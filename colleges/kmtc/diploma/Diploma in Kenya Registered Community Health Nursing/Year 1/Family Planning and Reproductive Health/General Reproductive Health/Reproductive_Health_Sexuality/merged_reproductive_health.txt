\section*{The functions of the female reproductive}
- - formation of ova
- - reception of spermatozoa
- - provision of suitable environments for fertilisation and fetal development
- - parturition (childbirth)
- - lactation, the production of breast milk.

\section*{External genitalia (vulva)}
- Consists:-
a. labia majora
b. labia minora,
c. the clitoris,
d. the vaginal orifice,
e. the vestibule,
f. the hymen
g. vestibular glands (Bartholin's glands).

\section*{External genitalia}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-07.jpg?height=1707&width=2253&top_left_y=143&top_left_x=114)

\section*{Labia majora}
- Two large folds forming the boundary of the vulva.
- Composed of skin, fibrous tissue and fat and contain large numbers of sebaceous and eccrine sweat glands.

\section*{Labia minora}
- Two smaller folds of skin between the labia majora, containing numerous sebaceous and eccrine sweat glands.

Vestibule
The cleft between the labia minora.
- The vagina, urethra and ducts of the greater vestibular glands open into the vestibule.

\section*{Clitoris}
- Corresponds to the penis in the male and contains sensory nerve endings and erectile tissue.

\section*{Vestibular glands}
- The vestibular glands (Bartholin's glands) are situated one on each side near the vaginal opening.
- Their ducts open into the vestibule immediately lateral to the attachment of the hymen.
- They secrete mucus that keeps the vulva moist.

\section*{Hymen.}
- Is a thin layer of mucous membrane that partially occludes the opening of the vagina.
- It is normally incomplete to allow for passage of menstrual flow and is stretched or completely torn away by sexual intercourse.

\section*{Imperforate Hymen}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-12.jpg?height=1461&width=2497&top_left_y=338&top_left_x=0)

\section*{Perineum}
- Roughly triangular area extending from the base of the labia minora to the anal canal.
- It consists of connective tissue, muscle and fat.
- It gives attachment to the muscles of the pelvic floor

\section*{Internal genitalia}
- Consist of:-
a. the vagina,
b. uterus,
c. two uterine tubes
d. two ovaries.

\end{figure}

\section*{VAGINA}
- strong canal of muscle
- Is a fibromuscular tube lined with stratified squamous epithelium that forms ridges or rugae
- It runs obliquely upwards and backwards at an angle of about $45^{\circ}$ between the bladder in front and rectum and anus behind.
- In adult, anterior wall is about 7.5 cm long and posterior wall about 9 cm long.
- Extends from the cervix of uterus to the vestibule (cleft between 2 labia minora).
- Superior end sorrounds cervix (forming fornices)
- Vagina passes through the pelvic floor.
- It has Lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria(normal flora), that secrete lactic acid, maintaining the $\mathbf{p H} \mathbf{4 . 9 - 3 . 5}$.
- The acidity inhibits growth of most other micro-organisms that may enter the vagina from the perineum or during sexual intercourse.

\section*{Functions of vagina}
- Excretory pathway for menstrual fluid.
- Forms inferior part of pelvic canal /passage for childbirth.
- Receives penis and ejaculate during sexual intercourse (coitus).

\section*{Relations.}
- Anterior- base of bladder and urethra.
- Laterally- levator ani, visceral pelvic fascia, ureters.
- Posteriorly- anal canal, rectum, recto-uterine pouch.

\section*{Blood \& nerve supply to vagina}
- Arterial supply- uterine and vaginal arteries- branches of the internal iliac arteries.
-Venous drainage- internal iliac veins.
- Lymph drainage- deep and superficial iliac glands
- Nerve supply - pudendal nerves.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-21.jpg?height=1609&width=1576&top_left_y=133&top_left_x=443)

\section*{UTERUS}
- Thick walled, pear-shaped, hollow, muscular organ.
- Lies in the pelvic cavity between the urinary bladder and the rectum.
- In most women, it leans forward (anteversion), and is bent forward (anteflexion) almost at right angles to the vagina
- Anterior wall rests against the bladder, forming the vesicouterine pouch
- Posteriorly folds back on to the rectum forming rectouterine pouch (pouch of Douglas).
- It is about 7.5 cm long, 5 cm wide and its walls are about $\mathbf{2 . 5 ~ c m}$ thick.
- parts of the uterus:- fundus, body and cervix
- Non gravid uterus- in the true pelvis.
- Gravid uterus- Rises into false pelvis and abdomen.

\section*{Walls of uterus}

\section*{composed of three layers:-}
- Perimetrium - Serous coat ( Peritoneum) supported by thin layer of connective tissue.
- Myometrium- smooth muscle layer.
- Endometrium - inner mucous coat shed off during menses.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-26.jpg?height=1609&width=1576&top_left_y=133&top_left_x=443)

\section*{Uterine tubes.}
- Extends from uterine horns and open into the peritoneal cavity near ovaries.
- The uterine (Fallopian) tubes are about 10 cm long.
- The end of each tube has fingerlike projections called fimbriae.
- lined with ciliated epithelium

\section*{Parts.}
- Infundibulum- opens into peritoneal cavity.
- Bears fimbriae
- Ampulla - widest, longest
- Isthmus - thick walled, narrowest.
- Uterine - Intramural segment.

\section*{Functions}
- The uterine tubes propel the ovum from the ovary to the uterus by peristalsis and ciliary movement.
- Fertilisation of the ovum
- zygote is propelled into the uterus for implantation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-29.jpg?height=1761&width=2383&top_left_y=70&top_left_x=57)

\section*{Functions of the uterus}
- Regular monthly cycle (menstrual cycle)
- Receive, nourish and protect a fertilised ovum.
- Accommodate the developing baby (embryo)
- Placenta attachment

\section*{Functions of placenta}
- The placenta- attach the fetus to the wall of the uterus by the umbilical cord
- provides route by which the growing baby receives oxygen and nutrients, and gets rid of its wastes.
- The placenta - secretes high levels of progesterone

\section*{Ovaries}
- Produce sex hormones and the ova
- It contains ovarian follicles in various stages of maturity, each of which contains an ovum.
- Before puberty the ovaries are inactive it contains immature (primordial) follicles.
- During the childbearing years, about every 28 days, one or more ovarian follicle matures (Graafian follicle), ruptures and releases its ovum (ovulation)
- Ruptured follicle develops into corpus luteum which in turn will leave a scar of fibrous tissue called the corpus albicans

\section*{Functions}
- Female gametes are stored and develop prior to ovulation.
- Releases hormones essential to the physiological changes during the reproductive cycle - oestrogen, progesterone and inhibin
- Oestrogen during the $1^{\text {st }}$ half then after ovulation, the corpus luteum secretes primarily progesterone, with some oestrogen and inhibin

\section*{Puberty in the female}
- Puberty- age at which the internal reproductive organs reach maturity (between the ages of $12-14 \mathrm{yrs}$ ) (menarche),
- marks the beginning of the childbearing period.
- The ovaries are stimulated by the gonadotrophins from the anterior pituitary:FSH \& LH
- Physical and psychological changes at puberty:
- - the uterus, the uterine tubes and the ovaries reach maturity
- - the menstrual cycle and ovulation begin (menarche)
- - the breasts develop and enlarge
- - pubic and axillary hair begins to grow
- - increase in height and widening of the pelvis
- - increased fat deposited in the subcutaneous tissue, especially at the hips and breasts.

Gamete: egg or sperm
Gametogenesis: production of eggs or sperm
Oogenesis: production of eggs
Spermatogenesis: production of sperm
Spermiogenesis: differentiation of sperm morphology
Follicle: where eggs mature in the ovary
Ovulation: release of egg from follicle
Polar body: nonfunctional product of meiotic divisions in oogenesis

Zygote: Fertilized egg

\section*{DEFINITIONS}

\section*{1. Menstrual Cycle:}
- Rhythmical series of physiological changes that occur in fertile women resulting in the release of a mature ovum for fertilization which if fails to occur vaginal bleeding occurs.
- Average length: 28 days, but typically varies, with shorter and longer cycles (21-35 days)

\section*{2. Menstruation:}
- Is a vaginal bleeding that occurs monthly in adolescent girls and premenopausal women.
3. Menarche: a woman's first menstruation - typically occurs around age 12
4. Menopause: end of a woman's reproductive phase, commonly occurs between ages 45 and 55
- age of menopause is largely the result of genetics
5. Follicular Phase: Begins on Day 1 of mestrual cycle - ovulation of your menstrual cycle.
6. Ovulation: The release of a mature ovum when a follicle in the ovary bursts.
7. Luteal Phase: Begins on Day 14, after ovulation occurs and ends on Day 1 of the next period

Hormones produced by the pituitary gland
1. FSH (follicle stimulating hormone)
- Stimulates the development of a follicle in the ovary, and within the follicle the egg matures and ripens.
- Stimulates the ovaries to produce hormones such as oestrogen.
2. LH (luteinising hormone)
- Stimulates the release of egg from the ovary in the middle of the menstrual cycle
- Stimulates the ovary to produce progesterone to keep the uterus lining in place.

\section*{Hormones produced by the ovaries}

\section*{1. Oestrogen}
- Stimulates the lining of the uterus to build up in preparation for pregnancy.
- Affect the pituitary gland.

Ø As the oestrogen levels rises, the production of FSH falls gradually and this would have caused the oestrogen level to fall also but paradoxically doesn't.
Ø The rise in the oestrogen level initially supresses the production of LH until mid cycle when it gives a positive feedback resulting in LH surge. When LH reaches its peak in the middle of the menstrual cycle, it stimulates the release of the ripe egg from the ovary.
2. Progesterone
- Maintains the thick lining of the uterus
- Stimulates the growth of blood vessels in the lining to prepare for pregnancy.
- Helps to maintain pregnancy if a fertilised ovum arrives in the uterus.

\section*{Ovarian Hormones}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-45.jpg?height=1311&width=1911&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=347)

\section*{PHASES OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE}
- Physiological changes during menstrual cycle can be observed at three different levels:
- neuroendocrine level
- Ovaries
${ }^{\circ}$ uterus
- These changes are what define the phases
- Menstrual cycle can be divided into 3 phases:
- menstrual phase
- proliferative / follicular (estrogen) phase
- secretory / luteal phase (progesterone) phase

\section*{Phase}

\section*{Average start and end day (assuming a 28-day cycle)}
Menstrual phase ..... 1-4
Proliferative phase ..... 5-13
Ovulation ..... 13-16
Secretory phase ..... 16-28

\section*{MENSTRUAL PHASE}

\section*{Menstruation}
- Menstrual bleeding, menses, period
- Discharge of bloody fluid containing endometrial cells, glandular secretions and blood cells, lasts 3-5 days
- Due to strong vasoconstriction and proteolytic activity, endometrial tissue dies and is discharged during menstrual bleeding
- Endometrium becomes very thin, but due to low estrogen levels, hypophysis secretes more FSH
- FSH stimulates secretion of estrogen $\rightarrow$ serves as proliferation signal to the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-50.jpg?height=1739&width=2443&top_left_y=105&top_left_x=19)

\section*{FOLLICULAR PHASE}
- The main hormones in the follicular phase are:
- Pituitary - FSH
- Ovarian - Oestrogen

Due to the rise of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, several ovarian follicles are stimulated Follicles compete with each other for dominance
The follicle that reaches maturity is called a Graafian follicle
- As they mature, the follicles secrete increasing amounts of estrogen, which thickens the new functional layer of endometrium in the uterus
- Estrogen also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus
- At the end of this phase ovulation occurs

\section*{Days 1-14}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-53.jpg?height=1630&width=1634&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=411)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-54.jpg?height=1755&width=2309&top_left_y=60&top_left_x=19)

\section*{OVULATION}
- During the follicular phase, estrogen suppresses production of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland
-When the ovum has nearly matured, levels of estrogen reach a threshold above which they stimulate production of LH (positive feedback loop)
- The release of LH matures the ovum and weakens the wall of the follicle in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its secondary oocyte
- After being released from the ovary, the ovum is swept into the fallopian tube

\section*{LUTEAL PHASE}
- Corpus luteum: solid body formed in an ovary after the ovum has been released into the fallopian tube
- Produces significant amounts of progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst
- Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle

\section*{Days 14-28}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-57.jpg?height=1407&width=1937&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=165)

Continues uterine lining thickening

\section*{Menopause}

The menopause (climacteric) usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55 years, marking the end of the childbearing period Caused by a progressive reduction in oestrogen levels, as the number of functional follicles in the ovaries declines with age.
The ovaries gradually become less responsive to FSH and LH.
ovulation and the menstrual cycle become irregular, eventually ceasing.

\section*{Presentation of menopause}

\section*{Early /Stage 1:}
- Changes in menstrual cycle

Shorter cycles resulting from shorter follicular phase
- Hot flushes - Vasomotor changes/vasodilation.
- Sweating
- palpitations
- Insomnia
- Depression
- behaviour changes e.g. irritability, mood changes

\section*{Intermediate}
- Urogenital atrophy- atrophy of the sex organs
- shrinkage of the breasts
- axillary and pubic hair become sparse
- Dyspareunia
- Dysuria
- Stress incontinence
- Skin changes- thinning

\section*{Late}
- Osteoporosis- loss of bone mass
- Cardiovascular disease - Increase in blood cholesterol levels.

\section*{Breasts}
- Also known as mammary glands
- Are accessory glands of female reproductive system. They exist also in the male.

Structure - draw the diagram of the breast

\section*{Structures}
- Contains skin, mammary glands and adipose tissue
- Consists of 15 to 20 Lobes of mammary gland that radiate outward from the nipple
- lactiferous duct
- lactiferous sinuse
- Suspensory ligaments of breast (cooper's ligaments): connective tissue septa that extend from the skin to the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-63.jpg?height=1404&width=1324&top_left_y=369&top_left_x=1167)
deep fascia
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-64.jpg?height=1815&width=1994&top_left_y=41&top_left_x=89)
- Each breast contains about 20 lobes
- each lobe contains a number of glandular structures called lobules, where milk is produced.
- Lobules open into tiny lactiferous ducts, which drain milk towards the nipple.
- The nipple- small conical eminence at the centre of the breast surrounded by a pigmented area(areola).
- On the surface of the areola are numerous sebaceous glands (Montgomery's tubercles), which lubricate the nipple during lactation.
- supported by fatty and fibrous connective tissue that anchor the breast to the chest wall.
- After delivery prolactin hormone from AP stimulates milk production.
- oxytocin from PP stimulates the release of milk (milk ejection) in response to the stimulation of the nipple by the sucking baby

\section*{Male reproductive system}
- The functions of the male reproductive organs are:
- - production, maturation and storage of spermatozoa
- - delivery of spermatozoa in semen into the female reproductive tract.

\section*{DRAW THE STRUCTURE}
- Male reproductive organs,
- The testis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_64390bfbc5819afe273bg-69.jpg?height=1841&width=2491&top_left_y=28&top_left_x=6)

\section*{Scrotum}
- The scrotum is a pouch of pigmented skin, fibrous and connective tissue and smooth muscle.
- It is divided into two compartments, each of which contains one testis, one epididymis and the testicular end of a spermatic cord.

\section*{Testes}
- The testes are the male reproductive glands and are the equivalent of the ovaries in the female.
- They are about 4.5 cm long, 2.5 cm wide and 3 cm thick and are suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cords.
- During early fetal life, the testes develop in the lumbar region of the abdominal cavity just below the kidneys.
- They then descend into the scrotum, taking with them coverings of peritoneum, blood and lymph vessels, nerves and the deferent duct.
- Descent of the testes into the scrotum should be complete by the 8th month of fetal life.
- They are surrounded by three layers of tissue.
1. Tunica vaginalis - double membrane, forming the outer covering of the testes
2. Tunica albuginea - a fibrous covering beneath the tunica vaginalis.
3. Tunica vasculosa. This consists of a network of capillaries supported by delicate connective tissue.

\section*{Structure of testis}
- Each testis has 200-300 lobules, and within each lobule are 1-4 convoluted loops of germinal epithelial cells, called seminiferous tubules= Spermatozoa (sperm) production .
- FSH from AP stimulates sperm production
- Between the tubules are groups of interstitial cells (Leydig cells) that secrete the hormone testosterone.
- At the upper pole of the testis the tubules combine to form a single tubule. This tubule is repeatedly folded and tightly packed into a mass called the epididymis = Maturation and storage of sperms .
- It leaves the scrotum as the deferent duct (vas deferens) in the spermatic cord.

\section*{SPERMATOZOA}
- A mature sperm has a head, a body, and a long whip-like tail used for motility.
- The head is almost completely filled by the nucleus, containing its DNA.
- It also contains the enzymes required to penetrate the outer layers of the ovum to reach and fuse with its nucleus.
- The body of the sperm is packed with mitochondria for energy, to fuel the propelling action of the tail that powers the sperm along the female reproductive tract.
- Successful spermatogenesis takes place at a temperature about $3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ below normal body temperature.
- The testes are cooled by their position outside the abdominal cavity, and the thin outer covering of the scrotum has very little insulating fat.
- sperm production in males begins at puberty and continues throughout life, often into old age, under the influence of testosterone.
- Unlike females, who produce no new gametes after birth.

\section*{Spermatic cords}
- The spermatic cords suspend the testes in the scrotum.
- Each cord contains a testicular artery, testicular veins, lymphatics, a deferent duct and testicular nerves.

\section*{Prostate gland}
- The prostate gland lies in the pelvic cavity in front of the rectum and behind the symphysis pubis, completely surrounding the urethra as it emerges from the bladder.
- It has an outer fibrous covering, enclosing glandular tissue wrapped in smooth muscle.
- The gland weighs about 8 g in youth, but progressively enlarges (hypertrophies) with age and is likely to weigh about 40 g by the age of 50.

\section*{Functions}
- The prostate gland secretes a thin, milky fluid that makes up about 30\% of the volume of semen, and gives it its milky appearance.
- It contains a clotting enzyme, which thickens the semen in the vagina, increasing the likelihood of semen being retained close to the cervix.

\section*{Male Glands}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

> Prostate
> Secretes 30\% of milky, slightly acidic seminal fluid with In antibiotic to kill bacteria

Cowper's Glands Secrete clear, alkaline mucus to buffer and lubricate urethra

\section*{Penis}
- It is formed by three cylindrical masses of erectile tissue and smooth muscle.
- The two lateral columns are called the corpora cavernosa and the column between them, containing the urethra, is the corpus spongiosum.
- At its tip it is expanded into a triangular structure known as the glans penis.
- Just above the glans the skin is folded to form a movable double layer, the foreskin /prepuce.
- Arterial blood is supplied by internal pudendal arteries.
- veins drain blood to the internal pudendal and internal iliac veins.
- Sperm comprise only $10 \%$ of the final ejaculate, seminal fluid (50-60\%) and prostatic fluid (20-30\%)
- Between $2-5 \mathrm{~mL}$ of semen are produced in a normal ejaculate, and contain between 40 and 100 million spermatozoa per mL .
- If not ejaculated, sperm gradually lose their fertility after several months and are reabsorbed by the epididymis.

\section*{Puberty in the male}
- Occurs between the ages of 10 and 14.
- LH from AP stimulates the interstitial cells of the testes to increase the production of testosterone.

\section*{Physical changes at puberty}
- - marked increase in height and weight
- - enlargement of the larynx and deepening of the voice
- - growth of hair on the face, axillae, chest, abdomen and pubis
- - enlargement of the penis, scrotum and prostate gland
- - maturation of the seminiferous tubules and production of spermatozoa
- - the skin thickens and becomes oilier.

\section*{FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLES}

Obimbo MM,
'If there was justice in the world, you wouldn't have to go to school during your period.You'd just stay home for five days and eat chocolate and cry' Andrea Portes
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_80c10e68f0a52ea4468eg-02.jpg?height=1060&width=1898&top_left_y=755&top_left_x=443)

\section*{Objectives}
- About the female reproductive cycle:
- Define terms used
- List the phases
- Highlight the main features of each phase
- Clinical application
- Including contraception

\section*{Preamble}
- Different mammals have different patterns of reproduction
- Different types of cycles:
- Estrous
- Menstrual
- Challenges concerned with female reproductive functions:
- Cause of onset of puberty and development of secondary sexual characteristics
- Establishment and continuance of menstruation

\section*{Terms}
- Menarche - age of menstruation onset
- (local data- Ogeng'o and Obimbo, Acta Peadiatrica 2011)
- Menopause - age of final menstruation
- (local data-Nore et al, East Afr MJ, 1997)
- Overt menstruation - flow of blood from uterus via the vagina
- Covert menstruation- breakdown of endometrium without vaginal bleeding
- Ovulation?

\section*{Background}
- Cycle:
- Prepares the ovum for fertilization prepares the uterus for implantation Control through endocrine system Both local and distant hormones facilitate the process
Negative and positive feedback effects Bleeding, breast tenderness and mood swings are characteristics

\section*{Hormonal regulation}
- Length - 28days
- Concerned endocrine structures
- Role of Pineal gland and Hypothalamus in biological clock
- Hypothalamus
- Pituitary gland
- Ovaries
- Malfunction leads to deranged reproductive cycles

In the Ovary
- Follicular phase
- Ovulation
- Luteal phase

In the Uterus
- Ischemic and Menstruation phase
- Proliferative
- Secretory

\section*{Ovarian cycle}
- Follicular - recruitment of follicles, growth and maturation, production of hormones - FSH, E2, LH
- Ovulatory - release of the oocyte, LH surge
- Luteal - reorganizaton of the follicular cells to form corpus luteum, P4, E2
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_80c10e68f0a52ea4468eg-10.jpg?height=1875&width=2497&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)

\section*{Follicular phase}
- Follicular stimulating hormone stimulates maturation of follicles
- Competition for dominance
- Only one follicle reaches maturation
- Maturing follicles secrete estradiol
- Estrodial (estrogen) stimulates production of GnRH which causes production of FSH and LH
- Sloughed endometrium is built up (proliferative phase)
- Day 5-I3

\section*{Ovulation}
- LH causes release of secondary oocyte which matures to ootid then ovum
- Occurs from day 12-13 and may last 2 days
- Only one ovum is released from the ovary
- Uptake of the ovum at the fimbria transported to the ampulla
Fertilization within 36 hrs
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_80c10e68f0a52ea4468eg-12.jpg?height=585&width=814&top_left_y=1243&top_left_x=1683)

\section*{Luteal phase}

Corpus luteum is significant
Its growth is under influence of LH and FSH
Produces progesterone and estrogen
- Progesterone has these effects:
- Prepares endometrium for implantation
-Causes rise in body temperature
-The products have negative feedback to LH/FSH production
- Involution of corpus luteum
- Falling levels of progesterone causes sloughing of the endometrium and marks the beginning of a new cycle.

\section*{Menstruation phase}
- I ${ }^{\text {st }}$ day of menses marks the $I^{\text {st }}$ day of female reproductive cycle
- Takes place between day I to day 6 (3-6 days)
- Maximum of 80 mls of blood is lost (average 35 mls )
- Some heavy losses, (cause aneamia?) painful losses
- Blood does not clot, why?
- Most women are happier, why?

\section*{Proliferative phase}
- Facilitated by FSH and E2
- Build up of the stratum functionale
- Renewal of the connective tissue, increase in vascularity
- Thickening of the endometrium

\section*{Secretory phase}

\section*{Characteristics:}
stroma becomes loose and edematous blood vessels entering the endometrium become thickened and twisted glands become tortuous and contain secretory material within the lumina

Reason for the name 'secretory phase'

What happens if fertilization takes?
Embryo produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
- Has similar polypeptide sequence as LH
- Maintains corpus luteum and its functions
- hCG is the specific to human embryo

\section*{Changes in other genital structures}

Cervix
endocervical glands $(E \uparrow) \rightarrow$ mucus(thin,clear, watery) $\rightarrow$ maximal (ovulation)
endocervical glands $(\mathrm{P} \uparrow) \rightarrow$ mucus(thick, opaque, tenacious)
- Vagina

Vaginal mucosa $(\mathrm{E} \uparrow) \rightarrow$ thickening and secretory changes
Vaginal mucosa $(\mathrm{P} \uparrow) \rightarrow$ secrete $\downarrow$

\section*{Fertility awareness}
- Most fertile period of a woman is between day 9-15 of the a 28 day cycle
- Methods used to delineate awareness are:

Calender based
Symptoms based
Urine kits

\section*{Clinical application \\ - Catamenial epilepsy}
- McClintock effect (synchronization of menses)
- Anovulatory cycles
- Menorrhgia, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea.
- Hormonal contraception
- If women are supposed to be less rational and more emotional at the beginning of menstrual cycle when the sex hormones are their lowest, then why isn't it logical to say that, in those few days, women behave the most like the way men behave all month long?" Gloria Steinem

\section*{MALE REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY}
- Primary gonads are the testes
- External organs: Penis, scrotum
- Internal organs:
- Testes, epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory ducts, penile urethra (a complex set of ducts and tubules leading from the testes to the penis)
- Accessory sex organs include:

\section*{External Genitalia}
-Scrotum
-Penis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-006.jpg?height=1179&width=1517&top_left_y=661&top_left_x=738)

\section*{Scrotum}
- Consists of skin and subcutaneous tissue
- A vertical scrotal septum, of subcutaneous tissue in the center divides it into two parts, each containing one testis
- Smooth muscle fibers, called the dartos muscle, in the subcutaneous tissue contract to give the scrotum its wrinkled appearance. When these fibers are relaxed, the scrotum is smooth
- The cremaster muscle, consists of skeletal muscle fibers and controls the position of the scrotum and testes. When it is cold or a man is sexually aroused, this muscle contracts to pull the testes closer to the body for warmth
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-008.jpg?height=2066&width=2754&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)

\section*{Scrotum}
- Skin
- Dartos muscle (smooth)
- Septum
- Cremaster muscle (skeletal)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-009.jpg?height=1063&width=891&top_left_y=604&top_left_x=1378)

\section*{Penis I}
- Male copulatory organ, by conveying the urethra provides common outlet for urine and semen
- Is a cylindrical pendant organ located anterior to the scrotum and functions to transfer sperm to the vagina
- Consists of three columns of erectile tissue that are wrapped in connective tissue and covered with skin
- The two dorsal columns are the corpora cavernosa
- The single, midline ventral column surrounds the urethra and is called the corpus spongiosum

\section*{Penis II}
- Has three parts:
- A root, body (shaft), and glans penis
- The root of the penis attaches it to the pubic arch
-The body is the visible, pendant portion
-The corpus spongiosum expands at the distal end to form the glans penis
-The urethra, which extends throughout the length of the corpus spongiosum, opens through the external urethral orifice at the tip of the glans penis
- A loose fold of skin, called the prepuce, or foreskin, covers the glans penis

\section*{Penis III}

\section*{Arterial supply: branches of internal pudendal artery}
- Venous and lymphatic supply:
- blood from the carvenous spaces is drained by venous plexus that join the deep dorsal vein of the penis
- Blood from superficial coverings of the penis drain into the superficial dorsal vein
- Erectile tissue supplied by helicine arteries
- Nervous supply
- Derived from S2-S4 spinal cord segment and ganglia
- Sensory and sympathetic: Dorsal nerve of penis and terminal branch of pudendal nerve
- Parasympathetic (innervate the helicine arteries of erectile tissue): Cavernous nerves
- Illioinguinal nerve supplies skin at the root of the penis

\section*{Testes}
-Two testes located in the scrotum
- Sperms can not develop at normal body temperature
- Testes hanging in the scrotum-the temperature is - $2^{\circ}$ C
- Each testis:
- Is an oval structure about $5 \mathrm{~cm} \times 3 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Is covered by tunica albuginea
- Septa with about 250 lobules each
- Each lobule contains 1 to 4 -seminiferous tubules that converge to form a single straight tubule, which leads into the rete testis into the epididymis
- Interstitial cells (cells of Leydig), which produce male sex hormones, are located between the seminiferous tubules within a lobule.
- Short efferent ducts exit the testes to enter the epididymis

\section*{Duct System}
- Sperm cells pass through a series of ducts to reach the outside of the body. After they leave the testes, the sperm passes through the:
- Epididymis
- Ductus deferens
- Ejaculatory duct
- Urethra
- Seminiferous tubules merge into larger set of tubules called rete testis
- Rete testis ultimately drains into larger tubules called efferent ducts, which in turn drain into the epididymis
- Epididymis has three parts: head, body and tail
- Tail of epididymis dilates into ductus deferens
- A long tube (about 6 meters) located along the superior and posterior margins of the testes.
- Sperm that leave the testes are immature and incapable of fertilizing ova. They complete their maturation process and become fertile as they move through the epididymis. Mature sperm are stored in the lower portion, or tail, of the epididymis
- It takes 20 days for sperms to pass through the epydidymis during which the sperm gains its motility
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-023.jpg?height=1446&width=2462&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=77)

The testis, epididymis, and ductus deferens, lateral aspect. The tunica albuginea has been extensively removed to expose the lobular structure of the testis created by the septa. The
epididymis has been pulled away from the testis and its duct has been dissected to show its convoluted course (length $=5-6 \mathrm{~m}$ ).

\section*{Ductus Deferens (vas deferens)}
- A fibromuscular tube that is continuous with the epididymis
- Enters the abdomino-pelvic cavity through the inguinal canal and passes along the lateral pelvic wall, behind bladder \& toward the prostate gland
- As each duct passes behind (dorsal to) bladder, it has appended to it a gland called the seminal vesicle
- Just before it reaches the prostate gland, each ductus deferens enlarges to form an ampulla
- The ampulla is the position of sperm storage prior to ejaculation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-029.jpg?height=1583&width=2121&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=348)

\section*{Ejaculatory Duct}
- Each ductus deferens, at the ampulla, joins the duct from the adjacent seminal vesicle (one of the accessory glands) to form a short ejaculatory duct
- Each ejaculatory duct passes through the prostate gland and empties into the urethra
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-031.jpg?height=1742&width=2238&top_left_y=161&top_left_x=214)

\section*{Urethra}
- Transports semen from the ejaculatory duct to the outside of the body
- Subdivided into:
- Prostatic urethra that extends through the prostate gland
- Membranous urethra that travels through the urogenital diaphragm
- Penile urethra that ends through the penis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-033.jpg?height=1583&width=2121&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=348)

\section*{Accessory glands}
- The vagina has a highly acidic environment to prevent bacterial growth
- Sperm cannot survive in this type of environment, so an alkaline secretion called seminal fluid is needed to lessen the acidity of the vagina and bring pH values closer to neutral
- As the sperm travel through the reproductive tract (a process that can take several days), they are nourished by nutrients within the seminal fluid
- The components of seminal fluid are produced by accessory glands:
- Seminal vesicle
- Prostate gland
- Bulbourethral glands

\section*{Seminal Fluid or Semen}
- A slightly alkaline mixture of sperm cells and secretions from the accessory glands
- Secretions from the seminal vesicles make up about 60 percent of the volume of the semen, with most of the remainder coming from the prostate gland. The sperm and secretions from the bulbourethral gland contribute only a small volume
- The volume of semen in a single ejaculation may vary from 1.5 to 6.0 ml . There are between 50 to 150 million sperm per milliliter of semen. Sperm counts below 10 to 20 million per milliliter usually present fertility problems

\section*{Seminal Vesicles}
- The paired seminal vesicles are located on the posterior surface of the urinary bladder adjacent to the ampulla of the ductus deferens
- Each seminal vesicle is an elongated, pouch-like hollow organ approximately 5-8 centimeters long
- It is the proximal portion of each seminal vesicle that merges with a ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct
- The seminal vesicles secrete a viscous, whitish-yellow alkaline fluid containing both fructose and prostaglandins
The fructose is a sugar that nourishes the sperm as they travel through the female reproductive tract, while the prostaglandins promote the widening and slight dilation of the external os of the cervix

\section*{Prostate}
- A compact encapsulated organ that weighs about 20 grams and is shaped like a walnut (shape of human brain), measuring approximately 2 cm by 3 cm by 4 cm
- Located immediately inferior to the bladder
- Secretes a slightly milky fluid that is weakly acidic and rich in citric acid, seminal plasmin, and prostatespecific antigen (PSA):
- Citric acid is a nutrient for sperm health
- Seminal plasmin is an antibiotic that combats urinary tract infections
- PSA acts as an enzyme to help liquefy semen following ejaculation

\section*{Bulbourethral Glands (Cowper's)}
- Paired, pea-shaped bulbourethral glands (or Cowper's glands) are located within the urogenital diaphragm on each side of the membranous urethra
Each gland has a short duct that projects into the base of the penis and enters the spongy urethra
- Their secretory product is a clear, viscous mucin that forms mucus when mixed with water
As a component of the seminal fluid, this mucin protects the urethra by neutralizing the acidity of the urine residue in the urethra, helps to neutralize the acidity of the vagina, and provides some lubrication for the tip of the penis during intercourse.

\section*{FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM}
- Broadly divided into external genitalia and internal genitalia
- External genitalia
- Include the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vestibule, the perineum
- Internal genitalia
- Include the ovaries(sex gonads), fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina

-The vulva includes the outwardly visible structures:
- Mons pubis
- Labia majora
- Labia minora
- Clitoris
- Urethral opening

External genitalia of adult female (parous)

\section*{Mons Pubis}
- The triangular mound of fatty tissue that covers the pubic bone
- It protects the pubic symphysis
- During adolescence sex hormones trigger the growth of pubic hair on the mons pubis
- Hair varies in coarseness curliness, amount, color and thickness

\section*{Labia Majora}
- Referred to as the outer lips
- Protect the introitus and urethral openings
- Are covered with squamous epithelium and contain sweat glands and sebaceous glands, hair follicles, inner surface are hairless
- Beneath the skin is dense connective tissue and adipose tissue - with a rich venous plexus
-The round ligament terminate at its anterior third
- Become flaccid with age and after childbirth

\section*{LABIA MINORA}
- Referred to as the "inner lips"
- Hairless skin folds. Made up of erectile muscle fibres, connective tissue, sebaceous glands, numerous vessels and nerve endings
- Each of which splits anteriorly to run over, and under, the glans of the clitoris. The more anterior folds unite to form the hood-shaped prepuce of the clitoris, whereas the posterior folds insert into the underside of the glans as the frenulum.
- They are more sensitive and responsive to touch than the labia majora

\section*{Clitoris}
- Erectile organ composed of nerves, blood vessels, and erectile tissue
- Consists of a glans, a body and two crura
- Located under the prepuce
- It is made up of a shaft and a glans
- Becomes engorged with blood during sexual stimulation
- Key to sexual pleasure for most women
- Urethral opening is located directly below clitoris

\section*{Vaginal opening (Introitus)}
- Opening may be covered by a thin sheath called the hymen
- Using the presence of an intact hymen for determining virginity is erroneous
- Some women are born without hymens
- The hymen can be perforated by many different events

\section*{Various Types of Hymens}

\section*{Parous introitus (after childbirth)}

\section*{Vestibule}
- Triangular space bound by
- Anteriorly: clitoris
- Posteriorly: fourchette
- Laterally: labia minus
-There are six openings into the vestibule
- Urethral opening
- Vaginal orifice and hymen
- Openings of Bartholins glands(2)
- Openings of paraurethral(Skene) glands(2)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-055.jpg?height=1703&width=2505&top_left_y=309&top_left_x=59)

\section*{Bartholin's glands}
- Pea-sized, yellowish in colour, about 0.5 cm , each with a narrow duct 2.5 cm long opening into the vestibule outside the hymen.
-The duct is lined by columnar epithelium but near its opening by stratified squamous epithelium
- During sexual excitement, they secrete abundant alkaline mucus which helps with lubrication.

Blood supply to the vulva
- Chief- Pudendal artery

\section*{Lymphatic drainage of the vulva}
- Lymphatic vessels of the vulva drain primarily into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. These nodes are located within a triangle formed by the inguinal ligament, the medial border of the sartorius muscle, and the lateral border of the adductor longus muscle
- In general, lymphatic drainage travels in a stepwise fashion from the superficial to the deep inguinal nodes and then to pelvic lymph node(iliac nodes and obturator nodes)
- Vulvar lymphatics decussate in the mons pubis and the posterior fourchette. Lymphatics do not cross the labiocrural folds and generally do not cross the midline unless originating at the clitoris or at the perineal body.
- As a result, metastasis of vulvar tumors to contralateral nodes is rare in the absence of ipsilateral groin metastasis. Ipsilatera/tumors can be defined as lesions that are further than 1 cm from the midline.

\section*{INTERNAL GENITALIA}

The internal genitalia consists of the:
- Vagina
- Cervix
- Uterus
- Fallopian Tubes
- Ovaries

\section*{Vagina}

The vagina forms the inferior-most region of the female reproductive tract that connects the uterus with the outside of the body anteroventrally
- Functions:-
- functions as the birth canal
- copulatory organ of the female
- Serves as the passageway for menstruation, \& uterine secretions

\section*{Vagina-structure}
-The vagina is a thick-walled, fibromuscular tube, with an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral walls
- The cervix projects into the anterior vaginal wall, making it shorter than the posterior wall by about 3 cm .
- The posterior vaginal wall is about 7 to 9 cm in length in the adult female, although there is great variability in this dimension.

\section*{Vagina- structure 2}
- The spaces between the cervix and vagina are known as the anterior, posterior, and lateral vaginal fornices
-The vagina's relatively thin, distensible wall consists of four layers: an inner mucosa, a sub mucosa, muscularis, and an outer adventitia The mucosa is of the nonkeratinized stratified squamous type and lies on a loose areolar vascular submucosa.

\section*{Vagina}
- The vagina's relations to other parts of the body can be understood by dividing it into thirds.
- Lower third, the vagina is fused anteriorly with the urethra, posteriorly with the perineal body, and laterally to each levator ani
- Middle third; vesical neck and trigone anteriorly, the rectum posteriorly, and the levators laterally

\section*{Vagina}
- Upper third, the anterior vagina is adjacent to the bladder and ureters, posterior to the cul-de-sac, and lateral to the cardinal ligaments.

\section*{Vagina-blood supply}
- Blood supply:
- vaginal artery and branches from the uterine, middle rectal, and internal pudendal arteries.
- Innervation:
- the upper vagina: uterovaginal plexus
- the distal vagina: pudendal nerve

\section*{Uterus}
-The uterus is a fibromuscular organ usually divided into:
- a lower cervix
- an upper corpus or uterine body
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-073.jpg?height=1703&width=2446&top_left_y=172&top_left_x=210)

\section*{Cervix}
- The portion of cervix exposed to the vagina is the exocervix or portio vaginalis. It has a convex round surface with a circular or slitlike opening (the external os) into the endocervical canal
- The endocervical canal is about 2 to 3 cm in length and opens proximally into the endometrial cavity at the internal os
- The cervical mucosa contains:
- Stratified squamous epithelium characteristic of the exocervix,
- Mucus-secreting columnar epithelium, characteristic of the endocervix

\section*{Cervix}
- Intersection between the two epithelia is the squamocolumnar junction
- Is geographically variable and dependent on hormonal stimulation
- It is this dynamic interface, the transformation zone, that is most vulnerable to the development of squamous neoplasia
- In early childhood, during pregnancy, or with oral contraceptive use:
- columnar epithelium may extend from the endocervical canal onto the exocervix, a condition known as eversion or ectopy
- After menopause, the transformation zone:
- usually recedes entirely into the endocervical canal

\section*{Corpus (Body of Uterus)}

The uterus is pear shaped
- Varies in size and shape, depending on:-
- Hormonal levels
-Previous parturition
-Presence of pathology (eg fibroids, adenomyosis)
- In the adult the uterus is about 8 cm long, 5 cm wide, walls 1.25 cm thick, and weighs $50-80$ grams
- At birth, the cervix and corpus are about equal in size(ratio 1:1), in adult women, the corpus has grown to 2 to 3 times the size of the cervix, post menopausal women the corpus: cervix ratio is $1: 1$

\section*{Corpus (Body of Uterus)}
-The uterine corpus is divided into 3 parts: Isthmus, cornu and fundus
- The uterus is made up of three layers the: endometrium, myometrium and perimetrium (serosa)

\section*{Supports of the uterus}
- Transverse cervical ligaments (cardinal ligaments)
- Uterosacral ligaments
- Pubocervical ligaments
- The round ligaments
- Pelvic diaphragm(Levator ani)
- Urogenital diaphragm( made of a pair of deep transvesus perinei and the sphincter urethrea muscles)
- Perineal body

\section*{Ligaments}
4 pairs of ligaments
- Round ligament
- Uterosacral ligament
- Cardinal ligament
- Broad ligament
1. Round ligament - attaches anterior-inferiorly to uterotubal junctions, pass in the broad ligaments, end in labia majora. They help to keep uterus in the position of anteversion.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-080.jpg?height=1228&width=1354&top_left_y=506&top_left_x=1396)
2. Broad ligament - arise from the side of the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall, provide minimal support.

Between two leaves of ligam there lies
- round ligaments
- fallopian tubes
- ovarian ligament
- Mesosalpinx
- infundibulum ligament
- ovarian vessels and nerves the infundibulopelvic lig.,
3. Cardinal ligaments - extend from cervix and lateral parts vaginal fornix to lateral walls pelvis.

Chief means of support and suspends the uterus from the lateral walls of the
- Ligaments
4.Uterosacral ligaments arise from the sacral fascia, and insert into the posteroinferior portion of the uterus at about the level of the isthmus. They provide important support for the uterus.

\section*{Isthmus}
- Limited above by the anatomical internal os and below by the histological os
- Forms the lower uterine segment in pregnancy
- Normal position of the uterus is anteflexed and anteverted

retroflexion: the fundus is pointing backwards. Anterior of uterus is convex.

Blood supply of the uterus
- Uterine artery- arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries
-The ovarian arteries- arises from the abdominal aorta
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-087.jpg?height=1942&width=2511&top_left_y=63&top_left_x=137)

\section*{Blood supply of the uterus}
- The uterine artery travels through the cardinal ligament and passes over the ureter ( NB the ureter is located approximately 1.5 cm lateral to the cervix.)
- It then joins the uterus near the level of the internal cervical os and gives off branches that run superiorly towards the uterine corpus and inferiorly towards the cervix.
- The uterine corpus branches anastomose with vessels that derive from the ovarian arteries, thus providing collateral blood flow.

The uterine artery also sends a branch to the cervicovaginal junction at the lateral aspect of the

Lymphatic drainage of the uterus
- Fundus and upper part of body- aortic nodes, superficial inguinal nodes along the round ligament
- Lower part of the body-external iliac nodes
- Cervix- external iliac nodes, internal iliac nodes, sacral nodes

\section*{Nerve supply of the uterus}
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves through the inferior hypogastric and ovarian plexuses
- Sympathetic from T12, L1 segment of spinal cord
- Parasympathetic nerves- S2, S3, S4

\section*{Uterus- Functions}
- Site for implantation
- Supports, protects, and nourishes the developing embryo/fetus
- Forms a vascular connection with the mother's uterine wall that later develops into the placenta
- Ejects the fetus at birth after maternal oxytocin levels increase to initiate the uterine contractions of labor
- Site for menstruation if an oocyte is not fertilized or after a baby is expelled, the muscular wall of the uterus contracts and sheds its inner lining as menstruation

\section*{Uterus-relations}
- Anterior

\section*{Adnexa}

The fallopian tubes and ovaries collectively are referred to as the adnexa

\section*{Oviducts (Fallopian Tubes)}
- Paired hollow structures representing the proximal unfused ends of the müllerian duct
- Length: 7 to 12 cm
- Function: ovum pickup, provision of physical environment for conception, and transport and nourishment of the fertilized ovum
- The tubal mucosa is ciliated columnar epithelium
- Made up of an inner circular and outer longitudinal smooth muscle layer
- Blood suppply: uterine and ovarian arteries
- Innervation: uterovaginal plexus and the ovarian plexus

\section*{Oviducts (Fallopian Tubes)}
- Divided into 4 parts:
- Interstitial: narrowest portion of the tube, lies within the uterine wall and forms the tubal ostia at the endometrial cavity
- Isthmus: narrow segment closest to the uterine wall
- Ampulla: larger diameter segment lateral to the isthmus
- Fimbria (infundibulum): funnel-shaped abdominal ostia of the tubes, opening into the peritoneal cavity; this opening is fringed with numerous fingerlike projections that provide a wide surface for ovum pickup

\section*{Ovaries}
- Are paired gonadal structures suspended between the pelvic wall and the uterus by the infundibulopelvic ligament laterally and the uteroovarian ligament medially
- Inferiorly, the hilar surface of each ovary is attached to the broad ligament
- The normal ovary is about $5 \times 3 \times 3 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Each ovary consists of an outer cortex, the central medulla and the rete ovarii (the hilum)
- The hilum is the point of attachment of the vary to the mesovarium, it contains nerves, blood vessels and hilus cells.
- The hilus cells are very similar to the testosterone producing Lydig cells of the testes

\section*{Ovarian cortex}
-The outermost portion of the cortex is called the tunica albuginea, topped on its surface by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium, referred to as the ovarian surface epithelium or ovarian mesothelium.
-The cortex is composed of a specialized stroma and follicles in various stages of development or attrition
-The oocytes, enclosed in complexes called follicles, are in the inner part of the cortex, embedded in stromal tissue.
- The stromal tissue is composed of connective tissue and interstitial cells which are derived from mesenchymal cells.
- The medulla occupies a small portion is composed primarily of fibromuscular tissue and blood vessels

\section*{Ovaries}
-The female gonads or sex glands
- The physiologic role of the ovary is periodic release of gametes(eggs, oocytes) and the production of the steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone
- Both activities are integrated in the continuous repetitive process of follicle maturation, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation and regression
- A woman is born with approximately 400,000 immature eggs called follicles
- During a lifetime a woman release @ 400 to 500 fully matured eggs for fertilization
- The follicles in the ovaries produce the female sex hormones, progesterone and estrogen
- These hormones prepare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg

\section*{Structure of Ovary}
- Covered with germinal epithelium
- Tunica Albuginea
- Cortex (outer layer)
- Medulla (inner core)

\end{tabular}

\section*{Perineum}
- Diamond-shaped area between the thighs that is circumscribed anteriorly by the pubic symphysis, laterally by the ischial tuberosities, and posteriorly by the coccyx
- 2 distinct triangle bases are formed by an imaginary horizontal line extending between the ischial tuberosities of the coccyx
- Anterior triangle, called the urogenital triangle, contains:
- urethral and vaginal orifices in females
- base of the penis and the scrotum in males
- Posterior triangle, called the anal triangle, is the location of the anus in both sexes

\section*{Mammary glands}
- Are present in both males and females but normally function only in women
- They are important to mammalian reproduction, although not actually a part of the reproductive system
- Consist of small sacs of epithelial tissue that secrete milk
- Milk drains into a series of ducts opening at the nipple
- In nonlactating female mammal, the mammary glands are composed primarily of fatty (adipose) tissue
- In males, the low level of estrogen prevents the development of both the secretory apparatus and the fat deposits, so male breasts remain small, and nipples are not connected to ducts

\section*{ADOLESCENTS AND YOUTH SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH 06 HRS}

\section*{UNIT CODE: RHN 103}

\section*{Broad Objective}
- By the end of the unit the leaner will acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes in order to provide quality reproductive health services to adolescents and youth.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
${ }^{-}$Participate in the provision of sexual and reproductive health services to the adolescent/youth.
- Integrate sexual health to holistic care

\section*{Content}
- Adolescents and youth sexual reproductive health: Definitions of terms, human sexuality, sexual orientation, identity, body mapping, human sexual response cycles, myths and misconceptions related to human sexuality. Integration of sexual health into holistic care, attitude change towards sexuality and HIV/AIDS. Adolescent/Youth Sexual and Reproductive health care services, models of youth friendly health services.

\section*{Introduction}
- Although adolescents and the youth form the majority of our population, their issues have, for a long time, been ignored. Yet young people have special needs and requirements.
- At the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, it was concluded that adolescents are a particularly vulnerable group due to the fact that they are known to have:
- Inadequate level of knowledge about human sexuality
- Inadequate or poor information on quality reproductive health services
- High risk sexual behaviors
- Discriminatory social practices
${ }^{-}$In response to these insights, the GoK decided to address adolescent and youth issues by developing new strategic approaches to communication programmes to enhance positive behavior development and adoption by young people.

\section*{Defining Adolescence}
- Adolescence is defined as the transition period between childhood and adulthood. It is a period of rapid growth and maturation as the person reaches puberty.
- The most colourful years of life are the teenage years.
- This is a period when the youth want to be appreciated for who they are and seek affection and attention.
- The onset of adolescence varies from one individual to the other, and between the two sexes.
- In girls, it may begin as early as 9 years while in boys it may begin at 12 years.
- The two sexes share an approximate range marking adolescence from 13-1 8 years.
- The youth age extends up to 21 years. However, according to the laws of Kenya, a person is considered to be an adult and answerable for their own actions from the age of 18.

\section*{Physical Characteristics of Adolescence}
- Adolescence is marked by the development of secondary characteristics under the influence of the gonadotrophic hormone from the anterior pituitary gland

\section*{Girls}
- Breasts increase in size and are spherical in shape due to enlarged glandular tissue
- Typical female shape and contour of the body develop, that is broad hips and narrow chest and shoulders
- Hair develops in the armpits and pubic region
- Internal organs of reproduction, that is, vagina, uterus, ovaries mature and menstruation (menarche) begins
- Face may become smooth or facial pimples (acne) may develop

\section*{Boys}
- In boys, under the influence of androgens, secondary characteristics appear from age 12 14 years.
- Enlarged testis and penis
- Development of armpit,chest, pubic and facial hairs
- First ejaculation (spermache) and nocturnal emissions (wet dreams) occur
- Gain in muscular strength and weight
- Voice changes with the voice becoming deeper
- Skin problems such as acne develop and the face looks rough
- Body shape takes on typical adult characteristics, for example, broad shoulders
- Rapid growth in height depending on genetics

\section*{Sociological, Psychological and Emotional Characteristics of Adolescents}
- While the aforementioned physiological changes are taking place and can be observed, great emotional and psychological changes are taking place that may not be as noticeable

\section*{Emotional and Psychological Changes Resulting From Adolescence}
- Changing relationships with parents, which may involve the adolescent pulling away and becoming more independent
- Changing relationships with friends.
- Adolescents often imitate the values and behaviors of friends rather than those of parents and other adults.
- Peers are an important influence but they care more about what their friends think of them
- The relationship with the opposite sex increases as they learn how to cope with romantic and sexual feelings
- Personal feelings are also affected and there is a need to accept themselves as an independent individual
- Values and behaviors are affected.
- Adolescents may attempt to behave more as adults, resolving problems in a responsible manner and making decisions bearing in mind the possible consequences
- Increased interest in everyday recreational activities
- Increase in mood swings as they seek attention and want to belong and be appreciated

With this understanding, there is a need to provide adolescents and young people with guidance and counseling, especially on reproductive health issues

\section*{Key Areas in Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health}
- Young people have special needs in all circumstances and each age group within this population (9-24 years) has different problems and requirements. As a health worker, you need to address the reproductive health needs of adolescents/youths diligently in order to assist them to make informed choices.
- The Government of Kenya is particularly interested in the health of its young people for a number of reasons.
- They constitute a significant proportion of the population and the fertility attributed to them (20\% of pregnant women are adolescents, aged 15-19 years) has a substantial impact on population growth.

\section*{Statistics Supporting a Need for Youth Reproductive Health Services}
- 20\% of Kenyan adolescents become sexually active as early as 9-14 years
- By 20 years of age $80 \%$ have experienced sexual intercourse
- HIV prevalence among adolescents of 15-19 years stands at $22.3 \%$ for females and $4.2 \%$ for males
- 10,000 schoolgirls drop out of school every year due to pregnancy, which you will agree is quite alarming, as the rate of illiteracy and poverty keeps rising

\section*{The most common reproductive health problems among this age group}
- Early child bearing (70\% prevalence rates), which is usually due to girl child discrimination in educational opportunities. Girls, therefore, opt to marry early instead of staying at home
${ }^{-}$STIs/HIV/AIDS (45\% prevalence rates), as a result of idleness among the youth due to lack of recreational facilities compounded by curiosity and peer pressure. This leads them into unsafe sexual practices and, in some cases, prostitution to earn a living
- Unsafe abortion due to unplanned and unwanted pregnancy
${ }^{-}$It has also been observed that most adolescents have inadequate information about their sexuality, which also compounds the risks of early childbearing, unsafe abortion, STIs/HIV/AIDS and subsequent risks of infertility and cancer

\section*{Reproductive Health Needs Amongst Adolescents}
${ }^{-}$Information on sexuality and reproductive health
- Access to family planning services and provision of effective methods
- Prenatal and post abortion care, irrespective of the age or marital status
- Safe delivery, preferably in a hospital with facilities for all eventualities
- Treatment of unsafe abortions, which should be discouraged, but in the event of any occurrence, post abortion care should be given to save lives
- Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases
- Protection from sexual abuse. Cases of sexual offenders should be reported to the authorities so that appropriate action can be taken
- Culturally appropriate guidance and counseling and or mental health services
- Education in negotiating skills to help them make informed choices and accept the consequences of their actions
adolescent/youth enjoy good reproductive health, there is also a need to do the following:
${ }^{-}$Develop a comprehensive reproductive health package to address youth/adolescent issues through the provision of counselling and user friendly clinics
- Promote responsible and healthy RH and sexual behavior of the youth through counseling and guidance
- Sensitize leaders, programme managers, service providers, teachers, the community, adolescents and youths themselves, on the reproductive health needs and rights of adolescents and youths
- The primary principle in working effectively with young people is to promote their participation.
- As a group, young people often have a 'culture' of their own, with particular norms and values.
${ }^{-}$They may not respond to services designed for adults.
- They are at a stage in life where they need to develop a sense of control over their bodies and their health.
- At the same time, since they are young and relatively inexperienced, they need guidance that is both sensitive and reassuring.
- The best way to encourage young people to participate is to develop a partnership between them and health care providers with proper regard for parental guidance and responsibilities.
- Once the youths know their rights and have appropriate information, they will be able to make informed choices.
- Consequently, their reproductive health will improve tremendously.
${ }^{-}$It is important to remember that young people are flexible, resourceful and energetic.
- They can help each other through peer counseling and peer education.
- You should, therefore, try to tap these strengths in order to be able to provide them with the necessary support

\section*{Principles for Working Effectively With Young People You must understand the cultural senstivities surrounding the provision of information and services to young people. Create awareness to communities on the need to be realistic and to give appropriate counseling.}
- You should identify and encourage peer leadership and communication. As you recall, at this age peers are very important and they are perceived as trustworthy sources of information. Therefore, make use of them.
${ }^{-}$It is essential to have links between health and community services in order to make sure that young people get the appropriate treatment for problems which might be revealed through one service but require additional assistance from another service (for example, sexual violence or unsafe abortion).
${ }^{-}$Young people need privacy. The problems that bring them to you make them feel ashamed, embarrassed or confused. It is, therefore, important for you to create the most private space and environment possible to talk to young people
- Confidentiality must be guaranteed. You need to maintain confidentiality in all your dealings with young people and be honest with them about their health problems.
- In most cultures, the gender of the service provider is important. A young person should be referred to a provider of the same sex.

\section*{Life Planning Skills}
${ }^{-}$Life planning skills refer to the information that you impart to young people to help them cope with the life challenges they meet as they grow up.
- Life planning skills are very handy when counselling adolescents who are facing a dilemma and trying to make an informed choice or decision
${ }^{-}$At this stage of their lives they need good information about sexuality and reproduction
${ }^{-}$Young people also need to develop certain skills to be able to make informed, responsible decisions about their sexual behavior.
- They need to learn how to resist pressure, be assertive, negotiate, and resolve conflict.
- peer counseling and peer education can be very effective in strengthening these skills and attitudes.

\section*{Life planning skills are divided into two components.}
- Values and values verification, which depends on the personality of the individual
- Decision making abilities, which depend on communication skills, for example: assertiveness and negotiation skills

\section*{Values and Values Verification}
${ }^{-}$By introducing the concept of values, you help young people to identify values learned from families and communities.
- This helps them to explain and stand up for the values and behaviors that dictate their actions.
- Values have different meanings to different people, as they are beliefs, ideas or principles that determine who you are and how you behave.
- For example, a person who values their family cares about their spouse, children and home life. A person who values education will study hard and pass examinations. Thus values dictate the behavior of individuals. The individual learns to make decisions consistent with personal values. Values are held dear and encourage self esteem in the individual.
- Unfortunately some communities value practices such as wife inheritance, wife beating, female circumcision, and early girl child marriage.
- All of these may pose significant danger to the community in relation to reproductive health.
- As a healthcare provider, it is important that you discourage harmful values and advocate values that enhance good and sound health in the community.

\section*{some of the more common harmful practices that you need to discourage within the communities you work with}

\section*{- Wife Inheritance}

This practice risks the spread of STIs/HIV/AIDS and all their consequences. It is also one of the main causes of disharmony in the family unit.

\section*{Wife Beating}
- A number of women have been maimed. Often they indicate that they feel stigmatized and are thus unable to seek medical assistance/attention.
- Some have even suffered miscarriages and premature deliveries due to violence and sexual abuse.

\section*{Female Genital Mutilation}
- This brings about the risk of infection and bleeding following the operation. In the long term, it also leads to prolonged second stage of labour due to scarring of genitalia. Female genital mutilation can also result in complications of lacerations and injury to pelvic floor and high perinatal morbidity and mortality

\section*{Early Girl Child Marriage}
${ }^{-}$In many communities, girls are married long before they are mature enough to be parents.
- Early pregnancy presents with complications of prolonged or obstructed labour, which may result in the rupture of the uterus, as the pelvis and reproductive organs are immature.
- Early marriage also means high school dropout rates.
- This, in turn increases illiteracy and its consequences such as inability of girls, or
- women, to negotiate their rights due to lack of information about their health needs.
- Having covered some of the negative practices associated with reproductive health and youth, here are some of the good values you should attempt to reinforce within the communities you work with.

\section*{Education of the Girl Child}
- A good education will enable girls to be knowledgeable and to understand reproductive and child health issues.
- This will inevitably contribute to a better quality of life in the community.
- With good education, girls and women can be empowered economically and be productive to the nation.

\section*{Abstinence}
${ }^{-}$Both girls and boys should be encouraged to remain virgins and abstain from premarital sex until they get married.
- This will help in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is a national disaster as the majority of the youths are infected/affected.
- It will also reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancy and the accompanying health consequences.
- You have now covered some of the practices valued by communities in some detail.
- However will be useful for you to gain an understanding of where values come from and how there are some factors that may influence our behaviour and make us act in a manner that is inconsistent with our values.
${ }^{-}$By understanding these factors you can help young people to examine their values and encourage them to avoid being influenced to abandon their good values.

\section*{Origin of Values}
- Parents and family members, who help to instill values in the child, which will eventually become a part of an individual
- Community, which reinforces values and can discipline in case of deviations
${ }^{-}$Religious leaders, who reinforce individual beliefs about good and evil
- Teachers in school, where education helps the adolescent to start reasoning and checking their values more clearly.
- The adolescent will identify mentors and try to copy them
- Friends, who greatly influence the initial values.
- Some succumb to negative peer pressure but this depends on the personality of the individual

\section*{Factors that can cause people to deviate from their values \\ People often want to experiment or try somebody else's values in order to validate them and decide whether to adopt them or not \\ - Peer pressure may force the individual to do things not in keeping with their values hence they become deviant}
- Opportunity for personal gain
- Opportunity to make someone else angry as well as rebel to get attention

\section*{Decision Making}
${ }^{-}$Decision making is the art of making a choice out of several options.
- Making a decision exposes the individual to a lot of challenges as they weigh the consequences based on the choices available.
- Making a decision equips the young person with life planning skills.
- Presented below are some of the skills that an individual needs in order to make sound decisions:
- Communication, which is the art of equipped with accurate information about themselves, they will be able to account for decisions they make.
- They must have good communication skills.
${ }^{-}$Assertiveness, which means being confident and able to make a stand on their words, actions or beliefs.
- This includes the ability to say NO to drugs or sexual advances, because illicit drugs or premarital sex are against their moral and/or religious beliefs

\section*{*Assertiveness}

\section*{The skill of assertiveness is based}
on five rights. These are the rights to
- Expression using the verbal, non-verbal and body expressions
- Set one's priorities by putting first things first.
- Accept that one's needs are just as important as the other person's and put your own needs across without fear of intimidation
- Refuse requests without feeling guilty as one defends one's values.
${ }^{-}$Young people should be taught that they have the right to say no
${ }^{\bullet}$ Judge one's behaviour and take responsibility for the consequences
- Negotiation skills
- Young people need accurate information regarding reproductive health, especially related to HIV/AIDS and substance abuse.
- Once they know the facts and the outcomes of their behavior, they will be able to communicate effectively, make informed choices and defend them against their peers.
- They must know the options available based on the consequences.
- Negotiation and assertiveness skills play an important role in communication as the youth make decisions, which affect their reproductive health.
${ }^{-}$The last and most important step of decision making is seeking help.
- Our youths need to feel free and look for information and assistance when not sure of the decision to be made.
- They should know where to go for assistance when they need help.
- This could be to their parents, Teachers, religious leaders or health professionals.
- These life planning skills are important to the youths.
- So learn them well to enable you to impart them to the young people.
- Young people can make poor life decisions for a variety of reasons and these decisions have their own inherent dangers.

\section*{Drug Abuse}
- Drugs are mostly taken to elevate the mood and often the individual feels 'high'. In the long run drugs impair the person's ability to make sound decisions and established values may be ignored.
- Drugs are mostly taken to elevate the mood and often the individual feels 'high'. In the long run drugs impair the person's ability to make sound decisions and established values may be ignored.

\section*{Unprotected Sex}
- Unprotected sex is often a result of the individual succumbing to peer pressure.
- Occasionally, decisions are made under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
- This adds to the risk of spreading STIs/HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, school dropout and poverty.

\section*{Crime}
${ }^{-}$Lawlessness and crime, such as stealing or robbery with violence, is commonly found among people with low negotiation and assertive skills.
- In order to enhance the health and well being of adolescents and youths, remedial activities need to be undertaken.

\section*{Activities to Improve Adolescent/YouthHealth}
- There are various interventions your community and the Government can undertake to improve the health of young people, thus helping them to develop confidence and become productive citizens.

\section*{Community and Government Interventions to Improve the Health of Young People}
- Advocating the recognition of socioeconomic and reproductive health needs and rights of adolescents and the youth
- Establishing an understanding with youth advisory councils at all levels to coordinate and advise on youth and adolescent health
${ }^{-}$Developing specific messages for different target groups (parents, religious and other leaders, youths and adolescents)
${ }^{-}$Implementing youth friendly and accessible RH services to enable the youth to seek services and receive counseling without barriers.
- Health providers should create a conducive environment when counseling and avoid biases that discourage youths from coming to the facility
${ }^{-}$Educating youths on their rights in order to help them attain the highest degree of health and self esteem.
- They should be sensitized to advocate against marriage at an early age, female circumcision, child abuse and so on.
- They should also advocate for the respect of good cultural values, access to RH services and the need for informed choice and privacy
- Conducting basic/applied research on youth and adolescent issues on regular basis and implementing the findings
${ }^{-}$As a health care provider you should advocate active involvement of adolescents/youth in projects aimed at promoting responsible sexuality, preventing unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and spread of STIs/HIV/AIDS.
- The advocacy should focus on several issues.
- Most importantly, there should be attempts to integrate gender issues into youth programmes so that they reinforce appropriate values.
- Additionally, you should incorporate Information, Education and Communication (IEC) in the reproductive health programs.

\section*{Gender Issues and Reproductive Health Rights}

\section*{Introduction}
${ }^{-}$It has been established that human sexuality, reproduction and gender issues are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive life.
- You will also cover how gender issues affect access to and enjoyment of good reproductive health in our communities and what you can do to improve reproductive health rights.

\section*{Definition of Terms}

Gender What is meant by 'gender', does it simply mean male or female or does it describe more than just biological characteristics?
As a term, it has been misinterpreted to mean male or female only.
Biologically, people are born either male or female but learn to be a man or a woman. However, when you talk about gender, this refers to the economic, social or cultural attributes associated with being a female or a male.

\section*{Gender Inequalities and Discrimination}
- Gender inequality and discrimination refers to unequal access to power, resources and opportunities in society.
Gender inequality and discrimination harms the health of young girls and women, directly and indirectly, throughout their life cycle.
- The neglect of their health needs through, for example, overworking and poor eating habits, makes them vulnerable to chronic ill health, which prevents many women from fully taking part in society.
- Unequal power relations between men and women often limit women's control over sexual activity and their ability to protect themselves against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.
- The subordinate status of women goes far back. The place of women in society has never been equal to that of men.
${ }^{-}$In the Christian Bible, it is said that the Jewish community in which Jesus was born and later ministered had very little regard for women compared to their male counterparts.
- A woman could be divorced at her husband's request without objections.
${ }^{-}$In African society, socio cultural factors tied with traditional beliefs and practices play a great role in determining the place of women in almost all spheres of their lives.
- This influence begins with the socialization of young children both within and outside the home.
- At childhood, both boys and girls are introduced to societal beliefs, practices and values as they apply to each gender.
- Boys are supposed to become heads and protectors of the family.
- The girls become wives and mothers, dependent on their husbands.
- These gender inequalities between sexes lead to women's subordinate positions within the family.
- Before you continue, reflect briefly on the type of gender inequalities you have observed in your community.

\section*{Examples of Gender Inequalities}

Inequalities in education
- Inequalities in the labour force
- Access to medical care
- Law of succession
- Cultural practices (such as female genital mutilation, polygamy and wife inheritance)

\section*{Preference for the Male Child}
- Since time immemorial, the boy child has always been preferred over the girl child in the African culture.
- It is perceived that the boy has more economic value than the girl.
- The boy is viewed as an asset that can contribute wages through his labour and provide for the care of parents in old age.
- Customarily, inheritance and lineage is passed through sons. In many communities, girls and women cannot inherit anything even from the husband and in some societies only boys participate in religious ceremonies.
- Girls, on the other hand, are seen as a liability.
${ }^{-}$Parents see no need in investing in them, as they will leave the homestead to get married and provide hard labour benefits to the husbands' side.
${ }^{-}$This poses a great risk to the girl child and her reproductive health right from conception.
- For example, today with modern technology where sex can be predetermined, it has been noted that out of 8,000 pregnancies terminated annually, only one foetus is a male. In countries where abortion is illegal, infanticide is on the increase, and where girls are born they are often severely neglected.

\section*{Education}
${ }^{-}$Parents prefer to educate sons. Why? Women are considered to be a liability. Remember the saying about watering a plant in the neighbour's garden? Some people view educating girls as a waste of money as they will get married and leave the homestead. Others believe that women cannot excel, and in any case, men are the breadwinners in the family.

\section*{Food}
- Traditional practices, which dictate the kinds of foods that can or cannot be eaten by girls, may lead to malnutrition and stunted growth with several consequences, including the possibility of girls developing a small pelvis.
- This has serious repercussions for a woman's reproductive health and may lead to anaemia, and obstetric complications during childbirth.

\section*{Access to Medical Care}
- The female child, when sick is often denied prompt medical attention. In some countries girls are breastfed for a shorter period hence denying them the necessary nutrients from breast milk.
- Sometimes the mother is forced to stop lactation early to get pregnant, because the family is trying for a son. This leads to chronic ill health with serious complications, which result in increased morbidity and mortality
- All these factors make it difficult for the girl child to stand out and excel

\section*{Denial of Other Basic Rights}
- Own land or to inherit property
- Obtain access to credit
- Earn income and promotion in their work
- Have access to services that meet their sexual and reproductive health needs
- Girls are often subjected to various other discriminatory practices, which, directly or indirectly, deny them their rights. These can include Early Marriages, Female Genital Mutilation, Polygamy and Wife Inheritance.

\section*{Early Marriages}
- Girls in some communities are forced to marry early so that the father can acquire bride wealth.
- Research has shown that early marriage exposes the girl child to early sexual activity, which in turn predisposes her to cancer of the cervix, obstetric complications and ill health.

\section*{Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)}
- This is also known as female circumcision. It is practiced in several countries in Africa and the Middle East. It is estimated that about 130 million girls are currently living with the effects of FGM. A further two million girls are at a risk of the practice. Societies that practice FGM believe that it is an initiation into adulthood and prevents the woman from becoming promiscuous

\section*{The Four Types of Female Genital Mutilation}
- Circumcision, which involves cutting of the prepuce or hood of the clitoris
- Excision, which involves the cutting of the clitoris and all or part of the labia minora
${ }^{-}$Infibulation, which involves the cutting of the clitoris, labia minora, and part of labia majora. The two sides of vulva are then pinned together with silk, catgut sutures, or with thorns, thus obliterating the vaginal introitus except for a small opening, preserved by inserting a piece of wood or reed for passage of urine or menstrual blood. The girl's legs are bound together from hip to ankle and she is kept immobile for 40 days to permit the formation of scar tissue
${ }^{-}$Intermediate, which involves the removal of the clitoris and some or all parts of the labia minora
- All of these operations present serious consequences to the reproductive health for girls and women

\section*{The Potential Health Consequences of FGM}
- Medical complications such as haemorrhage, pain, pelvic infection, and painful intercourse
- Complications of childbirth such as obstructed labour due to scarring of tissues. In some communities the husband must give consent before an episiotomy can be performed
- The procedure also denies the woman enjoyment of sexual life as the clitoris plays a role in reaching orgasm
- FGM also predisposes girls to early marriage since after the initiation they are considered mature and can get married. Early marriage, as you said earlier, has negative consequences on their RH as it exposes them to early pregnancy. If contraception is not used, the girl may have many deliveries, which predisposes her to various risks, including cancer of the cervix

\section*{Wife Inheritance}
- This is a cultural practice whereby a woman whose husband has died is inherited by a brother or relative of the late husband. The aim of this practice is to maintain the family lineage.
- In the past this custom was beneficial to some extent, as it provided stability and security to the woman and her children. However, today, it has been abused. Most men look for widows from rich homes so that they can exploit their wealth.
${ }^{-}$Also, this practice has led to the death of whole families because it facilitates the spread of HIV/AIDs

\section*{Polygamy}
- Polygamy is also a very common practice in some parts of Africa whereby men are allowed to marry more than one wife.
- Polygamy creates conflicts in the family and enhances the spread of STD's/HIV/AIDS

\section*{Gender Violence}
- Gender based violence is recognized today as a major issue on the international human rights agenda. As you well know, in some communities, the right of a husband to beat or physically intimidate his wife is a deeply held conviction. Indeed, there are women who often view a degree of physical abuse is justified under certain conditions
${ }^{-}$The dictionary definition of violence is: 'using or tending to use aggressive force'.
${ }^{-}$Another important word for you to know is 'abuse
${ }^{-}$Abuse may be defined as: 'a systematic pattern of behaviour in a relationship that is used to gain and/or maintain control and power over another
- Abuse ranges from emotional abuse such as hurting another person's feelings; psychological violence such as threats to do bodily harm,physical abuse such as hitting to cause pain orinjury, and sexual abuse which includes rape,defilement and incest.

<<NOTE TO USER: For more information on reproductive health, please visit the website of the Department of Reproductive Health and Research at WHO: www.who.int/reproductivehealth/en/>>

\section*{LEARNING OBJECTIVES}

After this presentation individuals should be able to understand, recognize, and know:

Basic components of reproductive health Basic hormone and endocrine functions

Reproductive physiology
*Importance of environmental exposures on reproductive health endpoints
<<READ SLIDE.>>

According to the formal definition by the World Health Organization (WHO), health is more than absence of illness. It is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being. Similarly, reproductive health also represents a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of reproductive diseases or alterations.

This presentation will introduce you to the basics of reproductive health and the important role that the environment plays in influencing the health of individuals.

The WHO defines reproductive health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of reproductive disease or infirmity. Reproductive health involves all of the reproductive processes, functions and systems at all stages of human life. This definition implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Men and women have the right to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice that are not against the law. Furthermore, men and women should have access to appropriate health care services that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth, as well as to provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.
Reproductive health is a universal concern, but is of special importance for women particularly during the reproductive years. However, men also demand specific reproductive health needs and have particular responsibilities in terms of women's reproductive health because of their decision-making powers in some reproductive health matters. Reproductive health is a fundamental component of an individual's overall health status and a central determinant of quality of life.

Right to a satisfying and safe sex life with the freedom to decide to reproduce and how often to do so
* Safe, effective, affordable access to family planning methods
* Access to appropriate reproductive health services

The WHO's definition of reproductive health specifically highlights the importance of an individual's right to maintain their own sexual health status. Sexual health is the integration of emotional, intellectual, and social aspects of sexual being in order to positively enrich personality, communication, relationships and love. The three fundamental principles of sexual health are: 1) capacity to enjoy and control sexual and reproductive behavior; 2) freedom from shame, guilt, fear, and other psychological factors that may impair sexual relationships; and 3) freedom from organic disorder or disease that interferes with sexual and reproductive function.
Reproductive health further implies the right to satisfying and safe sex life. This includes the ability to reproduce, but also the personal freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. Both men and women have the right to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning that are not against the law.
Reproductive health should also be understood in the context of healthy relationships in which there is an understanding of the balance between fulfillment and risk. Reproductive health contributes enormously to physical and psychosocial comfort and closeness between individuals. Poor reproductive health is frequently associated with disease, abuse, exploitation, unwanted pregnancy, and death.

\section*{THE LIFE CYCLE PERSPECTIVE}

Individual reproductive health needs differ at each stage of life
* Reproductive health status may reflect cumulative effects and experiences that occurred in earlier life phases

Reproductive health is important for healthy social, economic, and human development!

An inability to address reproductive health concerns may result in future health complications

Reproductive health is a crucial feature of healthy human development and of general health. It may be a reflection of a healthy childhood, is crucial during adolescence, and sets the stage for health in adulthood and beyond the reproductive years for both men and women.
Reproductive life span does not begin with sexual development at puberty and end at menopause for a woman or when a man is no longer likely to have children. Rather, it follows throughout an individual's life cycle and remains important in many different phases of development and maturation.
At each stage of life, individual reproductive health needs may differ. However, there is a cumulative effect across the life course, and each phase has important implications for future well-being. An inability to deal with reproductive health problems at any stage in life may set the scene for later health problems. This is known as the life cycle perspective for reproductive health.

Healthy reproductive systems, processes, and function are imperative components of adequate overall health. However, many internal as well as external factors may challenge an individual's ability to maintain reproductive health. It is important to keep in mind that reproductive health status may be determined by occurrences and exposures from in utero development until the final stages of life.
Numerous factors directly effect how well an individual maintains his or her reproductive health status. While some factors may be pre-determined, such as genetic susceptibility to a particular disorder or disease, other factors that relate to the maintenance of reproductive health may be behavioural and involve an individual's participation in risky practices. Furthermore, the environment in which an individual lives, both natural and physical, may present important risk that may directly influence reproductive health. For instance, some occupational exposures (e.g works with hazardous pesticides) can have adverse effects in reproductive life.

\section*{INFERTILITY AND FECUNDITY}

Primary infertility - failure to bear any children after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse

Secondary infertility - failure to have a second child after a first birth

Fecundity - the ability of a couple to conceive after a certain time of attempting to become pregnant
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-10.jpg?height=472&width=321&top_left_y=745&top_left_x=1295)

The World Health Organization defines the term primary infertility as the inability to bear any children, whether this is the result of the inability to conceive a child, or the inability to carry a child to full term after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. Primary infertility is sometimes known as primary sterility. However, in many medical studies, the term primary infertility is only used to describe a situation where a couple is not able to conceive.
Secondary infertility is defined as the inability to have a second child after a first birth. Secondary infertility has shown to have a high geographical correlation with primary infertility. Fecundity describes the ability to conceive after several years of exposure to risk of pregnancy. Fecundity is often evaluated as the time necessary for a couple to achieve pregnancy. The World Health Organization recommends defining fecundity as the ability for a couple to conceive after two years of attempting to become pregnant.
The terms infertility and infecundity are often confused. Fertility describes the actual production of live offspring, while fecundity describes the ability to produce live offspring. Fecundity cannot be directly measured, though it may be assessed clinically. Typically, fecundity may be assessed by the time span between a couple's decision to attempt to conceive and a successful pregnancy.

\section*{REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ISSUES DURING AND AFTER PREGNANCY}

Congenital anomalies - all structural, functional, and genetic abnormalities diagnosed at birth or in the neonatal period

Ectopic pregnancy - when implantation occurs outside the uterus

Fetal death (stillbirth) - death prior to the complete birth after 20 weeks of gestation. Evidenced by lack of vital life signs
* Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) - spontaneous loss of a pregnancy that occurs before 20 weeks of gestational age

There are specific reproductive health problems that directly describe the health of an early pregnancy or the development of the fetus in utero.
The World Health Organization describes the term congenital abnormalities as all structural, functional, and genetic abnormalities diagnosed in aborted fetuses, at birth or in the neonatal period. Congenital abnormalities are sometimes known as birth defects.
An ectopic pregnancy describes a complication in the early stages of pregnancy when a fertilized egg is implanted in an area outside of the uterine cavity. A majority of ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube, but may also occur in the cervix, ovary, or abdomen. If not treated properly, an ectopic pregnancy may be life threatening for the woman.
Fetal death (commonly known as a stillbirth) occurs when an infant does not survive complete expulsion from the mother or after twenty completed weeks of gestational age. Death is evidenced by a lack of vital signs following separation from the womb, for example, lack of fetal breath, heart beat, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.

As previously mentioned, reproductive health describes multiple components of health status and is essential in the development of social, economic, spiritual, and mental well-being. For this reason, reproductive health research is a diverse field that encompasses numerous disciplines. This diagram from the WHO demonstrates the different components of reproductive health research while emphasizing that each component remains part of one single unit of investigation. This diagram also portrays the imperative role of society and culture on the outcome of reproductive health status.

While many reproductive health questions are still left unanswered, a solid foundation of biological reproductive health knowledge exists that should be understood before attempting to investigate more complex reproductive health topics. Examples include knowledge of the hormonal pathways that control the reproductive system, the central components and functions of the female reproductive system, and the central components and functions of the male reproductive system. These topics will be described in the upcoming slides.

\section*{2.A. INTRODUCTION TO GENETICS}
* Many human traits are passed from parents to offspring
*Genes are the basic units of heredity
* Genes are situated on chromosomes, which are comprised of DNA
* Humans have two copies of every gene: one from their mother and one from their father
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-15.jpg?height=335&width=632&top_left_y=872&top_left_x=1073)

Genetics is the study of heredity in living organisms. Heredity describes the passing of parental traits to offspring. For example, if a mother has black hair and her biological son has black hair, we can assume that heredity was involved in the passing of hair colour from mother to son. The study of genetics can thus explain why children look more like one parent or another, and why biological siblings have some similarities and differences. The term genetics contains the root word, gene. Genes are specific human traits that are passed from parents to their children. Essentially, genes are the basic units of heredity and heredity is the passing of traits to offspring. Humans have thousands of genes each. These genes are made of DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA is a chain of molecules that uniquely defines the individual traits that you possess. All humans have a different DNA pattern and this explains why no two human beings are exactly the same. The specific molecules of DNA that carry the hereditary information of humans are known as chromosomes. It is important to remember that each of our cells throughout our body thus contains these genes with our unique DNA pattern. However, all humans have two copies of every gene. One gene was inherited from the mother, and the other gene was inherited from the father. The image shows different types of human chromosomes pairs.

\section*{SEX DETERMINATION}
* Sex chromosomes determine whether a baby will be male or female
* The mother has two of the same kind of chromosomestwo X's (XX)
* The father has two different chromosomes - $X$ and $Y(X Y)$
* The child will randomly inherit one chromosome from the father to be either XX (female) or XY (male)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-16.jpg?height=421&width=579&top_left_y=829&top_left_x=1132)

There are a specific type of chromosomes that are known as the sex chromosomes. In humans, the mother's egg cell contains an $X$ chromosome. The father's sperm cell contains either an $X$ or a $Y$ chromosome. An infant will inherit one pair of sex chromosomes, either one $X$ from the mother and one $X$ from the father OR one $X$ from the mother and one $Y$ from the father. This random inheritance will determine whether the child is a boy or a girl. It is important to note that the sex chromosome that a child inherits from its father will determine its sex. This is because the child will automatically inherit one $X$ from its mother. For example if a baby inherits the $X$ chromosome from its father, the child will be a girl, represented by a double $X(X X)$. If the baby inherits the $Y$ chromosome from its father the child will be a boy, represented by an $X$ and a $Y(X Y)$.

\section*{EPIGENETICS}

\section*{Changes in expression of genes not caused by alterations of the DNA sequence}

\section*{May be caused by factors in the environment}
* Potentially alter gene expression
* Potentially suppress or activate specific genes

Epigenetic changes may be reversible or permanent and passed down

to subsequent generations (transgenerational)

Epigenetics is the study of inherited changes in phenotype (factors that account for appearance) that are not directly related to, nor explained by changes in our DNA pattern. For this reason, this field of study is known as "epi," the greek root for "above," indicating that a change has occurred that is not directly related to the genetic code, but above it somehow. In epigenetics, non-genetic causes are responsible for different expressions of phenotypes. Or, termed in a different way, epigenetics describes changes in the expression of our genes that are not caused by alterations in the DNA sequence. Essentially, a different factor accounts for the change in the gene expression.
Exogenous, or environmental components may affect gene regulation and thus, potentially, subsequent expression in the phenotype. Changes to gene expression that are induced by environmental contaminants can be permanent or transient. Research has shown that epigenetic changes may in fact be reversed.

\section*{2.B. ENDOCRINE SYSTEM}
* Physiologic system that controls the proper functioning of multiple bodily functions and organs
* Comprised of ductless glands that secrete hormones into the bloodstream

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
* Essential role is to ensure a coordinated response between messages from internal organs and tissues

The endocrine system plays an essential role in the short term and long term regulation of metabolic pathways that control many development processes for men and women. Specifically, this system plays an important role in the proper functioning of the reproductive system.
A series of ductless glands make up the endocrine system. The most important glands in the endocrine system are the adrenal, thyroid, and pituitary gland, though reproductive organs, such as the female ovaries and male testis, are also considered endocrine glands. When a number of glands communicate with one another in a sequence, it is called a gland axis, like the hypothalamic, pituitary, and adrenal axis.
Common disorders of the endocrine system include over secretion or under secretion of specific chemical messengers. Such disorders commonly induce diseases that may affect the proper functioning of multiple organs and systems. Some diseases may be debilitating or even life-threatening.
The field of study that deals with disorders of endocrine glands is endocrinology.

\section*{HORMONES}
* Diverse effects in the body
- Growth and development
- Mood
- Metabolism regulation
- Reproductive cycle control

\author{
Essential to maintaining health of the body!
}
* Fundamental components of the endocrine system

Hormones are chemical signals that transmit messages from one part of the body to another. They travel through the bloodstream to target specific tissues or organs. Hormones regulate many different processes, such as growth and development, metabolism, sexual function, reproduction, and mood.
Hormones also work to control natural chemical balances to ensure the body is in a stable state. They may induce immediate bodily effects, or work slowly, over time, to affect entire bodily processes. Hormones act as very powerful signals. It takes a very small amount of hormonal imbalance to cause significant changes in the human body.

\section*{TYPES OF HORMONES}

\section*{Three basic classes of hormones}

\section*{1. Peptide-derived}
- Amino acid chains
- Insulin, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)

\section*{2. Steroid-derived}
- Derived from cholesterol, cortisone, aldosterone
- Estrogen, testosterone

\section*{3. Amine-derived}
- Amino acids chains
- Catecholamine

There are different classes of hormones within the human body. Each type of hormone has a different function in the body. They are divided into three classes.
The first class of hormones are peptide-derived hormones, and are made of single amino acids that link to form amino acid chains.

Some examples of peptide-derived hormones include insulin and two female reproductive hormones: Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). Insulin is the hormone that is responsible for maintaining appropriate blood sugar levels. LH and FSH will be discussed in upcoming slides.
A second class of hormones are the steroid-derived hormones. Examples of steroid hormones are estrogen and testosterone. These reproductive hormones will be described in the upcoming sections.
The third class of hormones are the amine-derived hormones. Similar to peptide-derived hormones, as they are also made of amino acids that link to form amino acid chains. Aminederived hormones are specifically comprised of the specific amino acid that are known as tyrosine and tryptophan. Tryptophan is the precursor of serotonin and melatonin synthesis.
Note: Peptides consist of chains of amino-acids (oligo- or poly-peptides, proteins). Amines are derived from single amino-acids.

\section*{THE IMPORTANCE OF HOMEOSTASIS}

A state of internal balance

Avoiding dramatic shifts in hormone levels that may negatively affect health

See-saw principle: cells send feedback signals to regulate proper levels of each hormone
* Usually negative feedback-signals tell endocrine system to reduce production of
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-21.jpg?height=600&width=264&top_left_y=514&top_left_x=1333)
certain hormones

A central function of the endocrine system is the maintenance of homeostasis in the body. Homeostasis is defined as a stable, constant condition of a living organism, free from sudden fluctuation. Several regulatory mechanisms in the endocrine system allow homeostasis to occur. The endocrine system, and its complex processes, are responsible for a proper internal balance of the human body. Homeostatic regulation allows humans to function effectively even when they are exposed to different environmental conditions, such as temperature. For example, when human beings are in hot temperatures, sweat glands in the skin will produce sweat, thus bringing liquid to the surface for evaporation, and acting to internally reduce our body heat. This is an example of a homeostatic process.
When the endocrine system is not able to properly maintain homeostasis, serious life-threatening disorders and diseases may occur.
The endocrine system regulates proper balance of hormones in the body through a process known as the "seesaw principle." This principle describes the communication between cells and glands that secrete hormones to ensure proper hormonal balance. When there is an improper level of hormones in the bloodstream, cells will communicate with other cells to increase or decrease (as needed) the production of a certain hormone.
The slide demonstrates how the endocrine system regulates itself to promote homeostasis. Cell A (pink and red colored) will secrete hormone $A$ which will influence cell $B$, and thus the secretion of cell $B$ (gray colored). If cell $B$ produces too much hormone B , cell A will sense this imbalance and decrease secretion of hormone A , which will in turn decrease secretion of hormone $B$ by cell $B$. This regulation is known as a negative feedback loop because the resulting return to homeostasis occurs due to a decrease in hormone secretion.

A good example of how the endocrine system maintains homeostasis via the see-saw principle is the maintenance of blood sugar levels by the hormone insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that causes certain cells to take up sugar, in the form of glucose, from the blood. The level of insulin in the bloodstream is a very important mechanism of central metabolic control.
If blood sugar falls too low in the body, the person may experience unconsciousness due to a lack of glucose. However, insulin also acts to ensure that blood sugar does not rise too high.
When endocrine control of insulin fails, diabetes mellitus may occur. However, if the body is in proper homeostatic balance via the see-saw principle, levels of blood sugar will be stable.

\section*{REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES}
* Responsible for sexual development and reproductive health in women and men
* Female primary reproductive hormones:
- Estrogen
- Progesterone
- Luteinizing hormone
- Follicle stimulating hormone
* Male primary reproductive hormones:
- Testosterone
- Luteinizing hormone
- Follicle stimulating hormone

Different types of hormones are responsible for different processes in the human body. For example, there is a group of hormones responsible for the reproductive processes of the body. These are known as reproductive hormones and are responsible for many different processes related to sexual development and reproduction. Estrogen is a type of reproductive hormone and is the primary female reproductive hormone. Estrogen promotes the development of breasts and regulates the process of the menstrual cycle. Details of the menstrual cycle will be described in further slides. Progesterone is another type of female reproductive hormone. It is responsible for many processes during pregnancy, including the development of the fetus in the mother's womb. Luteinizing hormone, known as LH , is yet another female reproductive hormone. LH is essential for female reproduction. LH triggers ovulation and is responsible for releasing the female egg. Therefore, it plays an important role in the menstrual cycle. Finally, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), is a female reproductive hormone that regulates the development, growth, pubertal maturation, and reproductive processes of the female body. It also initiates follicular growth and prepares the body for the start of the next ovulation cycle. LH and FSH are reproductive hormones that work together and help control the menstrual cycle.
Men do not have the same reproductive hormones as women. Testosterone is the male reproductive hormone and is the principal male reproductive hormone. Testosterone is important in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testes and the prostate. Testosterone also promotes hair growth and muscle development during adolescence, a stage known as puberty.
Sexual development and reproductive health for both women and men are dependent on the action of these reproductive hormones.

\section*{ROLE OF HORMONES IN SEX DIFFERENTIATION}
* Testosterone secretion determines whether an embryo will develop into a phenotypic male or a female
* Secretion of testosterone will induce formation of male reproductive system
* Lack of secretion and/or response to testosterone can lead to failure to form the male reproductive system completely, leading to female characteristics

Reproductive hormones are responsible for deciding whether a developing embryo will become a phenotypic male or a female. Whether an embryo will develop into a male or female depends on the formation of reproductive duct systems and the differentiation of external genitalia. When a fetus is approximately 8 weeks old, it will begin to develop either male or female reproductive systems. The mechanism that decides the sex of the fetus is the secretion, or release, of testosterone or a lack of testosterone secretion. For example, if testosterone is released at approximately 8 weeks of fetal life, the fetus will develop a male duct system and external male genitalia. However, if secretion of testosterone does not occur, there will be no induction of male duct system differentiation, thus leading to development of the female duct system. A lack of testosterone release will lead to the development of female characteristics.

\section*{2.C. FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM}
* Ovaries - where egg is produced
* Oviduct (Fallopian tube) where fertilization takes place
* Uterus - where the embryo grows and develops
* Vagina - birth canal

The female reproductive pathway is comprised of the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The vagina is where the male sperm first enter the internal pathway of the female reproductive tract and is also where a baby will leave the female's body once ready for birth. The next compartment in the female reproductive system is the uterus. This is the space where the fetus will develop. Next are the fallopian tubes. The female reproductive tract has two fallopian tubes, one on each side of the top of the uterus where mature eggs or ova move through to reach the uterus. Finally, the ovaries are the two round organs that produce the female egg cells. The ovaries rest outside of the openings of the fallopian tubes.

\section*{OOGENESIS}
* Oogenesis is the production of the egg in the ovaries
* Begins when the female is an embryo
* all primary oocytes develop before birth and remain "dormant" in this stage until ready for maturation

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-26.jpg?height=633&width=440&top_left_y=460&top_left_x=1219}

\end{figure}

Oogenesis is the term used to describe the creation of the egg, or ovum. The egg is the female cell that will be fertilized by a sperm to create an embryo that can develop into a fetus. The process of oogenesis begins when a female is still just an embryo. The creation of the female eggs occurs before or slightly after the birth of a female. At birth, a female will have $1,000,000$ primary eggs, but only 200,000 are left by puberty. No additional primary eggs are created. Over a woman's reproductive lifetime, only 450 eggs complete oogenesis. The latency period render the eggs particularly vulnerable to environmental exposures.
You will notice in the diagram that for every mature ovum that is created, three polar bodies will also be created. However, the mature ovum is what is known as the egg. It is this egg that must be fertilized by a sperm in order for an embryo to grow into a fetus.
Oocyte formation in utero provides a susceptibility to epigenetics effects from maternal exposures and to third-generation effects.

In any one human generation, the egg's development starts before the female that carries it is even born; 8 to 20 weeks after the fetus has started to grow, cells that are to become mature ova have been multiplying, and by the time that the female is born, all of the egg cells that the ovaries will release during the active reproductive years of the female are already present in the ovaries. These cells, known as the primary ova,..., remain dormant until just prior to ovulation, when an egg is released from the ovary. Some egg cells may not mature for 40 years; others degenerate and never mature.

\section*{FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE HORMONE PATHWAYS}

The hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are both in the brain.

Hormonal messaging between the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, and ovaries regulates female reproductive system.
$\Leftrightarrow$ Feedback loop controls proper hormonal balance.
* Hormones signal target female reproductive organs: breasts, uterus, and vagina.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-27.jpg?height=435&width=323&top_left_y=788&top_left_x=1263)

The female reproductive system is regulated by a the signaling pathways of the female reproductive hormones described in previous slides. There are three key places in the female body that serve as hormonal messaging centers. They are the hypothalamus in the brain, the anterior pituitary gland, and the ovaries. The hypothalamus secretes a hormone that is called the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hormone (GnRH) regulates the release of the luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from specialized cells in the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones are released in short bursts. LH and FSH promote ovulation and stimulate secretion of the sex hormone estradiol, (an estrogen) and progesterone from the ovaries. These hormones circulate in the bloodstream and stimulate the target organs of the reproductive system, including the breasts, uterus, vagina. Proper functioning of the female reproductive system is dependent on the chemical messaging of the described hormonal pathways.

\section*{FEMALE MENSTRUAL CYCLE}
* Each month, a woman's body prepares for the possible fertilization of an egg
* Ovarian Cycle

An egg matures in the ovary and is released about 14 days from the last menstruation
* Uterine Cycle

The lining of the uterus builds up to prepare for a fertilized egg. If no fertilization occurs, the lining breaks down and menstruation occurs

The female menstrual cycle is necessary for reproduction. This process is under control of the endocrine system. The menstrual cycle occurs as a result of a female body's preparation for potential fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell to create an embryo. During the ovarian cycle, a primary oocyte matures into a egg ready for release. The egg is released into the fallopian tube and is ready for potential fertilization by a sperm cell. At this moment, the uterus begins forming a layer of nutrient rich cells on its inner walls. This lining will serve as an implantation bed for a potentially fertilized egg. However, if the egg is not fertilized by the time the egg reaches the uterus, the uterus will shed the lining that was created. This is because there is no longer a need for an implantation bed because fertilization has not occurred. Menstruation occurs in monthly cycles throughout a woman's reproductive life. However, menstruation does not occur while a woman is pregnant, in the majority of women. Menstruation starts during puberty and ends permanently at menopause.

\section*{FEMALE MENSTRUAL CYCLE}
* Follicle is the egg and the cells surrounding it.
* One follicle fully matures during each ovarian cycle.
* Ovulation is the release of egg from ovary triggered by LH (Luteinizing Hormone).

The female menstrual cycle is regulated by specific hormones. Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone promote ovulation and stimulate the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. These two hormones stimulate the uterus to prepare for potential fertilization. The cycle has three phases: follicular (before release of the egg), ovulatory (egg release), and luteal (after egg release). The menstrual cycle begins with the first day of bleeding. This is counted as day 1 . The cycle ends just before the next menstrual period. Menstrual cycles typically range from about 25 to 36 days.

\section*{2.D. MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM}
* Sperm are the male reproductive cells
* The penis is the male organ used in sexual intercourse
* The testes are where sperm are produced
* The scrotum contains the testes and controls temperature for sperm development

Unlike the female reproductive system, most of the male reproductive system is located outside of the body. These external structures include the penis, scrotum, and testicles.
Sperm are the male reproductive cells. The sperm cell consists of a head, a midpiece and a tail. The head contains the nucleus. The head is surrounded by an acrosome that contains enzymes for penetrating the female egg. The body has many mitochondria to provide energy for the journey through the female cervix. The tail or "flagellum" allows the sperm to move. Sperm is expelled (ejaculated) through the end of the penis.
The penis is the male organ used in sexual intercourse. It has three parts: the root, which attaches to the wall of the abdomen; the body, or shaft; and the glans, which is the cone-shaped part at the end of the penis.
Most men have two testes. The testes are responsible for making testosterone, the primary male sex hormone, and for generating sperm.
The scrotum is a sac of skin that hangs behind and below the penis. It contains the testes. The scrotum acts as a "climate control system" for the testes. For normal sperm development, the testes must be at a temperature slightly cooler than body temperature.

Testosterone is an imperative sex hormone in male reproductive function. Specifically, it regulates spermatogenesis, the production of the sperm. A proper balance of testosterone in the male body is essential to maintain not only reproductive health, but overall health status. The figure is the representation of the testosterone molecule. Testosterone is a steroid hormone. Genetics also has a role in the development of the male reproductive system. For instance, they act as regulators of testicular descent.

Spermatogenesis describes the process of sperm cell development in the male. It is initiated in the male testis with the beginning of puberty. It entails numerous steps that one by one, lead to the development of a mature sperm cell. First, the process begins with rounded immature sperm cells. These cells first undergo mitotic division in which the genetic material in the immature sperm cell is replicated. Mitotic division indicates that the genetic material was separated into two identical copies of each other. Next, is a phase of meiotic division. Meiotic division refers to a cellular process that occurs in sex cells. This process divides the chromosome in half and produces two cells with half the genetic material in each cell. Finally, the sperm cells undergo a final metamorphic change to produce mature sperm.
Spermatogenesis is heavily dependent on appropriate levels of testosterone and may be affected by hormonal fluctuations in the body.

\section*{PRODUCTION FACTORS IN SPERMATOGENESIS}
* Sperm production takes 70 to 80 days
* Between 20 and 375 million sperm are produced per day

WHO lower reference values for human semen
* Total sperm number 39 million per ejaculate
* Sperm concentration 15 million per mL
* Vitality 28\% live
* Progressive motility 32\%
* Total (progressive + non-progressive motility) 40\%
* Morphologically normal forms 4\%

This data represents reference distributions of semen characteristics of fertile men in a number of countries. They provide an appropriate tool in conjunction with clinical data to evaluate a patient's semen quality and prospects for fertility.

Spermatogenesis is a complex physiological process. The production of relatively high concentrations of sperm is essential for healthy reproductive function of males. On average, the process of sperm production takes between 70 to 80 days. A very large volume of individual sperm are produced every day, though it varies widely between 20 million and 375 million individual sperm cells.
Semen is the liquidly medium that provides sperm with nutrients as they travel through the female reproductive tract to fertilize the egg.
In every millimeter of semen, there are approximately 100,000,000 sperm, however, this number can also vary depending on a numerous internal and external factors. Epidemiologic research has ascertained that within a millimeter of male sperm, approximately 20,000,000 will be unviable to fertilize a female egg due to physiologic or chemical dysfunction.

Reproductive health extends through conception and the development of the embryo and fetus!

Conception describes the process of the joining of sperm and egg. This process can only can occur during a short window of the menstrual cycle, either 2 days before or 15 hours following ovulation. Developmental processes related to human fertility and conception occur during limited periods of time. If sperm meets and penetrates a mature egg after ovulation, it will fertilize it. When the sperm penetrates the egg, changes occur in the protein coating around it to prevent other sperm from entering. However, both the female egg and male sperm must demonstrate proper structure and function in order for conception to occur.

Human embryogenesis is a process of very specific cell divisions and differentiations following fertilization of a male sperm with a female egg. Embryogenesis begins at the moment that a sperm meets with the egg and lasts until the eighth week of development. The original cell at fertilization is known as a zygote. The zygote will undergo specific cell division, known as cleavages. The different types of cleavages are outlined in the diagram. At approximately day five following fertilization, the zygote has divided multiple times and is now formally referred to as a blastocyst. In the first week, the blastocyst will implant into the uterine wall. Following this period, the mass of cells will differentiate and the first physiologic structures will be formed, including the beginnings of the umbilical cord.

Organogenesis describes the process by which the cells differentiate into specific tissues that will later become internal organs. There are three specific tissues that develop during this period. They are the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The ectoderm will form the external layer of organs. For example, the skin cells of the body will be formed from the ectoderm developed during organogenesis. The next type of tissue is the mesoderm, which will represent the middle layer of the organs. This type of tissue includes the red blood cells and skeletal muscle cells. Finally, endodermic tissue will be formed. The endoderm will comprise the internal layer of organs. An example of endoderm formation is the development of thyroid cells. Together, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm will create the essential organs for the developing fetus.
Internal organs begin to develop in utero between the 3rd and 8th week. During this critical window of development, the process of cell differentiation may be adversely affected by various environmental exposures. However, due to the complexity of organogenesis, as well as the poorly understood mechanisms of action for many exogenous elements on organogenesis, the exact health effects are difficult to presume. On this diagram, you will notice the transition from the zygote to the blastocyst described in the previous slide.

\caption{Characterized by two specific mechanisms:
1. Rapid growth
2. Cellular differentiation and organ development}
\end{figure}

Following the end of embryogenesis in the $8^{\text {th }}$ week, the developing organism is officially known as a fetus. From this point forward, the developmental period is known as the fetal period. During the fetal period, the beginnings of all of the major organs are created through intricate cell divisions and differentiations. In addition to individual organs, physiologic systems are also developed.
The fetal period is defined by two major stages: rapid growth and cell differentiation. The first stage is rapid growth. Fetal growth is the most intense at the first week of fetal period and lasts through week sixteen. In this rapid growth phase, the fetus experiences a 25 -fold increase in body weight.
The second phase of growth is defined by dramatic tissue and organ development. During the rapid growth period previously described, the fetus has not developed any mechanisms for proper cell differentiation. Therefore, during this second phase, complex processes of cell differentiation and cleavaging develop specific organs, organ systems, and tissues. In addition, the fetus takes the shape representative of an infant. Throughout the fifth month, muscle mass begins to develop and the mother may experience the first fetal movements due to this occurrence. By the six month, the lungs have fully differentiated and the fetus is able to independently breathe. The seventh month is marked by the development of the nervous system and the fetus is able to respond to basic reflexes, including constriction of the pupils in response to light.
The fetal period lasts until birth, at approximately the 38th week of development.

A critical window of susceptibility is a period where there are numerous changing capabilities in the developing organism. Exposures to environmental contaminants during this window may result in permanent damage to a fetus and may have lifelong effects on health. Given that development continues after birth, critical and sensitive windows occur before, during, and shortly after the fertilization of the egg. Critical windows of development are also present during pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and puberty. The diagram provided demonstrates the particular windows of susceptibility for the developing fetus, in this case, of the nervous system. The maternal environment at these specific temporal windows has important implications for the healthy development of a fetus.

Vulnerable periods during the development of the nervous system are sensitive to environmental insults because they are dependent on the temporal and regional emergence of critical developmental processes (i.e. proliferation, migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis, myelination, and apoptosis). Evidence from numerous sources demonstrates that neural development extends from the embryonic period through adolescence. In general, the sequence of events is comparable among species, although the time scales are considerably different. Developmental exposure of animals or humans to numerous agents (e.g. X-ray irradiation, methylazoxymethanol, ethanol, lead, methyl mercury, or chlorpyrifos) demonstrates that interference with one or more of these developmental processes can lead to developmental neurotoxicity. Different behavioural domains (e.g. sensory, motor, and various cognitive functions) are subserved by different brain areas. Although there are important differences between the rodent and human brain, analogous structures can be identified. Moreover, the ontogeny of specific behaviours can be used to draw inferences regarding the maturation of specific brain structures or neural circuits in rodents and primates, including humans. Furthermore, various clinical disorders in humans (e.g. schizophrenia, dyslexia, epilepsy, and autism) may also be the result of interference with normal ontogeny of developmental processes in the nervous system. Of critical concern is the possibility that developmental exposure to neurotoxicants may result in an acceleration of age-related decline in function. This concern is compounded by the fact that developmental neurotoxicity that results in small effects can have a profound societal impact when amortized across the entire population and across the lifespan of humans.

"mis-programming" of the endocrine system

The majority of the endocrine system is developed during the fetal or neonatal period in humans. Most endocrine glands, like the thyroid, pancreas, adrenals, and gonads (reproductive organs), will form early in the second month and then differentiate into their respective physiologic forms in the third month. This development entails the initial programming of homeostasis, and will establish the definition of an appropriate hormonal balance for an individual throughout the rest of life. This can be thought of as an initial programming of the hormones needed to maintain the "see-saw" principle defined in a previous slide. For this reason, this specific period of endocrine system programming is imperative for future healthy homeostatic balance. Research has demonstrated that abnormal environmental factors during fetal or neonatal development may potentially result in permanent "mis-programming" of the endocrine system. "Mis-programming" may lead to the development of homeostatic imbalance and potentially subsequent disease.

\section*{3. A. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT}
* Focuses on exposure to contaminants found in the environment, specifically during critical periods of development.
* All the physical, chemical, biological and social factors that may affect the origin, growth, development and survival of a person in a given setting.
Examples include:
- Specific synthetic chemicals
- Some metals

> Still an emerging issue!
- Air pollutants

Reproductive health and the environment focuses on exposures to environmental contaminants during critical periods of human development. These periods are directly related to reproductive health throughout the life course, including the period before conception, at conception, fertility, pregnancy, child and adolescent development, and adult health. Exposures to different environmental contaminants may influence reproductive health status through the process of epigenetics.
Environmental toxicants may potentially induce effects in human reproductive processes. However, the extent of this hypothesis must be supported through greater levels of research.

In the case of repeated low doses in the occupational setting, of pesticides for instance, the toxicity is chronic and might affect the regulations/metabolism of genes and the immune, endocrine and other systems. The effects are chronic and might only be visible after a latency period.

Several chemicals, compounds (both synthetic and organic), metals, and other environmental toxicants have been associated with adverse human health effects. Significant scientific concerns over the potential impact of these environmental hazards on reproductive health have increased research and public debate on this issue. For instance, evidence is arising on relationships between spontaneous abortion as well as reduction of anogenital distance and exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) during pregnancy.

Prenatal phthalate exposure impairs testicular function and shortens anogenital distance (AGD) in male rodents. We present data from the first study to examine AGD and other genital measurements in relation to prenatal phthalate exposure in humans. A standardized measure of AGD was obtained in 134 boys 2-36 months of age. AGD was significantly correlated with penile volume ( $R=0.27, p=0.001$ ) and the proportion of boys with incomplete testicular descent ( $R=0.20, p=0.02$ ). We defined the anogenital index (AGI) as AGD divided by weight at examination [AGI $=A G D /$ weight $(\mathrm{mm} / \mathrm{kg})$ ] and calculated the age-adjusted AGI by regression analysis. We examined nine phthalate monoester metabolites, measured in prenatal urine samples, as predictors of age-adjusted AGI in regression and categorical analyses that included all participants with prenatal urine samples ( $n=85$ ). Urinary concentrations of four phthalate metabolites [monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP)] were inversely related to AGI. After adjusting for age at examination, $p$-values for regression coefficients ranged from 0.007 to 0.097 . Comparing boys with prenatal MBP concentration in the highest quartile with those in the lowest quartile, the odds ratio for a shorter than expected AGI was 10.2 (95\% confidence interval, 2.5 to 42.2 ). The corresponding odds ratios for MEP, MBzP, and MiBP were 4.7, 3.8, and 9.1, respectively (all $p$-values $<0.05$ ). We defined a summary phthalate score to quantify joint exposure to these four phthalate metabolites. The age-adjusted AGI decreased significantly with increasing phthalate score ( $p$-value for slope $=0.009$ ). The associations between male genital development and phthalate exposure seen here are consistent with the phthalate-related syndrome of incomplete virilization that has been reported in prenatally exposed rodents. The median concentrations of phthalate metabolites that are associated with short AGI and incomplete testicular descent are below those found in one-quarter of the female population of the United States, based on a nationwide sample. These data support the hypothesis that prenatal phthalate exposure at environmental levels can adversely affect male reproductive development in humans.

\section*{3.B. ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS: DEFINITIONS}

> Endocrine Disruptor is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters the function of the endocrine system and consequently results in adverse health effects

> Potential endocrine disruptor is an exogenous substance or mixture that possesses properties that might lead to endocrine disruption

\section*{Research in this field is just beginning!}

An endocrine disruptor is an exogenous substance or mixture that alters the function of the endocrine system and consequently causes adverse health effects in an intact organism, or its progeny, or subpopulations.
A potential endocrine disruptor is an exogenous substance or mixture that possesses properties that might be expected to lead to endocrine disruption in an intact organism, or its progeny, or subpopulations.
Key issues in understanding the role and action of endocrine disruptors and potential endocrine disruptors are the mechanisms of action and consequences of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals, including mixture of various chemical compounds, dose response relationships, latent effects, and age of exposure.
It is important to acknowledge that the state of science regarding endocrine disruptor research is only beginning and much more is yet to be learned about the specific qualities of these environmental compounds. Endocrine disruption has sometimes been demonstrated for animals (wildlife/in vivo and in vitro studies). For instance, tributyl tin (TBT) originating from antifouling paints used to treat boat hulls induces a form of pseudohermaphroditism (termed imposex) in female gastropods by an endocrine-disrupting mechanism.

The endocrine system is a complex network of hormones that regulates various bodily functions such as growth and development. The endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, thymus, pancreas, ovaries, and testes. These glands or organs release carefully-measured levels of hormones into the bloodstream that act as natural chemical messengers to control important processes of the body.
Specific environmental toxicants directly affect the endocrine system. Endocrine disruptors are exogenous agents that interfere with the synthesis, secretion, transport, binding, action, or elimination of natural hormones in the body that are responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis, reproduction, development, and/or behavior. Endocrine disruptors can change normal hormone levels, stimulate or halt the production of certain hormones, or change the way hormones move through the body.
However, greater research is still needed to substantiate this hypothesis.

There is increasing evidence in humans and in experimental animals for a relationship between exposure to specific environmental chemicals and perturbations in levels of critically important thyroid hormones (THs). Identification and proper interpretation of these relationships are required for accurate assessment of risk to public health.
Objectives: We review the role of TH in nervous system development and specific outcomes in adults, the impact of xenobiotics on thyroid signaling, the relationship between adverse outcomes of thyroid disruption and upstream causal biomarkers, and the societal implications of perturbations in thyroid signaling by xenobiotic chemicals.
Data sources: We drew on an extensive body of epidemiologic, toxicologic, and mechanistic studies.
Data synthesis: THs are critical for normal nervous system development, and decreased maternal TH levels are associated with adverse neuropsychological development in children. In adult humans, increased thyroid-stimulating hormone is associated with increased blood pressure and poorer blood lipid profiles, both risk factors for cardiovascular disease and death. These effects of thyroid suppression are observed even within the "normal" range for the population. Environmental chemicals may affect thyroid homeostasis by a number of mechanisms, and multiple chemicals have been identified that interfere with thyroid function by each of the identified mechanisms.
Conclusions: Individuals are potentially vulnerable to adverse effects as a consequence of exposure to thyroid-disrupting chemicals. Any degree of thyroid disruption that affects TH levels on a population basis should be considered a biomarker of adverse outcomes, which may have important societal outcomes.

Endocrine disrupting compounds act by mimicking or antagonizing naturally occurring hormones in the body. It is believed that endocrine disruptors act by interfering with synthesis, secretion, transport, metabolism, binding action, or elimination of natural hormones that are present in the body and are responsible for homeostasis, reproduction, and developmental process.

\section*{HORMONAL MECHANISMS OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS}

Endocrine disruptors act by mimicking or antagonizing naturally occurring hormones in the body. However, there are different types of hormones in the body as explained in previous slides. For this reason, endocrine disruptors must exert their effects by mimicking or antagonizing specific types of hormones in the body. In fact, endocrine disruptors may be categorized according to their mimicking or antagonizing behavior.
The largest body of evidence exists for endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogen. These are called estrogenic or estrogen agonists because they behave similarly to naturally occurring estrogens in the body. Endocrine disruptors that are estrogenic (green molecule) will mimic the naturally occurring estrogen (orange molecule) and bind with the receptor (purple molecule) that was meant for the naturally occurring estrogen.
Endocrine disruptors may also antagonize estrogen activity, and are thus called estrogen antagonists. This means that they may bind the same site on the receptor of the agonist does but are incapable of doing the task that the agonist can do.
Similarly, this same concept may apply to other types of hormones, including androgens. Endocrine disruptors, through the same principle as described above, can be either androgen agonists or androgen antagonists. The largest body of evidence exists for compounds that are estrogenic in nature.
Endocrine disruptors can also affect hormonal mechanisms (e.g thyroid).

Some environmental toxicants, such as pesticides, are intentionally released into the environment. Others, however, are released unintentionally during manufacturing, use, and disposal. A few chemicals are created unintentionally as by-products of industrial processes. This is true for a group of chemicals known as "dioxin-like" pollutants. Environmental toxicants that may exert adverse effects on reproductive health are present in media such as the water, air, soil, dust, food, and consumer products. Humans are exposed to these contaminants in the home, community, school, or workplace. To potentially cause harm, a toxicant must come into contact with a individual and enter the body, a step referred to as biologic uptake. Biologic uptake is the moment at which exposure occurs. Toxicants enter the body in one or more of three ways: inhalation, ingestion, or dermal absorption through the skin. Toxicants are then distributed to tissues an organs and subject to metabolism. Toxicants, or their metabolites, travel to target organs, such as the thyroid, ovaries, or testes, where they exert biological effects. Certain toxicants are stored in the body for long periods of time in muscle, bones or adipose tissue.

\section*{SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF EXPOSURE}

\section*{1. Effect of low doses}
- Subtle disruptions of endocrine signaling can have significant effects on the body

\section*{2. Wide range of effects}
- Endocrine signals govern virtually all processes in the body
- Effects can be seen in many different diseases and conditions
- Changes may be seen at population level (e.g. population shifts in fertility) but difficult to demonstrate at the individual level

\section*{3. Multiple exposures}
- Humans are exposed to a mixture of environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors
- Important in determining risk and the potential for synergistic effects

Normal endocrine signaling involves very small changes in hormone levels, yet these changes can have significant biological effects. Studies of endocrine disruptors in animal models have sometimes demonstrated that no threshold dose could be detected, that is, health effects were apparent at the lowest doses tested.
Secondly, environmental contaminants may demonstrate a wide range of effects. Endocrine signals govern virtually every organ and process in the body. That means that when outside chemicals interfere with those systems, the effects can be seen in many different diseases and conditions some of which we are just learning to recognize as the result of endocrine disruption.
On a daily basis, humans can be exposed a mixture of environmental contaminants that are found in the air, water, and food. Certain chemicals can have a greater adverse effect when other chemicals are present in the body.

Some endocrine disrupting chemicals whose effects can be seen cause effects in low doses but not at high doses, in opposition to the usual dose response curve familiar to toxicologists, which shows continually increasing responses with increases in dose. In vivo effects of bisphenol A (BPA), induce effects at low dose exposure during development on brain structure, function and behavior in rats and mice. (L. Birnbaum, Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Drinking Water: Risks to Human Health and the Environment, www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2010/02/t20100225a.html)

\section*{IMPORTANT POINTS RELATED TO ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS' HEALTH EFFECTS}

Adults may compensate for endocrine disruptors' effects
* Exposure when endocrine system is developing may result in permanent damage

Exposure to same endocrine disruptors in different stages of life results in different effects

Endocrine disruptors do not always affect the system predicted

Endocrine disruptors may impact physiological processes in multiple ways. However, there are important points that must be stressed. First of all, if exposure to endocrine disruptors occurs in adulthood, the effects of exposure may be compensated for by homeostatic mechanisms and thus may not result in evident health disparities. Additionally, the period in which the endocrine system is being programmed is incredibly vulnerable to damage. Thus, if an individual is exposed to an endocrine disruptor during this stage, permanent damage to the function of hormonal signalling pathways may occur. This can be specifically evident for stimulatory and inhibitory signalling pathways in the endocrine system.
It is also important to note that the effects of endocrine disruptors are not ubiquitous throughout the different stages of life. That is to say that exposures to even the same levels of endocrine disruptors in different stages of development may induce different effects.
Finally, due to the complexity involved in endocrine signalling, many different organ systems may be affected by a change in the function of one branch of the endocrine system. For this reason, when endocrine disruptors induce effects in the body, the extent of their action is largely unpredictable for other organ systems or hormonal signalling pathways.

Dose-response relationships are a critical component in understanding the mechanism of action for many endocrine disruptors. However, due to limited research and evidence from human exposures and effects, the true dose-response nature of many different endocrine disruptors is unknown. It is important to recognize that endocrine disruptors could affect the endocrine system by mimicking or antagonizing the hormones that are already present in the body. Therefore, the concentrations at which human health is affected by endocrine disruptors may be much less than with other environmental contaminants. There is uncertainty regarding the dose-response relationship between exposure to endocrine disruptors and adverse health effects dictated by changes in hormonal function and homeostatic equilibrium.

Reproductive Health and the Environment (Draft for review)

\section*{ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS AND NEUROTOXICITY}

Hundreds of chemicals and environmental toxicants can affect the nervous system

Mechanism of action
* transient changes in adult nervous system
*permanent changes induced in neural development
* direct toxic action on neuronal cells, effects via immune system, hormonal effects (thyroid), systemic diseases

Some pesticides and poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are neurotoxic

More than 850 chemicals directly impact the nervous system and may cause adverse health effects. This includes some metals, organic solvents, agrochemicals, poly-halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, and pharmaceuticals. Some of these environmental contaminants may be endocrine disrupting compounds because the reproductive endocrine system is primarily regulated by the neuroendocrine system.
There are two different hypothesized mechanisms of actions of endocrine disruptors on the nervous system. Endocrine disruptors may activate specific properties in adults and produce transient changes in the nervous system, or, exposure to endocrine disruptors during neural development may induce changes in neurobehavioral function, specifically sex-related behaviours. Also, there is direct toxic action on neuronal cells with effects seen via the immune system, hormonal effects (thyroid) and systemic diseases.
Specific chemicals may alter neurotransmitter concentrations, thus influencing neuroendocrine function and eventually reproduction. Some studies have indicated that poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may act through this mechanism, but greater research in necessary.

\section*{ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS AND NEUROTOXICITY: PBDEs AND PHTHALATES}

> Prenatal exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) may result in neurodevelopmental effects in infants

$\star$ Thyroid disruption
* Estrogen/androgen disruption

\section*{Prenatal exposure to phthalates associated with Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)}
* Oxidative metabolites formed
$\Leftrightarrow$ Antagonistic effects on the thyroid gland
-Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardant compounds that are persistent and bioaccumulative and therefore have become ubiquitous environment contaminants. A number of toxicologic studies have demonstrated that exposure to PBDEs may have endocrine-disrupting effects. Most of these studies have focused on thyroid hormone disruption and a smaller number on disruption of the estrogen/androgen hormone system. Animal studies suggest that prenatal PBDE exposure may result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects. A study of 100 children prenatally exposed to PBDE demonstrated that the chemical altered the neurodevelopment of children up to 72 months of age.
-At least 10 different phthalates are used commercially as plasticizers and solvents. Human exposure to phthalates can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact. Once absorbed, they are rapidly metabolized to monoesters, and the high-molecular-weight monoesters can undergo further oxidation to form oxidative metabolites. Antagonistic effects of phthalates on the thyroid gland in vivo and thyroid tissue in vitro have been reported. Recently, human studies have demonstrated that phthalate exposure in childhood was associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Engel et al. determined that behavioral domains adversely associated with prenatal exposure to phthalates are commonly affected in children clinically diagnosed with conduct or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.

Experimental and observational studies have reported biological consequences of phthalate exposure relevant to neurodevelopment. Engel et al. (p. 565) examined the association of prenatal phthalate exposure with offspring behavior in a multiethnic prenatal population enrolled in the Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Study in New York City between 1998 and 2002. Third-trimester maternal urine samples were collected and analyzed for phthalate metabolites, and the cognitive and behavioral development of the children was assessed between the ages of 4 and 9 years. In multivariate adjusted models, increased loge concentrations of low-molecular-weight (LMW) phthalate metabolites were associated with poorer scores on the Aggression, Conduct Problems, Attention Problems, and Depression, and Externalizing Problems and Behavioral Symptom Index composite scales. Increased loge concentrations of LMW phthalates were also associated with poorer scores on the Global Executive Composite index and the Emotional Control scale. The authors note that behavioral domains adversely associated with prenatal exposure to LMW phthalates in this study are commonly affected in children clinically diagnosed with conduct or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are widely used flame retardant compounds that are persistent and bioaccumulative. Animal studies suggest that prenatal PBDE exposure may result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects. Herbstman et al. (p. 712) initiated a longitudinal cohort following the World Trade Center attack on 11 September 2001 to evaluate associations between concentrations of individual PBDE congeners and neurodevelopmental indices. Outcomes were evaluated in approximately 100 children with PBDE concentrations measured in cord blood samples. After adjustment for potential confounders, higher concentrations of BDEs 47, 99, or 100 were associated with lower scores on tests of mental and physical development at 12-48 and 72 months. The authors conclude that developmental exposure to flame retardants following the World Trade Center disaster was associated with altered neurodevelopment of children up to 72 months of age.

\section*{Some adverse effects may be directly linked to endocrine disruption, but the causal pathway is largely inconclusive}

> Case studies to date have only involved high contamination exposures

The effects of environmental contaminants and potential endocrine disruptors have been studied extensively in wildlife. Specific mechanisms of the endocrine system, as well as hormonal events that regulate reproduction, are quite similar between some wildlife species and humans. Evidence from case studies has shown that wildlife may even be more sensitive to the action of certain environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors. A specific case study involves a decline in reproductive function of marine seals exposed to increased levels of two organochlorines: PCBs and DDE. Organochlorines are man-made organic compounds commonly used as pesticides. They are extremely persistent in the environment and are known to bioaccumulate in living organisms. It has been demonstrated that the population of Baltic ringed seals has declined significantly in the last century due to reproductive disorders. Specific abnormalities have included partial or complete sterility, interruptions during early pregnancy, and stenosis (abnormal narrowing) or necessary reproductive organs. A time trend study conducted by a team of scientists demonstrated that the seal populations affected by the reproductive disorder contained high levels of PCBs and DDE levels. The results specifically highlight that high levels of PCBs were the leading cause of reproductive malfunction. However, greater research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of action in this case study.

\section*{CASE STUDY: EGG SHELL THINNING}

Predatory birds exposed to organochlorine compounds experience abnormal reproductive morphologies

DDT and breakdown product, DDE

Direct impact on egg shell strength

Near extinction of many North American bird species
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-58.jpg?height=540&width=389&top_left_y=607&top_left_x=1284)

A rather famous case study for environmental exposures and effects in wildlife has been the loss of top level predatory birds due to egg shell thinning. Due to their specific feeding behaviour, carnivorous birds are exposed to a higher level of bio-accumulative organic compounds. Numerous studies have observed abnormal reproductive morphologies, deformities, and alterations in behaviour for bird colonies exposed to organic compound contaminants, specifically DDE, the breakdown product of the pesticide, DDT. DDE directly effects the shell gland and results in egg shell breaking or cracking, and thus severe decreases in avian populations. The widespread use of DDT as a insecticide in North America nearly resulted in the extinction of several bird species. However, it is widely understood that birds may be more susceptible to environmental contaminants due to their modes of reproduction, specifically, the vulnerability of egg shells to specific toxicants. However, research still remains inconclusive and greater research is needed in this area to understand the mechanisms of action of these environmental contaminants.

\section*{CASE STUDY: DEVELOPMENTAL ABNORMALITIES IN ALLIGATORS}
* Dicofol, organochlorine (OC) pesticide released into stream $\dot{*} 90 \%$ decrease in alligator species

* Dicofol may interact with estrogen receptor during juvenile development

WHO/IPCS/EDC, 2002

In 1980, a chemical spill in the state of Florida in the United States contaminated a stream with very high concentrations of dicofol, including its metabolites DDE and chloro-DDT. Dicofol is an organochlorine pesticide, similar in chemical nature and environmental effects to DDT. After the spill, the alligator population in the region decreased by $90 \%$ and adult alligators in the region were found to have high levels of dicofol and its by-products in their bodies. Alligators in the affected region demonstrated numerous reproductive dysfunctions, such as abnormal gonadal morphology and gonadal deformities. Specifically, male alligators in the contaminated area had significantly decreased phallic size and alterations in sperm cells. A proposed hypothesis is that the by-product of dicofol, DDE , may interact with the estrogen receptor and thus affect proper reproductive development in the juvenile alligator.
However, it must be stated that this specific case study demands greater research to document a dose response relationship between dicofol exposure and the reproductive health effects witnessed. Large carnivorous reptiles may bioaccumulate greater levels of environmental contaminants due to their feeding habits as well as their long life expectancies in the wild. Studies have shown that in fact, certain reptiles can bioaccumulate and biomagnify environmental contaminants to an equal or even greater scale than birds.
The diagram demonstrates male alligator phallic size in relation to the contaminated sites. The Woodruff lake region (far left bar) represents the control lake, while Apopka-GNS (far right bar) shows average phallic index in alligators at the contaminated site, and Apopka-NW (middle bar) shows the average phallic index in alligators in a contaminated area further away from the contaminated site.

3.D REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS: EXAMPLES OF EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH

Widespread and persistent, chlorinated hydrocarbons may mimic the biological effects of estrogens.

Excessive estrogen exposure is a key risk factor for gynaecologic malignancies and benign proliferative disorders - e.g. endometriosis and leiomyoma.

Also on hormone-dependent physiological processes
- e.g. conception; fetal development
- Possibly on osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease

As increasingly more women enter the workforce, they may be exposed to a variety of occupational chemicals and hazards that may lead to adverse health and reproductive effects. In addition, smoking, alcohol consumption, and other lifestyle factors play an increasingly important role in determining the health status of women. There is now abundant evidence that environmental factors may contribute to many of the disease processes discussed above. Some examples of likely environmental impact on women's health include the following:
Among the most widespread and persistent environmental toxicants are chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls), which are known to possess estrogenic potential, i.e., the ability to mimic the biological effects of estrogens. Imbalanced or unopposed estrogen exposure is a leading risk factor for many gynecologic malignancies, as well as benign proliferative disorders such as endometriosis and leiomyoma. The potential impact of these compounds on hormone-dependent physiological processes such as conception and fetal development, as well as on disease processes such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease, demands further exploration.

\section*{POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBs)}

\section*{A range of adverse, persistent effects were observed in children born to mothers exposed to relatively high levels of PCBs (in the "Yusho" and "Yu-Chen" poisoning incidents).}

The children presented
- Low birth weight
- Reduced growth
- Hyperpigmented skin
- Gingival hyperplasia
- Eye oedema
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-61.jpg?height=242&width=503&top_left_y=764&top_left_x=1029)
- Dentition at birth
- Abnormal calcification
-Men exposed before 20 years: lower chances to have a boy

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic compounds used in industrial processes. Many different forms of PCBs exist and persist in the environment today. Because of adverse health outcomes with PCB exposures in the past, many industrial countries decided to decrease or ban its production.

Exposure of the general population to PCBs occurs principally through contaminated food items.
Babies will be exposed through the mother's milk.
Two large episodes of intoxication in humans have occurred in Japan (Yusho) and China, Province of Taiwan (Yu-Cheng).
The main symptoms in Yusho and Yu-Cheng patients have frequently been attributed to contaminants in the PCB mixtures, specifically, to Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Expert groups concluded that the symptoms may have been caused by the combined exposure to PCBs and PCDFs.
In children of Yusho and Yu-Cheng patients, diminished growth, dark pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes, gingival hyperplasia, xenophthalmic oedematous eyes, dentition at birth, abnormal calcification of the skull, rocker bottom heel, and a high incidence of low birth weight were observed. Whether or not a correlation existed between the exposure and the occurrence of malignant neoplasms in these patients could not be definitely concluded, because the number of deaths was too small. However, a statistically significant increase was observed in male patients, with regard to mortality from all neoplasms, liver and lung cancer.
Developmental effects - Four epidemiological studies performed in the Netherlands examine the association between background PCB exposure and thyroid effects. These studies examined thyroid hormone levels in persons exposed to PCBs in utero and found that higher PCB exposure was associated with higher thyrotrophin-stimulating hormone (TSH) and lower T4 hormone levels in infancy and up to one year of age. These changes could affect neurodevelopment in utero as well as in neonatal and infant life. Studies examining neurodevelopment in relation to low level PCB exposure have found hypotonia and psychomotor delays in early life.
PCBs have been widely used in electrical equipment, and smaller volumes of PCBs are used as fire-resistant liquid in nominally closed systems. By the end of 1980, the total world production of PCBs was in excess of 1 million tonnes and, since then, production has continued in some countries. Despite increasing withdrawal from use, and restrictions on the production of PCBs, very large amounts of these compounds continue to be present in the environment, either in use or as waste. In recent years, many industrialized countries have taken steps to control and restrict the flow of PCBs into the environment. The most influential force leading to these restrictions has probably been a 1973 recommendation from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (WHO, 1976; IARC, 1978; OECD, 1982). Since then, the 24 OECD member countries have restricted the manufacture, sales, importation, exportation and use of PCBs, as well as establishing a labelling system for these compounds. Current sources of PCB release include volatilization from landfills containing transformer, capacitor, and other PCB-containing wastes, sewage sludge, spills, and dredge spoils, and improper (or illegal) disposal in open areas. Pollution may occur during the incineration of industrial and municipal waste. Most municipal incinerators are not effective in destroying PCBs. Explosions or overheating of transformers and capacitors may release significant amounts of PCBs into the local environment.

Reproductive Health and the Environment (Draft for review)
Seveso, Italy - 10 July 1976, chemical explosion that releases the highest levels of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure experienced by a human population.

\section*{Seveso Women's Health Study:1996 retrospective cohort study of females}
- Age of menopause: increase risk of early menopause
- Breast cancer: associated with individual high TCDD levels
- Menstrual cycles: more regular
- Endometriosis: doubled, non-significant risk
- Leiomyoma: ....seems to have an anti-estrogenic effect on myometrium
- Ovarian function: no evidence
- Menarche: no evidence
- Confusing picture: in some tissues TCDD may be estrogen like (breast) and in others it may be blocking estrogen (uterus).
- Timing of exposure seems to be important
- Excess of female births in a region after toxic chemical spill of TCD,

In Seveso Italy, 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo-p- dioxin (TCDD) was released when a chemical factor exploded. In the years that followed, males were born at half the rate of females in families where the father was exposed to the chemical. This study has not been reproduced in animals or humans.

\section*{DIETHYLSTILBESTROL}

Another type of cancer: Diethylstilbestrol (DES) as a model for environmental estrogens
- DES administered to pregnant women 1940-1960 for high-risk pregnancies but later to promote "healthier babies" as well.
- Female offspring developed clear-cell carcinoma of the vagina, vaginal adenosis, cervical ectropion, and other abnormalities.
- Males: reproductive tract abnormalities.

> Has human cancer incidence resulting from DES exposure peaked? DES daughters are reaching post-menopause, the age of endometrial carcinoma...
- DES may be a model compound for other environmental agents with estrogenic potential.

DES taught us three important lessons that can guide our investigations on endocrine disrupting chemicals in the future:
1. Exposure to endocrine disruptors during early (fetal) development can induce disorders of the endocrine system in the fetus, whilst the mother may appear healthy 2. The risk of health impacts from exposure to hormone disruptors is especially high during early development.
3. An endocrine disease or disorder induced during early development might only be apparent decades later, and exposure to this one chemical could lead to multiple health risks.

Please note pharmaceuticals are prescribed and taken on higher doses and often regular basis, so are usually high level exposures.

DES was administered to pregnant women during the 1940s through 1960s, originally for high-risk pregnancies but later to promote "healthier babies" as well. Subsequently, the drug was linked to the development of an otherwise extremely rare malignancy, clear-cell carcinoma of the vagina, in young female offspring exposed in utero. In addition, a number of more abnormalities. Although the public health hazards associated with further exposure to DES have been largely eliminated, there are a number of compelling reasons for the continued study of DES-exposed women, as well as for basic research on the biological effects of DES and other environmental estrogenic compounds.
First, it is unclear whether the human cancer incidence resulting from DES exposure has peaked. Although the majority of DES daughters have passed the age range for vaginal carcinoma development, few have reached the age range (postmeno-pausal) in which endometrial carcinoma typically occurs in the DES unexposed population, and endometrial of molecular genetic markers for DES carcinogenicity is therefore a continuing priority: such markers would also be of value in predicting risk for third-generation DES offspring, for whom little is known about potential health risks.
Second, DES may be viewed as a model compound for other environmental agents with estrogenic potential. The bioaccumulation of these environmental estrogens is recognized as a problem of increasing magnitude, and certain human populations in the United States have been shown to carry amounts of these fat-soluble compounds which, in fish and other wildlife, cause significant endocrine dysfunction and developmental anomalies of the reproductive tract. Insights into the biological effects of DES should therefore provide a foundation upon which future environmental health problems may be effectively addressed.
NIEHS has a long history of accomplishments in conducting and supporting research on estrogen action, hormonal carcinogenesis, and other types of estrogen-related pathology, particularly for DES and simiar compounds. More recent achievements have provided insights into basic mechanisms of estrogen receptor action at the molecular level. A transgenic human and animal tumors resulting from DES exposure in utero for molecular genetic alterations. Rapid advances in the fields of molecular and developmental biology have provided numerous insights into relevant genes and molecular pathways involved in reproductive tract development. Epidemiologic studies are fo-cused on a broad range of health effects among DES-exposed men and women. Expanded research efforts are necessary to use this knowledge in exploring the epigenetic effects of DES in relation to reproductive tract malformations at the molecular level.
In addition to the estrogen receptor, research on the role of "orphan receptors" in environmental disease is promising. Identification and characterization of orphan receptors and their endogenous ligands will provide a link to understanding the molecular mechanisms through which exogenous chemicals may exert toxic effects and through which natural substances influence physiologic processes. For example, a recently discovered member of the nuclear receptor family apparently recognizes a class of foreign chemicals called peroxisome TCDD. A related example is the retinoids, which regulate differentiation and growth of a variety of epithelial tissues including mammary gland, cervical, vaginal, and uterine epithelium. Ongoing research at NIEHS is directed toward understanding the process of squamous differentiation in gynecologic epithelial tissues by retinoids and estrogens, and interactions beween the retinoic acid receptor and estrogen receptor signaling pathways. Further research is necessary to define these pathways at the molecular level and to elucidate possible the tin-oids in breast and other cancers.
An additional complexity is that age and the timing of exposures to environmental agents can have a profound effect on individual susceptibility. For example, the well-known adverse perinatal DES-exposed experimental animal model point to critical stages of susceptibility. In fact, the hypothesis that exposure to environmental agents early in life is of greater health significance than adult exposure is currently being investigated by NIEHS researchers studying the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals during development and the importance of timing of exposure in cancer risk. Yet another aspect of timing that complicates environmental health research is that the appearance of disease often occurs much later than the causative exposure. This was the case with DES, and this delay makes identifying the contributing factor(s) difficult but challenging, requiring both laboratory- and human populationbased studies.

\section*{DDE, DDT \& PBBs}
- Dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene (DDE) exposure through breast milk may alter duration of lactation by acting through the estrogen receptor
- DDE exposures prenatally may have potential effects on adolescent growth and sexual maturation
- Dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane (DDT) might be connected to breast cancer
- Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and accelerated onset of puberty

Studies performed in North Carolina (US) and Northern Mexico showed a statistically significant association between DDE levels in breast milk, maternal serum, and cord blood and duration of lactation. It was thought that DDE acts through an estrogen receptor to oppose prolactin activity (for normal milk production, estrogen falls and prolactin rises) and interfere with milk synthesis.
In a US study, it was found that the higher the DDE exposure prenatally, the taller and heavier boys were at 14 years of age. There was no effect on when pubertal milestones were reached.
CB-153 and DDE in semen of 149 Swedish fishermen from the eastern Baltic coast had a high proportion of Y-chromosome bearing semen. Also high levels of persistent organic pollutants in blood.
Higher prevalence of chryptorchidism in Lithuania. Environmental factors may be changing the ratio of sperm carrying the X or Y (sex determining) chromosomes and may be contributing to male reproductive disorders
Exposure to p,p'-DDT early in life may increase breast cancer risk. Many U.S. women heavily exposed to DDT in childhood have not yet reached 50 years of age. The public health significance of DDT exposure in early life may be large.

\section*{REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS: HUMANS}
* High exposure case studies provide greatest evidence for adverse human effects (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls, diethylstilbestrol)

Inconclusive data related to low dose, chronic exposures
* Though may be most relevant!

Lack of data from developing nations
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-65.jpg?height=407&width=497&top_left_y=737&top_left_x=1214)

Certain environmental contaminants, specifically endocrine disruptors, may lead to adverse reproductive health effects in humans. A majority of the reproductive health effects of endocrine disruptors in humans have been witnessed through high exposure scenarios (for instance, the Seveso incident). For this reason, the research concerning low dose exposures is much less conclusive. However, low level exposures may potentially pose the greatest health threat for chronically exposed populations. Even small shifts in reproductive patterns may result in tremendous impacts for the population at large.
Data from human epidemiologic studies and case studies remain predominantly from North America and Canada. Exposures from the developing world are much less documented, though could potentially be more significant and impact vulnerable populations.
Specific examples of reproductive health endpoints resulting from exposures to endocrine disruptors will be explained in modules $2,3,4$, and 5.

\section*{LIMITATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE ON ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS}

Studies examining reproductive effects of low levels of endocrine disruptors in humans are inconclusive

However, high level exposures provide evidence of human susceptibility to endocrine disruptor effects

Research needs:
$\dot{\star}$ Effects of low level exposures
*Effects of early-life exposures to adult reproductive health
*Dose-response relationships
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-66.jpg?height=525&width=392&top_left_y=655&top_left_x=1284)
* Exposure during life-cycle and for future generations

The current state of the knowledge regarding endocrine disruptors and their mechanism of action demands greater research. While a few high level exposure studies have found an association between exposures to potentially endocrine disrupting chemicals and adverse reproductive health effects, the exact mechanism of action for many of these compounds of poorly understood

\section*{TOWARDS THE FUTURE}

\section*{The importance of research on reproductive health and environment}
- Consideration and study of environmental factors in reproductive diseases key for:
- developing new prevention strategies
- decreasing disease prevalence and severity
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_1997976d6e568456f182g-67.jpg?height=286&width=360&top_left_y=531&top_left_x=1371)
- Increased understanding of the mechanisms through which environmental agents disrupt organs/systems will help improve prevention and treatment strategies.
- Benefits from research will translate into better health for men and women, and yield findings that will benefit everybody

REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
}
K.KINYUA

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO RH}
- A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity in all matters related to the reproductive system, its function and processes.
- Basic elements:
- Ability - to reproduce, regulate fertility and enjoy healthy relationships
- Success - result in child survival, growth and health development
- Safety - Fertility regulation, pregnancy and child health

\section*{Components of Reproductive health}
1. Safe motherhood - Pre/Peri/Postnatal care, breast feeding and neonatal care
2. Family planning information and services
3. Prevention and management of infertility and sexual dysfunction in both males and females
4. Prevention and management of complications of abortion
5. Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections especially STDs including HIV/AIDS
6. Early detection of cancer of the cervix and breast
7. Menopause - Prevention of osteoporosis, atherosclerosis
8. Gender based violence

\section*{SCOPE OF RH}
1. Family planning counselling,
2. Safe motherhood; education, and service for healthy pregnancy, safe delivery and postnatal care
3. Care of new born
4. Prevention and management of complications of abortion

\section*{Scope of RH}
5. Information, education, and counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood for individuals, couples, and adolescent
6. Prevention and management of sub fertility
7. Life-cycle issues including breast cancer, cancer of the reproductive system and care of the elderly

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF RH}
- Reproductive health is a right
$\square$ lead a responsible and satisfied sex life.
$\square$ to reproduce and freedom to decide when and how often to do so
$\square$ to be informed about advantages, possible risks and side effects of contraceptives
$\square$ to have free, equal access to safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable method of fertility regulation.
$\square$ to get access to appropriate health service of good quality to go through safe pregnancy and child

\section*{Major obstetric causes of maternal mortality}
1. Hemorrhage - Pre/Peri/Postnatal
2. Sepsis
3. Pregnancy induced hypertension (especially in primigravida)
4. Unsafe abortion
5. Obstructed labor

\section*{Maternal Mortality definition}
- "A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of the pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes."
- Causes of maternal mortality maybe direct or indirect

\section*{Direct Causes of Maternal Death}
- These result from obstetric complications of pregnancy, labour and the puerperium and from interventions or any after effects of these events.
- The Five major causes of direct maternal deaths in order of frequency are:
- Haemorrhage,
- Sepsis,
- Hypertensive disorders,
- Complications of abortion and
- obstructed labour

\section*{Indirect causes of Maternal Deaths}
- They result from previously existing disease or disease that develops during pregnancy which was not due to direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.
- The major causes of indirect maternal deaths in our set up include:
- Malaria,
- HIV/AIDS, and
- anemia.

\section*{Maternal Morbidity}
- For every woman who dies another 30 suffer long term injuries and illness due to pregnancy and childbirth related complications.
- Maternal morbidity is any symptom or condition resulting from or made worse by pregnancy.
- Severe maternal morbidity (Near Miss) is defined as: "any pregnant or recently delivered woman (within six weeks after termination of pregnancy or delivery), in whom immediate survival is threatened and who survives by chance or because of the hospital care she receives."

\section*{Underlying causes of Maternal \& Neonatal Mortality (The three delays)}
- There are three distinct levels of delay which contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality: (Thadaseus and Maine, 1994):
1. Delay in deciding to seek appropriate care. This could be due to: socio-cultural barriers, Failure to recognize danger signs, failure to perceive severity of illness, and cost considerations
2. Delay in reaching an appropriate health care facility. This is due to: long distance to a facility, poor condition of roads, lack of transportation and cost considerations
3. Delay in receiving adequate emergency care at the facility. This may be due to: Shortage of staff, supplies and basic equipment; unskilled personnel, user fees among others.

Timeliness of interventions is imperative if adverse maternal and newborn outcomes are to be averted.

\section*{Status of Interventions to Reduce Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in Kenya}
- Approximately 9 out of 10 (92\%) of all pregnant women in Kenya attend antenatal care at least once from a health care provider and 56\% make four or more ANC visits.
- However, only about $44 \%$ of all deliveries are attended to by a skilled health provider.
- In fact since 1990, delivery by skilled attendants has progressively declined in Kenya.
- Majority of births are therefore occurring at home with no skilled care (KDHS, 2008/9).

\section*{Status of Interventions to Reduce Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in Kenya..}
- Among women who deliver outside the health facility, a vast majority (6 out of 10) do not receive postnatal care.
- Only 42 percent attend postnatal care within two days of delivery, (KDHS 2008/9).
- This is despite the fact that majority of maternal deaths occur during the postpartum period.

\section*{The Kenya Maternal and Newborn Health (MNH) Pillars}
1. Family planning and pre-pregnancy care- To ensure that individuals and couples have the information and services to plan the timing, number and spacing of pregnancies.
2. Focused Antenatal Care - To prevent complications where possible and ensure that complications of pregnancy are detected early and treated appropriately.
3. Essential Obstetric Care - To ensure that essential care for the high-risk pregnancies and complications is made available to all women who need it.
4. Essential Newborn Care - To ensure that essential care is given to newborns from the time they are born up to 28 days in order to prevent complications that may arise after birth.
5. Targeted Postpartum Care- To prevent any complication occurring after childbirth and ensure that both mother and baby are healthy and there is no transmission of infection from mother to child.
6. Post Abortion Care - to provide clinical treatment to all women and girls seeking care, for complications of incomplete abortion and miscarriage as well as counselling and contraceptives.
(Note that HIV PMTCT services are now integrated into ALL the pillars of 08/28/2MNH and clean and safe delivery is part of Essential Obstetric Care)

\section*{Skilled Attendance}
- Evidence has shown that there are 2 key interventions that improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality, namely:
* Skilled attendance at delivery (skills, numbers, enabling environment) and
* availability of Emergency Obstetric Care.
- The term "skilled attendant" refers exclusively to people with midwifery skills (e.g. doctors, midwives, nurses, clinical officers) who have been trained to proficiency in the skills necessary to manage normal deliveries and diagnose or refer obstetric complications.

\section*{Enabling Environment}
- To ensure effective and efficient service delivery, the skilled attendant requires an enabling environment.
- There is need for appropriate infrastructure as well as ensuring that the continuum of care is connected by an effective referral system, and supported by adequate supplies, equipment, drugs, good management and supportive supervision.

\section*{Referral Systems}
- A key aspect in ensuring a good maternal health service is a functional referral system.
- Access to a telephone and/or vehicle, with emergency funds or fuel to transfer urgent cases day or night is extremely important.
- Good record keeping and use of detailed referral letters will assist in reducing delay in the care for women with obstetric emergencies and severely ill newborns.
- The referring unit should be aware of the capacity of the referral point to manage the client being referred.

\section*{Community Action, Partnerships}
- Involving community members (particularly women and their families, health care providers, and local leaders) in efforts to improve maternal health helps to ensure programme success;
- Community education about obstetric complications and when and where to seek medical care is important to ensure birth planning/ use of birth preparedness cards, early recognition of complications and prompt care-taking behaviour

\section*{Male involvement and participation}
- it is evident that for successful programme implementation, male participation in MNH results in good outcomes for both mother and baby.
- Male involvement and participation is critical in addressing the first and second delay.
- In the Kenyan context, men have the resources and are the main decision makers in the families and communities on issues relating to MNH .

\section*{Equity for All}
- Rights based perspective helps legitimise prioritisation of women's health.
- It focuses attention on social, economic and geographic inequities.
- Strong political support and national ownership are essential to create enabling policies to attract resources for maternal and newborn health and to ensure those resources reach groups with the highest maternal mortality and morbidity.

\section*{Reproductive Rights}
- Health care providers should appreciate that most maternal and neonatal deaths are avoidable, and therefore maternal and newborn health must be given its due prominence.
- Safe Motherhood is a basic human right as women are entitled to enjoy a safe pregnancy and childbirth.

\section*{Emergency Obstetric Care}
- Emergency Obstetric Care refers to a set of minimal health care elements, which should be availed to all women during pregnancy and delivery.
- It includes both life saving and emergency measures e.g. Caesarean section, manual removal of placenta, etc, as well as non-emergency measures (e.g. use of the partograph to monitor labour, active management of the third stage of labour, etc.).
- Emergency Obstetric Care functions are generally categorized as Basic Emergency Obstetric Care (BEmOC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric care (CEmOC).

\section*{Basic Emergency Obstetric Care includes:}
1. Administration of IV antibiotics.
2. Administration of magnesium sulphate.
3. Administration of parental oxytocics.
4. Performing manual removal of the placenta.
5. Performing removal of retained products.
6. Performing assisted vaginal delivery (e.g. by vacuum extraction).
7. Performing newborn resuscitation

\section*{Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care}
- includes all the seven above, PLUS:
8. Performing surgery (Caesarean section), including provision of emergency obstetric anaesthesia.
9. Administration of blood transfusion.

\section*{CLIENT RIGHTS}
1. Right to Information
- All members of the community have a right to information on the benefits of reproductive health including Maternal and Newborn health for themselves and their families. They also have a right to information on how to access the services.
2. Right to Access
- All members of the community have a right to receive services from reproductive health / MNH programs, regardless of their socioeconomic status, political affiliations, religious beliefs, ethnic origin, marital status or geographical location. Access includes freedom from barriers such as policies, standards and practices, which are not scientifically justifiable.
3. Right of choice
- Individuals and couples have the right to decide freely where to obtain RH /MNH services.
4. Right to safety
- Clients have a right to safety in the practice of MNH
5. Right to Privacy
- Clients have a right to privacy while holding conversation with service providers and while undergoing physical examination.

\section*{Client rights}
6. Right to Confidentiality
- The client should be assured that any information she/he provides or any details of the service received will not be communicated to other parties without her/his consent.
7. Right to Dignity
- Reproductive Health /MNH clients have a right to be treated with courtesy, consideration, and attentiveness and with full respect of their dignity regardless of their level of education, social status or any other characteristics, which would single them out or make them vulnerable to abuse.
8. Right to Comfort
- Clients have a right to comfort when receiving services. This can be ensured by providing quality services in hygienically safe and conveniently located service delivery sites.
9. Right to Continuity of Care
- Clients have a right to receive services and reliable supply of RH /MNH commodities and drugs for as long as they need them.
10. Right of Opinion
- Clients have a right to express their views freely on the services they receive.

\section*{PROVIDERS' RIGHTS}
1. Training
- To continuously have access to the knowledge and skills needed to perform all the tasks required of them.
2. Information
- To be kept informed on issues related to their duties
3. Infrastructure
- To have appropriate physical facilities and organization to provide services at an acceptable level of quality.
4. Supplies
- To receive continuous and reliable supplies and materials required for providing reproductive health services at acceptable standards of quality.
5. Guidance
- To receive clear, relevant and objective guidance.

\section*{Providers rights}
6. Back up
- To be reassured that whatever the level of care at which they are working they will receive support from other individuals or units.
7. Respect
- To receive recognition of their competence and potential, and respect for their human needs.
8. Encouragement
- To be given stimulus in the development of their potential, initiative and creativity.
9. Feedback
- To receive feedback concerning their competence and attitudes as judged by others.
10. Self-expression
- To express their views freely, concerning the quality and efficiency of the reproductive health program.

\section*{THE SAFE MOTHERHOOD INITIATIVE}
- The Global Safe Motherhood Initiative launched in Nairobi in 1987 aimed at reducing the burden of maternal deaths and ill health in developing countries.
- The Safe Motherhood Initiative differed from other health initiatives in that it focused on the well being of women as an end in itself.
- In the SMI, the prevention of the death of a pregnant woman is considered to be the key objective, not because death adversely affects children and other family members but because women are intrinsically valuable (Thaddeus and Maine 1994).
- It underscored the fact that Safe motherhood is a basic human right

\end{tabular}

\section*{International Conference for Population and Development (ICPD)}
- The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo recommended to the international community a set of important population and development objectives.
- The Programme of Action was striking for the attention it devoted to the issue of women's health.
- It also included goals with regard to education, especially for girls, and for the further reduction of infant, child and maternal mortality levels.
- For Kenya, the ICPD recommendations were then translated into the National Reproductive Health Strategy (NRHS 1997 2010) and implementation plan whose goal was to reduce maternal, perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
- Another event that followed the ICPD was the Millennium Declaration in 2000 and the development of goals (MDGs) with indicators.

\section*{National Reproductive Health Policy 2007}
- The goal of the RH policy is to enhance the Reproductive Health status of all Kenyans through:
- Increased equitable access to RH services
- Improved quality, efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery at all levels
- Improved responsiveness to clients needs
- The main objective for Safe Motherhood in this RH Policy is to reduce maternal, perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in Kenya

National Reproductive Health Strategy (NRHS): 2009-2015
- This is a revision of the NRHS 19972010 and includes issues and challenges that had not been incorporated in the original strategy.
- The revision was also necessary in order to align it to the National RH Policy 2007.

\section*{The National Health Sector Strategic Plan (NHSSP II)-2005-2010}
- The aim of NHSSP II is to reverse the decline in the health status of Kenyans through an efficient, high quality health care system that is accessible, equitable and affordable for every Kenyan household.
- A major feature of the NHSSP is the introduction of the Kenya Essential Package for Health (KEPH), which focuses on the health needs of individuals through the six stages of the human life cycle.
- The strategic plan emphasizes strong community involvement in health care through the community Strategy

\section*{The KEPH Life-Cycle Cohorts}
- They are delineated in the NHSSP II as follows
- Cohort 1:-Pregnancy, delivery and the newborn child (up to 2 weeks of age)
- Cohort 2:- Early childhood (3 weeks to 5 years)
- Cohort 3:- Late childhood (6-12 years)
- Cohort 4:- Adolescence (13-24 years)
- Cohort 5:- Adulthood (25-59 years)
- Cohort 6:- Elderly (60 years and over)

\section*{Levels of Care in KEPH}
- The KEPH approach is not only limited to a definition of the target groups in terms of life-cycle cohorts.
- It also defines where the health services will be delivered.
- Under KEPH, promotive, preventive and curative services are provided at six levels of care:
- Level 6 : tertiary hospitals
- Level 5: secondary hospitals
- Level 4: primary hospitals
- Level 3: health centres, maternity, nursing homes
- Level 2: dispensaries / clinics
- Level 1: villages/household/families/individuals

\section*{NB}
- As a result of the implementation of the constitution of Kenya 2010, health functions have been devolved to the county.
- In the structure, County Health Services are organized around three levels of care:
- Community,
- Primary care, and

08/28/02/Referral services.

\section*{Annual Operational Plans (AOPs)}
- The Annual Operational Plans (AOPs) translate Kenya Essential Package for Health and the National Health Sector Strategic Plan II 2005-2010 into 'actionable' operational plans.
- AOPs also improve the planning process within the Ministry in particular highlighting the need for
- Improved coordination and decision-making
- Elimination of duplication of activities and
- More efficient use of available resources

\section*{The Community Strategy}
- The community-based approach, is the mechanism through which households and communities take an active role in health and health-related development issues.
- Initiatives outlined in the approach target the major priority health and related problems affecting all cohorts of life at the community and household levels level 1 of the KEPH-defined service delivery.

\section*{Vision 2030}
- Kenya Vision 2030 is the country's new development blueprint covering the period 2008 to 2030.
- The vision is based on three "pillars" namely;
- the economic pillar,
- the social pillar and
- the political pillar.
- Health is part of the social pillar.
- To improve the overall livelihoods of Kenyans, the country aims to provide an efficient and high quality health care system with the best standards.
- This is in order to reduce health inequalities and improve indicators in key areas where Kenya is lagging, especially in lowering infant and maternal mortality.

\section*{Vision 2030}
- Specific strategies include:
- provision of a robust health infrastructure network;
- improving the quality of health service delivery to the highest standards and promotion of partnerships with the private sector.
- In addition the Government has put in place health financing mechanisms to make quality MNH services affordable and accessible to all especially the poor and vulnerable women.
- These include the provision of free MNH /FP services at the lower levels, National Health Insurance Fund (NSSF), Health Sector Support Fund (HSSF), Hospital Management Support Fund (HMSF), FIF, Voucher system /Output Based Aid (OBA).
- The government is also encouraging initiatives that promote community based health financing.

\section*{ASSIGNMENT:READ OTHER POLICIES}
1. The Kenya Constitution (2010) calls for the highest attainable standard for health including reproductive health for all Kenyans
2. The Kenya Health Policy (2014-30) commits to strengthening the health care system and service delivery.
3. Kenya Health Sector Strategic and Investment Plan (2014-18) (MOH 2014A, B, MOH 2012).
4. Free Maternity Care
5. Elimination of User Fee for Public Primary Health Care Services,
6. Beyond Zero campaign.
7. Kenya RMNCAH investment framework

\section*{Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)}
$\square$ MDGs were set by all Government leaders at the UN Millennium Summit, September 2000)
- All UN organisations decided to be guided by MDGs in their future action: unity of purpose, coherent action, synergies and strategic approaches by the UN system as a whole (guided by CEB)
Leaders pledged to strive, individually and collectively, towards these goals through international, regional and national action, concerted by the UN.

\section*{Why the MDGs ?}

The 1990s was a decade of faltering progress on:
- Under-5 mortality rate
- Maternal mortality rate
- Child malnutrition
- Water and sanitation
- Income poverty
- Primary education

MDGs were meant to accelerate progress

\section*{Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)}
- Goal 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
- Goal 2. Achieve universal primary education
- Goal 3. Promote gender equality and empower women
- Goal 4. Reduce child mortality
- Goal 5. Improve maternal health
- Goal 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases
- Goal 7. Ensure environmental sustainability
- Goal 8. Develop a Global Partnership for Development

\section*{MDGS related to RH}
*Goal 3 Promote gender equality \& empower women
* Goal 4 Reduce child mortality by 2015 the no at 1990
* Goal 5 Improve maternal health

\section*{MDGs Related to RH 2008/09}
- MDG5 was to improve maternal health with a target of reducing MMR by 75\% between 1990 and 2015.
- For this to be attained there is need for a $5.5 \%$ decline in MMR annually from 1990.
- However, globally the reported annual percentage decline in MMR between 1990 and 2008 was only $2.3 \%$.
- Among countries with an MMR $\geq 100$ in 1990, it is evident that 30 countries have made insufficient or no progress.
- This list includes 23 countries from sub- Saharan Africa (WHO...Trends in Maternal mortality 1990-2008).
- Sadly Kenya is among these countries with an MMR of 488 per 100,000 live births, with some regions reporting MMRs of over 1000 per 100000 live births. (KDHS 2008/09)

\section*{MDGs Related to RH}
- To accelerate progress towards MDG 5, the UN Secretary-General in 2010launched the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health which elements include:
- Country-led health plans,
- a comprehensive, integrated package of essential interventions and services,
- Health systems strengthening,
- Health workforce capacity building, and
- coordinated research and innovation.

\section*{MDGs Related to RH}
- Kenya developed the national RH training plan whose goal is to ensure that health personnel have the knowledge, technical skills and positive attitude, to handle reproductive health issues within a comprehensive and integrated system.

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 infant mortality rate}
- The KDHS 2014 shows a decrease in the infant mortality rate from 52 to 39 per 1,000 live births, and a decrease in the under-five mortality rate from 74 to 52 per 1,000 live births between 2008 and 2014.
- These declines have been driven mainly by:
- Enhanced use of mosquito nets,
- Increases in antenatal care,
- skilled attendance at childbirth,
- Postnatal care,
- Contraceptive use,
- exclusive breastfeeding practices and
- a decrease in unmet family planning (FP) needs,
- as well as overall improvements in other social indicators such as education and access to water

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 neonatal mortality rate}
- The NMR declined from 31 per 1,000 births to 22 per 1,000 live births between 20082014.
- However, during the past decade, the NMR exhibited the slowest decline.
- Further reductions in infant and child mortality require steeper decline in the NMR, which is closely linked to improvements in maternal health services including intrapartum care.

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 maternal health}
- The MMR of 362 per 100,000 live births estimated by KDHS in 2014 is still high
- Coverage/utilization indicators also show some improvements but much more needs to be done to address inequities and to reach Universal Health Care(UHC).
- The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR, any method) among married women has increased to 58\% in 2014 from 46\% in 2008/9 with a decline in unmet need for FP.
- Nearly two thirds (61\%) of births took place in a health facility and 62\% of pregnant women were delivered by a skilled attendant.
- Postnatal care (PNC) increased from $42 \%$ in 2009 to $51 \%$ in 2014
- The total fertility rate has declined from 4.6 in 2008/9 to 3.9 in 2014; however, there has been no change in teen pregnancy with one in five ( $18 \%$ ) adolescents in the 15-19 years age group having started child bearing due to early marriage, high unmet need for contraception and poor access to FP services.

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014}
- Nutritional status of children under-five has improved with a decline in stunting from 35\% in 2008/9 to 26\% in 2014.
- However, one out of every four children still remains shorter for their age, a factor that adversely affects their future health, well-being and economic productivity.
- Nearly half (48\%) of households have access to an insecticide treated net;
- $53 \%$ of women and $46 \%$ of men were tested for HIV in the past 12 months and received the test results.
- Overall immunization coverage for basic vaccines increased from 65.3 percent 2008/9 to 71.3 percent in 2014 and coverage for measles, pentavalent and pneumococcal vaccine remained high.
- Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among children under 6 months has nearly doubled from 32 percent to 61 percent

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 summary key points}
- Child mortality has declined by over $20 \%$ since 2008 and the country achieved a total fertility rate (TFR) of less than four.
- Stunting, which remained stubbornly high over the past two decades, has started to decline.
- Six out of ten pregnant women now receive skilled care at childbirth and over half get postnatal care.
- However, despite this progress, Kenya could not achieve maternal and child health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)

\section*{Six Elements of the SDGs}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b10189afdc32462f0be2g-66.jpg?height=1376&width=1946&top_left_y=369&top_left_x=306)

\section*{What is new and different about the 17 SDGs?}
1. these Goals apply to every nation ... and every sector. Cities, businesses, schools, organizations, all are challenged to act. This is called Universality
2. the Goals are all inter-connected, in a system. We cannot aim to achieve just one Goal. We must achieve them all. This is called Integration
3. achieving these Goals involves making very big, fundamental changes in how we live on Earth. This is called Transformation

\section*{SDGs}
$\square$ The vision is for the goals to promote sustainable development and poverty eradication.
$\square$ The first 16 goals address priority areas that:
$\checkmark$ Increase the ambition/ improving and sustaining current achievements on existing MDG goals (poverty, health education, gender) with added dimensions on
$\checkmark$ Economic sustainability (inclusive growth, jobs, infrastructure, industrialization)
$\checkmark$ Environmental sustainability (climate change, oceans and land based ecosystems, sustainable consumption and production)
$\checkmark$ All held together by the glue of 'peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development' (governance agenda, rule of law, violence).
$\square$ The $17^{\text {th }}$ goal covers means of implementation (finance, otrade, technology, capacity building, partnerships, and

\section*{The SDGs versus MDGs}

Key Strengths of the proposed SDGs include:-
$\square$ The notion of leaving no one behind - with many targets aspiring zero/fully coverage (raising the ambition of the MDGs)

Stand alone goal of Inequality (within and between countries)
$\checkmark$ Stand alone goal on gender inequality, including ending of all forms of violence, discrimination, child marriages, and female genital mutilations

\section*{The SDGs versus MDGs}
- Environmental issues are strongly represented - fulfilling a long sought marriage between development and environment (climate change, marine and land base ecosystems, and sustainable consumption and production)
- Governance - for the first time - incorporating a goal and targets on governance and peaceful societies (legal identity, tackling corruption and bribery etc)
- Participatory/Inclusiveness Process in formulation of the SDGs: The participation and buy in of a wide range of stakeholders including member states and non governmental organizations
- The broad nature of the SDG is also a reflection of the nature of challenges facing the world today

\section*{From the MDGs to the SDGs}
- Formulating the SDGs: Member state driven process - shared seats representing 70 member states from five UN groups
- Proposals for the SDGs: universal -all countries, all people, including those excluded remaining after MDGs
- Expand MDG agenda: poverty, food, land, jobs, youth, health, population dynamics, water, sanitation, energy, growth, trade, vulnerable countries, cities, transport, SCP, forests, oceans, biodiversity, finance, technology

\section*{From the MDGs to the SDGs}
- SDGs: provide concrete and simple form to post 2015 development agenda
- SDGs: concentrate, galvanize action
- SDGs: provide for a new commitment period coming decades
- SDGs: new global partnerships and voluntary commitments, innovative finance
- SDGs: broader people and planet goals than MDGs, bolder targets, more national differentiation
- SDGs/P2015: draw on inputs of all stakeholders

\section*{KENYA SDG Targets for RH}

\section*{Kenya RMNCAH investment framework (January 2016)}
- The Kenya RMNCAH investment framework sets ambitious targets to increase:
1. skilled deliveries to $87 \%$,
2. $4+$ ANC visits to $69 \%$,
3. full immunization to $76 \%$,
4. contraceptive use by currently married women in reproductive age to $73 \%$, and
5. pregnant women tested for HIV who received results and post-test counseling to 75\% by 2020 from the baselines of the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2014 with enhanced focus on quality of services.
- It also aims to reduce stunting to $19 \%$, teenage pregnancy to $11 \%$, and contribute to decrease in neonatal mortality to $18 \%$.
- The absolute number of deaths of children under-five years is projected to reduce from 77,761 to 48,590 and maternal from 5,453 to 3,276 between 2014/15 and 2019/20.
- Finally, the framework aims to ensure that at least three out of four births will be registered, thereby providing more robust denominators to effectively plan and monitor RMNCAH service delivery.

\section*{How Kenya aim to monitor \& achieve SDGs for RH}

Kenya RMNCAH investment framework
- Progress on improvements in quality, productivity and efficiency will be tracked through strengthened routine data, independent surveys, and implementation research of innovations.
- Impact and outcome level indicators in reducing neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality rates, and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) will be tracked through population based surveys such as the KDHS.

\section*{How Kenya aim to monitor \& achieve SDGs for RH}

\section*{Kenya RMNCAH investment framework}
- The proposed Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) helps to identify and register maternal deaths, and support appropriate actions to be implemented to prevent them.
- Active citizens' participation and feedback, independent verification and progress reviews will be used to track achievements of the investments made in RMNCAH.
- Strengthening Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) will be an essential intervention to inform better planning and enhance accountability to results.
- It is estimated that implementation of the framework will require an increase in current annual per capita public expenditures on RMNCAH from Kenyan Shillings (KSH) 1,033 (US\$10.87) in 2015/16 to KSH 1,306 (US\$ 13.75) by 2019/20. An additional KSH 59 billion (US\$ 617 million) will be required to 08/2address the financing gap.

\section*{DEVOLUTION in achieving SDGs related to RH}
- Kenya has introduced an ambitious devolution initiative, which could help to address the major demand and supply side challenges.
- National RMNCAH serve as a guide for the development and implementation of county RMNCAH implementation plans, which will be an integral part of County Integrated Development Plans and aligned with the County Health Strategic and Investment Plans.

\section*{Areas to improve on}
- Devolution has the potential to address inequities and to enhance accountability.
- Increased government spending is necessary to scale-up interventions but ensuring effective coverage with an equity focus is critical to improve health outcomes.
- Effective partnerships are critical for success as fragmented financing and governance cause high transaction costs, hindering effective harmonization at the country level.
- Integration can optimize the efficient use of resources and reduce duplication and wastage.
- Incentives are effective in changing and influencing behavior of providers and users to improve health outcomes.
- Political commitment has been key to improved RMNCAH outcomes in all countries that have made progress on MDGs 4 and 5

\section*{INNOVATION AND RESEARCH}
- The following research questions have been identified by MOH:
- What are the factors that contribute to poor health seeking behaviors for RMNCAH services?
- What are the most cost effective models that can promote male involvement?
- What are the factors contributing to non-adherence to standard operating procedures and guidelines by health care providers in both private and public sectors?
- what is the impact of comprehensive RMNCAH training on the competency and skills of providers?
- Does task sharing work; if not, what are key barriers?
- What is the impact of current RMNCAH behavior change communication interventions?
- How effective are the different service delivery models, social media and mobile technologies in delivering adolescent sexual and reproductive health?
- What is the impact of maternal shelters?
- What are the mechanisms to get real time feedback from adolescents on health services (satisfaction with services)?

\begin{abstract}
Summary
These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were updated by CDC after consultation with professionals knowledgeable in the field of STIs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, June 11-14, 2019. The information in this report updates the 2015 guidelines. These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}

The term "sexually transmitted infection" (STI) refers to a pathogen that causes infection through sexual contact, whereas the term "sexually transmitted disease" (STD) refers to a recognizable disease state that has developed from an infection. Physicians and other health care providers have a crucial role in preventing and treating STIs. These guidelines are intended to assist with that effort. Although the guidelines emphasize treatment, prevention strategies and diagnostic recommendations also are discussed.

This report updates Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2015 (1) and should be regarded as a source of clinical guidance rather than prescriptive standards. Health care providers should always consider the clinical circumstances of each person in the context of local disease prevalence. These guidelines are applicable to any patient care setting that serves persons at risk for STIs, including family planning clinics, HIV care clinics, correctional health care settings, private physicians' offices, Federally Qualified Health Centers, clinics for adolescent care, and other primary care facilities. These guidelines are focused on treatment and counseling and do not address other community services and interventions that are essential to STI and HIV prevention efforts.

These STI treatment guidelines complement Recommendations for Providing Quality Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinical Services, 2020 (2) regarding quality clinical services for STIs in primary care and STD specialty care settings. This guidance specifies operational determinants of quality services in various clinical settings, describes on-site treatment and partner services, and indicates when STI-related conditions should be managed through consultation with or referral to a specialist.

\section*{Methods}

These guidelines were developed by CDC staff who worked with subject matter experts with expertise in STI clinical management from other federal agencies, nongovernmental academic and research institutions, and professional medical organizations. CDC staff identified governmental and nongovernmental subject matter experts on the basis of their expertise and assisted them in developing questions to guide individual literature reviews. CDC staff informed the subject matter experts that they were being consulted to exchange information and observations and to obtain their individual input. All subject matter experts disclosed potential conflicts of interest. STI Treatment Guidelines, 2021, Work Group members are listed at the end of this report.

In 2018, CDC staff identified key questions about treatment and clinical management to guide an update of the 2015 STD treatment guidelines (1). To answer these questions and synthesize new information available since publication of the 2015 guidelines, subject matter experts and CDC staff
collaborated to conduct systematic literature reviews by using an extensive MEDLINE database evidence-based approach for each section of the 2015 guidelines (e.g., using English-language published abstracts and peer reviewed journal articles). These systematic reviews were focused on four principal outcomes of STI therapy for each disease or infection: 1) treatment of infection on the basis of microbiologic eradication; 2) alleviation of signs and symptoms; 3) prevention of sequelae; and 4) prevention of transmission, including advantages (e.g., cost-effectiveness, single-dose formulations, and directly observed therapy) and disadvantages (e.g., adverse effects) of specific regimens. The outcome of the literature reviews guided development of background materials, including tables of evidence from peer-reviewed publications summarizing the type of study (e.g., randomized controlled trial or case series), study population and setting, treatments or other interventions, outcome measures assessed, reported findings, and weaknesses and biases in study design and analysis.
In June 2019, the subject matter experts presented their assessments of the literature reviews at an in-person meeting of governmental and nongovernmental participants. Each key question was discussed and pertinent publications were reviewed in terms of strengths, weaknesses, and relevance. Participants evaluated the quality of evidence, provided their input, and discussed findings in the context of the modified rating system used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). The discussions were informal and not structured to reach consensus. CDC staff also reviewed the publications from other professional organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF, the American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). The discussion culminated in a list of participants' opinions on all the key STI topic areas for consideration by CDC. (More detailed descriptions of the key questions, search terms, systematic search, evidence tables, and review process are available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/ default.htm).
CDC staff then independently reviewed the tables of evidence prepared by the subject matter experts, individual comments from the participants and professional organizations, and existing guidelines from other organizations to determine whether revisions to the 2015 STD treatment guidelines were warranted. CDC staff ranked evidence as high, medium, and low on the basis of each study's strengths and weaknesses according to the USPSTF ratings (https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce. org/uspstf/us-preventive-services-task-force-ratings). CDC staff then developed draft recommendations that were peer reviewed by public health and clinical experts as defined by the Office of

Management and Budget for influential scientific information. A public webinar was held to provide an overview of the draft recommendations and invite questions and comments on the draft recommendations. The peer review comments, webinar, questions, and responses were considered by CDC staff in developing the final recommendations for the updated STI treatment guidelines. Recommendations for HIV, hepatitis C, cervical cancer screening, STI screening in pregnancy, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, and hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination were developed after CDC staff reviewed existing published recommendations. The Englishlanguage literature was searched periodically by CDC staff to identify subsequently published articles warranting consideration.

Throughout this report, the evidence used as the basis for specific recommendations is discussed briefly. Publication of comprehensive, annotated discussions of such evidence is planned in a supplemental issue of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases after publication of the treatment guidelines. When more than one therapeutic regimen is recommended and the listed regimens have similar efficacy and similar rates of intolerance or toxicity, the recommendations are listed alphabetically. If differences are specified, regimens are prioritized on the basis of these differences. Recommended regimens should be used primarily; alternative regimens can be considered in instances of notable drug allergy or other medical contraindications to the recommended regimens. Alternative regimens are considered inferior to recommended regimens on the basis of available evidence regarding the principal outcomes and disadvantages of the regimens.

\section*{Clinical Prevention Guidance}

Prevention and control of STIs are based on the following five major strategies (3):
1. Accurate risk assessment and education and counseling of persons at risk regarding ways to avoid STIs through changes in sexual behaviors and use of recommended prevention services
2. Pre-exposure vaccination for vaccine-preventable STIs
3. Identification of persons with an asymptomatic infection and persons with symptoms associated with an STI
4. Effective diagnosis, treatment, counseling, and followup of persons who are infected with an STI
5. Evaluation, treatment, and counseling of sex partners of persons who are infected with an STI

\section*{STI and HIV Infection Risk Assessment}

Primary prevention of STIs includes assessment of behavioral risk (i.e., assessing the sexual behaviors that can place persons at risk for infection) and biologic risk (i.e., testing for risk markers for STI and HIV acquisition or transmission). As part of the clinical encounter, health care providers should routinely obtain sexual histories from their patients and address risk reduction as indicated in this report. Guidance for obtaining a sexual history is available at the Division of STD Prevention resource page (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/resources. htm) and in the curriculum provided by the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Centers (https://www. nnptc.org). Effective interviewing and counseling skills, characterized by respect, compassion, and a nonjudgmental attitude toward all patients, are essential to obtaining a thorough sexual history and delivering effective prevention messages. Effective techniques for facilitating rapport with patients include using open-ended questions (e.g., "Tell me about any new sex partners you've had since your last visit" and "What has your experience with using condoms been like?"); understandable, nonjudgmental language (e.g., "What gender are your sex partners?"and "Have you ever had a sore or scab on your penis?"); and normalizing language (e.g., "Some of my patients have difficulty using a condom with every sex act. How
is it for you?"). The "Five P's" approach to obtaining a sexual history is one strategy for eliciting information about the key areas of interest (Box 1). In addition, health care professionals can consider assessing sexual history by asking patients such questions as, "Do you have any questions or concerns about your sexual health?" Additional information about gaining cultural competency when working with certain populations (e.g., gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men [MSM]; women who have sex with women [WSW] or with women and men [WSWM]; or transgender men and women or adolescents) is available in sections of these guidelines related to these populations.

In addition to obtaining a behavioral risk assessment, a comprehensive STI and HIV risk assessment should include STI screening as recommended in these guidelines because STIs are biologic markers of risk, particularly for HIV acquisition and transmission among certain MSM. In most clinical settings, STI screening is an essential and underused component of an STI and HIV risk assessment. Persons seeking treatment or evaluation for a particular STI should be screened for HIV and other STIs as indicated by community prevalence and individual risk factors (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Syphilis). Persons should be informed about all the tests for STIs they are receiving and notified about tests for common STIs (e.g., genital herpes,

BOX 1. The Five P's approach for health care providers obtaining sexual histories: partners, practices, protection from sexually transmitted infections, past history of sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy intention

\section*{1. Partners}
- "Are you currently having sex of any kind?"
- "What is the gender(s) of your partner(s)?"

\section*{2. Practices}
- "To understand any risks for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), I need to ask more specific questions about the kind of sex you have had recently."
-"What kind of sexual contact do you have or have you had?"
- "Do you have vaginal sex, meaning 'penis in vagina' sex?"
- "Do you have anal sex, meaning 'penis in rectum/anus' sex?"
- "Do you have oral sex, meaning 'mouth on penis/vagina'?"

\section*{3. Protection from STIs}
- "Do you and your partner(s) discuss prevention of STIs and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)?"
- "Do you and your partner(s) discuss getting tested?"
- For condoms:
o "What protection methods do you use? In what situations do you use condoms?"

\section*{4. Past history of STIs}
- "Have you ever been tested for STIs and HIV?"
- "Have you ever been diagnosed with an STI in the past?"
- "Have any of your partners had an STI?"

\section*{Additional questions for identifying HIV and viral hepatitis risk:}
- "Have you or any of your partner(s) ever injected drugs?"
- "Is there anything about your sexual health that you have questions about?"

\section*{5. Pregnancy intention}
- "Do you think you would like to have (more) children in the future?"
- "How important is it to you to prevent pregnancy (until then)?"
- "Are you or your partner using contraception or practicing any form of birth control?"
- "Would you like to talk about ways to prevent pregnancy?"
trichomoniasis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and HPV) that are available but not being performed and reasons why they are not always indicated. Persons should be informed of their test results and recommendations for future testing. Efforts should be made to ensure that all persons receive STI care regardless of personal circumstances (e.g., ability to pay, citizenship or immigration status, gender identity, language spoken, or specific sex practices).

\section*{STI and HIV Infection Prevention Counseling}

After obtaining a sexual history from their patients, all providers should encourage risk reduction by offering prevention counseling. Prevention counseling is most effective if provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner appropriate to the patient's culture, language, sex and gender identity, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. Prevention counseling for STIs and HIV should be offered to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have received an STI diagnosis, have had an STI during the previous year, or have had multiple sex partners. USPSTF recommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for STIs and HIV (4). Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, is directed at a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies. One such approach, known as client-centered STI and HIV prevention counseling, involves tailoring a discussion of risk reduction to the person's situation. Although one large study in STI clinics (Project RESPECT) demonstrated that this approach was associated with lower acquisition of curable STIs (e.g., trichomoniasis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) (5), another study conducted 10 years later in the same settings but different contexts (Project AWARE) did not replicate this result (6).
With the challenges that intensive behavioral counseling poses, health care professionals might find brief prevention messages and those delivered through video or in a group session to be more accessible for the client. A review of 11 studies evaluated brief prevention messages delivered by providers and health counselors and reported them to be feasible and to decrease subsequent STIs in STD clinic settings (7) and HIV care settings (8). Other approaches use motivational interviewing to move clients toward achievable risk-reduction goals. Clientcentered counseling and motivational interviewing can be used effectively by clinicians and staff trained in these approaches. CDC provides additional information on these and other effective behavioral interventions at https://www.cdc.gov/ std/program/interventions.htm. Training in client-centered counseling and motivational interviewing is available through
the STD National Network of Prevention Training Centers (https://www.nnptc.org).

In addition to one-on-one STI and HIV prevention counseling, videos and large group presentations can provide explicit information concerning STIs and reducing disease transmission (e.g., how to use condoms consistently and correctly and the importance of routine screening). Groupbased strategies have been effective in reducing the occurrence of STIs among persons at risk, including those attending STD clinics (9). Brief, online, electronic-learning modules for young MSM have been reported to be effective in reducing incident STIs and offer a convenient client platform for effective interventions (10). Because the incidence of certain STIs, most notably syphilis, is higher among persons with HIV infection, use of client-centered STI counseling for persons with HIV continues to be encouraged by public health agencies and other health organizations (https://www.cdc.gov/ std/statistics/2019/default.htm). A 2014 guideline from CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Institutes of Health recommends that clinical and nonclinical providers assess a person's behavioral and biologic risks for acquiring or transmitting STIs and HIV, including having sex without condoms, having recent STIs, and having partners recently treated for STIs (https://stacks.cdc.gov/ view/cdc/44064). That federal guideline is for clinical and nonclinical providers to offer or make referral for regular screening for multiple STIs, on-site STI treatment when indicated, and risk-reduction interventions tailored to the person's risks. Brief risk-reduction counseling delivered by medical providers during HIV primary care visits, coupled with routine STI screening, has been reported to reduce STI incidence among persons with HIV infection (8). Other specific methods have been designed for the HIV care setting (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/effective-interventions/index.html).

\section*{Primary Prevention Methods}

\section*{Pre-Exposure Vaccination}

Pre-exposure vaccination is one of the most effective methods for preventing transmission of HPV, HAV, and HBV, all of which can be sexually transmitted. HPV vaccination is recommended routinely for males and females aged 11 or 12 years and can be administered beginning at age 9 years. HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for those not previously vaccinated (11). Sharing clinical decisionmaking about HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged $27-45$ years who are not adequately vaccinated in accordance with existing guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated, uninfected persons who are sexually active with more than one partner or are being evaluated or treated for an STI (12). In addition, hepatitis $A$ and $B$ vaccines are recommended for MSM, persons who inject drugs, persons with chronic liver disease, and persons with HIV or hepatitis C infections who have not had hepatitis A or hepatitis B (12). HAV vaccine is also recommended for persons who are homeless (13). Details regarding HAV and HBV vaccination, including routine childhood vaccination, are available at https://www.cdc.gov/ hepatitis and at the ACIP website (https://www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/index.html).

\section*{Condoms}

\section*{External Condoms}

When used consistently and correctly, external latex condoms, also known as male condoms, are effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection (http:// www.ashasexualhealth.org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms. pdf). In heterosexual HIV mixed-status relationships (i.e., those involving one infected and one uninfected partner) in which condoms were used consistently, HIV-negative partners were 71\%-80\% less likely to become infected with HIV, compared with persons in similar relationships in which condoms were not used (14,15). Two analyses of MSM mixed-status couple studies estimated the protective effect of condom use to be $70 \%$ and $91 \%$, respectively (16,17). Moreover, studies demonstrate that consistent condom use reduces the risk for other STIs, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and trichomoniasis (18-21). By limiting lower genital tract infections, condoms also might reduce the risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) among women (22). In addition, consistent and correct use of latex condoms reduces the risk for HPV infection and HPV-associated diseases, genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid when the infected area or site of potential exposure is covered (23-27). Additional information is available at https://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/index.html and www.factsaboutcondoms.com/professional.php. Condoms are regulated as medical devices and are subject to random sampling and testing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Each latex condom manufactured in the United States is tested electronically for holes before packaging. The rate of condom breakage during sexual intercourse and withdrawal in the United States is approximately two broken condoms per 100 condoms. Rates of breakage and slippage might be slightly higher during anal intercourse $(28,29)$. The failure of condoms to protect against STIs or unintended pregnancy usually results from inconsistent or incorrect use rather than condom breakage (30). Users should check the expiration or manufacture date
on the box or individual package. Latex condoms should not be used beyond their expiration date or $>5$ years after the manufacturing date. Condoms made of materials other than latex are available in the United States and can be classified into two general categories: 1) polyurethane, polyisoprene, or other synthetic condoms and 2) natural membrane condoms.

Polyurethane external condoms provide protection against STIs and HIV and pregnancy comparable to that of latex condoms (20,31). These can be substituted for latex condoms by persons with latex sensitivity, are typically more resistant to deterioration, and are compatible with use of both oil-based and water-based lubricants. The effectiveness of other synthetic external condoms to prevent STIs has not been extensively studied, and FDA labeling restricts their recommended use to persons who are sensitive to or allergic to latex. Natural membrane condoms (frequently called natural skin condoms or [incorrectly] lambskin condoms) are made from lamb cecum and can have pores up to $1,500 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter. Although these pores do not allow the passage of sperm, they are more than 10 times the diameter of HIV and more than 25 times that of HBV. Moreover, laboratory studies demonstrate that sexual transmission of viruses, including HBV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and HIV, can occur with natural membrane condoms (31). Therefore, natural membrane condoms are not recommended for prevention of STIs and HIV.

Providers should advise that condoms must be used consistently and correctly to be effective in preventing STIs and HIV while noting that any condom use is better than no condom use. Providing instructions about the correct use of condoms can be useful. Communicating the following recommendations can help ensure that patients use external condoms correctly:
- Use a new condom with each sex act (i.e., oral, vaginal, and anal).
- Carefully handle the condom to avoid damaging it with fingernails, teeth, or other sharp objects.
- Put the condom on after the penis is erect and before any genital, oral, or anal contact with the partner.
- Use only water-based or silicone-based lubricants (e.g., K-Y Jelly, Astroglide, AquaLube, or glycerin) with latex condoms. Oil-based lubricants (e.g., petroleum jelly, shortening, mineral oil, massage oils, body lotions, or cooking oil) can weaken latex and should not be used; however, oil-based lubricants typically can be used with polyurethane or other synthetic condoms.
- Ensure adequate lubrication during vaginal and anal sex, which might require using exogenous water-based lubricants.
- Hold the condom firmly against the base of the penis during withdrawal, and withdraw while the penis is still erect to prevent the condom from slipping off.

Additional information about external condoms is available at https://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness.

\section*{Internal Condoms}

Condoms for internal vaginal use, also known as female condoms, are available worldwide (e.g., the FC2 Female Condom, Reddy condom, Cupid female condom, and Woman's condom) $(31,32)$. Use of internal condoms can provide protection from acquisition and transmission of STIs, although data are limited. Internal condoms are more costly compared with external condoms; however, they offer the advantage of being controlled by the receptive partner as an STI and HIV prevention method, and the newer versions might be acceptable to all persons. Although the internal condom also has been used during receptive anal intercourse, efficacy associated with this practice remains unknown (33). Additional information about the internal condom is available at http://www.ashasexualhealth. org/pdfs/Male_and_Female_Condoms.pdf.

\section*{Cervical Diaphragms}

In observational studies, diaphragm use has been demonstrated to protect against cervical gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis (34). However, a trial examining the effect of a diaphragm plus lubricant on HIV acquisition among women in Africa reported no additional protective effect when compared with the use of male condoms alone. Likewise, no difference by study arm in the rate of acquisition of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or herpes occurred $(35,36)$. Diaphragms should not be relied on as the sole source of protection against HIV and other STIs.

\section*{Multipurpose Prevention Technologies}

Methods that combine STI and HIV prevention with pregnancy prevention are known as multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) (37) (https://www.who.int/ reproductivehealth/topics/linkages/mpts/en). Internal and external condoms are both examples of MPTs because they are effective prevention measures when used correctly for STI and HIV transmission or pregnancy prevention. The multicenter Evidence for Contraception Options and HIV Outcomes (ECHO) trial observed no statistically significant differences in HIV incidence rates among women randomly assigned to one of three contraceptive methods (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA], levonorgestrel implant, and coppercontaining intrauterine device [IUD]); however, rates of HIV infection were high in all groups, indicating a need for MPTs (38). Development of MPTs is complex and ongoing; products under study include microbicides with contraceptive devices (e.g., tenofovir with a vaginal ring contraceptive delivery package) and other innovative methods (39).

\section*{Topical Microbicides and Spermicides}

Nonspecific topical microbicides are ineffective for preventing HIV infection (40-45). Tenofovir gel has been studied for prevention of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and HIV infections (46,47). Adherence can be low (48), and prevention of HIV infection, especially among women, has not been demonstrated (47,49).Vaginal rings containing dapivirine have provided some reduction in HIV infection $(50,51)$. For men and transgender women who have anal intercourse, tenofovir gel appears safe when applied before and after anal sex (52). Spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9) might disrupt genital or rectal epithelium and have been associated with an increased risk for HIV infection. Condoms with N-9 are no more effective than condoms without N-9; therefore, N-9 alone or in a condom is not recommended for STI and HIV prevention (40). N-9 use also has been associated with an increased risk for bacterial urinary tract infections among women $(53,54)$.

\section*{Nonbarrier Contraception, Female Surgical Sterilization, and Hysterectomy}

Contraceptive methods that are not mechanical barriers offer no protection against HIV or other STIs. The ECHO study observed no differences in HIV incidence rates among women randomly assigned to DMPA, levonorgestrel implant, or copper-containing IUD contraceptive methods (38). A systematic review of epidemiologic evidence reported that the majority of studies demonstrated no association between use of oral contraceptives and HIV acquisition among women (55). Whether hormonal contraception alters a woman's risk for other STIs is uncertain $(56,57)$.

Sexually active women who use contraceptive methods other than condoms should be counseled about STI and HIV infection prevention measures. These include pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), limiting the number of sex partners, and correct and consistent use of condoms.

\section*{Emergency Contraception}

Unprotected intercourse exposes women to risks for STIs and unplanned pregnancy. Providers should offer counseling about the option of emergency contraception if pregnancy is not desired. Options for emergency contraception in the United States include copper-containing IUDs and emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) $(58,59)$. More information is available at https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-bulletin/articles/2015/09/emergency-contraception?utm_ source=redirect\&utm_medium=web\&utm_campaign=otn. ECPs are available in the following formulations: ulipristal
acetate in a single dose ( 30 mg ) available by prescription, levonorgestrel in a single dose ( 1.5 mg ) available over the counter or by prescription, or a combined estrogen and progestin pill regimen. Insertion of a copper-containing IUD $\leq 5$ days after unprotected sex can reduce pregnancy risk from a sex act by approximately $99 \%$ (60). ECPs are most efficacious when initiated as soon as possible after unprotected sex. Ulipristal acetate is effective $\leq 5$ days after unprotected sex, and levonorgestrel is most effective $\leq 3$ days after unprotected sex but has some efficacy at $\leq 5$ days. ECPs are ineffective (but not harmful) if the woman is already pregnant (61). A 2019 Cochrane review summarized the efficacy, safety, and convenience of different emergency contraception methods (61).
More information about emergency contraception is available in Contraceptive Technology, 21st Edition (31), in the 2016 U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations (U.S. SPR) for Contraceptive Use (emergency contraception) available at https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/ $\mathrm{mmwr} / \mathrm{spr} /$ emergency.html, and in the 2016 U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (U.S. MEC) for Contraceptive Use (copper IUDs for emergency contraception) available at https:// www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/mmwr/mec/ appendixj.html.
Providers should educate males and females about emergency contraception, especially if other methods of contraception were used incorrectly or not at all and pregnancy is not desired (62). An advance supply of ECPs can be provided or prescribed so that ECPs will be available when needed (59).

\section*{Male Circumcision}

Male circumcision reduces the risk for HIV infection and certain STIs among heterosexual men. Three randomized, controlled trials performed in regions of sub-Saharan Africa, where generalized HIV epidemics involving predominantly heterosexual transmission were occurring, demonstrated that male circumcision reduces the risk for HIV acquisition among men by $50 \%-60 \%$ (63-65). In those trials, circumcision also was protective against other STIs, including high-risk genital HPV infection and genital herpes (66-68). Follow-up studies have demonstrated sustained benefit of circumcision for HIV prevention (69) and that the effect is not mediated solely through a reduction in HSV-2 infection or genital ulcer disease (GUD) (70).
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) recommend that male circumcision efforts be scaled up as an effective intervention for preventing heterosexually acquired HIV infection (71) in countries with hyperendemic and generalized HIV epidemics within the context of ensuring universal access to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support
(https://www.afro.who.int/publications/voluntary-medical-male-circumcision-hiv-prevention). In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that newborn male circumcision be available to families that desire it because the benefits of the procedure, including prevention of penile cancers, urinary tract infections, GUD, and HIV infection, outweigh the risks. ACOG has also endorsed AAP's policy statement. In light of these benefits, the American Urological Association states that male circumcision should be considered an option for risk reduction, among other strategies (72). Additional information for providers counseling male patients and parents regarding male circumcision for preventing HIV, STIs, and other adverse health outcomes is available at https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/ male-circumcision.html.
No definitive data exist to determine whether male circumcision reduces HIV acquisition among MSM, although one meta-analysis of 62 observational studies reported that circumcision was protective against HIV acquisition in low- to middle-income countries but not in high-income countries (73). Further studies are needed to confirm any potential benefit of male circumcision for this population.

\section*{Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV}

Daily oral antiretroviral PrEP with a fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and either tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) have demonstrated safety (74) and a substantial reduction in the rate of HIV acquisition for MSM (75). TDF/FTC has demonstrated safety and efficacy for mixed-status heterosexual couples (76) and heterosexual men and women recruited individually (77); however, no evidence is yet available regarding TAF/ FTC among heterosexually active women. In addition, one clinical trial involving persons who inject drugs (78) and one involving heterosexual mixed-status couples (76) demonstrated substantial efficacy and safety of daily oral PrEP with TDF alone. High adherence to oral PrEP was strongly associated with protection from HIV infection. Studies conducted with MSM have demonstrated that taking PrEP at specific times before and after sexual intercourse was effective in preventing HIV; however, less experience exits with this regimen, it is not FDA cleared, and it has not been studied among other populations (79).
Comprehensive clinical practice guidelines are available for providers in prescribing PrEP to reduce the risk for HIV infection (80). Among HIV-negative sexually active men and women, bacterial STIs are key indicators of risk for HIV acquisition. Studies have documented the risk for HIV acquisition among MSM within 1 year after infection with rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia (one in 15 men ), primary or secondary syphilis (one in 18), and among men with no
rectal STI or syphilis infection (one in 53) (81-83). Sexually active adults and adolescents should be screened for STIs (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis) in accordance with recommendations, and persons with infection should be offered PrEP. The USPSTF recommends that persons at risk for HIV acquisition be offered $\operatorname{PrEP}$ (84). Persons at risk for HIV acquisition include HIV-negative persons whose sexual partner or partners have HIV infection (especially if viral load is detectable or unknown), persons who have had gonorrhea or syphilis during the previous 6 months, and injecting drug users who share injection equipment (84). Clinical practice guidelines recommend STI screening for persons taking PrEP (80) because increased rates of STI acquisition have been described (85-87).

\section*{Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for STIs}

Providing HSV treatment to persons with HIV and HSV infection has not demonstrated benefit in reducing HIV acquisition among uninfected partners. A large randomized controlled trial evaluated mixed-status heterosexual couples among the partners with HIV infection who also were seropositive for HSV-2 (88). Use of acyclovir had no effect on HIV transmission. These findings are consistent with a previous trial that reported no benefit of acyclovir in preventing HIV acquisition among persons seropositive for HSV-2 (89).

Doxycycline prophylaxis has been examined for preventing bacterial STIs. In a pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with previous syphilis (two or more episodes since HIV diagnosis) were randomly assigned to doxycycline 100 mg for 48 weeks versus a financial incentive-based behavioral intervention (90). That study demonstrated a 73\% reduction in any bacterial STI at any site, without substantial differences in sexual behavior. Additional studies examining doxycycline prophylaxis are under way or in development (91).

\section*{Postexposure Prophylaxis for HIV and STIs}

Guidelines for using PEP aimed at preventing HIV and other STIs as a result of sexual exposure are available at https://www. cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/programresources/cdc-hiv-npep-guidelines. pdf. Sexually active persons seeking HIV PEP should be evaluated for PrEP after completing their PEP course and testing negative for HIV. HIV PEP is also discussed elsewhere in this report (see Sexual Assault and Abuse and STIs). Genital hygiene methods (e.g., vaginal washing and douching) after sexual exposure are ineffective in protecting against HIV and STIs and might increase the risk for bacterial vaginosis (BV), certain STIs, and HIV infection (92).

STI PEP in the form of doxycycline 200 mg taken after unprotected anal sex has been studied among MSM and transgender women; results demonstrated reduction in incident
chlamydia and syphilis by $70 \%$ and $73 \%$, respectively, but no effect on gonorrhea (93). Other studies are under way or in development regarding doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial STIs (91). No long-term data are available regarding the impact of STI PEP on antimicrobial resistance and the microbiome. Further studies are needed to determine whether STI PEP is an effective and beneficial strategy for STI prevention.

\section*{HIV Treatment as Prevention: Antiretroviral Treatment of Persons with HIV to Prevent HIV Among Partners}

In 2011, the randomized controlled trial HPTN 052 demonstrated that, among HIV mixed-status heterosexual couples, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the infected partner decreased the risk for transmission to the uninfected partner by $96 \%$ (94). Therefore, ART not only is beneficial to the health of persons with HIV infection, it also reduces the risk for transmission. Additional studies of HIV mixed-status couples, heterosexual and MSM couples (PARTNER study), and MSM couples (Opposites Attract and PARTNERS2 studies) reported that patients with HIV taking ART who maintain an undetectable viral load demonstrate no risk for transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative sex partners (95-97). For those reasons, ART should be offered to all persons with HIV infection to obtain viral suppression. Detailed guidance regarding ART regimens is available in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' HIV treatment guidelines (98).

\section*{HIV Seroadaptive Strategies}

Seroadaptive strategies for HIV prevention have largely originated within communities of MSM. They are predicated on knowledge of self and partner HIV status. One specific seroadaptive practice is serosorting, which includes limiting anal sex without a condom to partners with the same HIV status as their own or choosing to selectively use condoms with HIV mixed-status partners. Another practice among mixed-status couples is seropositioning, in which the person with HIV infection is the receptive partner for anal intercourse. Observational studies have consistently reported that serosorting confers greater risk for HIV infection than consistent condom use but has lower risk compared with anal intercourse without a condom and without serosorting (99101). Serosorting practices have been associated with increased risk for STIs, including chlamydia and gonorrhea (102,103).

Serosorting is not recommended for the following reasons: many MSM who have HIV infection do not know they have HIV because they have not been tested recently, men's assumptions about the HIV status of their partners might be wrong, and some men with HIV infection might not disclose or might misrepresent their HIV status. All of these factors increase
the risk that serosorting can lead to HIV infection. Serosorting has not been studied among heterosexually active persons.

\section*{Abstinence and Reduction of Number of Sex Partners}

Abstinence from oral, vaginal, and anal sex and participating in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship with a partner known to be uninfected are prevention approaches to avoid transmission of STIs. For persons who are being treated for an STI (or whose partners are undergoing treatment), counseling that encourages abstinence from sexual intercourse until completion of the entire course of medication is vital for preventing reinfection. A trial conducted among women regarding the effectiveness of counseling messages when patients have cervicitis or vaginal discharge demonstrated that women whose sex partners have used condoms might benefit from a hierarchical message that includes condoms but women without such experience might benefit more from an abstinence-only message (104). A more comprehensive discussion of abstinence and other sexual practices that can help persons reduce their risk for STIs is available in Contraceptive Technology, 21st Edition (31).

\section*{Partner Services}

The term "partner services" refers to a continuum of clinical evaluation, counseling, diagnostic testing, and treatment designed to increase the number of infected persons brought to treatment and to reduce transmission among sexual networks. This continuum includes efforts of health departments, medical providers, and patients themselves. The term "public health partner services" refers to efforts by public health departments to identify the sex and needle-sharing partners of infected persons to ensure their medical evaluation and treatment. Health departments are increasingly incorporating referral to additional services, as indicated, into the partner services continuum. Aside from the general benefit to patients and partners, service referrals and linkage can mitigate the circumstances that increase risk for future STI and HIV acquisition.
The types and comprehensiveness of public health partner services and the specific STIs for which they are offered vary by public health agency, their resources, and the geographic prevalence of STIs. In most areas of the United States, health departments routinely attempt to provide partner services to all persons with infectious syphilis (primary or secondary) and persons with a new diagnosis of HIV infection. Health departments should provide partner services for persons who might have cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea. In contrast, relatively few U.S. health departments routinely provide STI partner services to persons with gonorrhea, chlamydia,
trichomoniasis, or other STIs (105). Because STI diagnoses often can serve as risk markers for HIV acquisition (83), public health services might include follow-up of MSM with an STI to offer HIV PrEP. Public health services can also include HIV and STI prevention interventions including HIV and STI testing, linkage and relinkage of persons with HIV infection to HIV care clinics, and referral of partners of persons with STIs or HIV infection to HIV PrEP, as indicated (106-109). Clinicians should familiarize themselves with public health practices in their area; however, in most instances, providers should understand that responsibility for discussing the treatment of partners of persons with STIs rests with the diagnosing provider and the patient. State laws require a good faith effort by the provider to inform partners, and providers should familiarize themselves with public health laws.

Clinicians who do not notify partners of patients directly can still provide partner services by counseling infected persons and providing them with written information and medication to give to their partners (if recommended and allowable by state law), directly evaluating and treating sex partners, and cooperating with state and local health departments. Clinicians' efforts to ensure treatment of patients' sex partners can reduce the risk for reinfection and potentially diminish transmission of STIs (110). Therefore, clinicians should encourage all persons with STIs to notify their sex partners and urge them to seek medical evaluation and treatment. Exceptions to this practice include circumstances posing a risk for intimate partner violence (111). Available data are limited regarding the rate of intimate partner violence directly attributable to partner notification (112,113); however, because of the reported prevalence of intimate partner violence in the general population (114), providers should consider the potential risk before notifying partners of persons or encouraging partner notification. Time spent counseling patients about the importance of notifying partners is associated with improved notification outcomes (115). When possible, clinicians should advise persons to bring their primary sex partner with them when returning for treatment and should concurrently treat both persons. Although this approach can be effective for a main partner (116,117), it might not be a feasible approach for additional sex partners. Evidence indicates that providing patients with written information to share with sex partners can increase rates of partner treatment (110).

Certain health departments now use technology (e.g., email, texting, mobile applications, and social media outlets) to facilitate partner services for locating and notifying the sex partners of persons with STIs, including HIV $(118,119)$. Patients now have the option to use Internet sites to send anonymous email or text messages advising partners of their exposure to an STI (120); anonymous notification via the

Internet is considered better than no notification at all. However, because the extent to which these sites affect partner notification and treatment is uncertain, patients should be encouraged to notify their partners in person or by telephone, email, or text message; alternatively, patients can authorize a medical provider or public health professional to notify their sex partners.

\section*{Expedited Partner Therapy}

Expedited partner therapy (EPT) is a harm-reduction strategy and the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of persons with diagnosed chlamydia or gonorrhea, who are unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment, by providing medications or prescriptions to the patient as allowable by law. Patients then provide partners with these therapies without the health care provider having examined the partner (https:// www.cdc.gov/std/ept). Unless prohibited by law or other regulations, medical providers should routinely offer EPT to patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure that all of a patient's sex partners from the previous 60 days will seek timely treatment. If the patient has not had sex during the 60 days before diagnosis, providers should offer EPT for the patient's most recent sex partner. Because EPT must be an oral regimen and current gonorrhea treatment involves an injection, EPT for gonorrhea should be offered to partners unlikely to access timely evaluation after linkage is explored. EPT is legal in the majority of states but varies by chlamydial or gonococcal infection. Providers should visit https://www.cdc.gov/std/ept to obtain updated information for their state. Providing patients with packaged oral medication is the preferred approach because the efficacy of EPT using prescriptions has not been evaluated, obstacles to EPT can exist at the pharmacy level $(121,122)$, and many persons (especially adolescents) do not fill the prescriptions provided to them by a sex partner (123,124). Medication or prescriptions provided for EPT should be accompanied by educational materials for the partner, including treatment instructions, warnings about taking medications (e.g., if the partner is pregnant or has an allergy to the medication), general health counseling, and a statement advising that partners seek medical evaluation as soon as possible for HIV infection and any symptoms of STIs, particularly PID.

Evidence supporting EPT is based on three U.S. clinical trials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia or gonorrhea (125-127). All three trials reported that more partners were treated when patients were offered EPT. Two reported statistically significant decreases in the rate of reinfection, and one observed a lower risk for persistent or recurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant. A fourth trial in the United Kingdom did not demonstrate a
difference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of partners treated between persons offered EPT and those advised to notify their sex partners (128). U.S. trials and a meta-analysis of EPT revealed that the magnitude of reduction in reinfection of index patients, compared with patient referral, differed according to the STI and the sex of the index patient (110,125-127). However, across trials, reductions in chlamydia prevalence at follow-up were approximately $20 \%$, and reductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50\% at follow-up.

Existing data indicate that EPT also might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis; however, no partner management intervention has been reported to be more effective than any other in reducing trichomoniasis reinfection rates $(129,130)$. No data support use of EPT in the routine management of patients with syphilis.

Data are limited regarding use of EPT for gonococcal or chlamydial infections among MSM, compared with heterosexuals $(131,132)$. Published studies, including recent data regarding extragenital testing, indicated that male partners of MSM with diagnosed gonorrhea or chlamydia might have other bacterial STIs (gonorrhea or syphilis) or HIV (133-135). Studies have reported that 5\% of MSM have a new diagnosis of HIV when evaluated as partners of men with gonococcal or chlamydial infections (133,134); however, more recent data indicate that, in certain settings, the frequency of HIV infection is much lower (135). Considering limited data and potential for other bacterial STIs among MSM partners, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT is recommended. All persons who receive bacterial STI diagnoses and their sex partners, particularly MSM, should be tested for HIV, and those at risk for HIV infection should be offered HIV PrEP (https://www. cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/risk/prep/cdc-hiv-prep-guidelines-2017.pdf).

\section*{Reporting and Confidentiality}

Accurate and timely reporting of STIs is integral to public health efforts in assessing morbidity trends, allocating limited resources, and assisting local health authorities with partner notification and treatment. STI and HIV/AIDS cases should be reported in accordance with state and local statutory requirements. Syphilis (including congenital syphilis), gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, and HIV are reportable diseases in every state. Because the requirements for reporting other STIs differ by state, clinicians should be familiar with the reporting requirements applicable within their jurisdictions.

Reporting can be provider based, laboratory based, or both. Clinicians who are unsure of state and local reporting requirements should seek advice from state or local health department STI programs. STI and HIV reports are kept confidential. In most jurisdictions, such reports are protected
by statute or regulation. Before conducting a follow-up of a person with a positive STI test result, public health professionals should consult the patient's health care provider, if possible, to inform them of the purpose of the public health visit, verify the diagnosis, determine the treatments received, and ascertain the best approaches to patient follow-up.

\section*{Retesting After Treatment to Detect Repeat Infections}

Retesting 3 months after diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis can detect repeat infection and potentially can be used to enhance population-based prevention (136,137). Any person who has a positive test for chlamydia or gonorrhea, along with women who have a positive test for trichomonas, should be rescreened 3 months after treatment. Any person who receives a syphilis diagnosis should undergo follow-up serologic syphilis testing per current recommendations and follow-up testing for HIV (see Syphilis). Additional information regarding retesting is available elsewhere in this report (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Syphilis; Trichomoniasis).

\section*{STI Detection Among Special Populations}

\section*{Pregnant Women}

Intrauterine or perinatally transmitted STIs can have debilitating effects on pregnant women, their fetuses, and their partners. All pregnant women and their sex partners should be asked about STIs, counseled about the possibility of perinatal infections, and provided access to recommended screening and treatment, if needed.
Recommendations for screening pregnant women for STIs to detect asymptomatic infections are based on disease severity and sequelae, prevalence among the population, costs, medicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. The following screening recommendations for pregnant women summarize clinical guidelines from federal agencies and medical professional organizations.

\section*{Screening Recommendations}

\section*{HIV Infection}

All pregnant women in the United States should be tested for HIV at the first prenatal visit, even if they have been previously tested (138). Testing pregnant women for HIV and prompt linkage to care of women with HIV infection are vital for women's health and reducing perinatal transmission of

HIV through ART and obstetrical interventions. HIV testing should be offered as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests (i.e., opt-out testing). For women who decline HIV testing, providers should address their concerns and, when appropriate, continue to encourage testing. Partners of pregnant patients should be offered HIV testing if their status is unknown (139).
Retesting in the third trimester (preferably before 36 weeks' gestation) is recommended for women at high risk for acquiring HIV infection. Examples of women at high risk include those who inject drugs, have STIs during pregnancy, have multiple sex partners during pregnancy, have a new sex partner during pregnancy, or have partners with HIV infection; those who are receiving care in health care facilities in settings with HIV incidence $\geq 1$ per 1,000 women per year; those who are incarcerated; those who live in areas with high rates of HIV infection; or those who have signs or symptoms of acute HIV infection (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, oral ulcers, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or transaminase elevation) (140).
Rapid HIV testing should be performed for any woman in labor who has not been tested for HIV during pregnancy or whose HIV status is unknown, unless she declines. If a rapid HIV test result is positive, ART should be administered without waiting for the results of confirmatory testing (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/ default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf).

\section*{Syphilis}

During 2012-2019, congenital syphilis rates in the United States increased from 8.4 to 48.5 cases per 100,000 births, a $477.4 \%$ increase (141). At least 45 states have a prenatal syphilis testing requirement, with high variability among those requirements (142). In the United States, all pregnant women should be screened for syphilis at the first prenatal visit, even if they have been tested previously (143). Prenatal screening for syphilis has been reported to be suboptimal in the United States $(144,145)$. Testing in the third trimester and at delivery can prevent congenital syphilis cases (146,147). Partners of pregnant women with syphilis should be evaluated, tested, and treated.
When access to prenatal care is not optimal, a stat rapid plasma reagin (RPR) card test and treatment, if that test is reactive, should be administered at the time that a pregnancy is confirmed or when the pregnancy test is performed, if follow-up is uncertain. Pregnant women should be retested for syphilis at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery if the mother lives in a community with high syphilis rates or is at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs or has an STI during pregnancy, having multiple sex partners, having a new sex partner, or having a sex partner with an STI). Neonates should not be discharged from the hospital unless
the syphilis serologic status of the mother has been determined at least once during pregnancy. Any woman who delivers a stillborn infant should be tested for syphilis.

\section*{Hepatitis B}

All pregnant women should be routinely tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) at the first prenatal visit even if they have been previously vaccinated or tested (148). Women who are HBsAg positive should be provided with, or referred for, counseling and medical management. Women who are HBsAg negative but at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. Women who were not screened prenatally, those who engage in behaviors that put them at high risk for infection (e.g., having had more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months, having been evaluated or treated for an STI, having had recent or current injection drug use, or having an HBsAg -positive sex partner), and those with clinical hepatitis should be tested at the time of admission to the hospital for delivery. To avoid misinterpreting a transient positive HBsAg result during the 21 days after vaccination, HBsAg testing should be performed before vaccine administration. All laboratories that conduct HBsAg tests should test initially reactive specimens with a licensed neutralizing confirmatory test. When pregnant women are tested for HBsAg at the time of admission for delivery, shortened testing protocols can be used, and initially reactive results should prompt expedited administration of immunoprophylaxis to neonates (148). Pregnant women who are HBsAg positive should be reported to the local or state health department to ensure that they are entered into a case-management system and that timely and age-appropriate prophylaxis is provided to their infants. Information concerning the pregnant woman's HBsAg status should be provided to the hospital where delivery is planned and to the health care provider who will care for the newborn. In addition, household and sexual contacts of women who are HBsAg positive should be vaccinated.

\section*{Chlamydia}

All pregnant women aged $<25$ years as well as older women at increased risk for chlamydia (e.g., those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) should be routinely screened for Chlamydia trachomatis at the first prenatal visit (149). Pregnant women who remain at increased risk for chlamydial infection also should be retested during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the neonate. Pregnant women identified as having chlamydia should be treated immediately and have a test of cure to document chlamydial eradication by a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) 4 weeks after treatment. All persons
diagnosed with a chlamydial infection should be rescreened 3 months after treatment.

\section*{Gonorrhea}

All pregnant women aged $<25$ years as well as women aged $\geq 25$ years at increased risk for gonorrhea (e.g., those with other STIs during pregnancy or those with a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI or is exchanging sex for money or drugs) should be screened for Neisseria gonorrhoeae at the first prenatal visit (149). Pregnant women who remain at high risk for gonococcal infection also should be retested during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and gonococcal infection in the neonate. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and might choose to consult local public health authorities for guidance on identifying groups that are more vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis of local disease prevalence. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated among specific geographic locations and communities (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/default. htm). Pregnant women identified as having gonorrhea should be treated immediately. All persons diagnosed with gonorrhea should be rescreened 3 months after treatment.

\section*{Hepatitis C Virus}

The rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has increased among pregnant women in recent years (150-153). HCV screening should be performed for all pregnant women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the HCV infection (HCV positivity) rate is $<0.1 \%$ (154-156). The most important risk factor for HCV infection is past or current injecting drug use (157). Additional risk factors include having had a blood transfusion or organ transplantation before July 1992, having received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987, having received an unregulated tattoo, having been on long-term hemodialysis, having other percutaneous exposures, or having HIV infection. All women with HCV infection should receive counseling, supportive care, and linkage to care (https://www.hcvguidelines.org). No vaccine is available for preventing HCV transmission.

\section*{Cervical Cancer}

Pregnant women should undergo cervical cancer screening and at the same frequency as nonpregnant women; however, management differs slightly during pregnancy (158). Colposcopy is recommended for the same indications during pregnancy as for nonpregnant women. However, biopsies may be deferred, and endocervical sampling should not be performed. Treatment should not be performed during pregnancy unless cancer is detected.

\section*{Bacterial Vaginosis, Trichomoniasis, and Genital Herpes}

Evidence does not support routine screening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery (159). Symptomatic women should be evaluated and treated (see Bacterial Vaginosis). Evidence does not support routine screening for Trichomonas vaginalis among asymptomatic pregnant women. Women who report symptoms should be evaluated and treated (see Trichomoniasis). In addition, evidence does not support routine HSV-2 serologic screening among asymptomatic pregnant women. However, type-specific serologic tests might be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk for HSV-2 infection and for guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital herpes during pregnancy. Routine serial cultures for HSV are not indicated for women in the third trimester who have a history of recurrent genital herpes.

For more detailed discussions of STI screening and treatment among pregnant women, refer to the following references: Screening for HIV Infection: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement (138); Recommendations for the Use of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant Women with HIV Infection and Interventions to Reduce Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/ files/inline-files/PerinatalGL.pdf); Guidelines for Perinatal Care (160); Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (12); Screening for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement (149); Screening for Bacterial Vaginosis in Pregnant Persons to Prevent Preterm Delivery: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement (159); Screening for Syphilis Infection in Pregnant Women: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement (161); Serologic Screening for Genital Herpes Infection: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement (162); Screening for HIV Infection in Pregnant Women: A Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (163); Screening for Hepatitis B in Pregnant Women: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (164); and CDC Recommendations for Hepatitis C Screening Among Adults United States, 2020 (156).

\section*{Adolescents}

In the United States, prevalence rates of certain STIs are highest among adolescents and young adults (141). For example, reported rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea are highest among females during their adolescent and young adult years, and many persons acquire HPV infection during that time.

Persons who initiate sex early in adolescence are at higher risk for STIs, as are adolescents living in detention facilities; those receiving services at STD clinics; those who are involved in commercial sex exploitation or survival sex and are exchanging sex for drugs, money, food, or housing; young males who have sex with males (YMSM); transgender youths; and youths with disabilities, substance misuse, or mental health disorders. Factors contributing to increased vulnerability to STIs during adolescence include having multiple sex partners, having sequential sex partnerships of limited duration or concurrent partnerships, failing to use barrier protection consistently and correctly, having lower socioeconomic status, and facing multiple obstacles to accessing health care $(141,165)$.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia explicitly allow minors to consent for their own STI services. No state requires parental consent for STI care, although the age at which a minor can provide consent for specified health care services (i.e., HPV vaccination and HIV testing and treatment) varies among states. In 2019, a total of 18 states allowed but did not require physicians to notify parents of a minor's receipt of STI services, including states where minors can legally provide their own consent to the service (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/ law/states/minors.html).

Protecting confidentiality for STI care, particularly for adolescents enrolled in private health insurance plans, presents multiple problems. After a claim has been submitted, many states mandate that health plans provide a written statement to the beneficiary indicating the service performed, the charges covered, what the insurer allows, and the amount for which the patient is responsible (i.e., explanation of benefits [EOB]) (166169). In addition, federal laws obligate notices to beneficiaries when claims are denied, including alerting beneficiaries who need to pay for care until the allowable deductible is reached. For STI testing and treatment-related care, an EOB or medical bill that is received by a parent might disclose services provided and list STI laboratory tests performed or treatment administered. Some states have instituted mechanisms for protecting adolescents' confidentiality and limiting EOBs. Additional risks to confidentiality breaches can inadvertently occur through electronic health records, although technology continues to evolve to assist with ensuring confidential care. AAP and the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine (SAHM) have published guidance on strategies to address emerging risks for confidentiality breaches associated with health information technology (169).

AAP and the SAHM recommend that providers have time alone with their adolescent patients that includes assessment for sexual behavior. The AAP recommendations are available at https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/ campaigns-and-toolkits/adolescent-health-care and the SAHM
recommendations are available at https://www.adolescenthealth. org/My-SAHM/Login-or-Create-an-Account.aspx?returnurl= \%2fResources\%2fClinical-Care-Resources\%2fConfidentiality. aspx. Discussions concerning sexual behavior should be tailored for the patient's developmental level and be aimed at identifying risk behaviors (e.g., multiple partners; oral, anal, or vaginal sex; or drug misuse behaviors). Careful, nonjudgmental, and thorough counseling is particularly vital for adolescents who might not feel comfortable acknowledging their engagement in behaviors that make them more vulnerable to acquiring STIs.

\section*{Screening Recommendations}

Recommendations for screening adolescents for STIs to detect asymptomatic infections are based on disease severity and sequelae, prevalence among the population, costs, medicolegal considerations (e.g., state laws), and other factors. Routine laboratory screening for common STIs is indicated for all sexually active adolescents. The following screening recommendations summarize published clinical prevention guidelines for sexually active adolescents from federal agencies and medical professional organizations.

\section*{Chlamydia}

Routine screening for C. trachomatis infection on an annual basis is recommended for all sexually active females aged $<25$ years (149). Rectal chlamydial testing can be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and exposure, through shared clinical decision-making between the patient and the provider (170,171). Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for C. trachomatis among sexually active young males, on the basis of efficacy and costeffectiveness. However, screening of sexually active young males should be considered in clinical settings serving populations of young men with a high prevalence of chlamydial infections (e.g., adolescent service clinics, correctional facilities, and STD clinics). Chlamydia screening, including pharyngeal or rectal testing, should be offered to all YMSM at least annually on the basis of sexual behavior and anatomic site of exposure (see Men Who Have Sex with Men).

\section*{Gonorrhea}

Routine screening for N. gonorrhoeae on an annual basis is recommended for all sexually active females aged $<25$ years (149). Extragenital gonorrhea screening (pharyngeal or rectal) can be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and exposure, through shared clinical-decision between the patient and the provider (170,171). Gonococcal infection is more prevalent among certain geographic locations and communities (141). Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and consult local public health
authorities for guidance regarding identifying groups that are more vulnerable to gonorrhea acquisition on the basis of local disease prevalence. Evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening, on the basis of efficacy and cost-effectiveness, for N. gonorrhoeae among asymptomatic sexually active young males who have sex with females only. Screening for gonorrhea, including pharyngeal or rectal testing, should be offered to YMSM at least annually (see Men Who Have Sex with Men).

Providers might consider opt-out chlamydia and gonorrhea screening (i.e., the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines, regardless of reported sexual activity) for adolescent and young adult females during clinical encounters. Cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that opt-out chlamydia screening among adolescent and young adult females might substantially increase screening, be costsaving (172), and identify infections among patients who do not disclose sexual behavior (173).

\section*{HIV Infection}

HIV screening should be discussed and offered to all adolescents. Frequency of repeat screenings should be based on the patient's sexual behaviors and the local disease prevelance (138). Persons with HIV infection should receive prevention counseling and linkage to care before leaving the testing site.

\section*{Cervical Cancer}

Guidelines from USPSTF and ACOG recommend that cervical cancer screening begin at age 21 years (174,175). This recommendation is based on the low incidence of cervical cancer and limited usefulness of screening for cervical cancer among adolescents (176). In contrast, the 2020 ACS guidelines recommend that cervical cancer screening begin at age 25 years with HPV testing. This change is recommended because the incidence of invasive cervical cancer in women aged $<25$ years is decreasing because of vaccination (177). Adolescents with HIV infection who have initiated sexual intercourse should have cervical screening cytology in accordance with HIV/AIDS guidelines (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/ guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infection/ human-papillomavirus-disease?view=full).

\section*{Other Sexually Transmitted Infections}

YMSM and pregnant females should be routinely screened for syphilis (see Pregnant Women; Men Who Have Sex with Men). Local disease prevalence can help guide decisionmaking regarding screening for T. vaginalis, especially among adolescent females in certain areas. Routine screening of adolescents and young adults who are asymptomatic for certain STIs (e.g., syphilis, trichomoniasis, BV, HSV, HAV, and HBV) is not typically recommended.

\section*{Primary Prevention Recommendations}

Primary prevention and anticipatory guidance for recognizing symptoms and behaviors associated with STIs are strategies that should be incorporated into all types of health care visits for adolescents and young adults. The following recommendations for primary prevention of STIs (i.e., vaccination and counseling) are based on published clinical guidelines for sexually active adolescents and young adults from federal agencies and medical professional organizations.
- HPV vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously at the routine age of 11 or 12 years (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).
- The HBV vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents and young adults who have not previously received the universal HBV vaccine series during childhood (12).
- The HAV vaccination series should be offered to adolescents and young adults as well as those who have not previously received the universal HAV vaccine series during childhood (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ schedules/hcp/imz/child-indications.html\#note-hepa).
- Information regarding HIV transmission, prevention, testing, and implications of infection should be regarded as an essential component of the anticipatory guidance provided to all adolescents and young adults as part of routine health care.
- CDC and USPSTF recommend offering HIV PrEP to adolescents weighing $\geq 35 \mathrm{~kg}$ and adults who are HIV negative and at substantial risk for HIV infection (80,178). YMSM should be offered PrEP in youth-friendly settings with tailored adherence support (e.g., text messaging and visits per existing guidelines). Indications for PrEP, initial and follow-up prescribing guidance, and laboratory testing recommendations are the same for adolescents and adults (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep).
- Medical providers who care for adolescents and young adults should integrate sexuality education into clinical practice. Health care providers should counsel adolescents about the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for acquiring STIs and should educate patients regarding evidence-based prevention strategies, which includes a discussion about abstinence and other risk-reduction behaviors (e.g., consistent and correct condom use and reduction in the number of sex partners including concurrent partners). Interactive counseling approaches (e.g., patient-centered counseling and motivational interviewing) are effective STI and HIV prevention strategies and are recommended by USPSTF. Educational materials (e.g., handouts, pamphlets, and videos) can reinforce office-based educational efforts.

\section*{Children}

Management of children who have STIs requires close cooperation among clinicians, laboratorians, and childprotection authorities. Official investigations, when indicated, should be initiated promptly. Certain diseases (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis), if acquired after the neonatal period, strongly indicate sexual contact. For other diseases (e.g., HSV, HPV and anogenital warts, and vaginitis), the association with sexual contact is not as clear (see Sexual Assault and Abuse and STIs).

\section*{Men Who Have Sex with Men}

MSM comprise a diverse group in terms of behaviors, identities, and health care needs (179). The term "MSM" often is used clinically to refer to sexual behavior alone, regardless of sexual orientation (e.g., a person might identify as heterosexual but still be classified as MSM). Sexual orientation is independent of gender identity. Classification of MSM can vary in the inclusion of transgender men and women on the basis of whether men are defined by sex at birth (i.e., transgender women included) or current gender identity (i.e., transgender men included). Therefore, sexual orientation as well as gender identity of individual persons and their sex partners should be obtained during health care visits. MSM might be at increased risk for HIV and other STIs because of their sexual network or behavioral or biologic factors, including number of concurrent partners, condomless sex, anal sex, or substance use (180-182). These factors, along with sexual network or higher community disease prevalence, can increase the risk for STIs among MSM compared with other groups (183,184).
Performing a detailed and comprehensive sexual history is the first step in identifying vulnerability and providing tailored counseling and care (3). Factors associated with increased vulnerability to STI acquisition among MSM include having multiple partners, anonymous partners, and concurrent partners (185,186). Repeat syphilis infections are common and might be associated with HIV infection, substance use (e.g., methamphetamines), Black race, and multiple sex partners (187). Similarly, gonorrhea incidence has increased among MSM and might be more likely to display antimicrobial resistance compared with other groups (188,189). Gonococcal infection among MSM has been associated with similar risk factors to syphilis, including having multiple anonymous partners and substance use, especially methamphetamines (190). Disparities in gonococcal infection are also more pronounced among certain racial and ethnic groups of MSM (141).

\section*{HIV Risk Among Men Who Have Sex with Men}

MSM are disproportionately at risk for HIV infection. In the United States, the estimated lifetime risk for HIV infection among MSM is one in six, compared with heterosexual men at one in 524 and heterosexual women at one in 253 (191). These disparities are further exacerbated by race and ethnicity, with African American/Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM having a one in two and a one in four lifetime risk for HIV infection, respectively. For HIV, transmission occurs much more readily through receptive anal sex, compared with penile-vaginal sex (192). Similar to other STIs, multiple partners, anonymous partners, condomless sex, and substance use are all associated with HIV infection (193-196). Importantly, other STIs also might significantly increase the risk for HIV infection (197-199). An estimated $10 \%$ of new HIV infections were attributable to chlamydial or gonococcal infection (81). A substantial number of MSM remain unaware of their HIV diagnosis (200). Clinical care involving MSM, including those who have HIV infection, should involve asking about STI-related risk factors and routine STI testing. Clinicians should routinely ask MSM about their sexual behaviors and symptoms consistent with common STIs, including urethral discharge, dysuria, ulcers, rash, lymphadenopathy, and anorectal symptoms that might be consistent with proctitis (e.g., discharge, rectal bleeding, pain on defecation, or pain during anal sex). However, certain STIs are asymptomatic, especially at rectal and pharyngeal sites, and routine testing is recommended. In addition, clinicians should provide education and counseling regarding evidence-based safer-sex approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing STI incidence (see HIV Infection, Detection, Counseling, and Referral).

\section*{Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention}

PrEP is the use of medications for preventing an infection before exposure. Studies have demonstrated that a daily oral medication TDF/FTC is effective in preventing HIV acquisition, and specifically among MSM (74,75,201). PrEP guidelines provide information regarding sexually active persons who are at substantial risk for acquiring HIV infection (having had anal or vaginal sex during the previous 6 months with either a partner with HIV infection, a bacterial STI in the past 6 months, or inconsistent or no condom use with a sex partner) or persons who inject drugs (injecting partner with HIV infection or sharing injection equipment) (80). Those guidelines provide information regarding daily PrEP use for either TDF/FTC (men or women) or tenofovir alafenamide and emtricitabine for MSM. Screening for bacterial STIs should occur at least every 6 months for all sexually active patients and every 3 months among MSM or
among patients with ongoing risk behaviors. MSM taking PrEP might compensate for decreased HIV acquisition risk by using condoms less frequently or modifying their behavior in other ways (202,203), although data regarding this behavior are inconsistent. Studies have reported that MSM taking PrEP have high rates of STIs, and frequent screening is warranted (204-206).

\section*{Importance of Rectal and Pharyngeal Testing}

Rectal and pharyngeal testing by NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recognized as an important sexual health consideration for MSM. Rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia are associated with HIV infection (82,207), and men with repeat rectal infections can be at substantially higher risk for HIV acquisition (208). Pharyngeal infections with gonorrhea or chlamydia might be a principal source of urethral infections (209-211). Studies have demonstrated that among MSM, prevalence of rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from $0.2 \%$ to $24 \%$ and $2.1 \%$ to $23 \%$, respectively, and prevalence of pharyngeal gonorrhea and chlamydia ranges from $0.5 \%$ to $16.5 \%$ and $0 \%$ to $3.6 \%$, respectively (171). Approximately $70 \%$ of gonococcal and chlamydial infections might be missed if urogenital-only testing is performed among MSM (212-216) because most pharyngeal and rectal infections are asymptomatic. Self-collected swabs have been reported to be an acceptable means of collection for pharyngeal and rectal specimens (217-219), which can enhance patient comfort and reduce clinical workloads.

A detailed sexual history should be taken for all MSM to identify anatomic locations exposed to infection for screening. Clinics that provide services for MSM at high risk should consider implementing routine extragenital screening for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis infections, and screening is likely to be cost-effective (220).

\section*{Screening Recommendations}

STI screening among MSM has been reported to be suboptimal. In a cross-sectional sample of MSM in the United States, approximately one third reported not having had an STI test during the previous 3 years, and MSM with multiple sex partners reported less frequent screening (221). MSM living with HIV infection and engaged in care also experience suboptimal rates of STI testing (222,223). Limited data exist regarding the optimal frequency of screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis among MSM, with the majority of evidence derived from mathematical modeling. Models from Australia have demonstrated that increasing syphilis screening frequency from two times a year to four times a year resulted in a relative decrease of $84 \%$ from peak prevalence (224). In a compartmental model applied to different populations in Canada, quarterly syphilis screening averted more than twice
the number of syphilis cases, compared with semiannual screening (225). Furthermore, MSM screening coverage needed for eliminating syphilis among a population is substantially reduced from $62 \%$ with annual screening to $23 \%$ with quarterly screening $(226,227)$. In an MSM transmission model that explored the impact of HIV PrEP use on STI prevalence, quarterly chlamydia and gonorrhea screening was associated with an $83 \%$ reduction in incidence (205). The only empiric data available that examined the impact of screening frequency come from an observational cohort of MSM using HIV PrEP in which quarterly screening identified more bacterial STIs, and semiannual screening would have resulted in delayed treatment of $35 \%$ of total identified STI infections (206). In addition, quarterly screening was reported to have prevented STI exposure in a median of three sex partners per STI infection (206). On the basis of available evidence, quarterly screening for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis for certain sexually active MSM can improve case finding, which can reduce the duration of infection at the population level, reduce ongoing transmission and, ultimately, prevalence among this population (228).

Preventive screening for common STIs is indicated for all MSM. The following screening recommendations summarize published federal agency and USPSTF clinical prevention guidelines for MSM and should be performed at least annually.

\section*{HIV Infection}

HIV serologic testing is indicated if HIV status is unknown or if HIV negative and the patient or their sex partner has had more than one sex partner since the most recent HIV test.

\section*{Syphilis}

Syphilis serologic testing is indicated to establish whether persons with reactive tests have untreated syphilis, have partially treated syphilis, or are manifesting a slow or inadequate serologic response to recommended previous therapy.

\section*{Gonorrhea and Chlamydia}

The following testing is recommended for MSM:
- A test for urethral infection* with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had insertive intercourse during the preceding year (urine NAAT is preferred).
- A test for rectal infection* with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among men who have had receptive anal intercourse during the preceding year (rectal NAAT is preferred).

\footnotetext{
*Regardless of condom use during exposure.
}
- A test for pharyngeal infection* with N. gonorrhoeae among men who have had receptive oral intercourse during the preceding year (pharyngeal NAAT is preferred).
- Testing for C. trachomatis pharyngeal infection is not recommended.
Basing screening practices solely on history might be suboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable taking a detailed sexual history (229), men might also feel uncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with their provider, and rectal and pharyngeal infections can be identified even in the absence of reported risk behaviors (171). Furthermore, the role of saliva, kissing, and rimming (i.e., oral-rectal contact) in the transmission of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis has not been well studied (230-232).

Rectal and pharyngeal testing (provider-collected or selfcollected specimens) should be performed for all MSM who report exposure at these sites. Testing can be offered to MSM who do not report exposure at these sites after a detailed explanation, due to known underreporting of risk behaviors. All MSM with HIV infection entering care should be screened for gonorrhea and chlamydia at appropriate anatomic sites of exposure as well as for syphilis.

More frequent STI screening (i.e., for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia) at 3 - to 6 -month intervals is indicated for MSM, including those taking PrEP and those with HIV infection, if risk behaviors persist or if they or their sex partners have multiple partners. In addition, providers can consider the benefits of offering more frequent HIV screening (e.g., every 3-6 months) to MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV infection.

\section*{Hepatitis B Virus}

All MSM should be screened with HBsAg, HBV core antibody, and HBV surface antibody testing to detect HBV infection (233). Vaccination against both HAV and HBV is recommended for all MSM for whom previous infection or vaccination cannot be documented. Serologic testing can be considered before vaccinating if the patient's vaccination history is unknown; however, vaccination should not be delayed. Vaccinating persons who have had previous infection or vaccination does not increase the risk for vaccine-related adverse events (see Hepatitis A Virus; Hepatitis B Virus).

\section*{Hepatitis C Virus}

CDC recommends HCV screening at least once for all adults aged $\geq 18$ years, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection (HCV RNA positivity) is <0.1\% (156). The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/ Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend all MSM with HIV infection be screened for HCV during the
initial HIV evaluation and at least annually thereafter (https:// www.hcvguidelines.org). More frequent screening depends on ongoing risk behaviors, high-risk sexual behavior, and concomitant ulcerative STIs or STI-related proctitis. Sexual transmission of HCV can occur and is most common among MSM with HIV infection (234-237). Screening for HCV in this setting is cost-effective $(238,239)$. Screening should be performed by using HCV antibody assays followed by HCV RNA testing for those with a positive antibody test. Suspicion for acute HCV infection (e.g., clinical evidence of hepatitis and risk behaviors) should prompt consideration for HCV RNA testing, despite a negative antibody test.

\section*{Human Papillomavirus}

HPV infection and associated conditions (e.g., anogenital warts and anal squamous intraepithelial lesions) are highly prevalent among MSM. The HPV vaccination is recommended for all men, including MSM and transgender persons or immunocompromised males, including those with HIV infection, through age 26 years (11). More information is available at https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/downloads/9vhpvguidance.pdf.
A digital anorectal examination (DARE) should be performed to detect early anal cancer among persons with HIV and MSM without HIV but who have a history of receptive anal intercourse. Data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology in populations at risk for anal cancer (see Anal Cancer). Health centers that initiate a cytology-based screening program should only do so if referrals to high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and biopsy are available.

\section*{Herpes Simplex Virus-2}

Evaluation for HSV-2 infection with type-specific serologic tests also can be considered if infection status is unknown among persons with previously undiagnosed genital tract infection (see Genital Herpes).

\section*{Postexposure Prophylaxis and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for STI Prevention}

Studies have reported that a benefit might be derived from STI PEP and PrEP for STI prevention. One study demonstrated that monthly oral administration of a 1-g dose of azithromycin reduced infection with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis but did not decrease the incidence of HIV transmission (240). Among MSM, doxycycline taken as PEP in a single oral dose $\leq 24$ hours after sex decreased infection with Treponema pallidum and C. trachomatis; however, no substantial effect was observed for infection with N. gonorrhoeae (93). Doxycycline taken as STI PrEP as 100 mg orally once daily also demonstrated a substantial reduction in gonorrhea,
chlamydia, and syphilis among MSM (90). However, these studies had limitations because of small sample size, short duration of therapy, and concerns about antibiotic resistance, specifically regarding $N$. gonorrhoeae (241). Further study is needed to determine the effectiveness of using antimicrobials for STI PrEP or PEP.

\section*{Counseling and Education Approaches}

Different counseling and STI prevention strategies are needed to effectively engage different groups of MSM. Outreach efforts should be guided by local surveillance efforts and community input. Engaging MSM at risk through social media, specifically online hookup sites, is an important outreach effort to consider. Hookup sites are Internet sites and mobile telephone applications that men might use for meeting other men for sex. Internet use might facilitate sexual encounters and STI transmission among MSM, and many men report using hookup sites to meet partners (242-245). The ease and accessibility of meeting partners online might reduce stigma and barriers of meeting partners through other settings. Moreover, these sites offer an opportunity for effective STI prevention messaging (246), although the cost might be limiting (247). Different groups of MSM might use different hookup sites, and efforts should be guided by local community input. Studies have demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of reaching MSM through these hookup sites to promote STI prevention efforts $(248,249)$.

\section*{Enteric Infections Among Men Who Have Sex with Men}

The importance of sexual transmission of enteric pathogens among MSM has been recognized since the 1970s, after the first report of MSM-associated shigellosis was reported in San Francisco $(250,251)$. Global increases in the incidence of shigellosis among adult MSM have been more recently observed (252-256). Sporadic outbreaks of Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri have been reported among MSM (257-262). Transmission occurs through oral-anal contact or sexual contact, and transmission efficiency is enhanced by both biologic or host and behavioral factors. HIV without viral suppression can be an independent risk factor that can contribute to transmission by increasing shedding of the enteric pathogen, increasing susceptibility of the host, or both $(255,263)$. Surveillance data in England during 2004-2015 demonstrated that 21\% of nontravel-associated Shigella diagnoses among MSM were among persons with HIV infection (255).

Other enteric organisms might also cause disease among MSM through sexual activities leading to oral-anal contact, including bacteria such as Escherichia coli (264) and

Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli $(265,266)$; viruses such as HAV (267); and parasites such as Giardia lamblia or Entamoeba histolytica $(268,269)$. Behavioral characteristics associated with the sexual transmission of enteric infections are broadly similar to those associated with other STIs (e.g., gonorrhea, syphilis, and lymphogranuloma venereum [LGV]). This includes multiple sex partners and online hookup sites that increase opportunities for sexual mixing, which might create dense sexual networks that facilitate STI transmission among MSM (270). Specific behaviors associated with sexually transmitted enteric infections among MSM involve attendance at sex parties and recreational drug use including chem sex (i.e., using crystal methamphetamine, gamma-butyrolactone, or mephedrone before or during sex), which might facilitate condomless sex, group sex, fisting, use of sex toys, and scat play (253,271). The growing number of sexually transmitted enteric infections might be attributable in part to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. This is well reported regarding Shigella species, for which rapid intercontinental dissemination of a S. flexneri 3a lineage with high-level resistance to azithromycin through sexual transmission among MSM (272) and clusters of multidrug resistant shigella cases among MSM have recently been reported (273). Multidrug-resistant Campylobacter species have also been documented $(266,274)$. For MSM patients with diarrhea, clinicians should request laboratory examinations, including stool culture; provide counseling about the risk for infection with enteric pathogens during sexual activity (oralanal, oral-genital, anal-genital, and digital-anal contact) that could expose them to enteric pathogens; and choose treatment, when needed, according to antimicrobial drug susceptibility.

\section*{Women Who Have Sex with Women and Women Who Have Sex with Women and Men}

WSW and WSWM comprise diverse groups with variations in sexual identity, practices, and risk behaviors. Studies indicate that certain WSW, particularly adolescents, young women, and WSWM, might be at increased risk for STIs and HIV on the basis of reported risk behaviors (275-280). Studies have highlighted the diversity of sexual practices and examined use of protective or risk-reduction strategies among WSW populations (281-283). Use of barrier protection with female partners (e.g., gloves during digital-genital sex, external condoms with sex toys, and latex or plastic barriers [also known as dental dams for oral-genital sex]) was infrequent in all studies. Although health organizations have online materials directed to patients, few comprehensive and reliable resources of sexual health information for WSW are available (284).

Recent studies regarding STI rates among WSW and WSWM indicate that WSWM experience higher rates of STIs than WSW, with rates comparable with women who have sex with men (WSM) in all studies reviewed (279,285,286). These studies indicate that WSW might experience STIs at lower rates than WSWM and WSM, although still at significant rates (287). One study reported higher sexual-risk behaviors among adolescent WSWM and WSW than among adolescent WSM (280). WSW report reduced knowledge of STI risks (288), and both WSW and WSWM experience barriers to care, especially Black WSW and WSWM $(289,290)$. In addition, a continuum of sexual behaviors reported by WSW and WSWM indicates the need for providers to not assume lower risk for WSW, highlighting the importance of an open discussion about sexual health.
Few data are available regarding the risk for STIs conferred by sex between women; however, transmission risk probably varies by the specific STI and sexual practice (e.g., oral-genital sex; vaginal or anal sex using hands, fingers, or penetrative sex items; and oral-anal sex $(291,292)$. Practices involving digital-vaginal or digital-anal contact, particularly with shared penetrative sex items, present a possible means for transmission of infected cervicovaginal or anal secretions. This possibility is most directly supported by reports of shared trichomonas infections (293,294) and by concordant drug-resistance genotype testing and phylogenetic linkage analysis identifying HIV transmitted sexually between women $(295,296)$. The majority of WSW ( $53 \%-97 \%$ ) have had sex with men in the past and continue to do so, with 5\%-28\% of WSW reporting male partners during the previous year (292,297-300).
HPV can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, and sexual transmission of HPV likely occurs between WSW (301-303). HPV DNA has been detected through polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods from the cervix, vagina, and vulva among $13 \%-30 \%$ of WSW $(301,302)$ and can persist on fomites, including sex toys (304). Among WSW who report no lifetime history of sex with men, $26 \%$ had antibodies to HPV-16, and $42 \%$ had antibodies to HPV-6 (301). High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) have been detected on Papanicolaou smears (Pap tests) among WSW who reported no previous sex with men $(301,302)$. WSWM are at risk for acquiring HPV from both their female partners and male partners and thus are at risk for cervical cancer. Therefore, routine cervical cancer screening should be offered to all women, regardless of sexual orientation or practices, and young adult WSW and WSWM should be offered HPV vaccination in accordance with recommendations (11) (https:// www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html).

Genital transmission of HSV-2 between female sex partners is inefficient but can occur. A U.S. population-based survey among women aged 18-59 years demonstrated an HSV-2 seroprevalence of $30 \%$ among women reporting same-sex partners during the previous year, $36 \%$ among women reporting same-sex partners in their lifetime, and $24 \%$ among women reporting no lifetime same-sex behavior (299). HSV-2 seroprevalence among women self-identifying as homosexual or lesbian was $8 \%$, similar to a previous clinic-based study of WSW $(299,305)$ but was $26 \%$ among Black WSW in one study (287). The relatively frequent practice of orogenital sex among WSW and WSWM might place them at higher risk for genital infection with HSV-1, a hypothesis supported by the recognized association between HSV-1 seropositivity and previous number of female partners. Thus, sexual transmission of HSV-1 and HSV-2 can occur between female sex partners. This information should be communicated to women as part of sexual health counseling.

Trichomonas is a relatively common infection among WSW and WSWM, with prevalence rates higher than for chlamydia or gonorrhea (306,307), and direct transmission of trichomonas between female partners has been demonstrated (293,294).

Limited information is available regarding transmission of bacterial STIs between female partners. Transmission of syphilis between female sex partners, probably through oral sex, has been reported. Although the rate of transmission of C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae between women is unknown, infection also might be acquired from past or current male partners. Data indicate that C. trachomatis infection among WSW can occur (275,286,308,309). Data are limited regarding gonorrhea rates among WSW and WSWM (170). Reports of same-sex behavior among women should not deter providers from offering and providing screening for STIs, including chlamydia, according to guidelines.

BV is common among women, and even more so among women with female partners (310-312). Epidemiologic data strongly demonstrate that BV is sexually transmitted among women with female partners. Evidence continues to support the association of such sexual behaviors as having a new partner, having a partner with BV, having receptive oral sex, and having digital-vaginal and digital-anal sex with incident $\operatorname{BV}(313,314)$. A study including monogamous couples demonstrated that female sex partners frequently share identical genital Lactobacillus strains (315). Within a community-based cohort of WSW, extravaginal (i.e., oral and rectal) reservoirs of BV-associated bacteria were a risk factor for incident BV (316). Studies have examined the impact of specific sexual practices on the vaginal microflora (306,317-319) and on recurrent (320) or incident $(321,322)$ BV among WSW. A BV pathogenesis study in WSW reported that Prevotella bivia,

Gardnerella vaginalis, and Atopobium vaginae might have substantial roles in development of incident BV (323). These studies have continued to support, although have not proven, the hypothesis that sexual behaviors, specific BV-associated bacteria, and possibly exchange of vaginal or extravaginal microbiota (e.g., oral bacterial communities) between partners might be involved in the pathogenesis of BV among WSW.

Although BV is common among WSW, routine screening for asymptomatic BV is not recommended. Results of one randomized trial used a behavioral intervention to reduce persistent BV among WSW through reduced sharing of vaginal fluid on hands or sex toys. Women randomly assigned to the intervention were $50 \%$ less likely to report receptive digitalvaginal contact without gloves than control subjects, and they reported sharing sex toys infrequently. However, these women had no reduction in persistent BV at 1 month posttreatment and no reduction in incident episodes of recurrent BV (324). Trials have not been reported examining the benefits of treating female partners of women with BV. Recurrent BV among WSW is associated with having a same-sex partner and a lack of condom use (325). Increasing awareness of signs and symptoms of BV among women and encouraging healthy sexual practices (e.g., avoiding shared sex toys, cleaning shared sex toys, and using barriers) might benefit women and their partners.

Sexually active women are at risk for acquiring bacterial, viral, and protozoal STIs from current and previous partners, both male and female. WSW should not be presumed to be at low or no risk for STIs on the basis of their sexual orientation. Report of same-sex behavior among women should not deter providers from considering and performing screening for STIs and cervical cancer according to guidelines. Effective screening requires that care providers and their female patients engage in a comprehensive and open discussion of sexual and behavioral risks that extends beyond sexual identity.

\section*{Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons}

Transgender persons often experience high rates of stigma and socioeconomic and structural barriers to care that negatively affect health care usage and increase susceptibility to HIV and STIs (326-332). Persons who are transgender have a gender identity that differs from the sex that they were assigned at birth $(333,334)$. Transgender women (also known as trans women, transfeminine persons, or women of transgender experience) are women who were assigned male sex at birth (born with male anatomy). Transgender men (also known as trans men, transmasculine persons, or men of transgender experience) are men who were assigned female sex at birth (i.e., born with female anatomy). In addition, certain persons might identify outside the gender binary of male or female or move back and
forth between different gender identities and use such terms as "gender nonbinary," "genderqueer," or "gender fluid" to describe themselves. Persons who use terms such as "agender" or "null gender" do not identify with having any gender. The term "cisgender" is used to describe persons who identify with their assigned sex at birth. Prevalence studies of transgender persons among the overall population have been limited and often are based on small convenience samples.

Gender identity is independent of sexual orientation. Sexual orientation identities among transgender persons are diverse. Persons who are transgender or gender diverse might have sex with cisgender men, cisgender women, or other transgender or gender nonbinary persons.

\section*{Clinical Environment Assessment}

Providers should create welcoming environments that facilitate disclosure of gender identity and sexual orientation. Clinics should document gender identity and sex assigned at birth for all patients to improve sexual health care for transgender and gender nonbinary persons. Assessment of gender identity and sex assigned at birth has been validated among diverse populations, has been reported to be acceptable $(335,336)$, and might result in increased patients identifying as transgender (337).

Lack of medical provider knowledge and other barriers to care (e.g., discrimination in health care settings or denial of services) often result in transgender and gender nonbinary persons avoiding or delaying preventive care services (338-340) and incurring missed opportunities for HIV and STI prevention services. Gender-inclusive and trauma-guided health care might increase the number of transgender patients who seek sexual health services, including STI testing (341), because transgender persons are at high risk for sexual violence (342).

Primary care providers should take a comprehensive sexual history, including a discussion of STI screening, HIV PrEP and PEP, behavioral health, and social determinants of sexual health. Clinicians can improve the experience of sexual health screening and counseling for transgender persons by asking for their choice of terminology or modifying language (e.g., asking patients their gender pronouns) to be used during clinic visits and history taking and examination (343). Options for fertility preservation, pregnancy potential, and contraception options should also be discussed, if indicated. For transgender persons who retain a uterus and ovaries, ovulation might continue in the presence of testosterone therapy, and pregnancy potential exists (https://transcare.ucsf.edu).

\section*{Transgender Women}

A systematic review and meta-analysis of HIV infection among transgender women estimated that HIV prevalence in
the United States is $14 \%$ among transgender women, with the highest prevalence among Black ( $44 \%$ ) and Hispanic ( $26 \%$ ) transgender women (344). Data also demonstrate high rates of HIV infection among transgender women worldwide (345). Bacterial STI prevalence varies among transgender women and is based largely on convenience samples. Despite limited data, international and U.S. studies have indicated elevated incidence and prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia among transgender women similar to rates among cisgender MSM (346-348). A recent study using data from the STD Surveillance Network revealed that the proportions of transgender women with extragenital chlamydial or gonococcal infections were similar to those of cisgender MSM (349).

Providers caring for transgender women should have knowledge of their patients' current anatomy and patterns of sexual behavior before counseling them about STI and HIV prevention. The majority of transgender women have not undergone genital-affirmation surgery and therefore might retain a functional penis; in these instances, they might engage in insertive oral, vaginal, or anal sex as well as receptive oral or anal sex. In the U.S. Transgender Survey, 12\% of transgender women had undergone vaginoplasty surgery, and approximately $50 \%$ more were considering surgical intervention (350). Providers should have knowledge about the type of tissue used to construct the neovagina, which can affect future STI and HIV preventive care and screening recommendations. The majority of vaginoplasty surgeries conducted in the United States use penile and scrotal tissue to create the neovagina (351). Other surgical techniques use intestinal tissue (e.g., sigmoid colon graft) or split-skin grafts (352). Although these surgeries involve penectomy and orchiectomy, the prostate remains intact. Transgender women who have had a vaginoplasty might engage in receptive vaginal, oral, or anal sex.

Neovaginal STIs have infrequently been reported in the literature and include HSV and HPV/genital warts in penile-inversion vaginoplasty, C. trachomatis in procedures that involved penile skin and grafts with urethra mucosa or abdominal peritoneal lining (353), and N. gonorrhoeae in both penile-inversion and colovaginoplasty (354-359). If the vaginoplasty used an intestinal graft, a risk also exists for bowel-related disease (e.g., adenocarcinoma, inflammatory bowel disease, diversion colitis, and polyps) (360-362).

\section*{Transgender Men}

The few studies of HIV prevalence among transgender men indicated that they have a lower prevalence of HIV infection than transgender women. A recent estimate of HIV prevalence among transgender men was $2 \%$ (344). However, transgender men who have sex with cisgender men might be at elevated
risk for HIV infection (332,363,364). Data are limited regarding STI prevalence among transgender men, and the majority of studies have used clinic-based data or convenience sampling. Recent data from the STD Surveillance Network demonstrated higher prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia among transgender men, similar to rates reported among cisgender MSM (365).

The U.S. Transgender Survey indicated that the proportion of transgender men and gender diverse persons assigned female sex at birth who have undergone gender-affirmation genital surgery is low. Providers should consider the anatomic diversity among transgender men because a person can undergo a metoidioplasty (a procedure to increase the length of the clitoris), with or without urethral lengthening, and might not have a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and therefore be at risk for bacterial STIs, HPV, HSV, HIV, and cervical cancer (366). For transgender men using gender-affirming hormone therapy, the decrease in estradiol levels caused by exogenous testosterone can lead to vaginal atrophy $(367,368)$ and is associated with a high prevalence of unsatisfactory sample acquisition (369). The impact of these hormonal changes on mucosal susceptibility to HIV and STIs is unknown.

Transgender men who have not chosen to undergo hysterectomy with removal of the cervix remain at risk for cervical cancer. These persons often avoid cervical cancer screening because of multiple factors, including discomfort with medical examinations and fear of discrimination (338,370). Providers should be aware that conducting a speculum examination can be technically difficult after metoidioplasty surgery because of narrowing of the introitus. In these situations, high-risk HPV testing using a swab can be considered; self-collected swabs for high-risk HPV testing has been reported to be an acceptable option for transgender men (371).

\section*{Screening Recommendations}

The following are screening recommendations for transgender and gender diverse persons:
- Because of the diversity of transgender persons regarding surgical gender-affirming procedures, hormone use, and their patterns of sexual behavior, providers should remain aware of symptoms consistent with common STIs and screen for asymptomatic infections on the basis of the patient's sexual practices and anatomy.
- Gender-based screening recommendations should be adapted on the basis of anatomy (e.g., routine screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae) as recommended for all sexually active females aged $<25$ years on an annual basis and should be extended to transgender men and nonbinary persons with a cervix among this age group.
- HIV screening should be discussed and offered to all transgender persons. Frequency of repeat screenings should be based on level of risk.
- For transgender persons with HIV infection who have sex with cisgender men and transgender women, STI screening should be conducted at least annually, including syphilis serology, HCV testing, and urogenital and extragenital NAAT for gonorrhea and chlamydia.
- Transgender women who have had vaginoplasty surgery should undergo routine STI screening for all exposed sites (e.g., oral, anal, or vaginal). No data are available regarding the optimal screening method (urine or vaginal swab) for bacterial STIs of the neovagina. The usual techniques for creating a neovagina do not result in a cervix; therefore, no rationale exists for cervical cancer screening (368).
- If transgender men have undergone metoidioplasty surgery with urethral lengthening and have not had a vaginectomy, assessment of genital bacterial STIs should include a cervical swab because a urine specimen will be inadequate for detecting cervical infections.
- Cervical cancer screening for transgender men and nonbinary persons with a cervix should follow current screening guidelines (see Human Papillomavirus Infections).

\section*{Persons in Correctional Facilities}

Multiple studies have demonstrated that persons entering correctional facilities have a high prevalence of STIs, HIV, and viral hepatitis, especially those aged $\leq 35$ years ( $141,372,373$ ). Risk behaviors for acquiring STIs (e.g., having condomless sex, having multiple sex partners, substance misuse, and engaging in commercial, survival, or coerced sex) are common among incarcerated populations. Before their incarceration, many persons have had limited access to medical care. Other social determinants of health (e.g., insufficient social and economic support or living in communities with high local STI prevalence) are common. Addressing STIs in correctional settings is vital for addressing the overall STI impact among affected populations.

Growing evidence demonstrates the usefulness of expanded STI screening and treatment services in correctional settings, including short-term facilities (jails), long-term institutions (prisons), and juvenile detention centers. For example, in jurisdictions with comprehensive, targeted jail screening, more chlamydial infections among females (and males if screened) are detected and subsequently treated in the correctional setting than in any other single reporting source $(141,374)$ and might represent the majority of reported cases in certain jurisdictions (375). Screening in the jail setting has the potential to reach
substantially more persons at risk than screening among the prison population alone.
Both males and females aged $\leq 35$ years in juvenile and adult detention facilities have been reported to have higher rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea than nonincarcerated persons in the community (141,374,376). Syphilis seroprevalence rates, which can indicate previously treated or current infection, are considerably higher among incarcerated adult men and women than among adolescents, which is consistent with the overall national syphilis trends (141,374). Detection and treatment of early syphilis in correctional facilities might affect rates of transmission among adults and prevention of congenital syphilis (377).
In jails, approximately half of entrants are released back into the community within 48 hours. As a result, treatment completion rates for those screened for STIs and who receive STI diagnoses in short-term facilities might not be optimal. However, because of the mobility of incarcerated populations in and out of the community, the impact of screening in correctional facilities on the prevalence of infections among detainees and subsequent transmission in the community after release might be considerable (378). Moreover, treatment completion rates of $\geq 95 \%$ in short-term facilities can be achieved by offering screening at or shortly after intake, thus facilitating earlier receipt of test results and, if needed, follow-up of untreated persons can be conducted through public health outreach.
Universal, opt-out screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea among females aged $\leq 35$ years entering juvenile and adult correctional facilities is recommended (379). Males aged <30 years entering juvenile and adult correctional facilities should also be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea (380). Opt-out screening has the potential to substantially increase the number tested and the number of chlamydia and gonorrhea infections detected (381-385). Point-of-care (POC) NAAT might also be considered if the tests have demonstrated sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Studies have demonstrated high prevalence of trichomoniasis among incarcerated females (386-392).

\section*{Screening Recommendations}

\section*{Chlamydia and Gonorrhea}

Females aged $\leq 35$ years and males aged <30 years housed in correctional facilities should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea. This screening should be conducted at intake and offered as opt-out screening.

\section*{Trichomonas}

Females aged $\leq 35$ years housed in correctional facilities should be screened for trichomonas. This screening should be conducted at intake and offered as opt-out screening.

\section*{Syphilis}

Opt-out screening for incarcerated persons should be conducted on the basis of the local area and institutional prevalence of early (primary, secondary, or early latent) infectious syphilis. Correctional facilities should stay apprised of local syphilis prevalence. In short-term facilities, screening at entry might be indicated.

\section*{Viral Hepatitis}

All persons housed in juvenile and adult correctional facilities should be screened at entry for viral hepatitis, including HAV, HBV, and HCV, depending on local prevalence and the person's vaccination status. Vaccination for HAV and HBV should be offered if the person is susceptible.

\section*{Cervical Cancer}

Women and transgender men who are housed in correctional facilities should be screened for cervical cancer as for women who are not incarcerated $(393,394)$ (see Cervical Cancer).

\section*{HIV Infection}

All persons being housed in juvenile and adult correctional facilities should be screened at entry for HIV infection; screening should be offered as opt-out screening. For those identified as being at risk for HIV infection (e.g., with diagnosed gonorrhea or syphilis or persons who inject drugs) and being released into the community, starting HIV PrEP (or providing linkage to a community clinic for HIV PrEP) for HIV prevention should be considered $(395,396)$. Persons are likely to engage in high-risk activities immediately after release from incarceration (397). For those identified with HIV infection, treatment should be initiated. Those persons receiving PrEP or HIV treatment should have linkage to care established before release. Correctional settings should consider implementing other STI prevention approaches, both during incarceration and upon release, which might include educational and behavioral counseling interventions (398-401), vaccination (e.g., for HPV) (402,403), condom distribution (404,405), EPT (125), and PrEP to prevent HIV infection (see Primary Prevention Methods).

\section*{HIV Infection}

\section*{Detection, Counseling, and Referral}

Infection with HIV causes an acute but brief and nonspecific influenza-like retroviral syndrome that can include fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, arthritis, or skin rash. Most persons experience at least one symptom; however, some might be asymptomatic or have no recognition of illness (406-409). Acute infection transitions to a multiyear, chronic illness that progressively depletes $\mathrm{CD4}^{+}$T lymphocytes crucial for maintenance of effective immune function. Ultimately, persons with untreated HIV infection experience symptomatic, life-threatening immunodeficiency (i.e., AIDS).

Effective ART that suppresses HIV replication to undetectable levels reduces morbidity, provides a near-normal lifespan, and prevents sexual transmission of HIV to others (95-97,410412). Early diagnosis of HIV and rapid linkage to care are essential for achieving these goals. Guidelines from both the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the International AIDS Society-USA Panel recommend that all persons with HIV infection be offered effective ART as soon as possible, both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to prevent HIV transmission (413).

STD specialty or sexual health clinics are a vital partner in reducing HIV infections in the United States. These clinics provide safety net services to vulnerable populations in need of HIV prevention services who are not served by the health care system and HIV partner service organizations. Diagnosis of an STI is a biomarker for HIV acquisition, especially among persons with primary or secondary syphilis or, among MSM, rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia (197). STD clinics perform only approximately 20\% of all federally funded HIV tests nationally but identify approximately $30 \%$ of all new infections (414). Among testing venues, STD clinics are high performing in terms of linkage to HIV care within 90 days of diagnosis; during 2013-2017, the percentage of persons with a new diagnosis in an STD clinic and linked to care within 90 days increased from 55\% to >90\% (415,415).

\section*{Screening Recommendations}

The following recommendations apply to testing for HIV:
- HIV testing is recommended for all persons seeking STI evaluation who are not already known to have HIV infection. Testing should be routine at the time of the STI evaluation, regardless of whether the patient reports any specific behavioral risks for HIV. Testing for HIV should be performed at the time of STI diagnosis and treatment if not performed at the initial STI evaluation and screening (82,195,416).
- CDC and USPSTF recommend HIV screening at least once for all persons aged 15-65 years (417).
- Persons at higher risk for HIV acquisition, including sexually active gay, bisexual, and other MSM, should be screened for HIV at least annually. Providers can consider the benefits of offering more frequent screening (e.g., every 3-6 months) among MSM at increased risk for acquiring HIV $(418,419)$.
- All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the first prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, preferably at $<36$ weeks' gestation, should be considered and is recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring HIV infection, women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high rates of HIV, and women examined in clinical settings in which HIV incidence is $\geq 1$ per 1,000 women screened per year (138,140).
- HIV screening should be voluntary and free from coercion. Patients should not be tested without their knowledge.
- Opt-out HIV screening (notifying the patient that an HIV test will be performed, unless the patient declines) is recommended in all health care settings. CDC also recommends that consent for HIV screening be incorporated into the general informed consent for medical care in the same manner as other screening or diagnostic tests.
- Requirement of specific signed consent for HIV testing is not recommended. General informed consent for medical care is considered sufficient to encompass informed consent for HIV testing.
- Providers should use a laboratory-based antigen/antibody ( $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Ab}$ ) combination assay as the first test for HIV, unless persons are unlikely to follow up with a provider to receive their HIV test results; in those cases screening with a rapid POC test can be useful.
- Preliminary positive screening tests for HIV should be followed by supplemental testing to establish the diagnosis.
- Providing prevention counseling as part of HIV screening programs or in conjunction with HIV diagnostic testing is not required (6). However, persons might be more likely to think about HIV and consider their risk-related behavior when undergoing an HIV test. HIV testing gives providers an opportunity to conduct STI and HIV prevention counseling and communicate risk-reduction messages.
- Acute HIV infection can occur among persons who report recent sexual or needle-sharing behavior or who have had an STI diagnosis.
- Providers should test for HIV RNA if initial testing according to the HIV testing algorithm recommended by CDC is negative or indeterminate when concerned about acute HIV infection (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872).
- Providers should not assume that a laboratory report of a negative $\mathrm{HIV} \mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Ab}$ or antibody test indicates that the requisite HIV RNA testing for acute HIV infection has been conducted. They should consider explicitly requesting HIV RNA testing when concerned about early acute HIV infection.
- Providers should assess eligibility of all persons seeking STI services for HIV PrEP and PEP. For persons with substantial risk whose results are HIV negative, providers should offer or provide referral for PrEP services, unless the last potential HIV exposure occurred $<72$ hours, in which case PEP might be indicated.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

HIV infection can be diagnosed by HIV $1 / 2 \mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Ab}$ combination immunoassays. All FDA-cleared HIV tests are highly sensitive and specific. Available serologic tests can detect all known subtypes of HIV-1. The majority also detect HIV-2 and uncommon variants of HIV-1 (e.g., group O and group N ).
According to an algorithm for HIV diagnosis, CDC recommends that HIV testing begin with a laboratorybased HIV-1/HIV-2 Ag/Ab combination assay, which, if repeatedly reactive, is followed by a laboratory-based assay with a supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assay (https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/50872). This algorithm confers an additional advantage because it can detect HIV-2 antibodies after the initial immunoassay. Although HIV-2 is uncommon in the United States, accurate identification is vital because monitoring and therapy for HIV-2 differs from that for HIV-1 (420). RNA testing should be performed on all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative supplemental antibody test results to determine whether the discordance represents acute HIV infection.
Rapid POC HIV tests can enable clinicians to make a preliminary diagnosis of HIV infection in $<20$ minutes. The majority of rapid antibody assays become reactive later in the course of HIV infection than conventional laboratory-based assays and thus can produce negative results among persons recently infected (e.g., acutely infected persons). Furthermore, HIV home-test kits only detect HIV antibodies and therefore will not detect acute HIV infection. If early or acute infection is suspected and a rapid HIV antibody assay is negative, confirmatory testing with combined laboratory-based assays or RNA testing should be performed. CDC recommends that all persons with reactive rapid tests be assessed with a laboratorybased $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Ab}$ assay. Additional details about interpretation of results by using the HIV testing algorithm recommended by CDC are available at https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/48472.

\section*{Acute HIV Infection}

Providers serving persons at risk for STIs are in a position to diagnose HIV infection during its acute phase. Diagnosing HIV infection during the acute phase is particularly important because persons with acute HIV have highly infectious disease due to the concentration of virus in plasma and genital secretions, which is extremely elevated during that stage of infection $(421,422)$ (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/ guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full). ART during acute HIV infection is recommended because it substantially reduces infection transmission to others, improves laboratory markers of disease, might decrease severity of acute disease, lowers viral setpoint, reduces the size of the viral reservoir, decreases the rate of viral mutation by suppressing replication, and preserves immune function (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/ guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/acute-and-recent-early-hiv-infection?view=full). Persons who receive an acute HIV diagnosis should be referred immediately to an HIV clinical care provider, provided prevention counseling (e.g., advised to reduce the number of partners and to use condoms correctly and consistently), and screened for STIs. Information should be provided regarding availability of PEP for sexual and injecting drug use partners not known to have HIV infection if the most recent contact was $<72$ hours preceding HIV diagnosis.

When providers test by using the CDC algorithm, specimens collected during acute infection might give indeterminate or negative results because insufficient anti-HIV antibodies and potentially insufficient antigen are present to be reactive on $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{Ab}$ combination assays and supplemental HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation assays. Whenever acute HIV infection is suspected (e.g., initial testing according to the CDC algorithm is negative or indeterminate after a possible sexual exposure to HIV within the previous few days to weeks, especially if the person has symptoms or has primary or secondary syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia), additional testing for HIV RNA is recommended. If this additional testing for HIV RNA is also negative, repeat testing in a few weeks is recommended to rule out very early acute infection when HIV RNA might not be detectable. A more detailed discussion of testing in the context of acute HIV infection is available at https:// clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/adult-and-adolescent-arv/ initiation-antiretroviral-therapy?view=full.

\section*{Treatment}

ART should be initiated as soon as possible for all persons with HIV infection regardless of $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$T-cell count, both for individual health and to prevent HIV transmission (https://clinicalinfo.hiv. gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).

Persons with HIV infection who achieve and maintain a viral load suppressed to $<200$ copies/mL with ART have effectively no risk for sexually transmitting HIV (95-97,421). Early HIV diagnosis and treatment is thus not only vital for individual health but also as a public health intervention to prevent new infections. Knowledge of the prevention benefit of treatment can help reduce stigma and increase the person's commitment to start and remain adherent to ART (423). The importance of adherence should be stressed as well as the fact that ART does not protect against other STIs that can be prevented by using condoms. Interventions to assist persons to remain adherent to their prescribed HIV treatment, to otherwise reduce the possibility of transmission to others, and to protect themselves against STIs, have been developed for diverse populations at risk (424) (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/ files/inline-files/AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).

Comprehensive HIV treatment and care services might not be available in facilities focused primarily on STI treatment. Providers in such settings should be knowledgeable about HIV treatment and care options available in their communities and promptly link persons who have newly diagnosed HIV infection and any persons with HIV infection who are not engaged in ongoing effective care to a health care provider or facility experienced in caring for persons living with HIV (https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/ AdultandAdolescentGL.pdf).

\section*{Other HIV Management Considerations}

Behavioral and psychosocial services are integral to caring for persons with HIV infection. Providers should expect persons to be distressed when first informed that they have HIV. They face multiple adaptive challenges, including coping with the reactions of others to a stigmatizing illness, developing and adopting strategies to maintain physical and emotional health, initiating changes in behavior to prevent HIV transmission to others, and reducing the risk for acquiring additional STIs. Many persons will require assistance gaining access to health care and other support services and coping with changes in personal relationships.
Persons with HIV infection might have additional needs (e.g., referral for substance use or mental health disorders). Others require assistance to secure and maintain employment and housing. Persons capable of reproduction might require family planning counseling, information about reproductive health choices, and referral for reproductive health care.
The following recommendations apply to managing persons with diagnosed HIV infection:
- Link persons with HIV infection to care and start them on ART as soon as possible.
- Report cases (in accordance with local requirements) to public health and initiate partner services.
- Provide prevention counseling to persons with diagnosed HIV infection.
- Ensure all persons with HIV infection are informed that if they achieve and maintain a suppressed viral load, they have effectively no risk for transmitting HIV. Stress that a suppressed viral load is not a substitute for condoms and behavioral modifications because ART does not protect persons with HIV against other STIs.
- Provide additional counseling, either on-site or through referral, about the psychosocial and medical implications of having HIV infection.
- Assess the need for immediate medical care and psychosocial support.
- Link persons with diagnosed HIV infection to services provided by health care personnel experienced in managing HIV infection. Additional services that might be needed include substance misuse counseling and treatment, treatment for mental health disorders or emotional distress, reproductive counseling, risk-reduction counseling, and case management. Providers should follow up to ensure that patients have received services for any identified needs.
- Persons with HIV infection should be educated about the importance of ongoing medical care and what to expect from these services.

\section*{STI Screening of Persons with HIV Infection in HIV Care Settings}

At the initial HIV care visit, providers should screen all sexually active persons for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, and perform screening for these infections at least annually during the course of HIV care (425). Specific testing includes syphilis serology and NAAT for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis at the anatomic site of exposure. Women should also be screened for trichomoniasis at the initial visit and annually thereafter. Women should be screened for cervical cancer precursor lesions per existing guidelines (98).

More frequent screening for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (e.g., every 3 or 6 months) should be tailored to individual risk and the local prevalence of specific STIs. Certain STIs can be asymptomatic; their diagnosis might prompt referral for partner services, might identify sexual and needle-sharing partners who can benefit from early diagnosis and treatment of HIV, and might prompt reengagement in care or HIV prevention services (e.g., PEP or PrEP) (8). More detailed information on screening, testing, and treatment is provided in pathogen-specific sections of this report.

\section*{Partner Services and Reporting}

Partner notification is a key component in the evaluation of persons with HIV infection. Early diagnosis and treatment of HIV among all potentially exposed sexual and injecting drug sharing partners can improve their health and reduce new infections. For those partners without HIV infection, partner services also provide an opportunity for offering HIV prevention services, including PrEP or PEP (if exposure was <72 hours previous) and STI testing and treatment.
Health care providers should inform persons with diagnosed HIV infection about any legal obligations of providers to report cases of HIV to public health; the local confidential processes for managing partner services, including that a public health department still might be in contact to follow up in their care and partner services; and the benefits and risks of partner notification and services. Health care providers should also encourage persons with a new HIV diagnosis to notify their partners and provide them with referral information for their partners about HIV testing. Partner notification for exposure to HIV should be confidential. Health care providers can assist in the partner notification process, either directly or by referral to health department partner notification programs. Health department staff are trained to use public health investigation strategies for confidentially locating persons who can benefit from HIV treatment, care, or prevention services. Guidance regarding spousal notification varies by jurisdiction. Detailed recommendations for notification, evaluation, and treatment of exposed partners are available in Recommendations for Partner Services Programs for HIV Infection, Syphilis, Gonorrhea, and Chlamydial Infections (111).

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

All pregnant women should be tested for HIV during the first prenatal visit. A second test during the third trimester, preferably at $<36$ weeks' gestation, should be considered and is recommended for women who are at high risk for acquiring HIV, women who receive health care in jurisdictions with high rates of HIV infection, and women served in clinical settings in which prenatal screening identifies $\geq 1$ pregnant woman with HIV per 1,000 women screened (138). Diagnostic algorithms for HIV for pregnant women do not differ from those for nonpregnant women (see STI Detection Among Special Populations). Pregnant women should be informed that HIV testing will be performed as part of the routine panel of prenatal tests (138); for women who decline HIV testing, providers should address concerns that pose obstacles, discuss the benefits of testing (e.g., early HIV detection, treatment, and care for improving health of the mother and reducing perinatal
transmission of HIV), and encourage testing at subsequent prenatal visits. Women who decline testing because they have had a previous negative HIV test result should be informed about the importance of retesting during each pregnancy. Women with no prenatal care should be tested for HIV at the time of delivery.
Testing pregnant women is crucial because knowledge of infection status can help maintain the woman's health, and it enables receipt of interventions (i.e., ART or specialized obstetrical care) that can substantially reduce the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV. Pregnant women with diagnosed HIV infection should be educated about the benefits of ART for their own health and for reducing the risk for HIV transmission to their infant. In the absence of ART, a mother's risk for transmitting HIV to her neonate is approximately $30 \%$; however, risk can be reduced to $<2 \%$ through ART, obstetrical interventions (i.e., elective cesarean delivery at 38 weeks' pregnancy), and breastfeeding avoidance (https:// clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/PerinatalGL. pdf). Pregnant women with HIV infection should be linked to an HIV care provider experienced in managing HIV in pregnancy and provided antenatal and postpartum treatment and advice. Detailed and regularly updated recommendations for managing pregnant patients with HIV infection are available at https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/sites/default/files/inlinefiles/PerinatalGL.pdf.

\section*{HIV Infection Among Neonates, Infants, and Children}

Diagnosis of HIV infection in a pregnant woman indicates the need for evaluating and managing the HIV-exposed neonate and considering whether the woman's other children, if any, might be infected. Detailed recommendations regarding diagnosis and management of HIV infection among neonates and children of mothers with HIV are beyond the scope of these guidelines but are available at https://clinicalinfo.hiv. gov/en/guidelines. Exposed neonates and children with HIV infection should be referred to physicians with expertise in neonatal and pediatric HIV management.

\section*{Diseases Characterized by Genital, Anal, or Perianal Ulcers}

In the United States, the majority of young, sexually active patients who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers have either genital herpes or syphilis. The frequency of each condition differs by geographic area and population; however, genital herpes is the most prevalent of these diseases. More than one etiologic agent (e.g., herpes and syphilis) can be present in any genital, anal, or perianal ulcer. Less common infectious
causes of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers include chancroid, LGV, and granuloma inguinale (donovanosis). GUDs (e.g., syphilis, herpes, and LGV) might also present as oral ulcers. Genital herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and chancroid have been associated with an increased risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. Genital, anal, or perianal lesions can also be associated with infectious and noninfectious conditions that are not sexually transmitted (e.g., yeast, trauma, carcinoma, aphthae or Behcet's disease, fixed drug eruption, or psoriasis).
A diagnosis based only on medical history and physical examination frequently can be inaccurate. Therefore, all persons who have genital, anal, or perianal ulcers should be evaluated. Specific evaluation of genital, anal, or perianal ulcers includes syphilis serology tests and darkfield examination from lesion exudate or tissue, or NAAT if available; NAAT or culture for genital herpes type 1 or 2; and serologic testing for type-specific HSV antibody. In settings where chancroid is prevalent, a NAAT or culture for Haemophilus ducreyi should be performed.
No FDA-cleared NAAT for diagnosing syphilis is available in the United States; however, multiple FDA-cleared NAATs are available for diagnosing HSV-1 and HSV-2 in genital specimens. Certain clinical laboratories have developed their own syphilis and HSV NAATs and have conducted Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) verification studies with genital specimens. Type-specific serology for HSV-2 might aid in identifying persons with genital herpes (see Genital Herpes). In addition, biopsy of ulcers with immunohistochemistry can help identify the cause of ulcers that are unusual or that do not respond to initial therapy. HIV testing should be performed on all persons not known to have HIV infection who present with genital, anal, or perianal ulcers (see Diagnostic Considerations in disease-specific sections). NAAT testing at extragenital sites should be considered for cases in which GUDs are suspected (e.g., oral manifestations of syphilis, herpes, or LGV). Commercially available NAATs have not been cleared by FDA for these indications; however, they can be used by laboratories that have met regulatory requirements for an off-label procedure.

Because early syphilis treatment decreases transmission possibility, public health standards require health care providers to presumptively treat any patient with a suspected case of infectious syphilis at the initial visit, even before test results are available. Presumptive treatment of a patient with a suspected first episode of genital herpes also is recommended because HSV treatment benefits depend on prompt therapy initiation. The clinician should choose the presumptive treatment on the basis of the clinical presentation (i.e., HSV lesions begin as vesicles and primary syphilis as a papule) and epidemiologic circumstances (e.g., high incidence of disease
among populations and communities and travel history). For example, syphilis is so common among MSM that any male who has sex with men presenting with a genital ulcer should be presumptively treated for syphilis at the initial visit after syphilis and HSV tests are performed. After a complete diagnostic evaluation, $>25 \%$ of patients who have genital ulcers might not have a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis (426).

\section*{Chancroid}

Chancroid prevalence has declined in the United States (141). When infection does occur, it is usually associated with sporadic outbreaks. Worldwide, chancroid appears to have decreased as well, although infection might still occur in certain Africa regions and the Caribbean. Chancroid is a risk factor in HIV transmission and acquisition (197).

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

A definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires identifying H. ducreyi on special culture media that is not widely available from commercial sources; even when these media are used, sensitivity is $<80 \%$ (427). No FDA-cleared NAAT for $H$. ducreyi is available in the United States; however, such testing can be performed by clinical laboratories that have developed their own NAAT and have conducted CLIA verification studies on genital specimens.

The combination of one or more deep and painful genital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy indicates the chancroid diagnosis; inguinal lymphadenitis typically occurs in $<50 \%$ of cases (428). For both clinical and surveillance purposes, a probable diagnosis of chancroid can be made if all of the following four criteria are met: 1) the patient has one or more painful genital ulcers; 2) the clinical presentation, appearance of genital ulcers and, if present, regional lymphadenopathy are typical for chancroid; 3) the patient has no evidence of T. pallidum infection by darkfield examination or NAAT (i.e., ulcer exudate or serous fluid) or by serologic tests for syphilis performed at least $7-14$ days after onset of ulcers; and 4) HSV-1 or HSV-2 NAAT or HSV culture performed on the ulcer exudate or fluid are negative.

\section*{Treatment}

Successful antimicrobial treatment for chancroid cures the infection, resolves the clinical symptoms, and prevents transmission to others. In advanced cases, genital scarring and rectal or urogenital fistulas from suppurative buboes can result despite successful therapy.
```
Recommended Regimens for Chancroid
    Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
        or
Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM in a single dose
        or
Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days
        or
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days
```


Azithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the advantage of single-dose therapy (429). Worldwide, several isolates with intermediate resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin have been reported. However, because cultures are not routinely performed, and chancroid is uncommon, data are limited regarding prevalence of $H$. ducreyi antimicrobial resistance.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Men who are uncircumcised and persons with HIV infection do not respond as well to treatment as persons who are circumcised or are HIV negative (430). Patients should be tested for HIV at the time chancroid is diagnosed. If the initial HIV test results were negative, the provider can consider the benefits of offering more frequent testing and HIV PrEP to persons at increased risk for HIV infection.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Patients should be reexamined 3-7 days after therapy initiation. If treatment is successful, ulcers usually improve symptomatically within 3 days and objectively within 7 days after therapy. If no clinical improvement is evident, the clinician should consider whether the diagnosis is correct, another STI is present, the patient has HIV infection, the treatment was not used as instructed, or the $H$. ducreyi strain causing the infection is resistant to the prescribed antimicrobial. The time required for complete healing depends on the size of the ulcer; large ulcers might require $>2$ weeks. In addition, healing can be slower for uncircumcised men who have ulcers under the foreskin. Clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is slower than that of ulcers and might require needle aspiration or incision and drainage, despite otherwise successful therapy. Although needle aspiration of buboes is a simpler procedure, incision and drainage might be preferred because of reduced need for subsequent drainage procedures.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Regardless of whether disease symptoms are present, sex partners of patients with chancroid should be examined and treated if they had sexual contact with the patient during the 10 days preceding the patient's symptom onset.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Data indicate ciprofloxacin presents a low risk to the fetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during breastfeeding (431). Alternative drugs should be used if the patient is pregnant or lactating. No adverse effects of chancroid on pregnancy outcome have been reported.

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with HIV infection who have chancroid infection should be monitored closely because they are more likely to experience chancroid treatment failure and to have ulcers that heal slowly $(430,432)$. Persons with HIV might require repeated or longer courses of therapy, and treatment failures can occur with any regimen. Data are limited concerning the therapeutic efficacy of the recommended single-dose azithromycin and ceftriaxone regimens among persons with HIV infection.

\section*{Children}

Because sexual contact is the major primary transmission route among U.S. patients, diagnosis of chancroid ulcers among infants and children, especially in the genital or perineal region, is highly suspicious of sexual abuse. However, H. ducreyi is recognized as a major cause of nonsexually transmitted cutaneous ulcers among children in tropical regions and, specifically, countries where yaws is endemic (433-435). Acquisition of a lower-extremity ulcer attributable to $H$. ducreyi in a child without genital ulcers and reported travel to a region where yaws is endemic should not be considered evidence of sexual abuse.

\section*{Genital Herpes}

Genital herpes is a chronic, lifelong viral infection. Two types of HSV can cause genital herpes: HSV-1 and HSV-2. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV-2, and $11.9 \%$ of persons aged 14-49 years are estimated to be infected in the United States (436). However, an increasing proportion of anogenital herpetic infections have been attributed to HSV-1, which is especially prominent among young women and MSM (186,437,438).
The majority of persons infected with HSV-2 have not had the condition diagnosed, many of whom have mild or unrecognized infections but shed virus intermittently in the anogenital area. Consequently, most genital herpes infections are transmitted by persons unaware that they have the infection or who are asymptomatic when transmission occurs. Management of genital HSV should address the chronic nature of the infection rather than focusing solely on treating acute episodes of genital lesions.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the self-limited, recurrent, painful, and vesicular or ulcerative lesions classically associated with HSV are absent in many infected persons at the time of clinical evaluation. If genital lesions are present, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by typespecific virologic testing from the lesion by NAAT or culture (186). Recurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for HSV-2 genital herpes infection than for HSV-1 genital herpes (439,440). Therefore, prognosis and counseling depend on which HSV type is present. Type-specific serologic tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of HSV infection in the absence of genital lesions. Both type-specific virologic and type-specific serologic tests for HSV should be available in clinical settings that provide care to persons with or at risk for STIs. HSV-2 genital herpes infection increases the risk for acquiring HIV twofold to threefold; therefore, all persons with genital herpes should be tested for HIV (441).

\section*{Virologic Tests}

HSV NAAT assays are the most sensitive tests because they detect HSV from genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous lesions; these tests are increasingly available (442-444). Although multiple FDA-cleared assays exist for HSV detection, these tests vary in sensitivity from $90.9 \%$ to $100 \%$; however, they are considered highly specific (445-447). PCR is also the test of choice for diagnosing HSV infections affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and systemic infections (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, and neonatal herpes). HSV PCR of the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital herpes infection, except in cases in which concern exists for disseminated infection (e.g., hepatitis). In certain settings, viral culture is the only available virologic test. The sensitivity of viral culture is low, especially for recurrent lesions, and decreases rapidly as lesions begin to heal $(443,448)$. Viral culture isolates and PCR amplicons should be typed to determine whether HSV-1 or HSV-2 is causing the infection. Failure to detect HSV by NAAT or culture, especially in the presence of older lesions or the absence of active lesions, does not indicate an absence of HSV infection because viral shedding is intermittent. Similarly, random or blind genital swabs in the absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital HSV infection because sensitivity is low, and a negative result does not exclude the presence of HSV infection.
Cytologic detection of cellular changes associated with HSV infection is an insensitive and nonspecific method of diagnosing genital lesions (i.e., Tzanck preparation) and therefore should not be relied on. Although a direct immunofluorescence assay using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies is also available for detecting HSV antigen from genital specimens, this assay lacks sensitivity and is not recommended (449).

\section*{Type-Specific Serologic Tests}

Both type-specific and type-common antibodies to HSV develop during the first weeks after infection and persist indefinitely. The majority of available, accurate typespecific HSV serologic assays are based on the HSV-specific glycoprotein G2 (gG2) (HSV-2) and glycoprotein G1 (gG1) (HSV-1). Type-common antibody tests do not distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection; therefore, type-specific serologic assays should be requested (450-452).
Both laboratory-based assays and POC tests that provide results for HSV-2 antibodies from capillary blood or serum during a clinic visit are available. The sensitivity of glycoprotein G type-specific tests for detecting HSV-2 antibody varies from $80 \%$ to $98 \%$; false-negative results might be more frequent at early stages of infection (451,453,454). Therefore, in cases of recent suspected HSV-2 acquisition, repeat typespecific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time of acquisition is indicated. The most commonly used test, HerpeSelect HSV-2 enzyme immunoassay (EIA), often is falsely positive at low index values (1.1-3.0) (457-457). One study reported an overall specificity of $57.4 \%$, with a specificity of $39.8 \%$ for index values of 1.1-2.9 (458). Because of the poor specificity of commercially available type-specific EIAs, particularly with low index values (<3.0), a confirmatory test (Biokit or Western blot) with a second method should be performed before test interpretation. Use of confirmatory testing with the Biokit or the Western blot assays have been reported to improve accuracy of HSV-2 serologic testing (459). The HerpeSelect HSV-2 immunoblot should not be used for confirmation because it uses the same antigen as the HSV-2 EIA. If confirmatory tests are unavailable, patients should be counseled about the limitations of available testing before obtaining serologic tests, and health care providers should be aware that false-positive results occur. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing for HSV-1 or HSV-2 is not useful because IgM tests are not type specific and might be positive during recurrent genital or oral episodes of herpes (460). Therefore, HSV IgM testing is not recommended.
Because approximately all HSV-2 infections are sexually acquired, presence of type-specific HSV-2 antibody implies anogenital infection. In this instance, education and counseling for persons with genital HSV infections should be provided. The presence of HSV-1 antibody alone is more difficult to interpret. HSV-1 serologic testing does not distinguish between oral and genital infection and typically should not be performed for diagnosing genital HSV-1 infection. Persons with HSV-1 antibodies often have oral HSV infection acquired during childhood, which might be asymptomatic. Lack of symptoms in a person who is HSV-1 seropositive does not
distinguish anogenital from orolabial or cutaneous infection, and, regardless of site of infection, these persons remain at risk for acquiring HSV-2. In addition, HSV-1 serologic testing has low sensitivity for detection of HSV-1 antibody (458). However, acquisition of HSV-1 genital herpes is increasing, and HSV-1 genital herpes also can be asymptomatic (437439,461,462). Diagnosis of HSV-1 infection is confirmed by virologic tests from genital lesions.

Type-specific HSV-2 serologic assays for diagnosing HSV-2 are useful in the following scenarios: recurrent or atypical genital symptoms or lesions with a negative HSV PCR or culture result, clinical diagnosis of genital herpes without laboratory confirmation, and a patient's partner has genital herpes. HSV-2 serologic screening among the general population is not recommended. Patients who are at higher risk for infection (e.g., those presenting for an STI evaluation, especially for persons with $\geq 10$ lifetime sex partners, and persons with HIV infection) might need to be assessed for a history of genital herpes symptoms, followed by type-specific HSV serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with genital symptoms.

\section*{Genital Herpes Management}

Antiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic patients and is the mainstay of management. The goals for use of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection are to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences and improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent transmission to sexual partners. Counseling regarding the natural history of genital herpes, risks for sexual and perinatal transmission, and methods for reducing transmission is also integral to clinical management.

Systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and symptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and recurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy. However, these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect the risk, frequency, or severity of recurrences after the drug is discontinued. Randomized trials have indicated that three FDA-approved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit for genital herpes: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (463-471). Valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has enhanced absorption after oral administration, allowing for less frequent dosing than acyclovir. Famciclovir also has high oral bioavailability. Topical therapy with antiviral drugs offers minimal clinical benefit and is discouraged.

\section*{First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes}

Newly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged clinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic involvement. Even persons with first-episode herpes who have
mild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or prolonged symptoms during recurrent infection. Therefore, all patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive antiviral therapy.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Recommended Regimens for First Clinical Episode of Genital Herpes* \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Acyclovir ${ }^{\dagger} 400 \mathrm{mg}$ orally 3 times/day for 7-10 days or \\

\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}

${ }^{\dagger}$ Acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 times/day is also effective but is not recommended because of the frequency of dosing.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes}

Almost all persons with symptomatic first-episode HSV-2 genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of genital lesions. Intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs among persons with HSV-2 genital herpes infection, even those with longstanding clinically silent infection. Antiviral therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions. Certain persons, including those with mild or infrequent recurrent outbreaks, benefit from antiviral therapy; therefore, options for treatment should be discussed. Many persons prefer suppressive therapy, which has the additional advantage of decreasing the risk for transmitting HSV-2 genital herpes to susceptible partners $(472,473)$.

\section*{Suppressive Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes}

Suppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes recurrences by $70 \%-80 \%$ among patients who have frequent recurrences (469-472). Persons receiving such therapy often report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks. Suppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less frequent recurrences. Long-term safety and efficacy have been documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir (474). Quality of life is improved for many patients with frequent recurrences who receive suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment (475). Providers should discuss with patients on an annual basis whether they want to continue suppressive therapy because frequency of genital HSV-2 recurrence diminishes over time for many persons. However, neither treatment discontinuation nor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events and development of HSV antiviral resistance related to longterm antiviral use are uncommon.

Treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate of HSV-2 transmission for discordant heterosexual couples in which a partner has a history of genital HSV-2 infection (473). Such couples should be encouraged to consider suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy for preventing transmission, in addition to consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual activity during recurrences. Suppressive antiviral therapy for persons with a history of symptomatic genital herpes also is likely to reduce transmission when used by those who have multiple partners. HSV-2 seropositive persons without a history of symptomatic genital herpes have a 50\% decreased risk for genital shedding, compared with those with symptomatic genital herpes (476). No data are available regarding efficacy of suppressive therapy for preventing HSV-2 transmission among discordant couples in which a partner has a history of asymptomatic HSV-2 infection identified by a positive HSV-2 serologic test. Among HSV-2 seropositive persons without HIV infection, oral TDF/FTC and intravaginal tenofovir are ineffective at reducing the risk for HSV-2 shedding or recurrences (477).
```
Recommended Regimens for Suppression of Recurrent HSV-2
Genital Herpes
Acyclovir 400 mg orally 2 times/day
    or
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally once a day*
    or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally once a day
    or
Famciclovir 250 mg orally 2 times/day
* Valacyclovir 500 mg once a day might be less effective than other valacyclovir or acyclovir dosing regimens for persons who have frequent recurrences (i.e., $\geq 10$ episodes/year).
```


Famciclovir appears somewhat less effective for suppression of viral shedding (478). Ease of administration and cost also are key considerations for prolonged treatment.

\section*{Recurrent HSV-1 Genital Herpes}

Recurrences are less frequent after the first episode of HSV-1 genital herpes, compared with genital HSV-2 genital herpes, and genital shedding rapidly decreases during the first year of infection (479). No data are available regarding the efficacy of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission among persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection. Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences through shared clinical decisionmaking between the patient and the provider.

\section*{Episodic Therapy for Recurrent HSV-2 Genital Herpes}

Episodic treatment of recurrent herpes is most effective if therapy is initiated within 1 day of lesion onset or during the
prodrome that precedes some outbreaks. The patient should be provided with a supply of drug or a prescription for the medication with instructions to initiate treatment immediately when symptoms begin. Acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir appear equally effective for episodic treatment of genital herpes (466-470).
```
Recommended Regimens for Episodic Therapy for Recurrent
HSV-2 Genital Herpes*
Acyclovir 800 mg orally 2 times/day for 5 days
    or
Acyclovir 800 mg orally 3 times/day for 2 days
    or

2 \text { days }
    or
Famciclovir 125 mg orally 2 times/day for 5 days
    or
Valacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 days
    or
Valacyclovir 1 g orally once daily for 5 days
* Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day for 5 days is also effective but is not
    recommended because of frequency of dosing.
```


\section*{Severe Disease}

Intravenous (IV) acyclovir therapy ( $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV every 8 hours) should be provided for patients who have severe HSV disease or complications that necessitate hospitalization (e.g., disseminated infection, pneumonitis, or hepatitis) or CNS complications (e.g., meningitis or encephalitis). HSV-2 meningitis is a rare complication of HSV-2 genital herpes infection that affects women more than men (480). IV therapy should be considered until clinical improvement followed by oral antiviral therapy to complete $>10$ days of total therapy. Longer duration is recommended for CNS complications. HSV-2 meningitis is characterized clinically by signs of headache, photophobia, fever, meningismus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis, accompanied by mildly elevated protein and normal glucose (481). Optimal therapies for HSV-2 meningitis have not been well studied (482); however, acyclovir $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV every 8 hours until clinical improvement is observed, followed by high-dose oral antiviral therapy (valacyclovir 1 g 3 times/day) to complete a 10- to 14-day course of total therapy, is recommended. For patients with previous episodes of documented HSV-2 meningitis, oral valacyclovir may be used for the entire course during episodes of recurrent HSV-2 meningitis. A randomized clinical trial indicated that suppressive therapy (valacyclovir 500 mg 2 times/day) did not prevent recurrent HSV-2 meningitis episodes; however, the dose might not have been sufficient for CNS penetration (483). Valacyclovir

500 mg 2 times/day is not recommended for suppression of HSV-2 meningitis; higher doses have not been studied in clinical trials. HSV meningitis should be distinguished from encephalitis, which requires a longer course (14-21 days) of IV therapy. Impaired renal function warrants an adjustment in acyclovir dosage.

\section*{Hepatitis}

Hepatitis is a rare manifestation of disseminated HSV infection, often reported among pregnant women who acquire HSV during pregnancy (484). Pregnant women in any trimester can present with fever and hepatitis (markedly elevated transaminases) but might not have any genital or skin lesions. HSV hepatitis is associated with fulminant liver failure and high mortality ( $25 \%$ ). Therefore, a high index of suspicion for HSV is necessary, with a confirmatory diagnosis by HSV PCR from blood (485). Among pregnant women with fever and unexplained severe hepatitis, disseminated HSV infection should be considered, and empiric IV acyclovir should be initiated pending confirmation (484).

\section*{Prevention}

Consistent and correct condom use has been reported in multiple studies to decrease, but not eliminate, the risk for HSV-2 transmission from men to women (486-488). Condoms are less effective for preventing transmission from women to men (489). Two randomized clinical trials of medical male circumcision (MMC) demonstrated a decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition among men in Uganda and South Africa (66,68). Results from a third trial conducted in Kenya did not demonstrate a substantial difference in HSV-2 acquisition among men who received MMC (490). A systematic review indicated high consistency for decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition among women with a male partner who underwent MMC (491). These data indicate that MMC can be associated with decreased risk for HSV-2 acquisition among adult heterosexual men and with decreased risk for HSV-2 transmission from male to female partners.

Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that PrEP with daily oral TDF/FTC decreases the risk for HSV-2 acquisition by 30\% in heterosexual partnerships (492). Pericoital intravaginal tenofovir 1\% gel also decreases the risk for HSV-2 acquisition among heterosexual women (493). Among MSM and transgender women, daily oral TDF/FTC decreases the risk for severe ulcers with symptomatic genital HSV-2 infection but not for HSV-2 acquisition (494). Insufficient evidence exists that TDF/FTC use among those who are not at risk for HIV acquisition will prevent HSV-2 infection, and it should not be used for that sole purpose. Oral TDF does not prevent HSV-2 acquisition among persons with HIV infection who
are taking TDF as part of their ART regimen (495). No data indicate that antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir) can be taken as PrEP by persons without HSV-2 to prevent its acquisition.

\section*{Counseling}

Counseling of persons with genital herpes and their sex partners is crucial for management. The goals of counseling include helping patients cope with the infection and preventing sexual and perinatal transmission. Although initial counseling can be provided at the first visit, patients often benefit from learning about the chronic aspects of the disease after the acute illness subsides. Multiple resources, including Internet sites and printed materials, are available to assist patients, their partners, and clinicians who provide counseling (496,497) (https://www. ashasexualhealth.org and https://www.cdc.gov/std/herpes).

Although the psychological effect of a serologic diagnosis of HSV-2 infection in a person with asymptomatic or unrecognized genital herpes appears minimal and transient (498,499), certain persons with HSV infection might express anxiety concerning genital herpes that does not reflect the actual clinical severity of their disease; the psychological effect of HSV infection can be substantial. Common concerns about genital herpes include the severity of initial clinical manifestations, recurrent episodes, sexual relationships and transmission to sex partners, and ability to bear healthy children.

\section*{Symptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes}

When counseling persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should discuss the following:
- The natural history of the disease, with emphasis on the potential for recurrent episodes, asymptomatic viral shedding, and the attendant risks for sexual transmission of HSV to occur during asymptomatic periods (asymptomatic viral shedding is most frequent during the first 12 months after acquiring HSV-2).
- The effectiveness of daily suppressive antiviral therapy for preventing symptomatic recurrent episodes of genital herpes for persons experiencing a first episode or recurrent genital herpes.
- The effectiveness of daily use of valacyclovir in reducing risk for transmission of HSV-2 among persons without HIV (473) and use of episodic therapy to shorten the duration of recurrent episodes.
- The importance of informing current sex partners about genital herpes and informing future partners before initiating a sexual relationship.
- The importance of abstaining from sexual activity with uninfected partners when lesions or prodromal symptoms are present.
- The effectiveness of male latex condoms, which when used consistently and correctly can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk for genital herpes transmission (486-488).
- The type-specific serologic testing of partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes to determine whether such partners are already HSV seropositive or whether risk for acquiring HSV exists.
- The low risk for neonatal HSV except when genital herpes is acquired late in pregnancy or if prodrome or lesions are present at delivery.
- The increased risk for HIV acquisition among HSV-2 seropositive persons who are exposed to HIV $(76,471)$.
- The lack of effectiveness of episodic or suppressive therapy among persons with HIV infection to reduce risk for transmission to partners who might be at risk for HSV-2 acquisition.

\section*{Asymptomatic HSV-2 Genital Herpes}

When counseling persons with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:
- Asymptomatic persons who receive a diagnosis of HSV-2 by type-specific serologic testing (with confirmatory testing, if needed) should receive education about the symptoms of genital herpes infection (see Diagnostic Considerations).
- Episodic and suppressive antiviral therapies are used predominantly to treat recurrences, prevent recurrences, and prevent transmission to sex partners of persons with symptomatic HSV-2 infection.
- For patients with serological evidence of HSV-2 (with combination testing if needed) without symptomatic recurrences, neither episodic nor suppressive therapy is indicated for prevention of recurrences (see Diagnostic Considerations).
- Among persons with asymptomatic infection, the efficacy of suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-2 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.
- Because of the decreased risk for shedding among those with asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, the benefit of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission is unknown among this population.

\section*{HSV-1 Genital Herpes}

When counseling persons with HSV-1 genital herpes infection, the provider should consider the following:
- Persons with virologic laboratory-documented symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes infection should be educated that the risk for recurrent genital herpes and genital shedding is lower with HSV-1 infection, compared with HSV-2 infection.
- Because of the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding, suppressive therapy for HSV-1 genital herpes should be reserved for those with frequent recurrences.
- For patients with frequently recurring HSV-1 genital herpes, suppressive therapy might be considered. Suppressive therapy to prevent HSV-1 transmission to sex partners has not been studied.
For persons with symptomatic HSV-1 genital herpes or asymptomatic HSV-2 genital herpes, suppressive therapy can be considered for those who have substantial psychosocial distress caused by the diagnosis of genital herpes. For women who have genital herpes, the providers who care for them during pregnancy and those who will care for their newborn infant should be informed of their infection (see Genital Herpes During Pregnancy).

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

The sex partners of persons who have symptomatic genital herpes can benefit from evaluation and counseling. Symptomatic sex partners should be evaluated and treated in the same manner as patients who have symptomatic genital herpes. Asymptomatic sex partners of patients who have symptomatic genital herpes should be asked about a history of genital symptoms and offered type-specific serologic testing for HSV-2. For partners without genital herpes, no data are available on which to base a recommendation for PEP or PrEP with antiviral medications or that they would prevent acquisition, and this should not be offered to patients as a prevention strategy.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions}

Allergic and other adverse reactions to oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are rare. Desensitization to acyclovir has been described (500).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Immunocompromised patients can have prolonged or severe episodes of genital, perianal, or oral herpes. Lesions caused by HSV are common among persons with HIV infection and might be severe, painful, and atypical (501). HSV shedding is increased among persons with HIV infection (502). Whereas ART reduces the severity and frequency of symptomatic genital herpes, frequent subclinical shedding still occurs $(503,504)$. Clinical manifestations of genital herpes might worsen during immune reconstitution early after initiation of ART. HSV-2 type-specific serologic testing can be considered for persons with HIV infection during their initial evaluation, particularly among those with a history of genital symptoms indicative of HSV infection.

Recommended therapy for first-episode genital herpes is the same as for persons without HIV infection, although treatment courses might need to be extended for lesion resolution. Suppressive or episodic therapy with oral antiviral agents is effective in decreasing the clinical manifestations of HSV infection among persons with HIV $(503,504)$. The risk for GUD increases during the first 6 months after starting ART, especially among persons who have a $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+} \mathrm{T}$-cell count $<200 \mathrm{cell} / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the risk for GUD among this population and can be continued for 6 months after ART initiation (504) when the risk for GUD returns to baseline levels. Suppressive antiviral therapy among persons with HIV and HSV infection does not reduce the risk for either HIV transmission or HSV-2 transmission to susceptible sex partners $(88,505)$. Suppressive antiviral therapy does not delay HIV disease progression and is not associated with decreased risk for HIV-related inflammation among persons taking ART (506). For severe HSV disease, initiating therapy with acyclovir $5-10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV every 8 hours might be necessary.

\section*{Antiviral-Resistant HSV Infection}

If lesions persist or recur in a patient receiving antiviral treatment, acyclovir resistance should be suspected and a viral culture obtained for phenotypic sensitivity testing (507). Molecular testing for acyclovir resistance is not available. Such persons should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist, and alternative therapy should be administered. All acyclovir-resistant strains are also resistant to valacyclovir, and the majority are resistant to famciclovir. Foscarnet ( $40-80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV every 8 hours until clinical resolution is attained) is the treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant genital herpes $(508,509)$. Intravenous cidofovir $5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight once weekly might also be effective. Foscarnet and cidofovir are nephrotoxic medications that require intensive laboratory monitoring and infectious
disease specialist consultation. Imiquimod 5\% applied to the lesion for 8 hours 3 times/week until clinical resolution is an alternative that has been reported to be effective $(510,511)$. Topical cidofovir gel 1\% can be applied to lesions 2-4 times daily; however, cidofovir must be compounded at a pharmacy (512).

Prevention of antiviral resistance remains challenging among persons with HIV infection. Experience with another group of immunocompromised persons (e.g., hematopoietic stemcell recipients) demonstrated that persons receiving daily suppressive antiviral therapy were less likely to experience acyclovir-resistant HSV infection compared with those who received episodic therapy for outbreaks (513).

\section*{Genital Herpes During Pregnancy}

Prevention of neonatal herpes depends both on preventing acquisition of genital herpes during late pregnancy and avoiding exposure of the neonate to herpetic lesions and viral shedding during delivery. Mothers of newborns who acquire neonatal herpes often lack histories of clinically evident genital herpes $(514,515)$. The risk for transmission to the neonate from an infected mother is high ( $30 \%-50 \%$ ) among women who acquire genital herpes near the time of delivery and low ( $<1 \%$ ) among women with prenatal histories of recurrent herpes or who acquire genital herpes during the first half of pregnancy (516,517). Women who acquire HSV in the second half of pregnancy should be managed in consultation with maternalfetal medicine and infectious disease specialists.

All pregnant women should be asked whether they have a history of genital herpes or genital symptoms concerning for HSV infection. At the onset of labor, all women should be questioned thoroughly about symptoms of genital herpes, including prodromal symptoms (e.g., pain or burning at site before appearance of lesion), and all women should be examined thoroughly for herpetic lesions. Women without symptoms or signs of genital herpes or its prodrome can deliver vaginally. Although cesarean delivery does not eliminate the risk for HSV transmission to the neonate (517), women with recurrent genital herpetic lesions at the onset of labor should have a cesarean delivery to reduce the risk for neonatal HSV infection.

Routine HSV-2 serologic screening of pregnant women is not recommended. Women without known genital herpes should be counseled to abstain from vaginal intercourse during the third trimester with partners known to have or suspected of having genital herpes. In addition, to prevent HSV-1 genital herpes, pregnant women without known orolabial herpes should be advised to abstain from receptive oral sex during the third trimester with partners known to have or suspected to have orolabial herpes. Type-specific serologic tests can be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk for HSV infection and for guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital
herpes during pregnancy. For example, such testing might be offered to a woman with no history of genital herpes whose sex partner has HSV infection. Many fetuses are exposed to acyclovir each year, and the medication is believed to be safe for use during all trimesters of pregnancy. A case-control study reported an increased risk for the rare neonatal outcome of gastroschisis among women who used antiviral medications between the month before conception and the third month of pregnancy (518). Acyclovir is also believed to be safe during breastfeeding (431,519). Although data regarding prenatal exposure to valacyclovir and famciclovir are limited, data from animal trials indicate that these drugs also pose a low risk among pregnant women (520). Acyclovir can be administered orally to pregnant women with first-episode genital herpes or recurrent herpes and should be administered IV to pregnant women with severe HSV (see Genital Herpes, Hepatitis). Suppressive acyclovir treatment starting at 36 weeks' gestation reduces the frequency of cesarean delivery among women who have recurrent genital herpes by diminishing the frequency of recurrences at term (521-523). However, such treatment might not protect against transmission to neonates in all cases (524). No data support use of antiviral therapy among asymptomatic HSV-seropositive women without a history of genital herpes. In addition, the effectiveness of antiviral therapy among sex partners with a history of genital herpes to decrease the risk for HSV transmission to a pregnant woman has not been studied. Additional information on the clinical management of genital herpes in pregnancy is available through existing guidelines (525).

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Recommended Regimen for Suppression of Recurrent Genital Herpes Among Pregnant Women* \\
\hline Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times/day or Valacyclovir 500 mg orally 2 times/day \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Neonatal Herpes}

Newborn infants exposed to HSV during birth, as documented by virologic testing of maternal lesions at delivery or presumed by observation of maternal lesions, should be followed clinically in consultation with a pediatric infectious disease specialist. Detailed guidance is available regarding management of neonates who are delivered vaginally in the presence of maternal genital herpes lesions and is beyond the scope of these guidelines; more information is available from the AAP (https://redbook.solutions.aap.org). Surveillance cultures or PCR of mucosal surfaces of the neonate to detect HSV infection might be considered before the development of
clinical signs of neonatal herpes to guide treatment initiation. In addition, administration of acyclovir might be considered for neonates born to women who acquired HSV near term because the risk for neonatal herpes is high for these newborn infants. All newborn infants who have neonatal herpes should be promptly evaluated and treated with systemic acyclovir. The recommended regimen for infants treated for known or suspected neonatal herpes is acyclovir $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV every 8 hours for 14 days if disease is limited to the skin and mucous membranes, or for 21 days for disseminated disease and disease involving the CNS.

\section*{Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis)}

Granuloma inguinale (donovanosis) is a genital ulcerative disease caused by the intracellular gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella granulomatis (formerly known as Calymmatobacterium granulomatis). The disease occurs rarely in the United States; however, sporadic cases have been described in India, South Africa, and South America (526-535). Although granuloma inguinale was previously endemic in Australia, it is now extremely rare $(536,537)$. Clinically, the disease is characterized as painless, slowly progressive ulcerative lesions on the genitals or perineum without regional lymphadenopathy; subcutaneous granulomas (pseudobuboes) also might occur. The lesions are highly vascular (i.e., beefy red appearance) and can bleed. Extragenital infection can occur with infection extension to the pelvis, or it can disseminate to intra-abdominal organs, bones, or the mouth. The lesions also can develop secondary bacterial infection and can coexist with other sexually transmitted pathogens.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

The causative organism of granuloma inguinale is difficult to culture, and diagnosis requires visualization of dark-staining Donovan bodies on tissue crush preparation or biopsy. Although no FDA-cleared molecular tests for the detection of K. granulomatis DNA exist, molecular assays might be useful for identifying the causative agent.

\section*{Treatment}

Multiple antimicrobial regimens have been effective; however, only a limited number of controlled trials have been published (538). Treatment has been reported to halt progression of lesions, and healing typically proceeds inward from the ulcer margins. Prolonged therapy is usually required to permit granulation and reepithelialization of the ulcers. Relapse can occur 6-18 months after apparently effective therapy.

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Granuloma Inguinale (Donovanosis)}

Azithromycin 1 g orally once/week or 500 mg daily for $>3$ weeks and until all lesions have completely healed

\section*{Alternative Regimens}

Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for at least 3 weeks and until all lesions have completely healed
or
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 times/day for $>3$ weeks and until all lesions have completely healed
or
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole one double-strength ( $160 \mathrm{mg} / 800$
mg ) tablet orally 2 time/day for $>3$ weeks and until all lesions have
completely healed

The addition of another antibiotic to these regimens can be considered if improvement is not evident within the first few days of therapy.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms have resolved. All persons who receive a diagnosis of granuloma inguinale should be tested for HIV.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms resolve.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has granuloma inguinale within the 60 days before onset of the patient's symptoms should be examined and offered therapy. However, the value of empiric therapy in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms has not been established.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Use of doxycycline in pregnancy might be associated with discoloration of teeth; however, the risk is not well defined. Doxycycline is compatible with breastfeeding (431). Sulfonamides can be associated with neonatal kernicterus among those with glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase deficiency and should be avoided during the third trimester and while breastfeeding (431). For these reasons, pregnant and lactating women with granuloma inguinale should be treated with a macrolide regimen (erythromycin or azithromycin).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with granuloma inguinale and HIV infection should receive the same regimens as those who do not have HIV.

\section*{Lymphogranuloma Venereum}

LGV is caused by C. trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3 $(539,540)$. LGV can cause severe inflammation and invasive infection, in contrast with C. trachomatis serovars A-K that cause mild or asymptomatic infection. Clinical manifestations of LGV can include GUD, lymphadenopathy, or proctocolitis. Rectal exposure among MSM or women can result in proctocolitis, which is the most common presentation of LGV infection (541), and can mimic inflammatory bowel disease with clinical findings of mucoid or hemorrhagic rectal discharge, anal pain, constipation, fever, or tenesmus $(542,543)$. Outbreaks of LGV proctocolitis have been reported among MSM with high rates of HIV infection (544-547). LGV proctocolitis can be an invasive, systemic infection and, if it is not treated early, can lead to chronic colorectal fistulas and strictures; reactive arthropathy has also been reported. However, reports indicate that rectal LGV can also be asymptomatic (548). A common clinical manifestation of LGV among heterosexuals is tender inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral. A self-limited genital ulcer or papule sometimes occurs at the site of inoculation. However, by the time persons seek care, the lesions have often disappeared. LGV-associated lymphadenopathy can be severe, with bubo formation from fluctuant or suppurative inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy. Oral ulceration can occur and might be associated with cervical adenopathy (549-551). Persons with genital or colorectal LGV lesions can also experience secondary bacterial infection or can be infected with other sexually and nonsexually transmitted pathogens.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

A definitive LGV diagnosis can be made only with LGVspecific molecular testing (e.g., PCR-based genotyping). These tests can differentiate LGV from non-LGV C. trachomatis in rectal specimens. However, these tests are not widely available, and results are not typically available in a time frame that would influence clinical management. Therefore, diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion, epidemiologic information, and a C. trachomatis NAAT at the symptomatic anatomic site, along with exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis, inguinal lymphadenopathy, or genital, oral, or rectal ulcers $(551,552)$. Genital or oral lesions, rectal specimens, and lymph node specimens (i.e., lesion swab or bubo aspirate) can be tested for C. trachomatis by NAAT or culture. NAAT is the preferred approach for testing because it can detect both LGV strains and non-LGV C. trachomatis strains (553). Therefore, all persons presenting with proctocolitis should be tested for chlamydia with a NAAT performed on rectal specimens. Severe symptoms of proctocolitis (e.g., bloody discharge, tenesmus, and rectal
ulcers) indicate LGV. A rectal Gram stain with >10 white blood cells (WBCs) has also been associated with rectal LGV (545,554,555).

Chlamydia serology (complement fixation or microimmunofluorescence) should not be used routinely as a diagnostic tool for LGV because the utility of these serologic methods has not been established, interpretation has not been standardized, and validation for clinical proctitis presentation has not been done. It might support an LGV diagnosis in cases of isolated inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy for which diagnostic material for C. trachomatis NAAT cannot be obtained.

\section*{Treatment}

At the time of the initial visit (before diagnostic NAATs for chlamydia are available), persons with a clinical syndrome consistent with LGV should be presumptively treated. Presumptive treatment for LGV is indicated among patients with symptoms or signs of proctocolitis (e.g., bloody discharge, tenesmus, or ulceration); in cases of severe inguinal lymphadenopathy with bubo formation, particularly if the patient has a recent history of a genital ulcer; or in the presence of a genital ulcer if other etiologies have been ruled out. The goal of treatment is to cure infection and prevent ongoing tissue damage, although tissue reaction to the infection can result in scarring. Buboes might require aspiration through intact skin or incision and drainage to prevent formation of inguinal or femoral ulcerations.

Recommended Regimen for Lymphogranuloma Venereum
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 21 days

\section*{Alternative Regimens}

Azithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks*
or
Erythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 times/day for 21 days
* Because this regimen has not been validated, a test of cure with C. trachomatis NAAT 4 weeks after completion of treatment can be considered.

The optimal treatment duration for symptomatic LGV has not been studied in clinical trials. The recommended 21-day course of doxycycline is based on long-standing clinical practice and is highly effective, with an estimated cure rate of $>98.5 \% (555,556)$. Shorter courses of doxycycline might be effective on the basis of a small retrospective study of MSM with rectal LGV, 50\% of whom were symptomatic, who received a 7- to 14-day course of doxycycline and had a 97\% cure rate (558). Randomized prospective studies of shorter-course doxycycline for treating LGV are needed. Longer courses of therapy might be required in the setting of fistulas, buboes, and other forms of severe disease (559).

A small nonrandomized study from Spain involving patients with rectal LGV demonstrated cure rates of $97 \%$ with a regimen of azithromycin 1 g once weekly for 3 weeks (560). Pharmacokinetic data support this dosing strategy (561); however, this regimen has not been validated. Fluoroquinolonebased treatments also might be effective; however, the optimal duration of treatment has not been evaluated. The clinical significance of asymptomatic LGV is unknown, and it is effectively treated with a 7-day course of doxycycline (562).

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Patients should be followed clinically until signs and symptoms have resolved. Persons who receive an LGV diagnosis should be tested for other STIs, especially HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Those whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

\section*{Follow-Up}

All persons who have been treated for LGV should be retested for chlamydia approximately 3 months after treatment. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, providers should retest at the patient's next visit for medical care within the 12 -month period after initial treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who has LGV within the 60 days before onset of the patient's symptoms should be evaluated, examined, and tested for chlamydial infection, depending on anatomic site of exposure. Asymptomatic partners should be presumptively treated with a chlamydia regimen (doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days).

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Use of doxycycline in pregnancy might be associated with discoloration of teeth; however, the risk is not well defined (563). Doxycycline is compatible with breastfeeding (431). Azithromycin might prove useful for LGV treatment during pregnancy, at a presumptive dose of 1 g weekly for 3 weeks; no published data are available regarding an effective dose and duration of treatment. Pregnant and lactating women with LGV can be treated with erythromycin, although this regimen is associated with frequent gastrointestinal side effects. Pregnant women treated for LGV should have a test of cure performed 4 weeks after the initial C. trachomatis NAAT-positive test.

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with LGV and HIV infection should receive the same regimens as those who do not have HIV. Prolonged therapy might be required because a delay in resolution of symptoms might occur.

\section*{Syphilis}

Syphilis is a systemic disease caused by T. pallidum. The disease has been divided into stages on the basis of clinical findings, which guide treatment and follow-up. Persons who have syphilis might seek treatment for signs or symptoms. Primary syphilis classically presents as a single painless ulcer or chancre at the site of infection but can also present with multiple, atypical, or painful lesions (564). Secondary syphilis manifestations can include skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions, and lymphadenopathy. Tertiary syphilis can present with cardiac involvement, gummatous lesions, tabes dorsalis, and general paresis.

Latent infections (i.e., those lacking clinical manifestations) are detected by serologic testing. Latent syphilis acquired within the preceding year is referred to as early latent syphilis; all other cases of latent syphilis are classified as late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration.
T. pallidum can infect the CNS, which can occur at any stage of syphilis and result in neurosyphilis. Early neurologic clinical manifestations or syphilitic meningitis (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, meningovascular syphilis, stroke, and acute altered mental status) are usually present within the first few months or years of infection. Late neurologic manifestations (e.g., tabes dorsalis and general paresis) occur 10 to >30 years after infection.

Infection of the visual system (ocular syphilis) or auditory system (otosyphilis) can occur at any stage of syphilis but is commonly identified during the early stages and can present with or without additional CNS involvement. Ocular syphilis often presents as panuveitis but can involve structures in both the anterior and posterior segment of the eye, including conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, posterior interstitial keratitis, optic neuropathy, and retinal vasculitis. Ocular syphilis can result in permanent vision loss. Otosyphilis typically presents with cochleo-vestibular symptoms, including tinnitus, vertigo, and sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral, have a sudden onset, and progress rapidly. Otosyphilis can result in permanent hearing loss.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Darkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting T. pallidum directly from lesion exudate or tissue are the definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and congenital syphilis (565). Although no T. pallidum directdetection molecular NAATs are commercially available, certain laboratories provide locally developed and validated PCR tests for detecting T. pallidum DNA. A presumptive diagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic tests: a nontreponemal test (i.e., Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test) and a treponemal test (i.e., the T. pallidum passive particle agglutination [TP-PA] assay, various EIAs, chemiluminescence immunoassays [CIAs] and immunoblots, or rapid treponemal assays) (566-568). At least 18 treponemal-specific tests are cleared for use in the United States. Use of only one type of serologic test (nontreponemal or treponemal) is insufficient for diagnosis and can result in false-negative results among persons tested during primary syphilis and false-positive results among persons without syphilis or previously treated syphilis.

\section*{Nontreponemal Tests and Traditional Algorithm}

False-positive nontreponemal test results can be associated with multiple medical conditions and factors unrelated to syphilis, including other infections (e.g., HIV), autoimmune conditions, vaccinations, injecting drug use, pregnancy, and older age $(566,569)$. Therefore, persons with a reactive nontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test to confirm the syphilis diagnosis (i.e., traditional algorithm). Nontreponemal test antibody titers might correlate with disease activity and are used for monitoring treatment response. Serum should be diluted to identify the highest titer, and results should be reported quantitatively. A fourfold change in titer, equivalent to a change of two dilutions (e.g., from 1:16 to 1:4 or from 1:8 to $1: 32$ ), is considered necessary for demonstrating a clinically significant difference between two nontreponemal test results obtained by using the same serologic test, preferably from the same manufacturer to avoid variation in results. Sequential serologic tests for a patient should be performed using the same testing method (VDRL or RPR), preferably by the same laboratory. VDRL and RPR are equally valid assays; however, quantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared directly with each other because the methods are different, and RPR titers frequently are slightly higher than VDRL titers.

Nontreponemal test titers usually decrease after treatment and might become nonreactive with time. However, for certain persons, nontreponemal antibodies might decrease less than fourfold after treatment (i.e., inadequate serologic response) or might decline appropriately but fail to serorevert and
persist for a long period. Atypical nontreponemal serologic test results (e.g., unusually high, unusually low, or fluctuating titers) might occur regardless of HIV status. When serologic tests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of primary, secondary, or latent syphilis, presumptive treatment is recommended for persons with risk factors for syphilis, and use of other tests (e.g., biopsy for histology and immunostaining and PCR of lesion) should be considered. For the majority of persons with HIV infection, serologic tests are accurate and reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response to treatment.

\section*{Treponemal Tests and Reverse Sequence Algorithm}

The majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives, regardless of adequate treatment or disease activity. However, $15 \%-25 \%$ of patients treated during the primary stage revert to being serologically nonreactive after 2-3 years (570). Treponemal antibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore should not be used for this purpose.
Clinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic samples by using automated treponemal immunoassays, typically by EIA or CIA (571-573). This reverse sequence algorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously treated for syphilis, those with untreated or incompletely treated syphilis, and those with false-positive results that can occur with a low likelihood of infection (574). Persons with a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management decisions. If the nontreponemal test is negative, the laboratory should perform a treponemal test different from the one used for initial testing, preferably TP-PA or treponemal assay based on different antigens than the original test, to adjudicate the results of the initial test.
If a second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive), persons with a history of previous treatment will require no further management unless sexual history indicates a reexposure. In this instance, a repeat nontreponemal test 2-4 weeks after a confirmed medical history and physical examination is recommended to evaluate for early infection. Those without a history of treatment for syphilis should be offered treatment. Unless a medical history or results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection, previously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis.
If the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, TP-PA nonreactive) and the epidemiologic
risk and clinical probability for syphilis are low, further evaluation or treatment is not indicated.

Multiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index values or high signal-to-cutoff ratio from treponemal EIA or CIA tests correlate with TP-PA positivity, which might eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing; however, the range of index values varies among different treponemal immunoassays, and the values that correspond to high levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ by immunoassay (567,575-582).

\section*{Cerebrospinal Fluid Evaluation}

Further testing with CSF evaluation is warranted for persons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, stroke, acute or chronic altered mental status, or loss of vibration sense). All patients with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology need a full ocular examination, including cranial nerve evaluation. If cranial nerve dysfunction is present, a CSF evaluation is needed. Among persons with isolated ocular symptoms (i.e., no cranial nerve dysfunction or other neurologic abnormalities), confirmed ocular abnormalities on examination, and reactive syphilis serology, a CSF examination is unnecessary before treatment. CSF analysis can be helpful in evaluating persons with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology who do not have ocular findings or cranial nerve dysfunction on examination. Among patients with isolated auditory abnormalities and reactive syphilis serology, CSF evaluation is likely to be normal and is unnecessary before treatment $(583,584)$.

Laboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of neurosyphilis; however, no single test can be used to diagnose neurosyphilis in all instances. Diagnosis of neurosyphilis depends on a combination of CSF tests (e.g., CSF cell count, protein, or reactive CSF-VDRL) in the presence of reactive serologic test (nontreponemal and treponemal) results and neurologic signs and symptoms. CSF laboratory abnormalities are common for persons with early syphilis and are of unknown medical significance in the absence of neurologic signs or symptoms (585). CSF-VDRL is highly specific but insensitive. For a person with neurologic signs or symptoms, a reactive CSF-VDRL (in the absence of blood contamination) is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis.

When CSF-VDRL is negative despite clinical signs of neurosyphilis, reactive serologic tests results, lymphocytic pleocytosis, or protein, neurosyphilis should be considered. In that instance, additional evaluation by using fluorescent treponemal-antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) or TP-PA testing on CSF might be warranted. The CSF FTA-ABS test is less specific for neurosyphilis than the CSF-VDRL but is highly sensitive. Fewer data are available regarding CSF TP-PA;
however, the sensitivity and specificity appear similar to the CSF FTA-ABS (586). Neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with a negative CSF FTA-ABS or TP-PA test, especially among persons with nonspecific neurologic signs and symptoms (587).
Among persons with HIV infection, CSF leukocyte count can be elevated ( $>5 \mathrm{WBCs} / \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ); the association with CSF leukocyte count and plasma HIV viral suppression has not been well characterized. Using a higher cutoff ( $>20$ WBCs $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ) might improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis among this population (588).

\section*{Treatment}

Penicillin G, administered parenterally, is the preferred drug for treating patients in all stages of syphilis. The preparation used (i.e., benzathine, aqueous procaine, or aqueous crystalline), dosage, and length of treatment depend on the stage and clinical manifestations of the disease. Treatment for late latent syphilis ( $>1$ years' duration) and tertiary syphilis requires a longer duration of therapy because organisms theoretically might be dividing more slowly (the validity of this rationale has not been assessed). Longer treatment duration is required for persons with latent syphilis of unknown duration to ensure that those who did not acquire syphilis within the preceding year are adequately treated.
Selection of the appropriate penicillin preparation is important because T. pallidum can reside in sequestered sites (e.g., the CNS and aqueous humor) that are poorly accessed by certain forms of penicillin. Combinations of benzathine penicillin, procaine penicillin, and oral penicillin preparations are not considered appropriate for syphilis treatment. Reports have indicated that practitioners have inadvertently prescribed combination long- and short-acting benzathine-procaine penicillin (Bicillin C-R) instead of the standard benzathine penicillin product (Bicillin L-A) recommended in the United States for treating primary, secondary, and latent syphilis. Practitioners, pharmacists, and purchasing agents should be aware of the similar names of these two products to avoid using the incorrect combination therapy agent for treating syphilis (589).
Penicillin's effectiveness for treating syphilis was well established through clinical experience even before the value of randomized controlled clinical trials was recognized. Therefore, approximately all recommendations for treating syphilis are based not only on clinical trials and observational studies, but on many decades of clinical experience.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Parenteral penicillin G is the only therapy with documented efficacy for syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women with syphilis at any stage who report penicillin allergy should be desensitized and treated with penicillin (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

\section*{Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction}

The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction frequently accompanied by headache, myalgia, and fever that can occur within the first 24 hours after the initiation of any syphilis therapy; it is a reaction to treatment and not an allergic reaction to penicillin. Patients should be informed about this possible adverse reaction and how to manage it if it occurs. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction occurs most frequently among persons who have early syphilis, presumably because bacterial loads are higher during these stages. Antipyretics can be used to manage symptoms; however, they have not been proven to prevent this reaction. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction might induce early labor or cause fetal distress in pregnant women; however, this should not prevent or delay therapy (590) (see Syphilis During Pregnancy).

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Sexual transmission of T. pallidum is thought to occur only when mucocutaneous syphilitic lesions are present. Such manifestations are uncommon after the first year of infection. Persons exposed through sexual contact with a person who has primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically and treated according to the following recommendations:
- Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who receives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis <90 days before the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis, even if serologic test results are negative.
- Persons who have had sexual contact with a person who receives a diagnosis of primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis $>90$ days before the diagnosis should be treated presumptively for early syphilis if serologic test results are not immediately available and the opportunity for follow-up is uncertain. If serologic tests are negative, no treatment is needed. If serologic tests are positive, treatment should be based on clinical and serologic evaluation and syphilis stage.
- In certain areas or among populations with high syphilis infection rates, health departments recommend notification and presumptive treatment of sex partners of persons with
syphilis of unknown duration who have high nontreponemal serologic test titers (i.e., >1:32) because high titers might be indicative of early syphilis. These partners should be managed as if the index patient had early syphilis.
- Long-term sex partners of persons who have late latent syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically for syphilis and treated on the basis of the evaluation's findings.
- The following sex partners of persons with syphilis are considered at risk for infection and should be confidentially notified of the exposure and need for evaluation: partners who have had sexual contact within 3 months plus the duration of symptoms for persons who receive a diagnosis of primary syphilis, within 6 months plus duration of symptoms for those with secondary syphilis, and within 1 year for persons with early latent syphilis.

\section*{Primary and Secondary Syphilis}

\section*{Treatment}

Parenteral penicillin G has been used effectively for achieving clinical resolution (i.e., the healing of lesions and prevention of sexual transmission) and for preventing late sequelae. However, no comparative trials have been conducted to guide selection of an optimal penicillin regimen. Substantially fewer data are available for nonpenicillin regimens.

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Primary and Secondary Syphilis* Among Adults}

Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a single dose
* Recommendations for treating syphilis among persons with HIV infection and pregnant women are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection; Syphilis During Pregnancy).

Available data demonstrate that use of additional doses of benzathine penicillin G, amoxicillin, or other antibiotics do not enhance efficacy of this recommended regimen when used to treat primary and secondary syphilis, regardless of HIV status (591-593).

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Syphilis Among Infants and Children}

Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM, up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units in a single dose

Infants and children aged $\geq 1$ month who receive a syphilis diagnosis should have birth and maternal medical records reviewed to assess whether they have congenital or acquired syphilis (see Congenital Syphilis). Infants and children aged $\geq 1$ month with primary and secondary syphilis should be managed by a pediatric infectious disease specialist and evaluated for sexual abuse (e.g., through consultation with child protective services) (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

All persons who have primary and secondary syphilis should be tested for HIV at the time of diagnosis and treatment. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP. In geographic areas in which HIV prevalence is high, persons who have primary or secondary syphilis should be offered PrEP and retested for HIV in 3 months if the initial HIV test result was negative.
Persons who have syphilis and symptoms or signs indicating neurologic disease (e.g., cranial nerve dysfunction, meningitis, stroke, or altered mental state) should have an evaluation that includes CSF analysis. Persons with syphilis who have symptoms or signs of ocular syphilis (e.g., uveitis, iritis, neuroretinitis, or optic neuritis) should have a thorough cranial nerve examination and ocular slit-lamp and ophthalmologic examinations. CSF evaluation is not always needed for persons with ocular syphilis if no evidence of cranial nerves $2,3,4$, 5 , and 6 dysfunction or other evidence of neurologic disease exists. If symptoms and signs of otic syphilis are present then an otologic examination is needed; CSF evaluation in persons with otic syphilis does not aid in the clinical management and therefore is not recommended (see Cerebrospinal Fluid Evaluation). Treatment should be guided by the results of these evaluations. Invasion of CSF by T. pallidum accompanied by CSF laboratory abnormalities is common among adults who have primary or secondary syphilis but has unknown medical significance (585). In the absence of clinical neurologic findings, no evidence supports variation from the recommended treatment regimen for primary or secondary syphilis. Symptomatic neurosyphilis after treatment with the penicillin regimens recommended for primary and secondary syphilis is rare. Therefore, unless clinical signs or symptoms of neurologic or ophthalmic involvement are present, routine CSF analysis is not recommended for persons who have primary or secondary syphilis.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Clinical and serologic evaluation should be performed at 6 and 12 months after treatment; more frequent evaluation might be prudent if opportunity for follow-up is uncertain or if repeat infection is a clinical concern. Serologic response (i.e., titer) should be compared with the titer at the time of treatment. However, assessing serologic response to treatment can be difficult, and definitive criteria for cure or failure by serologic criteria have not been well established. In addition, nontreponemal test titers might decrease more slowly for persons previously treated for syphilis $(594,595)$.
Persons who have signs or symptoms that persist or recur and those with at least a fourfold increase in nontreponemal
test titer persisting for $>2$ weeks likely were reinfected or experienced treatment failure. Among persons who have neurologic findings or persons with no neurologic findings without any reported sexual exposure during the previous 3-6 months indicating that treatment failure might be possible, a CSF examination is recommended with treatment guided by CSF findings. These persons should also be reevaluated for HIV infection.
Among persons with no neurologic findings after a thorough neurologic examination and who are sexually active, reinfection is likely and repeat treatment for early syphilis is recommended. These persons should also be reevaluated for HIV infection.
Failure of nontreponemal test titers to decrease fourfold within 12 months after therapy for primary or secondary syphilis (inadequate serologic response) might be indicative of treatment failure. However, clinical trial data have demonstrated that $10 \%-20 \%$ of persons with primary and secondary syphilis treated with the recommended therapy will not achieve the fourfold decrease in nontreponemal titer within 12 months after treatment (591,596,597). Serologic response to treatment appears to be associated with multiple factors, including the person's syphilis stage (earlier stages are more likely to decrease fourfold and become nonreactive), initial nontreponemal antibody titers (titers $<1: 8$ are less likely to decline fourfold than higher titers), and age (titers among older patients might be less likely to decrease fourfold than those of younger patients) (596-598). Optimal management of persons who have an inadequate serologic response after syphilis treatment is unclear. At a minimum, these persons should receive additional neurologic examinations, clinical and serologic follow-up annually, and reevaluation for HIV infection. If neurologic symptoms or signs are identified, a CSF evaluation is recommended, with findings guiding management. If additional follow-up cannot be ensured, retreatment is recommended. Because treatment failure might be the result of unrecognized CNS infection, CSF examination can be considered in situations in which follow-up is uncertain.
For retreatment, weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units intramuscularly (IM) for 3 weeks is recommended, unless CSF examination indicates that neurosyphilis is present (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Serologic titers might not decrease, despite a negative CSF examination and a repeated 3-week therapy course (599). In these circumstances, the benefit of additional therapy or repeated CSF examinations is unclear, and it is not typically recommended. Serologic and clinical monitoring at least annually should continue to monitor for any sustained increases in nontreponemal titer.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

Data to support use of alternatives to penicillin in treating primary and secondary syphilis are limited. However, multiple therapies might be effective for nonpregnant persons with penicillin allergy who have primary or secondary syphilis. Doxycycline ( 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days) $(600,601)$ and tetracycline ( 500 mg orally 4 times/day for 14 days) have been used for years and can be effective. Compliance is likely to be better with doxycycline than tetracycline because tetracycline can cause more gastrointestinal side effects and requires more frequent dosing. Limited clinical studies, along with biologic and pharmacologic evidence, indicate that ceftriaxone ( 1 g daily either IM or IV for 10 days) is effective for treating primary and secondary syphilis; however, the optimal dose and duration of ceftriaxone therapy have not been defined (602,603). Azithromycin as a single 2-g oral dose has been effective for treating primary and secondary syphilis among certain populations (602,604,605). However, because of T. pallidum chromosomal mutations associated with azithromycin and other macrolide resistance and documented treatment failures in multiple U.S. geographic areas, azithromycin should not be used as treatment for syphilis (606-608). Thorough clinical and serologic follow-up of persons receiving any alternative therapy is essential.
Persons with a penicillin allergy whose compliance with therapy or follow-up cannot be ensured should be desensitized and treated with benzathine penicillin G. Skin testing for penicillin allergy might be useful in circumstances in which the reagents and expertise are available for performing the test adequately (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

\section*{Pregnancy}

Pregnant women with primary or secondary syphilis who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk for acute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy; Syphilis During Pregnancy).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with HIV infection who have primary or secondary syphilis should be treated similarly to those without HIV (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection).

\section*{Latent Syphilis}

Latent syphilis is defined as syphilis characterized by seroreactivity without other evidence of primary, secondary, or tertiary disease. Persons who have latent syphilis and who acquired syphilis during the preceding year are classified as having early latent syphilis (early nonprimary, nonsecondary). Persons can receive a diagnosis of early latent syphilis if, during the year preceding the diagnosis, they had a documented seroconversion or a sustained ( $>2$ weeks) fourfold or greater increase in nontreponemal test titers in a previously treated person; unequivocal symptoms of primary or secondary syphilis; or a sex partner documented to have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis. In addition, for persons with reactive nontreponemal and treponemal tests whose only possible exposure occurred during the previous 12 months, early latent syphilis can be assumed.
In the absence of these conditions associated with latent syphilis, an asymptomatic person should be considered to have latent syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis (>1 year's duration). Nontreponemal serologic titers usually are higher early in the course of syphilis infection. However, early latent syphilis cannot be reliably diagnosed solely on the basis of nontreponemal titers. All persons with latent syphilis should have careful examination of all accessible mucosal surfaces to evaluate for mucosal lesions (primary or secondary syphilis) before making a latent syphilis diagnosis. Physical examination should include the oral cavity, perianal area, perineum, rectum, and genitals (vagina and cervix for women; scrotum, penis, and underneath the foreskin for uncircumcised men).

\section*{Treatment}

Because latent syphilis is not transmitted sexually, the objective of treating persons in this disease stage is to prevent medical complications of syphilis. Latent syphilis can also be vertically transmitted to a fetus; therefore, the goal of treating a pregnant woman is to prevent congenital syphilis. Although clinical experience supports the effectiveness of penicillin in achieving this goal, limited evidence is available for guiding choice of specific regimens or duration. Available data demonstrate that additional doses of benzathine penicillin G, amoxicillin, or other antibiotics in early latent syphilis do not enhance efficacy, regardless of HIV status (592,593,609).

Recommended Regimens for Latent Syphilis* Among Adults
Early latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin $\mathbf{G} 2.4$ million units IM in a single dose
Late latent syphilis: Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week intervals
* Recommendations for treating syphilis in persons with HIV and pregnant women are discussed elsewhere in this report (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection; Syphilis During Pregnancy).

Infants and children aged $\geq 1$ month with diagnosed latent syphilis should be managed by a pediatric infectious disease specialist and receive a CSF examination. In addition, birth and maternal medical records should be reviewed to assess whether these infants and children have congenital or acquired syphilis. For those with congenital syphilis, treatment should be undertaken as described (see Congenital Syphilis). Those with acquired syphilis should be evaluated for sexual abuse (e.g., through consultation with child protection services) (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). These regimens are for children who are not allergic to penicillin who have acquired syphilis and who have normal CSF examinations.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

All persons who have latent syphilis should be tested for HIV at the time of diagnosis or treatment. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP. In geographic areas in which the prevalence of HIV infection is high or among populations vulnerable to HIV acquisition, persons who have early latent or late latent syphilis should be offered PrEP and retested for HIV in 3 months if the first HIV test result was negative.
Persons who receive a diagnosis of latent syphilis and have neurologic or ocular signs and symptoms (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, ophthalmic or auditory symptoms, cranial nerve palsies, or symptoms or signs of meningitis or stroke) should be evaluated for neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, or otosyphilis according to their clinical presentation (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis).
If a person receives a delayed dose of penicillin in a course of weekly therapy for late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration, the course of action that should be recommended is unclear. Clinical experience indicates that an interval of 10-14 days between doses of benzathine penicillin for latent syphilis might be acceptable before restarting the sequence of injections (i.e., if dose 1 is administered on day 0 , dose 2 is administered on days 10-14). Pharmacologic considerations indicate that an interval of 7-9 days between doses, if feasible, might be preferred (610-612). Delayed doses are not optimal for pregnant women receiving therapy for latent syphilis (613). Pregnant women who have delays in any therapy dose $>9$ days between doses should repeat the full course of therapy.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Quantitative nontreponemal serologic tests should be repeated at 6,12 , and 24 months. These serologic titers should be compared with the titer at the time of treatment. Persons with at least a fourfold sustained increase in nontreponemal test titer persisting for $>2$ weeks or who experienced signs or symptoms attributable to primary or secondary syphilis
were likely reinfected or experienced treatment failure. These persons should be retreated and reevaluated for HIV infection. Among persons who have neurologic findings after a thorough neurologic examination or among persons with no neurologic findings and no sexual exposure during the previous year, a CSF examination is recommended. Treatment should be guided by CSF findings. Among persons with no neurologic findings after neurologic examination and who are sexually active, treatment with weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for 3 weeks is recommended.

Optimal management of persons who have less than a fourfold decrease in titers 24 months after treatment (i.e., an inadequate serologic response) is unclear, especially if the initial titer was $<1: 8$. At a minimum, these persons should receive additional clinical and serologic follow-up and be evaluated for HIV infection. If neurologic symptoms or signs are identified, a CSF evaluation is recommended, with the findings guiding management. If additional follow-up cannot be ensured or if an initially high titer ( $>1: 32$ ) does not decrease at least fourfold 24 months after treatment, retreatment with weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for 3 weeks is recommended. Because treatment failure might be the result of unrecognized CNS infection, CSF examination can be considered in such situations where follow-up is uncertain or initial high titers do not decrease after 24 months.

If the CSF examination is negative, repeat treatment for latent syphilis is recommended. Serologic titers might not decrease despite a negative CSF examination and a repeated course of therapy, especially if the initial nontreponemal titer is low ( $<1: 8$ ); in these circumstances, the need for additional therapy or repeated CSF examinations is unclear but is usually not recommended. Serologic and clinical monitoring at least annually should continue to monitor for any sustained increases in nontreponemal titer.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

The effectiveness of alternatives to penicillin in treating latent syphilis has not been well documented. Nonpregnant patients allergic to penicillin who have clearly defined early latent syphilis should respond to antibiotics recommended as alternatives to penicillin for treating primary and secondary syphilis (see Primary and Secondary Syphilis). The only acceptable alternatives for treating late latent syphilis or syphilis of unknown duration are doxycycline ( 100 mg orally 2 times/day) or tetracycline ( 500 mg orally 4 times/day),
each for 28 days. The efficacy of these alternative regimens among persons with HIV infection has not been well studied. These therapies should be used only in conjunction with close serologic and clinical follow-up, especially among persons with HIV infection. On the basis of biologic plausibility and pharmacologic properties, ceftriaxone might be effective for treating latent syphilis. However, the optimal dose and duration of ceftriaxone therapy have not been defined; treatment decisions should be discussed in consultation with a specialist. Persons with a penicillin allergy whose compliance with therapy or follow-up cannot be ensured should be desensitized and treated with benzathine penicillin G. Skin testing for penicillin allergy might be useful in circumstances in which the reagents and expertise are available for performing the test adequately (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

\section*{Pregnancy}

Pregnant women who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing for penicillin allergy might be useful in circumstances in which the reagents and expertise are available for performing the test adequately (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy; Syphilis During Pregnancy).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with HIV infection who have latent syphilis should be treated similarly to persons who do not have HIV (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection).

\section*{Tertiary Syphilis}

Tertiary syphilis refers to gummas, cardiovascular syphilis, psychiatric manifestations (e.g., memory loss or personality changes), or late neurosyphilis. Guidelines for all forms of neurosyphilis (e.g., early or late neurosyphilis) are discussed elsewhere in these recommendations (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Persons with gummas and cardiovascular syphilis who are not allergic to penicillin and have no evidence of neurosyphilis by clinical and CSF examination should be treated with the following regimen.

Recommended Regimen for Tertiary Syphilis Among Adults
Tertiary syphilis with normal CSF examination: Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM each at 1-week intervals

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

All persons who have tertiary syphilis should receive a CSF examination before therapy is initiated and have an HIV test.

Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP. Persons with CSF abnormalities should be treated with a neurosyphilis regimen. Certain providers treat all persons who have cardiovascular syphilis with a neurosyphilis regimen. These persons should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Limited information is available concerning clinical response and follow-up of persons who have tertiary syphilis.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

See Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

Any person allergic to penicillin should be treated in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

\section*{Pregnancy}

Pregnant women who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk for acute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy; Syphilis During Pregnancy).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with HIV infection who have tertiary syphilis should be treated as described for persons without HIV (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection).

\section*{Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis}

\section*{Treatment}

CNS involvement can occur during any stage of syphilis, and CSF laboratory abnormalities are common among persons with early syphilis, even in the absence of clinical neurologic findings. No evidence exists to support variation from recommended diagnosis and treatment for syphilis at any stage for persons without clinical neurologic findings, except tertiary syphilis. If clinical evidence of neurologic involvement is observed (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, motor or sensory deficits, cranial nerve palsies, or symptoms or signs of meningitis or stroke), a CSF examination should be performed before treatment.

Syphilitic uveitis or other ocular syphilis manifestations (e.g., neuroretinitis and optic neuritis) can occur at any stage of syphilis and can be isolated abnormalities or associated with neurosyphilis. All persons with ocular symptoms and reactive
syphilis serology need a full ocular examination, including cranial nerve evaluation. If cranial nerve dysfunction is present, a CSF evaluation is needed. Among persons with isolated ocular symptoms (no cranial nerve dysfunction or other neurologic abnormalities), reactive syphilis serology, and confirmed ocular abnormalities on examination, CSF examination is unnecessary before treatment. CSF analysis might be helpful in evaluating persons with ocular symptoms and reactive syphilis serology who do not have ocular findings on examination. If ocular syphilis is suspected, immediate referral to and management in collaboration with an ophthalmologist is crucial. Ocular syphilis should be treated similarly to neurosyphilis, even if a CSF examination is normal.

Hearing loss and other otologic symptoms can occur at any stage of syphilis and can be isolated abnormalities or associated with neurosyphilis, especially of cranial nerve 8 . However, among persons with isolated auditory symptoms, normal neurologic examination, and reactive syphilis serology, CSF examination is likely to be normal and is not recommended before treatment. Otosyphilis should be managed in collaboration with an otolaryngologist and treated by using the same regimen as for neurosyphilis.

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, or Otosyphilis Among Adults}

Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 18-24 million units per day, administered as 3-4 million units IV every 4 hours or continuous infusion for 10-14 days

If compliance with therapy can be ensured, the following alternative regimen might be considered.
```
Alternative Regimen
Procaine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM once daily
    plus
Probenecid 500 mg orally 4 times/day, both for 10-14 days
```


The durations of the recommended and alternative regimens for neurosyphilis are shorter than the duration of the regimen used for latent syphilis. Therefore, benzathine penicillin, 2.4 million units IM once per week for 1-3 weeks, can be considered after completion of these neurosyphilis treatment regimens to provide a comparable total duration of therapy.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

The following are other considerations in the management of persons who have neurosyphilis:
- All persons who have neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, or otosyphilis should be tested for HIV at the time of diagnosis. Those whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.
- Although systemic steroids are used frequently as adjunctive therapy for otosyphilis and for ocular syphilis, such drugs have not been proven to be beneficial.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Data from two studies indicate that, among immunocompetent persons and persons with HIV infection who are on effective ART, normalization of the serum RPR titer predicts normalization of abnormal CSF parameters after neurosyphilis treatment (614,615). Therefore, repeated CSF examinations are unnecessary for persons without HIV infection or persons with HIV infection who are on ART and who exhibit serologic and clinical responses after treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

See Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

Limited data indicate that ceftriaxone $1-2 \mathrm{~g}$ daily either IM or IV for 10-14 days can be used as an alternative treatment for persons with neurosyphilis (603,616,617). Cross-sensitivity between ceftriaxone and penicillin can occur; however, the risk for penicillin cross-reactivity between third-generation cephalosporins is negligible (618-621) (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). If concern exists regarding ceftriaxone safety for a patient with neurosyphilis, skin testing should be performed to confirm penicillin allergy and, if necessary, penicillin desensitization in consultation with a specialist is recommended. Other regimens have not been adequately evaluated for treatment of neurosyphilis.

\section*{Pregnancy}

Pregnant women who are allergic to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk for acute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with HIV infection who have neurosyphilis should be treated as described for persons without HIV (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection).

\section*{Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection}

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Interpretation of treponemal and nontreponemal serologic tests for persons with HIV infection is the same as for persons without HIV. Although rare, unusual serologic responses have
been observed among persons with HIV infection who have syphilis. The majority of reports have involved posttreatment serologic titers that were higher than expected (i.e., high serofast) or fluctuated, and false-negative serologic test results and delayed appearance of seroreactivity have also been reported (622).

When clinical findings are indicative of syphilis, but serologic tests are nonreactive or their interpretation is unclear, alternative tests (e.g., biopsy of a lesion, darkfield examination, or PCR of lesion material) might be useful for diagnosis. Neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, and otosyphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurologic, ocular, and other signs and symptoms among persons with HIV infection.

\section*{Treatment}

Persons with HIV infection who have early syphilis might be at increased risk for neurologic complications (623) and might have higher rates of inadequate serologic response with recommended regimens. The magnitude of these risks is not defined precisely but is likely small. Although long-term (>1 year) comparative data are lacking, no treatment regimens for syphilis have been demonstrated to be more effective in preventing neurosyphilis among persons with HIV infection than the syphilis regimens recommended for persons without HIV (609). Careful follow-up after therapy is essential. Using ART per current HIV guidelines might improve clinical outcomes among persons coinfected with HIV and syphilis; concerns regarding adequate treatment of syphilis among persons with HIV infection might not apply to those with HIV virologic suppression $(624,625)$.

\section*{Primary and Secondary Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection}

Recommended Regimen for Primary and Secondary Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection

Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a single dose

Available data demonstrate that additional doses of benzathine penicillin $G$, amoxicillin, or other antibiotics in primary and secondary syphilis among persons with HIV infection do not result in enhanced efficacy (592,593,609).

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

The majority of persons with HIV infection respond appropriately to the recommended benzathine penicillin G treatment regimen for primary and secondary syphilis (626). CSF abnormalities (e.g., mononuclear pleocytosis and elevated protein levels) can be common among persons with HIV, even those without syphilis. The clinical and prognostic significance of such CSF laboratory abnormalities among persons with primary and secondary syphilis who lack neurologic symptoms
is unknown. Certain studies have demonstrated that among persons with HIV infection and syphilis, CSF abnormalities are associated with a CD4+ T-cell count of $\leq 350$ cells $/ \mathrm{mL}$ or an RPR titer of $\geq 1: 32(614,627)$. However, CSF examination followed by treatment for neurosyphilis on the basis of laboratory abnormalities has not been associated with improved clinical outcomes in the absence of neurologic signs and symptoms. All persons with HIV infection and primary and secondary syphilis should have a thorough neurologic, ocular, and otic examination (614,622,625). CSF examination should be reserved for those with an abnormal neurologic examination.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Persons with HIV infection and primary or secondary syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically for possible treatment failure at $3,6,9,12$, and 24 months after therapy; those who meet the criteria for treatment failure (i.e., signs or symptoms that persist or recur or a sustained [>2 weeks] fourfold or greater increase in titer) should be managed in the same manner as persons without HIV infection (i.e., depending on history of sexual activity and on findings of neurologic examination, either repeat treatment with weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for 3 weeks or CSF examination and repeat treatment guided by CSF findings) (see Primary and Secondary Syphilis).
In addition, CSF examination and retreatment can be considered for persons whose nontreponemal test titers do not decrease fourfold within 24 months of therapy. If CSF examination is normal, treatment with benzathine penicillin G administered as 2.4 million units IM at weekly intervals for 3 weeks is recommended. Serologic titers might not decrease despite a negative CSF examination and a repeated 3-week course of therapy (599). Especially if the initial nontreponemal titer is low ( $<1: 8$ ) in these circumstances, the benefit of additional therapy or repeated CSF examinations is unclear but is not usually recommended. Serologic and clinical monitoring at least annually should continue to monitor for any sustained increases in nontreponemal titer.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

See Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

Persons with HIV infection who are allergic to penicillin and have primary or secondary syphilis should be managed according to the recommendations for persons without HIV who are allergic to penicillin (see Primary and Secondary Syphilis). Persons with penicillin allergy whose compliance with alternative therapy or follow-up cannot be ensured should
be desensitized and treated with penicillin G (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). Using penicillin alternatives has not been well studied among persons with HIV infection; azithromycin is not recommended for persons with HIV and primary or secondary syphilis infection. Alternative therapies should be used only in conjunction with close serologic and clinical follow-up. Persons with HIV and latent syphilis should be treated similarly to persons who do not have HIV (see Latent Syphilis).

\section*{Latent Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection}

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Early Latent Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection}

Benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM in a single dose

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Late Latent Syphilis or Latent Syphilis of Unknown Duration Among Persons with HIV Infection}

Benzathine penicillin G 7.2 million units total, administered as 3 doses of 2.4 million units IM at 1-week intervals

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

All persons with HIV and latent syphilis infection should undergo a thorough neurologic, ocular, and otic examination; those with neurologic symptoms or signs should undergo immediate CSF examination. In the absence of neurologic symptoms or signs, CSF examination has not been associated with improved clinical outcomes and therefore is not recommended. Those with ocular or otic symptoms or signs should be evaluated for ocular syphilis and otosyphilis according to those clinical presentations (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis).

\section*{Follow-Up}

Patients with HIV and latent syphilis infection should be evaluated clinically and serologically at $6,12,18$, and 24 months after therapy. Those persons who meet the criteria for treatment failure (i.e., signs or symptoms that persist or recur or a sustained [ $>2$ weeks] fourfold or greater increase in titer) should be managed in the same manner as persons without HIV (i.e., depending on history of sexual activity and on findings of neurologic examination, either repeat treatment with weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM for 3 weeks or CSF examination and repeat treatment guided by CSF findings) (see Latent Syphilis).
In addition, CSF examination and retreatment can be considered for persons whose nontreponemal test titers do not decrease fourfold within 24 months of therapy. If CSF examination is normal, treatment with benzathine penicillin G administered as 2.4 million units IM at weekly intervals for

3 weeks is recommended. Serologic titers might not decrease despite a negative CSF examination and a repeated 3 -week course of therapy (599). Especially if the initial nontreponemal titer is low ( $<1: 8$ ) in these circumstances, the benefit of additional therapy or repeated CSF examinations is unclear but is not usually recommended. Serologic and clinical monitoring at least annually should continue to ensure nontreponemal titers remain stable without any sustained titer increases.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

See Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

The efficacy of alternative nonpenicillin regimens for latent syphilis for persons living with HIV infection has not been well studied, and these therapies should be used only in conjunction with close serologic and clinical follow-up. Patients with penicillin allergy whose compliance with alternative therapy or follow-up cannot be ensured should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

\section*{Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otic Syphilis Among Persons with HIV Infection}

All persons with HIV and syphilis infection should receive a careful neurologic ocular and otic examination. Persons with HIV infection and neurosyphilis should be treated according to the recommendations for persons with neurosyphilis and without HIV infection (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis).

\section*{Follow-Up}

Persons with HIV and neurosyphilis infection should be managed according to the recommendations for persons without HIV infection. Serum RPR can be followed for necessary treatment success rather than following CSF parameters (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Limited data indicate that changes in CSF parameters might occur more slowly among persons with HIV infection, especially those with more advanced immunosuppression $(588,624)$.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

See Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

Persons with HIV who are allergic to penicillin and have neurosyphilis infection should be managed according to the
recommendations for persons without HIV infection with neurosyphilis who are allergic to penicillin (see Neurosyphilis, Ocular Syphilis, and Otosyphilis). Small observational studies conducted among persons with HIV and neurosyphilis report that ceftriaxone $1-2 \mathrm{~g}$ IV daily for $10-14$ days might be effective as an alternative agent (628-630). The possibility of cross-sensitivity between ceftriaxone and penicillin exists; however, the risk for penicillin cross-reactivity between third-generation cephalosporins is negligible (619-621,631) (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). If concern exists regarding the safety of ceftriaxone for a person with HIV and neurosyphilis, skin testing should be performed to confirm penicillin allergy and, if necessary, penicillin desensitization in consultation with a specialist is recommended. Other regimens have not been adequately evaluated for treatment of neurosyphilis.

\section*{Syphilis During Pregnancy}

All women should be screened serologically for syphilis at the first prenatal care visit (174), which is mandated by the majority of states (142). Among populations for whom receipt of prenatal care is not optimal, serologic screening and treatment (if serologic test is reactive) should be performed at the time of pregnancy testing (632). Antepartum screening can be performed by manual nontreponemal antibody testing (e.g., RPR) by using the traditional syphilis screening algorithm or by treponemal antibody testing (e.g., immunoassays) using the reverse sequence algorithm.
Pregnant women with positive treponemal screening tests (e.g., EIA, CIA, or immunoblot) should have additional quantitative nontreponemal testing because titers are essential for monitoring treatment response. Serologic testing should also be performed twice during the third trimester: at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery for pregnant women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis and for women who have been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy.
Maternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include sex with multiple partners, sex in conjunction with drug use or transactional sex, late entry to prenatal care (i.e., first visit during the second trimester or later) or no prenatal care, methamphetamine or heroine use, incarceration of the woman or her partner, and unstable housing or homelessness (174,633-636). Moreover, as part of the management of pregnant women who have syphilis, providers should obtain information concerning ongoing risk behaviors and treatment of sex partners to assess the risk for reinfection.
Any woman who has a fetal death after 20 weeks' gestation should be tested for syphilis. No mother or neonate should leave the hospital without maternal serologic status having been
documented at least once during pregnancy. Any woman who at the time of delivery has no prenatal care history or has been at risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy (e.g., misuses drugs; has had another STI during pregnancy; or has had multiple sex partners, a new partner, or a partner with an STI) should have the results of a syphilis serologic test documented before discharge.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Pregnant women seropositive for syphilis should be considered infected unless an adequate treatment history is clearly documented in the medical records and sequential serologic antibody titers have decreased as recommended for the syphilis stage. The risk for antepartum fetal infection or congenital syphilis at delivery is related to the syphilis stage during pregnancy, with the highest risk occurring during the primary and secondary stages. Quantitative maternal nontreponemal titer, especially if $>1: 8$, might be a marker of early infection and bacteremia. However, risk for fetal infection is still substantial among pregnant women with late latent syphilis and low titers. Pregnant women with stable, serofast low nontreponemal titers who have previously been treated for syphilis might not require additional treatment; however, increasing or high antibody titers in a pregnant woman previously treated might indicate reinfection or treatment failure, and treatment should be offered.

If an automated treponemal test (e.g., EIA or CIA) is used for antepartum syphilis screening, all positive tests should be reflexed to a quantitative nontreponemal test (e.g., RPR or VDRL). If the nontreponemal test is negative, the results are considered discrepant and a second treponemal test (TP-PA is preferred) should be performed, preferably on the same specimen.

If the second treponemal test is positive (e.g., EIA positive, RPR negative, or TP-PA positive), current or previous syphilis infection can be confirmed. For women with a history of adequately treated syphilis who do not have ongoing risk, no further treatment is necessary. Women without a history of treatment should have the syphilis stage determined and should be treated accordingly with a recommended penicillin regimen.

If the second treponemal test is negative (e.g., EIA positive, RPR negative, or TP-PA negative), the positive EIA or CIA is more likely to represent a false-positive test result for women who are living in communities with low rates of syphilis, have a partner who is uninfected, and have no history of treated syphilis $(637,638)$. If the woman is at low risk for syphilis, lacks signs or symptoms of primary syphilis, has a partner with no clinical or serologic evidence of syphilis, and is likely to follow up with clinical care, repeat serologic testing within 4 weeks can be considered to determine whether the EIA or CIA remains positive or if the RPR, VDRL, or TP-PA result becomes positive. If both the RPR and TP-PA remain negative, no further
treatment is necessary. If follow-up is not likely, women with an isolated reactive treponemal test and without a history of treated syphilis should be treated according to the syphilis stage.

\section*{Treatment}

Penicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for treating fetal infection and preventing congenital syphilis (639). Evidence is insufficient to determine the optimal penicillin regimen during pregnancy (640).

Recommended Regimen for Syphilis During Pregnancy
Pregnant women should be treated with the recommended penicillin regimen for their stage of infection

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

The following recommendations should be considered for pregnant women with syphilis infection:
- Certain evidence indicates that additional therapy is beneficial for pregnant women to prevent congenital syphilis. For women who have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, a second dose of benzathine penicillin G 2.4 million units IM can be administered 1 week after the initial dose (641-643).
- When syphilis is diagnosed during the second half of pregnancy, management should include a sonographic fetal evaluation for congenital syphilis. However, this evaluation should not delay therapy. Sonographic signs of fetal or placental syphilis (e.g., hepatomegaly, ascites, hydrops, fetal anemia, or a thickened placenta) indicate a greater risk for fetal treatment failure (644); cases accompanied by these signs should be managed in consultation with obstetric specialists. A second dose of benzathine penicillin $G$ 2.4 million units IM after the initial dose might be beneficial for fetal treatment in these situations.
- Women treated for syphilis during the second half of pregnancy are at risk for premature labor or fetal distress if the treatment precipitates the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction (590). These women should be advised to seek obstetric attention after treatment if they notice any fever, contractions, or decrease in fetal movements. Stillbirth is a rare complication of treatment; however, concern for this complication should not delay necessary treatment. No data are available to support that corticosteroid treatment alters the risk for treatment-related complications during pregnancy.
- Missed doses $>9$ days between doses are not acceptable for pregnant women receiving therapy for late latent syphilis (613). An optimal interval between doses is 7 days for pregnant women. If a pregnant woman does not return for the next dose on day 7, every effort should be made
to contact her and link her to immediate treatment within 2 days to avoid retreatment. Pregnant women who miss a dose of therapy should repeat the full course of therapy.
- All women who have syphilis should be offered testing for HIV at the time of diagnosis.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Coordinated prenatal care and treatment are vital because providers should document that women are adequately treated for the syphilis stage and ensure that the clinical and antibody responses are appropriate for the patient's disease stage. If syphilis is diagnosed and treated at or before 24 weeks' gestation, serologic titers should not be repeated before 8 weeks after treatment (e.g., at 32 weeks' gestation) but should be repeated again at delivery. Titers should be repeated sooner if reinfection or treatment failure is suspected. For syphilis diagnosed and treated after 24 weeks' gestation, serologic titers should be repeated at delivery.

A majority of women will not achieve a fourfold decrease in titers before delivery, although this does not indicate treatment failure (645). However, a fourfold increase in titer after treatment (e.g., from $1: 8$ to $1: 32$ ) that is sustained for $>2$ weeks is concerning for reinfection or treatment failure. Nontreponemal titers can increase immediately after treatment, presumably related to the treatment response. Therefore, unless symptoms and signs exist of primary or secondary syphilis, follow-up titer should not be repeated until approximately 8 weeks after treatment. Inadequate maternal treatment is likely if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy, clinical signs of infection are present at delivery, or the maternal antibody titer at delivery is fourfold higher than the pretreatment titer.

See Syphilis, Management of Sex Partners.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

No proven alternatives to penicillin are available for treatment of syphilis during pregnancy. Pregnant women who have a history of penicillin allergy should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G. Skin testing or oral graded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk for acute allergic reactions (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

Tetracycline and doxycycline are to be avoided in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (431). Erythromycin and azithromycin should not be used because neither reliably cures maternal infection nor treats an infected fetus (640). Data are insufficient to recommend ceftriaxone or other cephalosporins
for treatment of maternal infection and prevention of congenital syphilis (646,647).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Placental inflammation from congenital syphilis infection might increase the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV. All women with HIV infection should be evaluated for syphilis and receive a penicillin regimen appropriate for the syphilis stage. Data are insufficient to recommend any alternative regimens for pregnant women with syphilis and HIV infection (see Syphilis Among Persons with HIV).

\section*{Congenital Syphilis}

The rate of reported congenital syphilis in the United States has increased dramatically since 2012. During 2019, a total of 1,870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported, including 94 stillbirths and 34 infant deaths (141). The 2019 national rate of 48.5 cases per 100,000 live births represents a $41 \%$ increase relative to 2018 (34.3 cases per 100,000 live births) and a 477\% increase relative to 2012 (8.4 cases per 100,000 live births). During 2015-2019, the rate of congenital syphilis increased 291.1\% (12.4 to 48.5 per 100,000 live births), which mirrors increases in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis among females aged 15-44 years (a 171.9\% increase, from 3.2 to 8.7 per 100,000 females).

Effective prevention and detection of congenital syphilis depend on identifying syphilis among pregnant women and, therefore, on the routine serologic screening of pregnant women during the first prenatal visit and at 28 weeks' gestation and at delivery for women who live in communities with high rates of syphilis, women with HIV infection, or those who are at increased risk for syphilis acquisition. Certain states have recommended screening three times during pregnancy for all women; clinicians should screen according to their state's guidelines.

Maternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include sex with multiple partners, sex in conjunction with drug use or transactional sex, late entry to prenatal care (i.e., first visit during the second trimester or later) or no prenatal care, methamphetamine or heroine use, incarceration of the woman or her partner, and unstable housing or homelessness (174,633-636). Moreover, as part of the management of pregnant women who have syphilis, providers should obtain information concerning ongoing risk behaviors and treatment of sex partners to assess the risk for reinfection.

Routine screening of neonatal sera or umbilical cord blood is not recommended because diagnosis at that time does not prevent congenital syphilis in certain newborns. No mother or newborn infant should leave the hospital without maternal
serologic status having been documented at least once during pregnancy. Any woman who had no prenatal care before delivery or is considered at increased risk for syphilis acquisition during pregnancy should have the results of a syphilis serologic test documented before she or her neonate is discharged. A quantitative RPR is needed at the time of delivery to compare with the neonate's nontreponemal test result. If a stat RPR is unavailable and a rapid treponemal test is performed at delivery, the results should be confirmed by using standard syphilis serologic laboratory tests (e.g., RPR and treponemal test) and algorithms.

\section*{Evaluation and Treatment of Neonates}

Diagnosis of congenital syphilis can be difficult because maternal nontreponemal and treponemal immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibodies can be transferred through the placenta to the fetus, complicating the interpretation of reactive serologic tests for syphilis among neonates (infants aged $<30$ days). Therefore, treatment decisions frequently must be made on the basis of identification of syphilis in the mother; adequacy of maternal treatment; presence of clinical, laboratory, or radiographic evidence of syphilis in the neonate; and comparison of maternal (at delivery) and neonatal nontreponemal serologic titers (e.g., RPR or VDRL) by using the same test, preferably conducted by the same laboratory. Any neonate at risk for congenital syphilis should receive a full evaluation and testing for HIV.
All neonates born to mothers who have reactive nontreponemal and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a quantitative nontreponemal serologic test (RPR or VDRL) performed on the neonate's serum because umbilical cord blood can become contaminated with maternal blood and yield a false-positive result, and Wharton's jelly within the umbilical cord can yield a false-negative result. The nontreponemal test performed on the neonate should be the same type of nontreponemal test performed on the mother.
Conducting a treponemal test (e.g., TP-PA, immunoassayEIA, CIA, or microbead immunoassay) on neonatal serum is not recommended because it is difficult to interpret, as passively transferred maternal antibodies can persist for $>15$ months. Commercially available IgM tests are not recommended.
All neonates born to women who have reactive nontreponemal serologic tests for syphilis at delivery should be examined thoroughly for evidence of congenital syphilis (e.g., nonimmune hydrops, conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia ${ }^{\dagger}$ or cholestatic jaundice or cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, rhinitis, skin rash, or pseudoparalysis of an extremity). Pathologic examination of the placenta or umbilical cord using specific staining (e.g., silver) or a T. pallidum PCR test using

\footnotetext{
${ }^{\dagger}$ Direct hyperbilirubinemia is direct bilirubin level $>2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ( $34 \mathrm{umol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) or $20 \%$ of the total bilirubin level.
}
a CLIA-validated test should be considered; direct fluorescence antibody (DFA-TP) reagents are unavailable (565). Darkfield microscopic examination or PCR testing of suspicious lesions or body fluids (e.g., bullous rash or nasal discharge) also should be performed. In addition to these tests, for stillborn infants, skeletal survey demonstrating typical osseous lesions might aid in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis because these abnormalities are not detected on fetal ultrasound.

The following scenarios describe the recommended congenital syphilis evaluation and treatment of neonates born to women who had reactive nontreponemal and treponemal serologic tests for syphilis during pregnancy (e.g., RPR reactive, TP-PA reactive or EIA reactive, RPR reactive) and have a reactive nontreponemal test at delivery (e.g., RPR reactive). Maternal history of infection with T. pallidum and treatment for syphilis should be considered when evaluating and treating the neonate for congenital syphilis in most scenarios, except when congenital syphilis is proven or highly probable.

\section*{Scenario 1: Confirmed Proven or Highly Probable Congenital Syphilis}

Any neonate with
- an abnormal physical examination that is consistent with congenital syphilis;
- a serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer that is fourfold ${ }^{\mathbb{S}}$ (or greater) higher than the mother's titer at delivery (e.g., maternal titer $=1: 2$, neonatal titer $\geq 1: 8$ or maternal titer $=1: 8$, neonatal titer $\geq 1: 32$ ); or
- a positive darkfield test or PCR of placenta, cord, lesions, or body fluids or a positive silver stain of the placenta or cord.

\section*{Recommended Evaluation}
- CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein**

\footnotetext{
${ }^{\$}$ One dilution is within the test performance of nontreponemal tests and is not a significant change.
${ }^{5}$ The absence of a fourfold or greater titer for a neonate does not exclude congenital syphilis.
** Interpretation of CSF test results requires a nontraumatic lumbar puncture (i.e., a CSF sample that is not contaminated with blood). CSF test results obtained during the neonatal period can be difficult to interpret; normal values differ by gestational age and are higher among preterm infants. Studies indicate that $95 \%$ of healthy neonates have values of $\leq 16-19$ WBCs $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ or protein levels of $\leq 115-118 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ on CSF examination. During the second month of life, $95 \%$ of healthy infants have $\leq 9-11$ WBCs $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ or protein levels of $\leq 89-91 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Lower values (i.e., 5 WBCs $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ and protein level of $40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$ might be considered the upper limits of normal for older infants. Other causes of elevated values should be considered when an infant is being evaluated for congenital syphilis (Sources: Kestenbaum LA, Ebberson J, Zorc JJ, Hodinka RL, Shah SS. Defining cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count reference values in neonates and young infants. Pediatrics 2010;125:257-64; Shah SS, Ebberson J, Kestenbaum LA, Hodinka RL, Zorc JJ.

}
- Complete blood count (CBC) and differential and platelet count
- Long-bone radiographs
- Other tests as clinically indicated (e.g., chest radiograph, liver function tests, neuroimaging, ophthalmologic examination, and auditory brain stem response)

\section*{Recommended Regimens, Confirmed or Highly Probable Congenital Syphilis}

Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 100,000-150,000 units/kg/body weight/day, administered as 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IV every 12 hours during the first 7 days of life and every 8 hours thereafter for a total of 10 days
or
Procaine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IM in a single daily dose for 10 days

If $>1$ day of therapy is missed, the entire course should be restarted. Data are insufficient regarding use of other antimicrobial agents (e.g., ampicillin). When possible, a full 10-day course of penicillin is preferred, even if ampicillin was initially provided for possible sepsis (648-650). Using agents other than penicillin requires close serologic follow-up for assessing therapy adequacy.

\section*{Scenario 2: Possible Congenital Syphilis}

Any neonate who has a normal physical examination and a serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer equal to or less than fourfold of the maternal titer at delivery (e.g., maternal titer $=1: 8$, neonatal titer $\leq 1: 16$ ) and one of the following:
- The mother was not treated, was inadequately treated, or has no documentation of having received treatment.
- The mother was treated with erythromycin or a regimen other than those recommended in these guidelines (i.e., a nonpenicillin G regimen). ${ }^{\dagger \dagger}$
- The mother received the recommended regimen but treatment was initiated $<30$ days before delivery.

\section*{Recommended Evaluation}
- CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein**
- CBC, differential, and platelet count
- Long-bone radiographs

This evaluation is not necessary if a 10-day course of parenteral therapy is administered, although such evaluations might be useful. For instance, a lumbar puncture might document CSF abnormalities that would prompt close follow-up. Other tests (e.g., CBC, platelet count, and longbone radiographs) can be performed to further support a diagnosis of congenital syphilis.

\footnotetext{
${ }^{\dagger \dagger}$ A women treated with a regimen other than recommended in these guidelines should be considered untreated.
}

\section*{Recommended Regimens, Possible Congenital Syphilis}

Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 100,000-150,000 units/kg body weight/day, administered as 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IV every 12 hours during the first 7 days of life and every 8 hours thereafter for a total of 10 days
or
Procaine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IM in a single daily dose for 10 days
or
Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IM in a single dose

Before using the single-dose benzathine penicillin G regimen, the recommended evaluation (i.e., CSF examination, longbone radiographs, and CBC with platelets) should be normal, and follow-up should be certain. If any part of the neonate's evaluation is abnormal or not performed, if the CSF analysis is uninterpretable because of contamination with blood, or if follow-up is uncertain, a 10-day course of penicillin G is required.

If the neonate's nontreponemal test is nonreactive and the provider determines that the mother's risk for untreated syphilis is low, treatment of the neonate with a single IM dose of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight for possible incubating syphilis can be considered without an evaluation. Neonates born to mothers with untreated early syphilis at the time of delivery are at increased risk for congenital syphilis, and the 10-day course of penicillin G should be considered even if the neonate's nontreponemal test is nonreactive, the complete evaluation is normal, and follow-up is certain.

\section*{Scenario 3: Congenital Syphilis Less Likely}

Any neonate who has a normal physical examination and a serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer equal or less than fourfold of the maternal titer at delivery (e.g., maternal titer $=1: 8$, neonatal titer $\leq 1: 16$ ) and both of the following are true:
- The mother was treated during pregnancy, treatment was appropriate for the infection stage, and the treatment regimen was initiated $\geq 30$ days before delivery.
- The mother has no evidence of reinfection or relapse.

\section*{Recommended Evaluation}

No evaluation is recommended.
Recommended Regimen, Congenital Syphilis Less Likely
Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IM in a single dose*
* Another approach involves not treating the newborn if follow-up is certain but providing close serologic follow-up every 2-3 months for 6 months for infants whose mothers' nontreponemal titers decreased at least fourfold after therapy for early syphilis or remained stable for lowtiter, latent syphilis (e.g., VDRL <1:2 or RPR <1:4).

\section*{Scenario 4: Congenital Syphilis Unlikely}

Any neonate who has a normal physical examination and a serum quantitative nontreponemal serologic titer equal to or less than fourfold of the maternal titer at delivery ${ }^{\$}$ and both of the following are true:
- The mother's treatment was adequate before pregnancy.
- The mother's nontreponemal serologic titer remained low and stable (i.e., serofast) before and during pregnancy and at delivery (e.g., VDRL $\leq 1: 2$ or RPR $\leq 1: 4$ ).

\section*{Recommended Evaluation}

No evaluation is recommended.
Recommended Regimen, Congenital Syphilis Unlikely
No treatment is required. However, any neonate with reactive nontreponemal tests should be followed serologically to ensure the nontreponemal test returns to negative (see Follow-Up). Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight as a single IM injection might be considered, particularly if follow-up is uncertain and the neonate has a reactive nontreponemal test.

The following situations describe management of neonates born to women screened during pregnancy by using the reverse sequence algorithm with reactive treponemal serologic tests and a nonreactive nontreponemal serologic test.

Reactive maternal treponemal serologies with a nonreactive nontreponemal serology (e.g., EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, or TP-PA reactive) during pregnancy. Syphilis is highly unlikely for neonates born to mothers with a nonreactive nontreponemal test after adequate treatment for syphilis during pregnancy or documentation of adequate treatment before pregnancy (with no evidence of reinfection of relapse). If testing is performed again at delivery and 1) the maternal nontreponemal test remains nonreactive and 2) the neonate has a normal physical examination and nonreactive nontreponemal test (e.g., RPR nonreactive), the provider should consider managing similarly to Scenario 4 without a laboratory evaluation and with no treatment required. Benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight as a single IM injection might be considered if syphilis exposure is possible within 1 month of delivery and follow-up of the mother and infant is uncertain.

Isolated reactive maternal treponemal serology (e.g., EIA reactive, RPR nonreactive, or TP-PA nonreactive) during pregnancy. Syphilis is unlikely for neonates born to mothers screened with the reverse sequence algorithm with isolated reactive maternal treponemal serology. Among lowprevalence populations, these are likely false-positive results and might become nonreactive with repeat testing (638). If these neonates have a normal physical examination and the risk for syphilis is low in the mother, no evaluation and treatment are
recommended for the neonate. If syphilis exposure is possible or unknown in the mother or the mother desires further evaluation to definitively rule out syphilis, repeat serology within 4 weeks is recommended to evaluate for early infection (see Syphilis During Pregnancy).

Isolated reactive maternal treponemal serology (e.g., rapid treponemal test) at delivery. For mothers with late or no prenatal care with a reactive rapid treponemal test at delivery, confirmatory laboratory-based testing should be performed; however, results should not delay evaluation and treatment of the neonate. These neonates should be evaluated and treated with a 10-day course of penicillin as recommended in Scenario 1 , and consultation with a specialist is recommended.

\section*{Follow-Up}

All neonates with reactive nontreponemal tests should receive thorough follow-up examinations and serologic testing (i.e., RPR or VDRL) every 2-3 months until the test becomes nonreactive.

For a neonate who was not treated because congenital syphilis was considered less likely or unlikely, nontreponemal antibody titers should decrease by age 3 months and be nonreactive by age 6 months, indicating that the reactive test result was caused by passive transfer of maternal IgG antibody. At age 6 months, if the nontreponemal test is nonreactive, no further evaluation or treatment is needed; if the nontreponemal test is still reactive, the infant is likely infected and should be treated.

Treated neonates who exhibit persistent nontreponemal test titers by age 6-12 months should be reevaluated through CSF examination and managed in consultation with an expert. Retreatment with a 10-day course of a penicillin G regimen might be indicated.

Neonates with a negative nontreponemal test at birth and whose mothers were seroreactive at delivery should be retested at age 3 months to rule out serologically negative incubating congenital syphilis at the time of birth. Treponemal tests should not be used to evaluate treatment response because the results are qualitative, and passive transfer of maternal IgG treponemal antibody might persist for $>15$ months.

Neonates whose initial CSF evaluations are abnormal do not need repeat lumbar puncture unless they exhibit persistent nontreponemal serologic test titers at age $6-12$ months. Persistent nontreponemal titers and CSF abnormalities should be managed in consultation with an expert.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

Neonates who require treatment for congenital syphilis but who have a history of penicillin allergy or develop an allergic reaction presumed secondary to penicillin should
be desensitized and then treated with penicillin G (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). Skin testing remains unavailable for neonates because the procedure has not been standardized for this age group. Data are insufficient regarding use of other antimicrobial agents (e.g., ceftriaxone) for congenital syphilis among neonates. If a nonpenicillin G agent is used, close clinical and serologic follow-up is required in consultation with an expert. Repeat CSF examination should be performed if the initial CSF examination was abnormal.

\section*{Penicillin Shortage}

During periods when the availability of aqueous crystalline penicillin G is compromised, the following is recommended (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/drug-notices.htm):
- For neonates with clinical evidence of congenital syphilis (see Scenario 1), check local sources for aqueous crystalline penicillin G (potassium or sodium) and notify CDC and FDA of limited supply. If IV penicillin G is limited, substitute some or all daily doses with procaine penicillin $G$ ( 50,000 units $/ \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/dose IM/day in a single daily dose for 10 days).
- If aqueous or procaine penicillin G is unavailable, ceftriaxone ( $50-75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day IV every 24 hours) can be considered with thorough clinical and serologic follow-up and in consultation with an expert because evidence is insufficient to support using ceftriaxone for treating congenital syphilis. Ceftriaxone should be used with caution in neonates with jaundice.
- For neonates without any clinical evidence of congenital syphilis (see Scenario 2 and Scenario 3), use
o procaine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight/ dose/day IM in a single dose for 10 days, or
- benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM as a single dose.
- If any part of the evaluation for congenital syphilis is abnormal or was not performed, CSF examination is not interpretable, or follow-up is uncertain, procaine penicillin G is recommended. A single dose of ceftriaxone is inadequate therapy.
- For premature neonates who have no clinical evidence of congenital syphilis (see Scenario 2 and Scenario 3) and might not tolerate IM injections because of decreased muscle mass, IV ceftriaxone can be considered with thorough clinical and serologic follow-up and in consultation with an expert. Ceftriaxone dosing should be adjusted according to birthweight.

\section*{HIV Infection}

Evidence is insufficient to determine whether neonates who have congenital syphilis and HIV infection or whose mothers have HIV require different therapy or clinical management than is recommended for all neonates. All neonates with congenital syphilis should be managed similarly, regardless of HIV status.

\section*{Evaluation and Treatment of Infants and Children with Congenital Syphilis}

Infants and children aged $\geq 1$ month who are identified as having reactive serologic tests for syphilis (e.g., RPR reactive, TP-PA reactive or EIA reactive, RPR reactive) should be examined thoroughly and have maternal serology and records reviewed to assess whether they have congenital or acquired syphilis (see Primary and Secondary Syphilis; Latent Syphilis; Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). In the case of extremely early or incubating syphilis at the time of delivery, all maternal serologic tests might have been negative; thus, infection might be undetected until a diagnosis is made later in the infant or child. Any infant or child at risk for congenital syphilis should receive a full evaluation and testing for HIV infection.
International adoptee, immigrant, or refugee children from countries where treponemal infections (e.g., yaws or pinta) are endemic might have reactive nontreponemal and treponemal serologic tests, which cannot distinguish between syphilis and other subspecies of T. pallidum (651). These children might also have syphilis (T. pallidum subspecies pallidum) and should be evaluated for congenital syphilis.

\section*{Recommended Evaluation}

The following evaluations should be performed:
- CSF analysis for VDRL, cell count, and protein
- CBC, differential, and platelet count
- Other tests as clinically indicated (e.g., long-bone radiographs, chest radiograph, liver function tests, abdominal ultrasound, ophthalmologic examination, neuroimaging, and auditory brain-stem response)

Recommended Regimen for Congenital Syphilis Among Infants and Children

Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 200,000-300,000 units/kg body weight/day IV, administered as 50,000 units/kg body weight every 4-6 hours for 10 days

If the infant or child has no clinical manifestations of congenital syphilis and the evaluation (including the CSF examination) is normal, treatment with <3 weekly doses of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM can be considered. A single dose of benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM up to the adult dose of
2.4 million units in a single dose can be considered after the 10-day course of IV aqueous penicillin G to provide more comparable duration for treatment in those who have no clinical manifestations and normal CSF. All of these treatment regimens should also be adequate for children who might have other treponemal infections.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Thorough follow-up examinations and serologic testing (i.e., RPR or VDRL) of infants and children treated for congenital syphilis after the neonatal period (aged $>30$ days) should be performed every 3 months until the test becomes nonreactive or the titer has decreased fourfold. The serologic response after therapy might be slower for infants and children than neonates. If these titers increase at any point $>2$ weeks or do not decrease fourfold after 12-18 months, the infant or child should be evaluated (e.g., CSF examination), treated with a 10-day course of parenteral penicillin $G$, and managed in consultation with an expert. Treponemal tests (e.g., EIA, CIA, or TP-PA) should not be used to evaluate treatment response because the results are qualitative and persist after treatment, and passive transfer of maternal IgG treponemal antibody might persist for $>15$ months after delivery. Infants or children whose initial CSF evaluations are abnormal do not need repeat lumbar puncture unless their serologic titers do not decrease fourfold after 12-18 months. After 18 months of follow-up, abnormal CSF indices that persist and cannot be attributed to other ongoing illness indicate that retreatment is needed for possible neurosyphilis and should be managed in consultation with an expert.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Penicillin Allergy}

Infants and children who require treatment for congenital syphilis but who have a history of penicillin allergy or develop an allergic reaction presumed secondary to penicillin should be desensitized and treated with penicillin G (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). Skin testing remains unavailable for infants and children because the procedure has not been standardized for this age group. Data are insufficient regarding use of other antimicrobial agents (e.g., ceftriaxone) for congenital syphilis among infants and children. If a nonpenicillin G agent is used, close clinical, serologic, and CSF follow-up is required in consultation with an expert.

\section*{Penicillin Shortage}

During periods when availability of penicillin $G$ is compromised, management options are similar to options for the neonate (see Evaluation and Treatment of Neonates).
- For infants and children with clinical evidence of congenital syphilis, if IV penicillin is limited after checking local sources and notifying CDC and FDA about limited supplies, procaine penicillin G ( 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IM up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units a day in a single daily dose for 10 days) is recommended.
- If procaine penicillin G is not available, ceftriaxone (in doses for age and weight) can be considered with thorough clinical and serologic follow-up. Infants and children receiving ceftriaxone should be managed in consultation with an expert because evidence is insufficient to support use of ceftriaxone for treatment of congenital syphilis among infants or children. For infants aged $\geq 30$ days, use ceftriaxone $75 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day IV or IM in a single daily dose for 10-14 days (dose adjustment might be necessary on the basis of current weight). For children, ceftriaxone $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/ day in a single daily dose is recommended.
- For infants and children without any clinical evidence of infection (see Scenario 2 and Scenario 3), use
o procaine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight/dose IM up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units a day in a single dose for 10 days, or
- benzathine penicillin G 50,000 units/kg body weight IM up to the adult dose of 2.4 million units as a single dose.
- If any part of the evaluation for congenital syphilis is abnormal or not performed, CSF examination is not interpretable, or follow-up is uncertain, procaine penicillin G is recommended. In these scenarios, a single dose of ceftriaxone is inadequate therapy.

\section*{HIV Infection}

Evidence is insufficient to determine whether infants and children who have congenital syphilis and HIV infection or whose mothers have HIV require different therapy or clinical management than what is recommended for all infants and children. All infants and children with congenital syphilis should be managed similarly, regardless of HIV status.

\section*{Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy}

Penicillin and other ß-lactam antibiotics have a crucial role in treating STIs. Penicillin is recommended for all clinical stages of syphilis, and no proven alternatives exist for treating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis during pregnancy. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is recommended for gonorrhea treatment. For extragenital site infections, especially pharyngeal, failure rates of nonceftriaxone
regimens can be substantial. In most clinical settings, patients who report a penicillin allergy are not treated with B-lactam antimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and a concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often avoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin allergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low (652-654).

Prevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately $10 \%$ among the U.S. population and higher among hospital inpatients and residents in health care-related facilities (655658). One large study in an STI clinic revealed that $8.3 \%$ of patients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy (659). Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the majority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate the medication (660). The prevalence of reported penicillin allergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited data indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently reported antibiotic allergies (661).

Patients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin and are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. The presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces prescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin allergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective drugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer length of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple studies have described that persons with reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgicalsite infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and higher medical care usage (653,662-664).

The overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is secondary to imprecise use of the term "allergy" by families and clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, drug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can occur days after exposure. Approximately $80 \%$ of patients with a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have lost the sensitivity after 10 years (658). Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive.

In a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only $7.1 \%$ of the patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another ß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin allergy (659). Moreover, in studies that have incorporated penicillin skin testing and graded oral challenge among persons with reported penicillin allergy, the true rates of allergy are low, ranging from $1.5 \%$ to $6.1 \%$ (665-667). Studies in preoperative surgical patients with reported penicillin allergy, evaluated for cardiovascular surgery (668) or orthopedics (669), have rates of skin test positivity $<8.5 \%$. However, when patients with high-risk penicillin allergy histories are excluded, $99 \%$
of patients could receive $\beta$-lactams. In hospitalized patients and other populations with comorbidities, the typical rates of validated penicillin allergy among patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are $2.5 \%-9.0 \%$ (670-673).

\section*{Cross-Reactivity with Cephalosporins}

Penicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ß-lactam ring. This structural similarity has led to considerable confusion regarding cross-reactivity of these drugs and the risks for allergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillinallergic patients. In most clinical settings, patients with reported penicillin allergy are precluded from treatment with such cephalosporin antibiotics as ceftriaxone. Thirdgeneration cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and cefixime) have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients ( $<1 \%$ ) compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins (range: $1 \%-8 \%$ ). Moreover, anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons who report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate of one per 52,000 persons (652). Data from the Kaiser health care system reported that among 3,313 patients with selfreported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin (mostly first generation), no cases of anaphylaxis were reported (652). Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of any IgE-mediated symptoms (e.g., anaphylaxis or urticaria) from penicillin during the preceding 10 years.

\section*{Validating Penicillin or Another ß-Lactam Antibiotic Allergy}

Evaluating a patient who reports a penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy involves three steps: 1) obtaining a thorough medical history, including previous exposures to penicillin or other ß-lactam antibiotics (658); 2) performing a skin test evaluation by using the penicillin major and minor determinants; and 3) among those who have a negative penicillin skin test, performing an observed oral challenge with 250 mg amoxicillin before proceeding directly to treatment with the indicated $\beta$-lactam therapy $(667,675)$.

For persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin (either to the major or minor determinants), treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used (656,658). For persons among whom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic (e.g., a patient with neurosyphilis or a pregnant woman with syphilis) and among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction of penicillin tolerance (also referred to as desensitization) is required (675). Desensitization protocols to penicillin should
be performed by allergists, and they require a monitored inpatient environment.

\section*{Penicillin Skin Testing}

Penicillin skin testing with a major determinant analog (penicilloyl-polylysine) and minor determinants (benzylpenicilloate, benzylpenilloate, or benzylpenicillin isomers of penicillin) are used for skin test evaluation for IgE-dependent penicillin allergy and can reliably identify persons at high risk for IgE-mediated reactions to penicillin (658,660,676). Until recently, penicillin skin testing in the United States only included the major determinant benzyl penicillin poly-L-lysine (Pre-Pen) in addition to penicillin G. This test identifies approximately $90 \%-99 \%$ of the IgEmediated penicillin-allergic patients. Because the remaining $1 \%-10 \%$ of penicillin-allergic patients who are not captured by this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants IgE antibodies, the standard practice is to follow skin testing with an observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour of observation. If the skin test and oral challenge are both negative, the risk for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis approaches zero and is equivalent to that of a person who has never reported an allergy to penicillin.
A revised version of the penicillin skin test kit, which includes the major determinant reagent Pre-Pen, minor determinants, and amoxicillin, is being evaluated by FDA. This penicillin skin test kit has been evaluated among 455 patients (677) with previous allergy history and has a negative predictive value of $98 \%$. If approved, this kit might eliminate the need for oral challenge.

Penicillin skin testing has become a clinically significant element in antibiotic stewardship programs, and the procedure has been increasingly used by hospital-based pharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians (670,672,673,678,679) as part of overall antibiotic stewardship interventions. When integrated into stewardship, the rates of ß-lactam antibiotic use increased substantially (670).

\section*{Recommendations}

Persons with a history of severe adverse cutaneous reaction (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis) and other severe non-IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., interstitial nephritis or hemolytic anemia) are not candidates for penicillin skin testing or challenge. Penicillin and any other ß-lactam antibiotics should be avoided indefinitely among these patients, who should be referred to an allergy center for further evaluation. Similarly, patients who deny penicillin allergy, but who report previous IgE-type reactions to cephalosporins, should be referred to an allergist for specific cephalosporin testing.

In a time of increasing antimicrobial resistance, following recommended use of antibiotic treatments is crucial. STI programs and clinicians should promote increased access to penicillin allergy testing. Allergy testing is being provided by clinicians in primary care and hospital settings. If appropriate, STI programs and ambulatory settings should consider developing expanded access to penicillin or ß-lactam allergy assessment.

Persons with high-risk symptom histories (e.g., anaphylaxis within the previous 10 years) should not be administered penicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should not receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge in an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.

High-risk symptom histories include development of the following after penicillin or ß-lactam administration: anaphylaxis within 6 hours or severe adverse cutaneous reaction (e.g., eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) and other severe non-IgE-mediated reactions (e.g., kidney or hepatic injury, hemolytic anemia, or thrombocytopenia).

\section*{Direct Treatment Approach for Ceftriaxone}

Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low $(652,680,681)$. If a patient has a lowrisk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash) (Box 2). In addition, a family history of penicillin or ß-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with B -lactam antibiotics. This practice is increasingly being used in ambulatory settings and for preoperative prophylaxis (658,663,680,682-684).

\section*{BOX 2. Low-risk history in patients who report penicillin allergy}

\section*{Gastrointestinal symptoms}

Headache
Pruritis without rash
Localized rash
Delayed onset rash (>24 hours)
Symptoms unknown
Family history of penicillin or another drug allergy
Patient denies allergy but it is on the medical record

\section*{Patients at Low Risk for Oral Challenge}

If the patient gives only a low-risk history of IgE-mediated penicillin allergy that includes symptoms such gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonspecific pruritus, or gives a family history only, an oral challenge can be administered to document the absence of allergy (Box 2). If the reaction occurred in the distant past ( $>10$ years), the likelihood is reduced even further (653,658,663,682,683,685,686). The risk for severe amoxicillin-mediated anaphylaxis has decreased over time and is rare. In the United Kingdom during 19722007, one fatal case of amoxicillin-medicated anaphylaxis was reported (684).

\section*{Skin Testing for Penicillin Allergy}

Skin testing for penicillin allergy should be performed if any indication exists that the symptoms were secondary to an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Testing is also indicated as a potential diagnostic procedure to definitively rule out penicillin allergy and document a negative allergy status in the medical record (i.e., delabeling). Because penicillin allergy testing does not test for multiple minor determinants, a person with a negative skin test should follow up with an oral challenge to confirm the negative status.

Persons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by an amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin therapy safely if needed. Persons with positive skin test results and for whom no other clinical options exist (e.g., neurosyphilis and syphilis in a pregnant woman) should be referred to an allergist and desensitized before initiating treatment.

\section*{Testing Procedures}

Penicillin skin testing includes use of skin test reagents for identifying persons at risk for adverse reactions (Box 3), followed by initial pinprick screening with penicillin major determinants (Pre-Pen) and penicillin G, followed by intradermal testing if pinprick results are negative. Penicillin testing procedures are performed in accordance with the Pre-Pen test kit instructions (https://penallergytest.com/wp-content/uploads/PRE-PEN-Package-Insert.pdf). Saline negative controls and histamine positive controls are an integral part of the procedure. Penicillin skin testing should not be performed for patients who have taken antihistamines within the past 7 days.

Skin testing can be safely performed by trained nonallergists and has been implemented as an antimicrobial stewardship intervention by internal medicine physicians, pharmacists, hospitalists, and infectious disease physicians (670,673,678,679). Patients tested should also receive documentation of status, and the results should be entered in the medical record.

Penicillin skin testing during pregnancy is considered safe. For pregnant persons who report a penicillin or ß-lactam allergy, penicillin allergy is an important consideration in treating syphilis during pregnancy and the potential for group B streptococcal infection and preoperative prophylaxis if a cesarean delivery is required. However, oral challenges should not be performed unless in a setting where additional support services are available.

\section*{Managing Persons Being Tested}

Patients who have a positive skin test should not receive ß-lactam drugs in the ambulatory setting and should be referred to an allergist or penicillin allergy expert for further evaluation. The allergy testing results should be documented in the medical record. Patients who test negative should be informed that their risk for anaphylaxis is extremely low and is equivalent to a person who does not report an allergy history. If treatment with penicillin or ceftriaxone is indicated, it can be administered safely. Documentation of testing results should be provided to the patient.

\section*{Desensitization}

Desensitization is required for persons who have a documented penicillin allergy and for whom no therapeutic alternatives exist (e.g., syphilis during pregnancy and persons with neurosyphilis). Modified protocols might be considered

on the basis of the clinical syndrome, drug of choice, and route of administration (687-690). Patients might require referral to a specialty center where desensitization can be performed.

\section*{Allergy Referral Resources}

With increased access to skin testing kits and the need to better target therapy for gonorrhea and syphilis, programs should identify local allergy consultant resources.

\section*{Diseases Characterized by Urethritis and Cervicitis}

\section*{Urethritis}

Urethritis, as characterized by urethral inflammation, can result from either infectious or noninfectious conditions. Symptoms, if present, include dysuria, urethral pruritis, and mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge. Signs of urethral discharge on examination can also be present among persons without symptoms. Although N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis are well established as clinically important infectious causes of urethritis, M. genitalium has been strongly associated with urethritis and, less commonly, prostatitis (691-697). If POC diagnostic tools (e.g., Gram, methylene blue [MB], or gentian violet [GV] stain microscopy) are unavailable, drug regimens effective against both gonorrhea and chlamydia should be administered. Further testing to determine the specific etiology is recommended for preventing complications, reinfection, and transmission because a specific diagnosis might improve treatment compliance, delivery of risk-reduction interventions, and partner services. Both chlamydia and gonorrhea are reportable to health departments. NAATs are preferred for detecting C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, and urine is the preferred specimen for males (553). NAAT-based tests for diagnosing T. vaginalis among men with urethritis have not been cleared by FDA; however, laboratories have performed the CLIA-compliant validation studies (698) needed to provide such testing.

\section*{Etiology}

Multiple organisms can cause infectious urethritis. The presence of gram-negative intracellular diplococci (GNID) or purple intracellular diplococci (MB or GV) on urethral smear is indicative of presumed gonococcal infection, which is frequently accompanied by chlamydial infection. Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), which is diagnosed when microscopy of urethral secretions indicate inflammation without GNID or MB or GV purple intracellular diplococci, is caused by C. trachomatis in $15 \%-40 \%$ of cases; however,
prevalence varies by age group, with a lower proportion of disease occurring among older men (699). Documentation of chlamydial infection as NGU etiology is essential because of the need for partner referral for evaluation and treatment to prevent complications of chlamydia, especially for female partners. Complications of C. trachomatis-associated NGU among males include epididymitis, prostatitis, and reactive arthritis.
M. genitalium is associated with symptoms of urethritis and urethral inflammation and accounts for 15\%-25\% of NGU cases in the United States (691-693,696,697,700). Among men with symptoms of urethritis, M. genitalium was detected in 11\% of those with urethritis in Australia (701), 12\%-15\% in the United Kingdom (702-704), 15\% in South Africa (696), $19 \%$ in China (705), $21 \%$ in Korea, $22 \%$ in Japan (706), and $28.7 \%$ in the United States (range: 20.4\%-38.8\%) (697). Data are inconsistent regarding other Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species as etiologic agents of urethritis (707). The majority of men with Ureaplasma infections do not have overt disease unless a high organism load is present.
T. vaginalis can cause urethritis among heterosexual men; however, the prevalence varies substantially by U.S. geographic region, age, and sexual behavior and within specific populations. Studies among men with and without overt urethritis in developed countries document relatively low rates of T. vaginalis in the Netherlands (0.5\%) (708), Japan (1.3\%) (706,709), the United States (2.4\%) (710), and the United Kingdom (3.6\%) (703). Studies in other countries have documented higher rates, such as in Croatia (8.2\%) (711) and Zimbabwe (8.4\%) (712), particularly among symptomatic patients.

Neisseria meningitidis can colonize mucosal surfaces and cause urethritis (713). Urogenital N. meningitidis rates and duration of carriage, prevalence of asymptomatic and symptomatic infection, and modes of transmission have not been systematically described; however, studies indicate that N. meningitidis can be transmitted through oralpenile contact (i.e., fellatio) (714-716). N. meningitidis has similar colony morphology appearance on culture and cannot be distinguished from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram stain. Identification of N. meningitidis as the etiologic agent with presumed gonococcal urethritis on the basis of Gram stain but negative NAAT for gonorrhea requires a confirmation by culture. Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis. Although evidence is limited regarding the risk for sexual transmission or recurrent infections with meningococcal urethritis, treatment of sex partners of patients with meningococcal urethritis with the same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal infection can be considered. No indication exists for treating
persons with $N$. meningitidis identified in their oropharynx when not also associated with symptomatic urethritis.
In other instances, NGU can be caused by HSV, EpsteinBarr virus, and adenovirus (699) acquired by fellatio (i.e., oralpenile contact). In a retrospective review of 80 cases of HSV urethritis in Australia (717), the majority of infections were associated with HSV-1 with clinical findings of meatitis ( $62 \%$ ), genital ulceration $(37 \%)$, and dysuria $(20 \%)$. Adenovirus can present with dysuria, meatal inflammation, and conjunctivitis (718). Enteric bacteria have been identified as an uncommon cause of NGU and might be associated with insertive anal intercourse (699).
Other bacterial pathogens have been implicated as potential causes of clinical urethritis, either in clustered case series or as sporadic cases such as Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (719-723). Haemophilus was identified in 12.6\% of cases among 413 men (mostly MSM reporting insertive oral sex) (724), and high rates of azithromycin resistance ( $39.5 \%$ ) were identified among Haemophilus urethritis patients (725). Individual case reports have linked NGU to multiple bacterial species, including Corynebacterium propinquum (726), Kurthia gibsonii (727), Corynebacterium glucuronolyticum (728,729), Corynebacterium striatrium (730), Aerococcus urinae (731), and Neisseria elongata (732). Diagnostic testing and treatment for less-common organisms are reserved for situations in which these infections are suspected (e.g., sexual partner with trichomoniasis, urethral lesions, or severe dysuria and meatitis) or when NGU is not responsive to recommended therapy.
Even in settings that provide comprehensive diagnostic testing, etiology can remain obscure in half of cases. Idiopathic NGU was reported in 772 (59\%) of 1,295 first presentations of NGU among men seeking sexual health services in Australia (701). In a case-control study of 211 men with NGU symptoms in Denmark, no identifiable pathogen was identified in $24 \%$ of acute cases and $33 \%$ of chronic cases (733). NGU's importance if not caused by a defined pathogen is uncertain; neither complications (e.g., urethral stricture or epididymitis) nor adverse outcomes among sex partners have been identified in these cases.
Associations between NGU and insertive anal and oral exposure have been reported (734), as have higher rates of BV-associated Leptotrichia or Sneathia species among heterosexual men with urethritis (735). These studies increase concern for possible undetected infectious rectal or vaginal pathogens, or alternatively, a transient reactive dysbiosis after exposure to a new microbiome or even a noninfectious reactive etiology (736).

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Clinicians should attempt to obtain objective evidence of urethral inflammation. If POC diagnostic tests (e.g., Gram stain or MB or GV microscopy) are unavailable, urethritis can be documented on the basis of any of the following signs or laboratory tests:
- Mucoid, mucopurulent, or purulent discharge on examination.
- Gram stain is a POC diagnostic test for evaluating urethritis that is highly sensitive and specific for documenting both urethritis and the presence or absence of gonococcal infection; MB or GV stain of urethral secretions is an alternative POC diagnostic test with performance characteristics similar to Gram stain; thus, the cutoff number for WBCs per oil immersion field should be the same (737).
- Presumed gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBCs containing GNID in Gram stain or intracellular purple diplococci in MB or GV smears; men should be tested for C. trachomatis and $N$. gonorrhoeae by NAATs and presumptively treated and managed accordingly for gonococcal infection (see Gonococcal Infections).
- If no intracellular gram-negative or purple diplococci are present, men should receive NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae and can be managed for NGU as recommended (see Nongonococcal Urethritis).
- Gram stain of urethral secretions exist that demonstrate $\geq 2$ WBCs per oil immersion field (738). The microscopy diagnostic cutoff might vary, depending on background prevalence ( $\geq 2$ WBCs/high power field [HPF] in highprevalence settings [STI clinics] or $\geq 5$ WBCs/HPF in lower-prevalence settings). ${ }^{\boldsymbol{\$} \boldsymbol{S}}$

\footnotetext{
${ }^{\$ §}$ For urethral microscopy, the cutoff for diagnosing urethritis is $\geq 2$ WBCs/HPF (Sources: Rietmeijer CA, Mettenbrink CJ. Recalibrating the Gram stain diagnosis of male urethritis in the era of nucleic acid amplification testing. Sex Transm Dis 2012;39:18-20; Rietmeijer CA, Mettenbrink CJ. The diagnosis of nongonococcal urethritis in men: can there be a universal standard? Sex Transm Dis 2017;44:195-6). An additional evaluation supported this cutoff by demonstrating NGU sensitivity of $92.6 \%$ for cutoff of $\geq 2$ versus $55.6 \%$ sensitivity for cutoff of $\geq 5$ (Source: Sarier M, Sepin N, Duman I, et al. Microscopy of Gram-stained urethral smear in the diagnosis of urethritis: which threshold value should be selected? Andrologia 2018;50:e13143). Diagnostic cutoffs for 369 symptomatic and asymptomatic heterosexual men seeking STI care in Seattle revealed a maximal sensitivity and specificity achieved with a cutoff of $\geq 5$ WBCs/HPF. Using a lower cutoff of $\geq 2$ WBCs/HPF would miss 13\% of C. trachomatis and M. genitalium and overtreat $45 \%$ of persons who have negative tests (Source: Leipertz G, Chambers L, Lowens S, et al. P796 Reassessing the Gram stain smear [GSS] polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] cutoff for diagnosing non-gonococcal urethritis [NGU]. Sex Transm Infect 2019;95[Suppl 1]:A339). Another study discussed that the WBC/HPF cutoff value should discriminate on the basis of the prevalence of chlamydia, mycoplasma, and gonorrhea among a clinic population (Source: Moi H, Hartgill U, Skullerud KH, Reponen EJ, Syvertsen L, Moghaddam A. Microscopy of stained urethral smear in male urethritis: which cutoff should be used? Sex Transm Dis 2017;44:189-94).
}
- Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine or microscopic examination of sediment from a spun firstvoid urine demonstrating $\geq 10$ WBCs/HPF.
Men evaluated in settings in which Gram stain or MB or GV smear is unavailable who meet at least one criterion for urethritis (i.e., urethral discharge, positive leukocyte esterase test on first void urine, or microscopic examination of firstvoid urine sediment with $\geq 10$ WBCs/HPF) should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAATs and treated with regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.
If symptoms are present but no evidence of urethral inflammation is present, NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae might identify infections (739). Persons with chlamydia or gonorrhea should receive recommended treatment, and sex partners should be referred for evaluation and treatment. If none of these clinical criteria are present, empiric treatment of men with symptoms of urethritis is recommended only for those at high risk for infection who are unlikely to return for a follow-up evaluation or test results. Such men should be treated with drug regimens effective against gonorrhea and chlamydia.

\section*{Nongonococcal Urethritis}

NGU is a nonspecific diagnosis that can have various infectious etiologies. C. trachomatis has been well established as an NGU etiology; however, prevalence varies across populations and accounts for <50\% of overall cases (712,740742). M. genitalium is estimated to account for $10 \%-25 \%$ of cases (696,697,701,703,704,706,733,743), and T. vaginalis for $1 \%-8 \%$ of cases depending on population and location (703,706,708,710,712). Other etiologies include different bacteria, such as Haemophilus species $(724,725)$, N. meningitidis (713,716), HSV (706,717), and adenovirus (744). However, even when extensive testing is performed, no pathogens are identified in approximately half of cases $(701,733)$.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Clinical presentation can include urethral discharge, irritation, dysuria, or meatal pruritus (697,743,745). NGU is confirmed for symptomatic men when diagnostic evaluation of urethral secretions indicates inflammation, without evidence of diplococci by Gram, MB, or GV smear on microscopy (712,746,747). Visible discharge or secretions can be collected by a swab without inserting it into the urethra; if no visible secretions, the swab can be inserted into the urethral meatus and rotated, making contact with the urethral wall before removal. If microscopy is unavailable, urine testing for leukocyte esterase can be performed on first-void urine, and microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void
urine demonstrating $\geq 10$ WBCs/HPF has a high negative predictive value.

All men who have suspected or confirmed NGU should be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea by using NAATs. A specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, reinfection, and transmission. M. genitalium testing should be performed for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after initial empiric treatment. Testing for T. vaginalis should be considered in areas or among populations with high prevalence, in cases where a partner is known to be infected, or for men who have persistent or recurrent symptoms after initial empiric treatment.

\section*{Treatment}

Ideally, treatment should be pathogen based; however, diagnostic information might not be immediately available. Presumptive treatment should be initiated at NGU diagnosis. Doxycycline is highly effective for chlamydial urethral infections and is also effective for chlamydial infections of the rectum; it also has some activity against M. genitalium. In contrast, reports have increased of azithromycin treatment failures for chlamydial infection (748,749), and the incidence of macrolide resistance in M. genitalium also has been rapidly rising (697,702,705,750,751). Pharmacokinetic data indicate that changing azithromycin dosing from a single-dose strategy to a multiday strategy might protect against inducing resistance in M. genitalium infections $(745,752)$ (see Mycoplasma genitalium).

Recommended Regimen for Nongonococcal Urethritis
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
Alternative Regimens
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
or
Azithromycin 500 mg orally in a single dose; then 250 mg orally daily
for 4 days

To maximize compliance with recommended therapies, medications should be dispensed on-site at the clinic, and, regardless of the number of doses involved in the regimen, the first dose should be directly observed. Erythromycin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its gastrointestinal side effects and dosing frequency. Levofloxacin is no longer recommended for NGU because of its inferior efficacy, especially for M. genitalium.

\section*{Management Considerations}

To minimize transmission and reinfections, men treated for NGU should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e., until
completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved or for 7 days after single-dose therapy). Men with NGU should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Men should be provided their testing results obtained as part of the NGU evaluation. Those with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (136,137,753,754) (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections; Trichomoniasis).

If symptoms persist or recur after therapy completion, men should be instructed to return for reevaluation and should be tested for M. genitalium and T. vaginalis. Symptoms alone, without documentation of signs or laboratory evidence of urethral inflammation, are insufficient basis for retreatment. Providers should be alert to the possible diagnosis of chronic prostatitis or chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men experiencing persistent perineal, penile, or pelvic pain or discomfort; voiding symptoms; pain during or after ejaculation; or newonset premature ejaculation lasting for $>3$ months. Men with persistent pain should be referred to a urologist with expertise in pelvic pain disorders.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

All sex partners of men with NGU within the preceding 60 days should be referred for evaluation and testing and presumptive treatment with a drug regimen effective against chlamydia. All partners should be evaluated and treated according to the management section for their respective pathogen; EPT could be an alternate approach if a partner is unable to access timely care. To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

\section*{Persistent or Recurrent Nongonococcal Urethritis}

The objective diagnosis of persistent or recurrent NGU should be made before considering additional antimicrobial therapy. Symptomatic recurrent or persistent urethritis might be caused by treatment failure or reinfection after successful treatment. Among men who have persistent symptoms after treatment without objective signs of urethral inflammation, the value of extending the duration of antimicrobials has not been demonstrated. Treatment failure for chlamydial urethritis has been estimated at $6 \%-12 \%$ (755). The most common cause of persistent or recurrent NGU is M. genitalium, especially after doxycycline therapy (756,757). Treatment failure for M. genitalium is harder to determine because certain men
achieve clinical cure (i.e., resolution of symptoms) but can still have detectable M. genitalium in urethral specimens (758).

The initial step in recurrent urethritis is assessing compliance with treatment or potential reexposure to an untreated sex partner $(697,743)$. If the patient did not comply with the treatment regimen or was reexposed to an untreated partner, retreatment with the initial regimen can be considered. If therapy was appropriately completed and no reexposure occurred, therapy is dependent on the initial treatment regimen. Ideally, diagnostic testing among men with recurrent or persistent symptoms, including those with gonorrhea, chlamydia, M. genitalium, and trichomoniasis, can be used to guide further management decisions.
T. vaginalis is also known to cause urethritis among men who have sex with women. In areas where T. vaginalis is prevalent, men who have sex with women with persistent or recurrent urethritis should be tested for T. vaginalis and presumptively treated with metronidazole 2 g orally in a single dose or tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose; their partners should be referred for evaluation and treatment, if needed.

If T. vaginalis is unlikely (MSM with NGU or negative T. vaginalis NAAT), men with recurrent NGU should be tested for M. genitalium by using an FDA-cleared NAAT. Treatment for M. genitalium includes a two-stage approach, ideally using resistance-guided therapy. If M. genitalium resistance testing is available it should be performed, and the results should be used to guide therapy (see Mycoplasma genitalium). If M. genitalium resistance testing is not available, doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days should be used. The rationale for this approach is that although not curative, doxycycline decreases the M. genitalium bacterial load, thereby increasing likelihood of moxifloxacin success (759). Higher doses of azithromycin have not been effective for M. genitalium after azithromycin treatment failures. Men with persistent or recurrent NGU after treatment for M. genitalium or T. vaginalis should be referred to an infectious disease or urology specialist.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{HIV Infection}

NGU might facilitate HIV transmission (760). Persons with NGU and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

\section*{Cervicitis}

Two major diagnostic signs characterize cervicitis: 1) a purulent or mucopurulent endocervical exudate visible in the endocervical canal or on an endocervical swab specimen (commonly referred to as mucopurulent cervicitis), and
2) sustained endocervical bleeding easily induced by gentle passage of a cotton swab through the cervical os. Either or both signs might be present. Cervicitis frequently is asymptomatic; however, certain women might report an abnormal vaginal discharge and intermenstrual vaginal bleeding (e.g., especially after sexual intercourse). The criterion of using an increased number of WBCs on endocervical Gram stain in the diagnosis of cervicitis has not been standardized; it is not sensitive, has a low positive predictive value for $C$. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae infections, and is not available in most clinical settings (297,761). Leukorrhea, defined as $>10$ WBCs/HPF on microscopic examination of vaginal fluid, might be a sensitive indicator of cervical inflammation with a high negative predictive value (i.e., cervicitis is unlikely in the absence of leukorrhea) (762,763). Finally, although the presence of gramnegative intracellular diplococci on Gram stain of endocervical exudate might be specific for diagnosing gonococcal cervical infection when evaluated by an experienced laboratorian, it is not a sensitive indicator of infection (764).

\section*{Etiology}
C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae is the most common etiology of cervicitis defined by diagnostic testing. Trichomoniasis, genital herpes (especially primary HSV-2 infection), or M. genitalium (761,765-768) also have been associated with cervicitis. However, in many cases of cervicitis, no organism is isolated, especially among women at relatively low risk for recent acquisition of these STIs (e.g., women aged $>30$ years) (769). Limited data indicate that BV and frequent douching might cause cervicitis (770-772). The majority of persistent cases of cervicitis are not caused by reinfection with C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae; other factors might be involved (e.g., persistent abnormality of vaginal flora, M. genitalium, douching or exposure to other types of chemical irritants, dysplasia, or idiopathic inflammation in the zone of ectopy). Available data do not indicate an association between group B streptococcus colonization and cervicitis (773,774). No specific evidence exists for a role for Ureaplasma parvum or Ureaplasma urealyticum in cervicitis (707,761,765,775,776).

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Because cervicitis might be a sign of upper genital tract infection (e.g., endometritis), women should be assessed for signs of PID and tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae with NAAT on vaginal, cervical, or urine samples (553) (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). Women with cervicitis also should be evaluated for concomitant BV and trichomoniasis. Because sensitivity of microscopy for detecting T. vaginalis is relatively low (approximately $50 \%$ ), symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative wet-mount
microscopy for trichomonads should receive further testing (i.e., NAAT, culture, or other FDA-cleared diagnostic test) (see Trichomoniasis). Testing for M. genitalium with the FDAcleared NAAT can be considered. Although HSV-2 infection has been associated with cervicitis, the utility of specific testing (i.e., PCR or culture) for HSV-2 is unknown. Testing for U. parvum, U. urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, or genital culture for group B streptococcus is not recommended.

\section*{Treatment}

Multiple factors should affect the decision to provide presumptive therapy for cervicitis. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae should be provided for women at increased risk (e.g., those aged <25 years and women with a new sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), if follow-up cannot be ensured, or if testing with NAAT is not possible. Trichomoniasis and BV should be treated if detected (see Bacterial Vaginosis; Trichomoniasis). For women at lower risk for STIs, deferring treatment until results of diagnostic tests are available is an option. If treatment is deferred and C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae NAATs are negative, a follow-up visit to determine whether the cervicitis has resolved can be considered.

Recommended Regimen for Cervicitis*
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
* Consider concurrent treatment for gonococcal infection if the patient is at risk for gonorrhea or lives in a community where the prevalence of gonorrhea is high (see Gonococcal Infections).

Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

To minimize transmission and reinfection, women treated for cervicitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e., until completion of a 7 -day regimen or for 7 days after single-dose therapy) and symptoms have resolved. Women who receive a cervicitis diagnosis should be tested for syphilis and HIV in addition to other recommended diagnostic tests.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Women receiving treatment should return to their provider for a follow-up visit to determine whether cervicitis has resolved. For women who are untreated, a follow-up visit gives providers an opportunity to communicate test results obtained as part of the cervicitis evaluation. Providers should treat on the basis of any positive test results and determine whether
cervicitis has resolved. Women with a specific diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered partner services and instructed to return in 3 months after treatment for repeat testing because of high rates of reinfection, regardless of whether their sex partners were treated (753). If symptoms persist or recur, women should be instructed to return for reevaluation.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Management of sex partners of women treated for cervicitis should be tailored for the specific infection identified or suspected. All sex partners during the previous 60 days should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment if chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis was identified. EPT and other effective partner referral strategies are alternative approaches for treating male partners of women who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection (125-127) (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners are treated.

\section*{Persistent or Recurrent Cervicitis}

Women with persistent or recurrent cervicitis despite antimicrobial therapy should be reevaluated for possible reexposure or treatment failure. If relapse or reinfection with a specific infection has been excluded, BV is not present, and sex partners have been evaluated and treated, management options for persistent cervicitis are undefined. In addition, the usefulness of repeated or prolonged administration of antimicrobial therapy for persistent symptomatic cervicitis remains unknown. The etiology of persistent cervicitis, including the potential role of M. genitalium (777), is unclear. M. genitalium might be considered for cases of cervicitis that persist after azithromycin or doxycycline therapy in which reexposure to an infected partner or medical nonadherence is unlikely. Among women with persistent cervicitis who were previously treated with doxycycline or azithromycin, testing for M. genitalium can be considered and treatment initiated on the basis of results of diagnostic testing (318) (see Mycoplasma genitalium). For women with persistent symptoms that are clearly attributable to cervicitis, referral to a gynecologic specialist can be considered for evaluation of noninfectious causes (e.g., cervical dysplasia or polyps) (778).

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{HIV Infection}

Women with cervicitis and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV. Cervicitis can increase cervical HIV shedding, and treatment
reduces HIV shedding from the cervix and thereby might reduce HIV transmission to susceptible sex partners (779-783).

\section*{Pregnancy}

Diagnosis and treatment of cervicitis for pregnant women does not differ from that for women who are not pregnant (see Diagnostic Considerations; Treatment).

\section*{Contraceptive Management}

According to U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2016, leaving an IUD in place during treatment for cervicitis is advisable (58). However, current recommendations specify that an IUD should not be placed if active cervicitis is diagnosed (59).

\section*{Chlamydial Infections}

\section*{Chlamydial Infection Among Adolescents and Adults}

Chlamydial infection is the most frequently reported bacterial infectious disease in the United States, and prevalence is highest among persons aged $\leq 24$ years (141,784). Multiple sequelae can result from C. trachomatis infection among women, the most serious of which include PID, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Certain women who receive a diagnosis of uncomplicated cervical infection already have subclinical upper genital tract infection.

Asymptomatic infection is common among both men and women. To detect chlamydial infection, health care providers frequently rely on screening tests. Annual screening of all sexually active women aged $<25$ years is recommended, as is screening of older women at increased risk for infection (e.g., women aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) (149). In a communitybased cohort of female college students, incident chlamydial infection was also associated with BV and high-risk HPV infection (785). Although chlamydia incidence might be higher among certain women aged $\geq 25$ years in certain communities, overall, the largest proportion of infection is among women aged $<25$ years (141).

Chlamydia screening programs have been demonstrated to reduce PID rates among women $(786,787)$. Although evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for C. trachomatis among sexually active young men because of certain factors (i.e., feasibility, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness), screening of sexually active young men should be considered in clinical settings with a high prevalence of chlamydia (e.g., adolescent clinics, correctional facilities, or STD specialty
clinics) or for populations with a high burden of infection (e.g., MSM) (149,788). Among women, the primary focus of chlamydia screening should be to detect and treat chlamydia, prevent complications, and test and treat their partners, whereas targeted chlamydia screening for men should be considered only when resources permit, prevalence is high, and such screening does not hinder chlamydia screening efforts for women (789-791). More frequent screening than annual for certain women (e.g., adolescents) or certain men (e.g., MSM) might be indicated on the basis of risk behaviors.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

For women, C. trachomatis urogenital infection can be diagnosed by vaginal or cervical swabs or first-void urine. For men, C. trachomatis urethral infection can be diagnosed by testing first-void urine or a urethral swab. NAATs are the most sensitive tests for these specimens and are the recommended test for detecting C. trachomatis infection (553). NAATs that are FDA cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be collected by a clinician or patient in a clinical setting. Patientcollected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to those collected by a clinician using NAATs (792,793), and this screening strategy is highly acceptable among women $(794,795)$. Optimal urogenital specimen types for chlamydia screening by using NAAT include firstcatch urine (for men) and vaginal swabs (for women) (553). Recent studies have demonstrated that among men, NAAT performance on self-collected meatal swabs is comparable to patient-collected urine or provider-collected urethral swabs (796-798). Patient collection of a meatal swab for C. trachomatis testing might be a reasonable approach for men who are either unable to provide urine or prefer to collect their own meatal swab over providing urine. Previous evidence indicates that the liquid-based cytology specimens collected for Pap smears might be acceptable specimens for NAAT, although test sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than that associated with use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens (799); regardless, certain NAATs have been cleared by FDA for use on liquid-based cytology specimens.

Rectal and oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection among persons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be diagnosed by testing at the anatomic exposure site. NAATs have been demonstrated to have improved sensitivity and specificity, compared with culture, for detecting C. trachomatis at rectal and oropharyngeal sites (553,800-804), and certain NAAT platforms have been cleared by FDA for these anatomic sites (805). Data indicate that NAAT performance on self-collected rectal swabs is comparable to clinician-collected rectal swabs, and this specimen collection strategy for rectal C. trachomatis screening is highly acceptable among men $(217,806)$.

Self-collected rectal swabs are a reasonable alternative to clinician-collected rectal swabs for C. trachomatis screening by NAAT, especially when clinicians are not available or when selfcollection is preferred over clinician collection. Annual screening for rectal C. trachomatis infection should be performed among men who report sexual activity at the rectal site. Extragenital chlamydial testing at the rectal site can be considered for females on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and exposure through shared clinical decision-making bythe patient and the provider. The majority of persons with C. trachomatis detected at oropharyngeal sites do not have oropharyngeal symptoms. The clinical significance of oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection is unclear, and prevalence is low, even among populations at high risk. However, when gonorrhea testing is performed at the oropharyngeal site, chlamydia test results might be reported because certain NAATs detect both bacteria from a single specimen.

POC tests for C. trachomatis among asymptomatic persons can expedite treatment of infected persons and their sex partners. Among symptomatic patients, POC tests for C. trachomatis can optimize treatment by limiting unnecessary presumptive treatment at the time of clinical decision-making and improve antimicrobial stewardship. Thus, using a POC test will likely be a cost-effective diagnostic strategy for C. trachomatis infection (807). Newer NAAT-based POC tests have promising performance and are becoming commercially available (807-809).

\section*{Treatment}

Treating persons with C. trachomatis prevents adverse reproductive health complications and continued sexual transmission. Furthermore, treating their sex partners can prevent reinfection and infection of other partners. Treating pregnant women usually prevents transmission of C. trachomatis to neonates during birth. Treatment should be provided promptly for all persons with chlamydial infection; treatment delays have been associated with complications (e.g., PID) in a limited proportion of women (810).

Recommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection Among Adolescents and Adults

Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
Alternative Regimens
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose
or
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days

A meta-analysis and a Cochrane systematic review evaluated data from randomized clinical trials of azithromycin versus doxycycline for treating urogenital chlamydial infection
determined that microbiologic treatment failure among men was higher for azithromycin than for doxycycline $(748,749)$. Observational studies have also demonstrated that doxycycline is more efficacious for rectal C. trachomatis infection for men and women than azithromycin $(748,811)$. A randomized trial for the treatment of rectal chlamydia infection among MSM reported microbiologic cure was $100 \%$ with doxycycline and $74 \%$ with azithromycin (812). A published review reported that C. trachomatis was detected at the anorectal site among $33 \%-83 \%$ of women who had urogenital C. trachomatis infection, and its detection was not associated with report of receptive anorectal sexual activity (813).
Although the clinical significance of oropharyngeal C. trachomatis infection is unclear and routine oropharyngeal screening is not recommended, oropharyngeal C. trachomatis can be sexually transmitted to genital sites $(211,814)$; therefore, if C. trachomatis is identified from an oropharyngeal specimen while screening for pharyngeal gonorrhea, it should be treated. Evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of antimicrobial regimens for oropharyngeal chlamydia; however, a recently published observational study indicates doxycycline might be more efficacious than azithromycin for oropharyngeal chlamydia (815).
Available evidence supports that doxycycline is efficacious for C. trachomatis infections of urogenital, rectal, and oropharyngeal sites. Although azithromycin maintains high efficacy for urogenital C. trachomatis infection among women, concern exists regarding effectiveness of azithromycin for concomitant rectal C. trachomatis infection, which can occur commonly among women and cannot be predicted by reported sexual activity. Inadequately treated rectal C. trachomatis infection among women who have urogenital chlamydia can increase the risk for transmission and place women at risk for repeat urogenital C. trachomatis infection through autoinoculation from the anorectal site (816). Doxycycline is also available in a delayed-release $200-\mathrm{mg}$ tablet formulation, which requires once-daily dosing for 7 days and is as effective as doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treating urogenital C. trachomatis infection in men and women. It is more costly but also has lower frequency of gastrointestinal side effects (817). Levofloxacin is an effective treatment alternative but is more expensive. Erythromycin is no longer recommended because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects, which can result in nonadherence. When nonadherence to doxycycline regimen is a substantial concern, azithromycin 1 g regimen is an alternative treatment option but might require posttreatment evaluation and testing because it has demonstrated lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal infection.

Among persons receiving multidose regimens, medication should be dispensed with all doses involved, on-site and in the clinic, and the first dose should be directly observed. To maximize adherence with recommended therapies, on-site, directly observed single-dose therapy with azithromycin should always be available for persons for whom adherence with multiday dosing is a considerable concern.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

To minimize disease transmission to sex partners, persons treated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse for 7 days after single-dose therapy or until completion of a 7-day regimen and resolution of symptoms if present. To minimize risk for reinfection, patients also should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their sex partners have been treated. Persons who receive a diagnosis of chlamydia should be tested for HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. MSM who are HIV negative with a rectal chlamydia diagnosis should be offered HIV PrEP.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Test of cure to detect therapeutic failure (i.e., repeat testing 4 weeks after completing therapy) is not advised for nonpregnant persons treated with the recommended or alternative regimens, unless therapeutic adherence is in question, symptoms persist, or reinfection is suspected. Moreover, using chlamydial NAATs at $<4$ weeks after completion of therapy is not recommended because the continued presence of nonviable organisms (553,818,819) can lead to false-positive results.

A high prevalence of C. trachomatis infection has been observed among women and men who were treated for chlamydial infection during the preceding months (753,755,820-822). The majority of posttreatment infections do not result from treatment failure but rather from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner (823), indicating a need for improved education and treatment of sex partners. Repeat infections confer an elevated risk for PID and other complications among women. Men and women who have been treated for chlamydia should be retested approximately 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged (753). If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care <12 months after initial treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Sex partners should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment if they had sexual contact with the
partner during the 60 days preceding the patient's onset of symptoms or chlamydia diagnosis. Although the exposure intervals defining identification of sex partners at risk are based on limited data, the most recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated, even if the time of the last sexual contact was $>60$ days before symptom onset or diagnosis.

If health department partner management strategies (e.g., disease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable for persons with chlamydia, and if a provider is concerned that sex partners are unable to promptly access evaluation and treatment services, EPT should be considered as permitted by law (see Partner Services). Compared with standard patient referral of partners, this approach to therapy, which involves delivering the medication itself or a prescription by the patient or collaborating pharmacy, has been associated with decreased rates of persistent or recurrent chlamydia among women (125-127). Providers should provide patients with written educational materials to give to their partners about chlamydia, which should include notification that partners have been exposed and information about the importance of treatment. These materials also should inform partners about potential therapy-related allergies and adverse effects, along with symptoms indicative of complications (e.g., testicular pain among men and pelvic or abdominal pain among women). Educational materials for female partners should include information about the importance of seeking medical evaluation, especially if PID symptoms are present; undertreatment of PID among female partners and missed opportunities for diagnosing other STIs among women are concerning. MSM with chlamydia have a high risk for coexisting infections, especially undiagnosed HIV, among their partners and might have partners without HIV who could benefit from HIV PrEP. Data are also limited regarding effectiveness of EPT in reducing persistent or recurrent chlamydia among MSM (123,133,134); thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended. Having partners accompany patients when they return for treatment is another strategy that has been used successfully for ensuring partner treatment (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated (i.e., after completion of a 7-day regimen) and any symptoms have resolved.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Clinical experience and published studies indicate that azithromycin is safe and effective during pregnancy (824-826). Doxycycline is contraindicated during the second and third
trimesters of pregnancy because of risk for tooth discoloration. Human data reveal that levofloxacin presents a low risk to the fetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during breastfeeding; however, data from animal studies increase concerns regarding cartilage damage to neonates (431).

Test of cure (i.e., repeat testing after completion of therapy) to document chlamydial eradication, preferably by NAAT, at approximately 4 weeks after therapy completion during pregnancy is recommended because severe sequelae can occur among mothers and neonates if the infection persists. In addition, all pregnant women who have chlamydial infection diagnosed should be retested 3 months after treatment. Detection of C. trachomatis infection during the third semester is not uncommon among adolescent and young adult women, including those without C. trachomatis detected at the time of initial prenatal screening (827). Women aged <25 years and those at increased risk for chlamydia (i.e., those who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) should be screened at the first prenatal visit and rescreened during the third trimester to prevent maternal postnatal complications and chlamydial infection in the infant (149).

Recommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection During Pregnancy
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

Alternative Regimen
Amoxicillin 500 mg orally 3 times/day for 7 days

Because of concerns regarding chlamydia persistence after exposure to penicillin-class antibiotics that has been demonstrated in animal and in vitro studies, amoxicillin is listed as an alternative therapy for C. trachomatis for pregnant women $(828,829)$. Erythromycin is no longer recommended because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side effects that can result in therapy nonadherence. In addition, systematic reviews and meta-analyses have noted an association with macrolide antimicrobials, especially erythromycin, during pregnancy and adverse child outcomes, indicating cautious use in pregnancy (830-831).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons who have chlamydia and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

\section*{Chlamydial Infection Among Neonates}

Prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women is the best method for preventing chlamydial infection among
neonates. C. trachomatis infection of neonates results from perinatal exposure to the mother's infected cervix. Initial C. trachomatis neonatal infection involves the mucous membranes of the eye, oropharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum, although infection might be asymptomatic in these locations. Instead, C. trachomatis infection among neonates is most frequently recognized by conjunctivitis that develops 5-12 days after birth. C. trachomatis also can cause a subacute, afebrile pneumonia with onset at ages 1-3 months. Although C. trachomatis has been the most frequent identifiable infectious cause of ophthalmia neonatorum, neonatal chlamydial infections, including ophthalmia and pneumonia, have occurred less frequently since institution of widespread prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women. Neonates born to mothers at high risk for chlamydial infection, with untreated chlamydia, or with no or unconfirmed prenatal care, are at high risk for infection. However, presumptive treatment of the neonate is not indicated because the efficacy of such treatment is unknown. Infants should be monitored to ensure prompt and age-appropriate treatment if symptoms develop. Processes should be in place to ensure communication between physicians and others caring for the mother and the newborn to ensure thorough monitoring of the newborn after birth.

\section*{Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by C. trachomatis}

A chlamydial etiology should be considered for all infants aged $\leq 30$ days who experience conjunctivitis, especially if the mother has a history of chlamydial infection. These infants should receive evaluation and age-appropriate care and treatment.

\section*{Preventing Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by C. trachomatis}

Neonatal ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin, the only agent available in the United States for this purpose, is ineffective against chlamydial ophthalmia neonatorum (or pneumonia) (833). As an alternative, prevention efforts should focus on prenatal screening for C. trachomatis, including
- screening pregnant women at risk for C. trachomatis infection at the first prenatal visit (e.g., women aged $<25$ years and those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI);
- treating all pregnant women with C. trachomatis during pregnancy and performing a test of cure 4 weeks after treatment to verify chlamydial eradication; these women should also be retested 3 months after treatment and again in the third trimester or at time of delivery, and their partners should also be tested and treated;
- retesting pregnant women during the third trimester who initially tested negative but remained at increased risk for acquiring infection (e.g., women aged $<25$ years and those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI); and
- screening at delivery those pregnant women who were not screened for C. trachomatis during pregnancy if at risk or who had no prenatal care; physicians and others caring for the mother and the newborn should communicate to ensure follow-up on the results of laboratory tests performed at delivery, and if positive, prompt and ageappropriate treatment for the newborn and the mother.
Neonates born to mothers for whom prenatal chlamydia screening has been confirmed and the results are negative are not at high risk for infection.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Sensitive and specific methods for diagnosing chlamydial ophthalmia in the neonate include both tissue culture and nonculture tests (e.g., DFA tests and NAATs). DFA is the only nonculture FDA-cleared test for detecting chlamydia from conjunctival swabs. NAATs are not cleared by FDA for detecting chlamydia from conjunctival swabs, and clinical laboratories should verify the procedure according to CLIA regulations. Specimens for culture isolation and nonculture tests should be obtained from the everted eyelid by using a Dacron (DuPont)-tipped swab or the swab specified by the manufacturer's test kit; for culture and DFA, specimens must contain conjunctival cells, not exudate alone. Ocular specimens from neonates being evaluated for chlamydial conjunctivitis also should be tested for N. gonorrhoeae (see Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by N. gonorrhoeae).

\section*{Treatment}

> \begin{tabular}{l}  Recommended Regimen for Chlamydial Infection Among \\ Neonates \\ \hline Erythromycin base or ethyl succinate $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day \\ orally, divided into 4 doses daily for 14 days* \\ \hline * An association between oral erythromycin and azithromycin and infantile \\ hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has been reported among infants \\ aged < 6 weeks. Infants treated with either of these antimicrobials should \\ be followed for IHPS signs and symptoms. \end{tabular}

Although data regarding use of azithromycin for treating neonatal chlamydial infection are limited, available data demonstrate that a short therapy course might be effective (834). Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate for treating ophthalmia neonatorum caused by chlamydia and is unnecessary when systemic treatment is administered.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Because the efficacy of erythromycin treatment for ophthalmia neonatorum is approximately $80 \%$, a second course of therapy might be required $(834,835)$. Data regarding the efficacy of azithromycin for ophthalmia neonatorum are limited. Therefore, follow-up of infants is recommended to determine whether the initial treatment was effective. The possibility of concomitant chlamydial pneumonia should be considered (see Infant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis).

\section*{Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners}

Mothers of infants who have ophthalmia caused by chlamydia and the sex partners of these women should be evaluated and presumptively treated for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infection Among Adolescents and Adults).

\section*{Infant Pneumonia Caused by C. trachomatis}

Chlamydial pneumonia among infants typically occurs at age 1-3 months and is a subacute pneumonia. Characteristic signs of chlamydial pneumonia among infants include a repetitive staccato cough with tachypnea and hyperinflation and bilateral diffuse infiltrates on a chest radiograph. In addition, peripheral eosinophilia ( $\geq 400$ cells $/ \mathrm{mm}^{3}$ ) occurs frequently. Because clinical presentations differ, all infants aged $1-3$ months suspected of having pneumonia, especially those whose mothers have a history of, are at risk for (e.g., aged $<25$ years and those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI), or suspected of having a chlamydial infection should be tested for C. trachomatis and treated if infected.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Specimens for chlamydial testing should be collected from the nasopharynx. Tissue culture is the definitive standard diagnostic test for chlamydial pneumonia. Nonculture tests (e.g., DFA and NAAT) can be used. DFA is the only nonculture FDA-cleared test for detecting C. trachomatis from nasopharyngeal specimens; however, DFA of nasopharyngeal specimens has a lower sensitivity and specificity than culture. NAATs are not cleared by FDA for detecting chlamydia from nasopharyngeal specimens, and clinical laboratories should verify the procedure according to CLIA regulations (553). Tracheal aspirates and lung biopsy specimens, if collected, should be tested for C. trachomatis.

\section*{Treatment}

Because test results for chlamydia often are unavailable at the time initial treatment decisions are being made, treatment for C. trachomatis pneumonia frequently is based on clinical and
radiologic findings, age of the infant (i.e., $1-3$ months), and risk for chlamydia in the mother (i.e., aged $<25$ years, history of chlamydial infection, multiple sex partners, a sex partner with a concurrent partner, or a sex partner with a history of an STI). In the absence of laboratory results in a situation with a high degree of suspicion of chlamydial infection and the mother is unlikely to return with the infant for follow-up, exposed infants can be presumptively treated with the shortercourse regimen of azithromycin $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day orally, 1 dose daily for 3 days.

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Chlamydial Pneumonia Among Infants}

Erythromycin base or ethyl succinate $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day orally divided into 4 doses daily for 14 days

Alternative Regimen
Azithromycin suspension $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day orally, 1 dose daily for 3 days

\section*{Follow-Up}

Because erythromycin effectiveness in treating pneumonia caused by C. trachomatis is approximately $80 \%$, a second course of therapy might be required (836). Data regarding effectiveness of azithromycin in treating chlamydial pneumonia are limited. Follow-up of infants is recommended to determine whether the pneumonia has resolved, although certain infants with chlamydial pneumonia continue to have abnormal pulmonary function tests later during childhood.

\section*{Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners}

Mothers of infants who have chlamydial pneumonia and the sex partners of these women should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infection Among Adolescents and Adults).

\section*{Chlamydial Infection Among Infants and Children}

Sexual abuse should be considered a cause of chlamydial infection among infants and children. However, perinatally transmitted C. trachomatis infection of the nasopharynx, urogenital tract, and rectum can persist for $2-3$ years (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

NAATs can be used to test vaginal and urine specimens from girls and urine in boys (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). Data are lacking regarding use of NAATs for specimens from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) among boys and girls (553); other nonculture tests (e.g., DFA) are
not recommended because of specificity concerns. Although data regarding NAATs for specimens from extragenital sites for children are more limited and performance is test dependent (553), no evidence supports that NAAT performance for detecting C. trachomatis for extragenital sites among children would differ from that among adults. Because of the implications of a diagnosis of C. trachomatis infection in a child, only CLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAAT should be used for extragenital site specimens (837).

\section*{Recommended Regimens for Chlamydial Infection Among Infants and Children}

For infants and children weighing < 45 kg : Erythromycin base or ethyl succinate $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day orally divided into 4 doses daily for 14 days
Data are limited regarding the effectiveness and optimal dose of azithromycin for treating chlamydial infection among infants and children weighing $<45 \mathrm{~kg}$.

For children weighing $\geq \mathbf{4 5} \mathbf{~ k g}$ but aged $<\mathbf{8}$ years: Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose

For children aged $\geq 8$ years: Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose or
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

See Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children.

\section*{Follow-Up}

A test of cure to detect therapeutic failure ensures treatment effectiveness and should be obtained at a follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after treatment is completed.

\section*{Gonococcal Infections}

\section*{Gonococcal Infection Among Adolescents and Adults}

In the United States, an estimated $1,568,000$ new N. gonorrhoeae infections occur each year $(141,838)$, and gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported bacterial communicable disease. Urethral infections caused by $N$. gonorrhoeae can produce symptoms among men that cause them to seek curative treatment soon enough to prevent sequelae, but often not soon enough to prevent transmission to others. Among women, gonococcal infections are commonly asymptomatic or might not produce recognizable symptoms until complications (e.g., PID) have occurred. PID can result in tubal scarring that can lead to infertility or ectopic pregnancy.
Annual screening for N. gonorrhoeae infection is recommended for all sexually active women aged $<25$ years and for older
women at increased risk for infection (e.g., those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, or a sex partner who has an STI) (149). Additional risk factors for gonorrhea include inconsistent condom use among persons who are not in mutually monogamous relationships, previous or coexisting STIs, and exchanging sex for money or drugs. Clinicians should consider the communities they serve and consult local public health authorities for guidance regarding identifying groups at increased risk. Gonococcal infection, in particular, is concentrated in specific geographic locations and communities. MSM at high risk for gonococcal infection (e.g., those with multiple anonymous partners or substance abuse) or those at risk for HIV acquisition should be screened at all anatomic sites of exposure every 3-6 months (see Men Who Have Sex with Men). At least annual screening is recommended for all MSM. Screening for gonorrhea among heterosexual men and women aged $>25$ years who are at low risk for infection is not recommended (149). A recent travel history with sexual contacts outside the United States should be part of any gonorrhea evaluation.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Specific microbiologic diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection should be performed for all persons at risk for or suspected of having gonorrhea; a specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, reinfections, and transmission. Culture, NAAT, and POC NAAT, such as GeneXpert (Cepheid), are available for detecting genitourinary infection with N. gonorrhoeae (149); culture requires endocervical (women) or urethral (men) swab specimens. Culture is also available for detecting rectal, oropharyngeal, and conjunctival gonococcal infection. NAATs and POC NAATs) allow for the widest variety of FDA-cleared specimen types, including endocervical and vaginal swabs and urine for women, urethral swabs and urine for men, and rectal swabs and pharyngeal swabs for men and women (www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/K121710. pdf). However, product inserts for each NAAT manufacturer should be consulted carefully because collection methods and specimen types vary. Certain NAATs that have been demonstrated to detect commensal Neisseria species might have comparable low specificity when testing oropharyngeal specimens for N. gonorrhoeae (553). NAAT sensitivity for detecting $N$. gonorrhoeae from urogenital and nongenital anatomic sites is superior to culture but varies by NAAT type (553,800-803). For urogenital infections, optimal specimen types for gonorrhea screening using NAATs include first-void urine for men and vaginal swab specimens for women (553). Patient-collected samples can be used in place of providercollected samples in clinical settings when testing by NAAT
for urine (men and women), vaginal swabs, rectal swabs, and oropharyngeal swabs after patient instructions have been provided (209,806,839-842). Patient-collected specimens are reasonable alternatives to provider-collected swabs for gonorrhea screening by NAAT.
In cases of suspected or documented treatment failure, clinicians should perform both culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing because NAATs cannot provide antimicrobial susceptibility results. Because N. gonorrhoeae has demanding nutritional and environmental growth requirements, optimal recovery rates are achieved when specimens are inoculated directly and when the growth medium is promptly incubated in an increased carbon dioxide ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) environment (553). Nonnutritive swab transport systems are available that might maintain gonococcal viability for $<48$ hours in ambient temperatures (843-845).
Because of its high specificity ( $>99 \%$ ) and sensitivity ( $>95 \%$ ), a Gram stain of urethral discharge or secretions that demonstrate polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular gram-negative diplococci can be considered diagnostic for infection with N. gonorrhoeae among symptomatic men. However, because of lower sensitivity, a negative Gram stain should not be considered sufficient for ruling out infection among asymptomatic men. Infection detection by using Gram stain of endocervical, pharyngeal, and rectal specimens also is insensitive and is not recommended. MB or GV stain of urethral secretions is an alternative POC diagnostic test with performance characteristics similar to Gram stain. Gonococcal infection is diagnosed among symptomatic men by documenting the presence of a WBC-containing intracellular purple diplococci in MB or GV smears.

\section*{Antimicrobial-Resistant N. gonorrhoeae}

Gonorrhea treatment is complicated by the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to develop resistance to antimicrobials (846-848). In 1986, the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), a national sentinel surveillance system, was established to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities of urethral N. gonorrhoeae strains in the United States (849). The epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance guides decisions about gonococcal treatment recommendations and has evolved because of shifts in antimicrobial resistance patterns. During 2007, emergence of fluoroquinoloneresistant N. gonorrhoeae in the United States prompted CDC to cease recommending fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea treatment, leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining class of antimicrobials available for gonorrhea treatment in the United States (850). Reflecting concern about emerging gonococcal resistance, CDC's 2010 STD treatment guidelines recommended dual therapy for gonorrhea with a cephalosporin
plus either azithromycin or doxycycline, even if NAAT for C. trachomatis was negative at the time of treatment (851). However, during 2006-2011, the minimum concentrations of cefixime needed to inhibit in vitro growth of the N. gonorrhoeae strains circulating in the United States and other countries increased, demonstrating that cefixime effectiveness might be waning (851). In addition, treatment failures with cefixime or other oral cephalosporins were reported in Asia (852-855), Europe (856-860), South Africa (861), and Canada $(862,863)$. During that time, case reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures for pharyngeal infections reported in Australia $(864,865)$, Japan (866), and Europe were concerning $(856,867)$. Consequently, CDC no longer recommends cefixime as a first-line regimen for gonorrhea treatment in the United States (868). Since 2013, the proportion of GISP isolates that demonstrate reduced susceptibility (minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] $\geq 2.0 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) to azithromycin has increased almost tenfold, to $5.1 \%$ in 2019 (141). Unlike the appearance of ciprofloxacin resistance in the early 2000s, and cefixime reduced-susceptibility isolates during 2010-2011, emergence of azithromycin resistance is not concentrated among certain populations (e.g., MSM in the western United States). Azithromycin has unique pharmacokinetic properties that might predispose to resistance due to its prolonged half-life $(869,870)$. With the exception of a small cluster of gonorrhea strains with azithromycin resistance and reduced susceptibility to cefixime and ceftriaxone among seven patients during 2016, all gonorrhea strains identified by GISP are susceptible to either or both azithromycin and ceftriaxone or cefixime. In addition, since 2013, antimicrobial stewardship has become an urgent public health concern in the United States as described in Antimicrobial Resistant Threats in the United States (871). Emergence of azithromycin resistance is not isolated to $N$. gonorrhoeae; it has also been demonstrated in M. genitalium and such enteric pathogens as Shigella and Campylobacter (see Mycoplasma genitalium; Proctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis). Finally, concern exists regarding azithromycin treatment efficacy for chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections).

Dual therapy for gonococcal infection with ceftriaxone and azithromycin recommended in previous guidance might have mitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone in N. gonorrhoeae; however, concerns regarding potential harm to the microbiome and the effect on other pathogens diminishes the benefits of maintaining dual therapy. Consequently, only ceftriaxone is recommended for treating gonorrhea in the United States (872). Clinicians remaining vigilant for treatment failures is paramount, and CDC plans to continue to monitor for changing ceftriaxone MICs until additional antimicrobials or a vaccine is available. In cases in which chlamydial infection has not been excluded,
patients should also receive antichlamydial therapy. CDC and state health departments participate in CDC-supported gonorrhea surveillance activities (https://www.cdc.gov/std/ gisp) and can provide the most current information regarding gonococcal susceptibility.
Criteria for resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone have not been defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). However, isolates with cefixime or ceftriaxone MICs $\geq 0.5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ are considered to have decreased susceptibility (873). In the United States, the proportion of isolates in GISP demonstrating decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone or cefixime has remained low; during 2019, <0.1\% of isolates with decreased susceptibility (MIC $\geq 0.5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) to ceftriaxone or cefixime were identified (141). Because increasing MICs might predict resistance emergence, GISP established lower cephalosporin MIC threshold values that are lower than the susceptibility breakpoints set by CLSI to provide greater sensitivity in detecting decreasing gonococcal susceptibility for surveillance purposes. The percentage of isolates with cefixime MICs $\geq 0.25 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ increased from $0.1 \%$ during 2006 to $1.4 \%$ during $2011(851,874)$ and declined to $0.3 \%$ during 2019 (141). The percentage of isolates with ceftriaxone MICs $\geq 0.125 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ increased from $<0.1 \%$ in 2006 to $0.4 \%$ in 2011 and decreased to $0.1 \%$ in 2019 (141). Isolates with high-level cefixime and ceftriaxone MICs (MICs $=1.5-8.0 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ and MICs $=1.5-4.0 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$, respectively) have been identified in Japan (866), France (867,875), Spain $(876,877)$, the United Kingdom, and Australia (878,879). Decreased susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to cephalosporins and other antimicrobials is expected to continue; state and local surveillance for antimicrobial resistance is crucial for guiding local therapy recommendations (846,847). Although approximately $3 \%$ of all U.S. men who have gonococcal infections are sampled through GISP, surveillance by clinicians also is crucial. Clinicians who diagnose $N$. gonorrhoeae infection in a person with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure should perform culture and AST of relevant clinical specimens, consult an infectious disease specialist or an STD clinical expert (https://www.stdccn.org/render/Public) for guidance in clinical management, and report the case to CDC through state and local public health authorities within 24 hours. Isolates should be saved and sent to CDC through local and state public health laboratory mechanisms. Health departments should prioritize notification and culture evaluation for sexual partners of persons with N. gonorrhoeae infection thought to be associated with cephalosporin treatment failure or persons whose isolates demonstrate decreased susceptibility to cephalosporin. Agar dilution is the reference standard and preferred method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing with N. gonorrhoeae. Antibiotic gradient strips, such as Etest
(bioMérieux), can be used and are considered an acceptable alternative for quantitative antimicrobial susceptibility testing with $N$. gonorrhoeae when manufacturer instructions are followed. Disc diffusion only provides qualitative susceptibility results.

\section*{Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Cervix, Urethra, or Rectum}

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Recommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Cervix, Urethra, or Rectum Among Adults and Adolescents \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ceftriaxone $500 \mathrm{mg}^{*}$ IM in a single dose for persons weighing <150 kg \\
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
* For persons weighing $\geq 150 \mathrm{~kg}, 1 \mathrm{~g}$ ceftriaxone should be administered.

Although clinical data confirm that a single injection of ceftriaxone 250 mg is $>99 \%$ ( $95 \%$ confidence interval [CI]: $97.6 \%-99.7 \%$ ) effective in curing anogenital gonorrhea of circulating isolates ( $\mathrm{MIC}=0.03 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}$ ), a higher dose is likely necessary for isolates with elevated MICs (880,881). Effective treatment of uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea with ceftriaxone requires concentrations higher than the strain MIC for approximately 24 hours; although individual variability exists in the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone, a $500-\mathrm{mg}$ dose of ceftriaxone is expected to achieve in approximately 50 hours MIC $>0.03 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mL}(880,881)$. The pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone might be different in the pharynx with longer times higher than the strain MIC likely needed to prevent selection of mutant strains in the pharynx (882).
Single-dose injectable cephalosporin regimens, other than ceftriaxone, that are safe and have been effective against uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections in the past include ceftizoxime ( 500 mg IM), cefoxitin ( 2 g IM with probenecid 1 g orally), and cefotaxime ( 500 mg IM). None of these injectable cephalosporins offer any advantage over ceftriaxone 250 mg for urogenital infection, and efficacy for pharyngeal infection is less certain $(883,884)$. Because the ceftriaxone dose has been increased and the pharmacokinetics of other cephalosporins have not been evaluated, these dosing regimens might be at a disadvantage over ceftriaxone 500 mg .
```
Alternative Regimens if Ceftriaxone Is Not Available
Gentamicin 240 mg IM in a single dose
    plus
Azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose
    or
Cefixime* 800 mg orally in a single dose
```

* If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.

In one clinical trial, dual treatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g cured 100\% of cases (lower one-sided 95\% CI bound: 98.5\%) and can be considered an alternative to ceftriaxone for persons with cephalosporin allergy (885). This trial was not powered enough to provide reliable estimates of the efficacy of these regimens for treatment of rectal or pharyngeal infection; however, this regimen cured the few extragenital infections among study participants. Notably, gastrointestinal adverse events, primarily vomiting <1 hour after dosing, occurred among $3 \%-4 \%$ of persons treated with gentamicin plus azithromycin, necessitating retreatment with ceftriaxone and azithromycin. A similar trial that studied gentamicin 240 mg plus azithromycin 1 g determined lower cure rates at extragenital sites; 80\% (95\% CI: 72\%-88\%) of pharyngeal and 90\% (95\% CI: 84\%-95\%) of rectal infections were cured with this regimen (886). Gemifloxacin plus azithromycin has been studied and is no longer recommended as an alternative regimen because of limited availability, cost, and antimicrobial stewardship concerns (885).
An $800-\mathrm{mg}$ oral dose of cefixime should be considered only as an alternative cephalosporin regimen because it does not provide as high, nor as sustained, bactericidal blood levels as a $500-\mathrm{mg}$ IM dose of ceftriaxone. Furthermore, it demonstrates limited efficacy for treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea (92.3\% cure; 95\% CI: 74.9\%-99.1\%); in older clinical studies, cefixime cured $97.5 \%$ of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections (95\% CI: 95.4\%-99.8\%) (883,884). The increase in the prevalence of isolates obtained through GISP with elevated cefixime MICs might indicate early stages of development of clinically significant gonococcal resistance to cephalosporins. Changes in cefixime MICs can result in decreasing effectiveness of cefixime for treating urogenital gonorrhea. Furthermore, as cefixime becomes less effective, continued used of cefixime might hasten the development of resistance to ceftriaxone, a safe, well-tolerated, injectable cephalosporin and the last antimicrobial known to be highly effective in a single dose for treatment of gonorrhea at all anatomic infection sites. Other oral cephalosporins (e.g., cefpodoxime and cefuroxime) are not recommended because of inferior efficacy and less favorable pharmacodynamics (883).
Monotherapy with azithromycin 2 g orally as a single dose has been demonstrated to be $99.2 \%$ effective against uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea (95\% CI: 97.3\%-99.9\%) (883). However, monotherapy is not recommended because of concerns about the ease with which N. gonorrhoeae can develop resistance to macrolides, the high proportion of isolates with azithromycin decreased susceptibility, and documented azithromycin treatment failures (859). Strains of N. gonorrhoeae circulating in the United States are not adequately susceptible
to penicillin, tetracycline, and older macrolides (e.g., erythromycin), and thus use of these antimicrobials cannot be recommended.

Spectinomycin is effective ( $98.2 \%$ in curing uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections) but has poor efficacy for pharyngeal infections (883,887). It is unavailable in the United States, and the gentamicin alternative regimen has replaced the need for spectinomycin, if a cephalosporin allergy exists, in the United States.

\section*{Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Pharynx}

The majority of gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be relatively common among certain populations (800,801,888-890). Although these infections rarely cause complications, they have been reported to be a major source of community transmission and might be a driver of antimicrobial resistance (891,892). Gonococcal infections of the pharynx are more difficult to eradicate than infections at urogenital and anorectal sites (862). Few antimicrobial regimens reliably cure $>90 \%$ of gonococcal pharyngeal infections $(883,884)$. Providers should ask their patients with urogenital or rectal gonorrhea about oral sexual exposure; if reported, pharyngeal testing should be performed.

Recommended Regimen for Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infection of the Pharynx Among Adolescents and Adults
Ceftriaxone $500 \mathrm{mg}^{*}$ IM in a single dose for persons weighing $<150 \mathrm{~kg}$
* For persons weighing $\geq 150 \mathrm{~kg}, 1 \mathrm{~g}$ ceftriaxone should be administered.

If chlamydial infection is identified when pharyngeal gonorrhea testing is performed, treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. No reliable alternative treatments are available for pharyngeal gonorrhea. For persons with an anaphylactic or other severe reaction (e.g., Stevens Johnson syndrome) to ceftriaxone, consult an infectious disease specialist for an alternative treatment recommendation.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

To maximize adherence with recommended therapies and reduce complications and transmission, medication for gonococcal infection should be provided on-site and directly observed. If medications are unavailable when treatment is indicated, linkage to an STI treatment facility should be provided for same-day treatment. To minimize disease transmission, persons treated for gonorrhea should be instructed to abstain from sexual activity for 7 days after treatment and until all sex partners are treated ( 7 days after receiving treatment and resolution of symptoms, if present).

All persons who receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

\section*{Follow-Up}

A test of cure (i.e., repeat testing after completion of therapy) is unnecessary for persons who receive a diagnosis of uncomplicated urogenital or rectal gonorrhea who are treated with any of the recommended or alternative regimens. Any person with pharyngeal gonorrhea should return $7-14$ days after initial treatment for a test of cure by using either culture or NAAT; however, testing at 7 days might result in an increased likelihood of false-positive tests. If the NAAT is positive, effort should be made to perform a confirmatory culture before retreatment, especially if a culture was not already collected. All positive cultures for test of cure should undergo antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Symptoms that persist after treatment should be evaluated by culture for N. gonorrhoeae (with or without simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility. Persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or proctitis also might be caused by other organisms (see Urethritis; Cervicitis; Proctitis).
A high prevalence of $N$. gonorrhoeae infection has been observed among men and women previously treated for gonorrhea (137,753,754,893). The majority of these infections result from reinfection caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or the initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner, indicating a need for improved patient education and treatment of sex partners. Men or women who have been treated for gonorrhea should be retested 3 months after treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated; scheduling the follow-up visit at the time of treatment is encouraged. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care $<12$ months after initial treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Recent sex partners (i.e., persons having sexual contact with the infected patient <60 days preceding onset of symptoms or gonorrhea diagnosis) should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment. If the patient's last potential sexual exposure was $>60$ days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated.
If health department partner-management strategies (e.g., disease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable for persons with gonorrhea and partners' access to prompt clinical evaluation and treatment is limited, EPT can be delivered to the partner by the patient or a collaborating pharmacy as permitted by law (see Partner Services). Treatment of the sexual partner with cefixime 800 mg as a single dose
is recommended, provided that concurrent chlamydial infection has been excluded. If a chlamydia test result has not been documented, the partner may be treated with a single dose of oral cefixime 800 mg plus oral doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day for 7 days. If adherence with multiday dosing is a considerable concern, azithromycin 1 g can be considered but has lower treatment efficacy among persons with rectal chlamydia (see Chlamydial Infections). Provision of medication by EPT should be accompanied by written materials $(125,127)$ for educating partners about gonorrhea, their exposure to gonorrhea, and the importance of therapy. These materials should also educate partners about seeking clinical evaluation for adverse reactions or complications and general follow-up when able. Educational materials for female partners should include information about the importance of seeking medical evaluation for PID, especially if symptomatic; undertreatment of PID among female partners and missed opportunities for diagnosing other STIs among women are of concern. MSM with gonorrhea have a high risk for coexisting infections (especially undiagnosed HIV) among their partners, and they might have partners without HIV who could benefit from PrEP. Data are also limited regarding the effectiveness of EPT in reducing persistent or recurrent gonorrhea among MSM (133,135); thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse for 7 days after they and their sex partners have completed treatment and after resolution of symptoms, if present.

\section*{Suspected Cephalosporin Treatment Failure}

Cephalosporin treatment failure is the persistence of $N$. gonorrhoeae infection despite recommended cephalosporin treatment; such failure is indicative of infection with cephalosporin-resistant gonorrhea among persons whose partners were treated and whose risk for reinfection is low. Suspected treatment failure has been reported among persons receiving oral and injectable cephalosporins (852$855,857,859,861,863,864,867,875,894$ ). Treatment failure should be considered for persons whose symptoms do not resolve within 3-5 days after recommended treatment and report no sexual contact during the posttreatment follow-up period and persons with a positive test of cure (i.e., positive culture $>72$ hours or positive NAAT $>7$ days after receiving recommended treatment) when no sexual contact is reported during the posttreatment follow-up period (874). Treatment failure should also be considered for persons who have a positive culture on test of cure, if obtained, if evidence exists of decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins on antimicrobial
susceptibility testing, regardless of whether sexual contact is reported during the posttreatment follow-up period.

The majority of suspected treatment failures in the United States are likely to be reinfections rather than actual treatment failures (137,753,754,894). However, in cases in which reinfection is unlikely and treatment failure is suspected, before retreatment, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture (preferably with simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing if N. gonorrhoeae is isolated. Phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed by using Etest or agar dilution. All isolates of suspected treatment failures should be sent to CDC for antimicrobial susceptibility testing by agar dilution; local laboratories should store isolates for possible further testing if needed. Testing or storage of specimens or isolates should be facilitated by the state or local health department according to local public health protocol. Instructions for shipping isolates to CDC are available at https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/ arg/specimen_shipping_instructions1-29-08.pdf.
For persons with suspected cephalosporin treatment failure, the treating clinician should consult an infectious disease specialist, the National Network of STD Clinical Prevention Training Center clinical consultation line (https://www.stdccn. org/render/Public), the local or state health department STI program, or CDC (telephone: 800-232-4636) for advice about obtaining cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and treatment. Suspected treatment failure should be reported to CDC through the local or state health department <24 hours after diagnosis.
Patients with suspected treatment failures should first be retreated routinely with the initial regimen used (ceftriaxone 500 mg IM), with the addition of doxycycline if chlamydia infection exists, because reinfections are more likely than actual treatment failures. However, in situations with a higher likelihood of treatment failure than reinfection, relevant clinical specimens should be obtained for culture (preferably with simultaneous NAAT) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing before retreatment. Dual treatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g can be considered, particularly when isolates are identified as having elevated cephalosporin MICs (885,886,895). Persons with suspected treatment failure after treatment with the alternative regimen (cefixime or gentamicin) should be treated with ceftriaxone 500 mg as a single IM dose or as a single dose with or without an antichlamydial agent on the basis of chlamydia infection status. A test of cure at relevant clinical sites should be obtained $7-14$ days after retreatment; culture is the recommended test, preferably with simultaneous NAAT, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of N. gonorrhoeae if isolated. Clinicians should ensure that the patients' sex partners from
the preceding 60 days are evaluated promptly with culture and presumptively treated by using the same regimen used for the patients.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions}

The risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is highest with first-generation cephalosporins but is rare ( $<1 \%$ ) with third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone and cefixime) (631,680,896). Clinicians should first thoroughly assess a patient's allergy history, including type of reaction, associated medications, and previous prescription records. If IgE-mediated penicillin allergy is strongly suspected, dual treatment with single doses of IM gentamicin 240 mg plus oral azithromycin 2 g can be administered (885,886). If a patient is asymptomatic and the treating facility is able to perform gyrase A (gyrA) testing to identify ciprofloxacin susceptibility (wild type), oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg in a single dose can be administered. Providers treating persons with IgE-mediated cephalosporin or penicillin allergy should refer to the section of these guidelines regarding evaluation (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

\section*{Pregnancy}

Pregnant women infected with N. gonorrhoeae should be treated with ceftriaxone 500 mg in a single IM dose plus treatment for chlamydia if infection has not been excluded. When cephalosporin allergy or other considerations preclude treatment with this regimen, consultation with an infectious disease specialist or an STD clinical expert is recommended. Gentamicin use is cautioned during pregnancy because of risk for neonatal birth defects, nephrotoxicity, or ototoxicity (897) (https://www.stdccn.org/render/Public).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons who have gonorrhea and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

\section*{Gonococcal Conjunctivitis}

In the only published study of the treatment regarding gonococcal conjunctivitis among adults, all 12 study participants responded to a single 1-g IM injection of ceftriaxone (898). Because gonococcal conjunctivitis is uncommon and data regarding treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis among adults are limited, consultation with an infectious disease specialist should be considered.

Recommended Regimen for Gonococcal Conjunctivitis Among Adolescents and Adults

Ceftriaxone 1 g IM in a single dose
Providers should consider one-time lavage of the infected eye with saline solution.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Patients should be instructed to refer their sex partners for evaluation and treatment (see Gonococcal Infections, Management of Sex Partners).

\section*{Disseminated Gonococcal Infection}

Infrequently, N. gonorrhoeae can cause disseminated infection. Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) frequently results in petechial or pustular acral skin lesions, asymmetric polyarthralgia, tenosynovitis, or oligoarticular septic arthritis (899-901). Rarely, DGI is complicated by perihepatitis associated with gonococcal PID, endocarditis, or meningitis. Certain strains of N. gonorrhoeae that cause DGI can cause minimal genital inflammation, and urogenital or anorectal infections are often asymptomatic among DGI patients. If DGI is suspected, NAATs or culture specimens from all exposed urogenital and extragenital sites should be collected and processed, in addition to disseminated sites of infection (e.g., skin, synovial fluid, blood, or CSF). All N. gonorrhoeae isolates should be tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Risk factors for dissemination have included female sex, menstruation, pregnancy, and terminal complement deficiency (899); however, reports are increasing among men (900,901). Persons receiving eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits terminal complement activation, also might be at higher risk for DGI (902).

Hospitalization and consultation with an infectious disease specialist are recommended for initial therapy, especially for persons who might not comply with treatment, have an uncertain diagnosis, or have purulent synovial effusions or other complications. Examination for clinical evidence of endocarditis and meningitis should be performed.

\section*{Treatment of Arthritis and Arthritis-Dermatitis Syndrome}

Recommended Regimen for Gonococcal-Related Arthritis and Arthritis-Dermatitis Syndrome

Ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV every 24 hours
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.

\section*{Alternative Regimens}

Cefotaxime 1 g IV every 8 hours
or
Ceftizoxime 1 g every 8 hours
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.

When treating for the arthritis-dermatitis syndrome, the provider can switch to an oral agent guided by antimicrobial susceptibility testing 24-48 hours after substantial clinical improvement, for a total treatment course of $>7$ days.

\section*{Treatment of Gonococcal Meningitis and Endocarditis}

\section*{Recommended Regimen for Gonococcal Meningitis and Endocarditis}

Ceftriaxone $1-2 \mathrm{~g}$ IV every 24 hours
If chlamydial infection has not been excluded, providers should treat for chlamydia with doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days.

No recent studies have been published regarding treatment of DGI involving the CNS or cardiovascular system. The duration of treatment for DGI in these situations has not been systematically studied and should be determined in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Treatment for DGI should be guided by the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Length of treatment should be determined based on clinical presentation. Therapy for meningitis should be continued with recommended parenteral therapy for 10-14 days. Parenteral antimicrobial therapy for endocarditis should be administered for $>4$ weeks. Treatment of gonococcal perihepatitis should be managed in accordance with the recommendations for PID in these guidelines.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Gonococcal infection frequently is asymptomatic among sex partners of persons who have DGI. Providers should instruct patients to refer partners with whom they have had sexual contact during the previous 60 days for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment (see Gonococcal Infections, Management of Sex Partners).

\section*{Gonococcal Infection Among Neonates}

Prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women for gonorrhea is the best method for preventing N. gonorrhoeae infection among neonates. Gonococcal infection among neonates results from perinatal exposure to the mother's infected cervix. It is usually an acute illness that manifests $2-5$ days after birth. Prevalence of infection among neonates depends on the prevalence of infection among pregnant women and whether pregnant women are screened and treated for gonorrhea during
pregnancy. The most severe manifestations of N. gonorrhoeae infection among neonates are ophthalmia neonatorum and sepsis, which can include arthritis and meningitis. Less severe manifestations include rhinitis, vaginitis, urethritis, and scalp infection at sites of previous fetal monitoring.

\section*{Preventing Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by N. gonorrhoeae}

Ocular prophylaxis and preventive gonorrhea screening and treatment of infected pregnant women are especially important because ophthalmia neonatorum can result in perforation of the globe of the eye and blindness (903). Ocular prophylaxis for gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum has a long history of preventing sight-threatening gonococcal ocular infections. Cases in the United States are uncommon, which is likely attributable to gonorrhea screening programs for women, including pregnant women, that have contributed substantially to reduction in ophthalmia neonatorum (904). Neonatal ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin, the only agent available in the United States, is required by law in most states and is recommended because of safety, low cost, and ease of administration. It can contribute to preventing gonococcal blindness because not all pregnant women are screened for gonorrhea. The USPSTF recommends ocular prophylaxis with erythromycin ointment for all newborns <24 hours after birth (903). In addition to continuing routine ocular prophylaxis, prevention should focus on prenatal screening for N. gonorrhoeae, including
- screening pregnant women at risk (e.g., women aged $<25$ years and those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live in a community with high rates of gonorrhea) for N. gonorrhoeae infection at the first prenatal visit;
- treating all pregnant women with $N$. gonorrhoeae infection during pregnancy and retesting in 3 months, in the third trimester or at time of delivery (sex partners should be tested and treated);
- retesting pregnant women in the third trimester who initially tested negative but remained at increased risk for acquiring infection (e.g., women aged $<25$ years and those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live in a community with high rates of gonorrhea); and
- screening for gonorrhea at delivery for women not tested during pregnancy and at risk for infection (e.g., women aged $<25$ years and those aged $\geq 25$ years who have a new sex partner, more than one sex partner, a sex partner with concurrent partners, a sex partner who has an STI, or live
in a community with high rates of gonorrhea) or received no prenatal care; providers caring for the mother and the newborn should communicate to ensure follow-up on the results of laboratory tests performed at delivery, and if positive, prompt appropriate treatment of the newborn and mother.
Erythromycin is the only ophthalmic ointment recommended for use among neonates. Silver nitrate and tetracycline ophthalmic ointments are no longer manufactured in the United States, bacitracin is ineffective, and povidone iodine has not been studied adequately $(905,906)$. Gentamicin ophthalmic ointment has been associated with severe ocular reactions $(907,908)$. If erythromycin ointment is unavailable, infants at risk for exposure to $N$. gonorrhoeae, especially those born to a mother at risk for gonococcal infection or with no prenatal care, can be administered ceftriaxone $25-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV or IM, not to exceed 250 mg in a single dose.
```
Recommended Regimen to Prevent Ophthalmia Neonatorum
Caused by N. gonorrhoeae
Erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment in each eye in a single
application at birth
```


Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment should be instilled into both eyes of neonates as soon as possible after delivery, regardless of whether they are delivered vaginally or by cesarean delivery. Ideally, ointment should be applied by using single-use tubes or ampules rather than multiple-use tubes. If prophylaxis is delayed (i.e., not administered in the delivery room), a monitoring system should be established to ensure that all newborns receive prophylaxis $<24$ hours after delivery.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Newborns at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia include those who did not receive ophthalmic prophylaxis and whose mothers had no prenatal care, have a history of STIs during pregnancy, or have a history of substance misuse. Gonococcal ophthalmia is strongly suspected when intracellular gram-negative diplococci are identified on Gram stain of conjunctival exudate, justifying presumptive treatment for gonorrhea after appropriate cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing for N. gonorrhoeae are performed. Presumptive treatment for $N$. gonorrhoeae might be indicated for newborns at increased risk for gonococcal ophthalmia who have increased WBCs (no GNID) in a Gram-stained smear of conjunctival exudate. Nongonococcal causes of neonatal ophthalmia include Moraxella catarrhalis and other Neisseria species, which are organisms that are indistinguishable from N. gonorrhoeae on Gram-stained smear but can be differentiated in the microbiology laboratory.

\section*{Treatment of Gonococcal Ophthalmia Neonatorum}

Recommended Regimen for Gonococcal Ophthalmia Neonatorum

Ceftriaxone $25-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV or IM in a single dose, not to exceed 250 mg

One dose of ceftriaxone is adequate therapy for gonococcal ophthalmia. Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, especially those born prematurely. Cefotaxime $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV or IM as a single dose can be administered for those neonates unable to receive ceftriaxone because of simultaneous administration of IV calcium. Topical antibiotic therapy alone is inadequate and unnecessary if systemic treatment is administered.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Chlamydial testing should be performed simultaneously from the inverted eyelid specimen (see Ophthalmia Neonatorum Caused by C. trachomatis). Newborns who have gonococcal ophthalmia should be evaluated for signs of disseminated infection (e.g., sepsis, arthritis, and meningitis). Newborns who have gonococcal ophthalmia should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

\section*{Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners}

Mothers of newborns with ophthalmia neonatorum caused by N. gonorrhoeae should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea, along with their sex partners (see Gonococcal Infection Among Adolescents and Adults).

\section*{Disseminated Gonococcal Infection and Gonococcal Scalp Abscesses Among Neonates}

DGI might present as sepsis, arthritis, or meningitis and is a rare complication of neonatal gonococcal infection. Localized gonococcal infection of the scalp can result from fetal monitoring through scalp electrodes. Detecting gonococcal infection among neonates who have sepsis, arthritis, meningitis, or scalp abscesses requires cultures of blood, CSF, or joint aspirate. Specimens obtained from the conjunctiva, vagina, oropharynx, and rectum are useful for identifying the primary site or sites of infection. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all isolates should be performed. Positive Gramstained smears of abscess exudate, CSF, or joint aspirate provide a presumptive basis for initiating treatment for N. gonorrhoeae.

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Recommended Regimens for Disseminated Gonococcal Infection Among Neonates}

Ceftriaxone $25-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day IV or IM in a single daily dose for 7 days, with a duration of 10-14 days if meningitis is documented
or
Cefotaxime $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight/day IV or IM every 12 hours for
7 days, with a duration of 10-14 days if meningitis is documented

Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, especially those born prematurely. Cefotaxime $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV or IM as a single dose can be administered for those neonates unable to receive ceftriaxone because of simultaneous administration of IV calcium.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Chlamydial testing should be performed simultaneously among neonates with gonococcal infection (see Chlamydial Infection Among Neonates). Neonates who have DGI should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

\section*{Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners}

Mothers of newborns who have DGI or scalp abscesses caused by N. gonorrhoeae should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea, along with their sex partners (see Gonococcal Infection Among Adolescents and Adults).

\section*{Neonates Born to Mothers Who Have Gonococcal Infection}

Neonates born to mothers who have untreated gonorrhea are at high risk for infection. Neonates should be tested for gonorrhea at exposed sites (e.g., conjunctiva, vagina, rectum, and oropharynx) and treated presumptively for gonorrhea.

\section*{Treatment in the Absence of Signs of Gonococcal Infection}

> Recommended Regimen for Neonates Without Signs of Gonococcal Infection

Ceftriaxone $20-50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV or IM in a single dose, not to exceed 250 mg

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Ceftriaxone should be administered cautiously to neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, especially those born prematurely. Cefotaxime $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight IV or IM as a single dose can be administered for those neonates unable to receive ceftriaxone because of simultaneous administration of IV calcium. Age-appropriate chlamydial testing should be
performed simultaneously among neonates with gonococcal infection (see Chlamydial Infection Among Neonates). Follow-up examination is not required.

\section*{Management of Mothers and Their Sex Partners}

Mothers who have gonorrhea and their sex partners should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for gonorrhea (see Gonococcal Infection Among Adolescents and Adults).

\section*{Gonococcal Infection Among Infants and Children}

Sexual abuse is the most frequent cause of gonococcal infection among infants and children (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). For preadolescent girls, vaginitis is the most common manifestation of this infection; gonococcalassociated PID after vaginal infection can be less common among preadolescents than adults. Among sexually abused children, anorectal and pharyngeal infections with $N$. gonorrhoede are frequently asymptomatic.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Culture can be used to test urogenital and extragenital sites for girls and boys. NAAT can be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae from vaginal and urine specimens from girls and urine for boys (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children). Although data regarding NAAT from extragenital sites (rectum and pharynx) among children are more limited, and performance is test dependent, no evidence supports that performance of NAAT for detection of N. gonorrhoeae among children differs from that among adults (553). Because of the implications of a N. gonorrhoeae diagnosis in a child, only validated FDA-cleared NAAT assays should be used with extragenital specimens. Consultation with an expert is necessary before using NAAT to minimize the possibility of cross-reaction with nongonococcal Neisseria species and other commensals (e.g., N. meningitidis, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria lactamica, Neisseria cinerea, or M. catarrhalis) and to ensure correct interpretation of results.

Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. If evidence of DGI exists, gonorrhea culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be obtained from relevant clinical sites (see Disseminated Gonococcal Infection).

Ceftriaxone 1 g IM or IV in a single dose daily every 24 hours for 7 days

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Follow-up cultures are unnecessary. Only parenteral cephalosporins (i.e., ceftriaxone) are recommended for use among children. All children identified as having gonococcal infections should be tested for C. trachomatis, syphilis, and HIV (see Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children).

\section*{Mycoplasma genitalium}
M. genitalium causes symptomatic and asymptomatic urethritis among men and is the etiology of approximately 15\%-20\% of NGU, 20\%-25\% of nonchlamydial NGU, and $40 \%$ of persistent or recurrent urethritis (697,909,910). Infection with C. trachomatis is common in selected geographic areas (911-913), although M. genitalium is often the sole pathogen. Data are insufficient to implicate M. genitalium infection with chronic complications among men (e.g., epididymitis, prostatitis, or infertility). The consequences of asymptomatic infection with M. genitalium among men are unknown.

Among women, M. genitalium has been associated with cervicitis, PID, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, and infertility, with an approximately twofold increase in the risk for these outcomes among women infected with M. genitalium (766). M. genitalium infections among women are also frequently asymptomatic, and the consequences associated with asymptomatic M. genitalium infection are unknown.
M. genitalium can be detected among $10 \%-30 \%$ of women with clinical cervicitis (767,770,772,914-916). The existing evidence between M. genitalium and cervicitis is mostly supportive of a causal association. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated among women with M. genitalium, with return to baseline levels after clearance of the pathogen (917).
M. genitalium is identified in the cervix or endometrium of women with PID more often than in women without PID (918-924). Prevalence of M. genitalium among women with PID ranges from $4 \%$ to $22 \%(925,926)$ and was reported as $60 \%$ in one study of women with postabortal PID (918). The association with PID is supported by early studies among nonhuman primates that determined that endosalpingitis develops after inoculation with M. genitalium (927). Recent studies evaluating the lower and upper genital tract using highly sensitive M. genitalium NAAT assays or the role of M. genitalium in histologically defined endometritis have reported significantly elevated risk for PID (928). However, most studies of M. genitalium and PID, even those that controlled extensively for other infections and behavioral and biologic risk, are cross-sectional. The few prospective studies that have evaluated the role of M. genitalium in establishing subsequent PID demonstrated increased PID risk; however, these were not statistically significant associations, often because of a lack of statistical power. No clinical trial data are available that demonstrate that treating M. genitalium cervical infection prevents development of PID or endometritis. Although data regarding the benefits of testing women with PID for M. genitalium and the importance of directing treatment against this organism are limited, the associations of M. genitalium with cervicitis and PID in cross-sectional studies using NAAT testing are consistent (928).
Data from case-control serologic studies (929-931) and a meta-analysis of clinical studies (766) indicate a potential role in causing infertility. However, seroassays are suboptimal and inconclusive. Similarly, evidence for a role for M. genitalium infection during pregnancy as a cause of perinatal complications, including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, or low birthweight, are conflicting because evidence is insufficient to attribute cause (766,932-934). Data are limited regarding ectopic pregnancy and neonatal M. genitalium infection $(935,936)$.
Rectal infection with M. genitalium has been reported among $1 \%-26 \%$ of MSM (937-940) and among $3 \%$ of women (941). Rectal infections often are asymptomatic, although higher prevalence of M. genitalium has been reported among men with rectal symptoms. Similarly, although asymptomatic M. genitalium has been detected in the pharynx, no evidence exists of it causing oropharyngeal symptoms or systemic disease.

Urogenital M. genitalium infection is associated with HIV among both men and women (942-944); however, the data are from case-control and cross-sectional studies. Risk for HIV infection is increased among women with M. genitalium, and evidence indicates that HIV shedding occurs more often among persons with M. genitalium and HIV infection who are not taking ART than among persons without M. genitalium $(942,944)$.

\section*{Antimicrobial Resistance}

Resistance to azithromycin has been rapidly increasing and has been confirmed in multiple studies. Prevalence of molecular markers for macrolide resistance, which highly correlates with treatment failure, ranges from $44 \%$ to $90 \%$ in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia (697,702,945-953). Treatment with azithromycin alone has been reported to select for resistance (705,954,955), with treatment of macrolide-susceptible infections with a 1-g dose of azithromycin resulting in selection of resistantstrain populations in $10 \%-12 \%$ of cases. The prevalence of quinolone resistance markers is much lower (697,956-959). The first clinical treatment failures after moxifloxacin were associated specifically with the S83I mutation in the parC gene $(954,960)$. Prevalence of the S83I mutation in the United States ranges from $0 \%$ to $15 \%$ (947); however, correlation with fluoroquinolone treatment failure is less consistent than that with mutations associated with macrolide resistance (953,961,962). Clinically relevant quinolone resistance often is associated with coexistent macrolide resistance (954).

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}
M. genitalium is an extremely slow-growing organism. Culture can take up to 6 months, and technical laboratory capacity is limited to research settings. NAAT for M. genitalium is FDA cleared for use with urine and urethral, penile meatal, endocervical, and vaginal swab samples (https://www.hologic.com/package-inserts/diagnostic-products/aptima-mycoplasma-genitaliumassay). Molecular tests for macrolide (i.e., azithromycin) or quinolone (i.e., moxifloxacin) resistance markers are not commercially available in the United States. However, molecular assays that incorporate detection of mutations associated with macrolide resistance are under evaluation.
Men with recurrent NGU should be tested for M. genitalium using an FDA-cleared NAAT. If resistance testing is available, it should be performed and the results used to guide therapy. Women with recurrent cervicitis should be tested for M. genitalium, and testing should be considered among women with PID. Testing should be accompanied with resistance testing, if available. Screening of asymptomatic M. genitalium infection among women and men or extragenital testing for M. genitalium is not recommended. In clinical practice, if testing is unavailable, M. genitalium should be suspected in cases of persistent or recurrent urethritis or cervicitis and considered for PID.

\section*{Treatment}
M. genitalium lacks a cell wall, and thus antibiotics targeting cell-wall biosynthesis (e.g., ß-lactams including penicillins and cephalosporins) are ineffective against this organism. Because of the high rates of macrolide resistance with treatment failures (707) and efficient selection of additional resistance, a 1-g dose of azithromycin should not be used.

Two-stage therapy approaches, ideally using resistanceguided therapy, are recommended for treatment. Resistanceguided therapy has demonstrated cure rates of $>90 \%$ and should be used whenever possible $(759,963)$; however, it requires access to macrolide-resistance testing. As part of this approach, doxycycline is provided as initial empiric therapy, which reduces the organism load and facilitates organism clearance, followed by macrolide-sensitive M. genitalium infections treated with high-dose azithromycin; macrolideresistant infections are treated with moxifloxacin $(964,965)$.

\section*{Recommended Regimens if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is Available}

If macrolide sensitive: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin 1 g orally initial dose, followed by 500 mg orally daily for 3 additional days ( 2.5 g total)
If macrolide resistant: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days

\section*{Recommended Regimen if M. genitalium Resistance Testing Is Not Available}

If M. genitalium is detected by an FDA-cleared NAAT: Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 7 days

Although the majority of M. genitalium strains are sensitive to moxifloxacin, resistance has been reported, and adverse side effects and cost should be considered with this regimen. In settings without access to resistance testing and when moxifloxacin cannot be used, an alternative regimen can be considered, based on limited data: doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days, followed by azithromycin ( 1 g orally on day 1 followed by 500 mg once daily for 3 days) and a test of cure 21 days after completion of therapy (963). Because of the high prevalence of macrolide resistance and high likelihood of treatment failure, this regimen should be used only when a test of cure is possible, and no other alternatives exist. If symptomatic treatment failure or a positive test of cure occurs after this regimen, expert consultation is recommended. Data are limited regarding use of minocycline in instances of treatment failure (966).

Recommended PID treatment regimens are not effective against M. genitalium. Initial empiric therapy for PID, which includes doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days, should be provided at the time of presentation for care. If
M. genitalium is detected, a regimen of moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 14 days has been effective in eradicating the organism. Nevertheless, no data have been published that assess the benefits of testing women with PID for M. genitalium, and the importance of directing treatment against this organism is unknown.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Test of cure is not recommended for asymptomatic persons who received treatment with a recommended regimen. In settings in which M. genitalium testing is available, persons with persistent urethritis, cervicitis, or PID accompanied by detection of M. genitalium should be treated with moxifloxacin.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Recent studies report a high concordance of M. genitalium among partners of males, females, and MSM; however, no studies have determined whether reinfection is reduced with partner treatment (940,967,968). Sex partners of patients with symptomatic M. genitalium infection can be tested, and those with a positive test can be treated to possibly reduce the risk for reinfection. If testing the partner is not possible, the antimicrobial regimen that was provided to the patient can be provided.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons who have M. genitalium and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those persons without HIV.

\section*{Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor, or Discharge}

The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider.

Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication (969). Therefore, a careful history, examination, and laboratory testing to determine the etiology of any vaginal symptoms are warranted. Information regarding sexual behaviors and
practices, sex of sex partners, menses, vaginal hygiene practices (e.g., douching), and self-treatment with oral and intravaginal medications or other products should be elicited. The infections most frequently associated with vaginal symptoms are BV (i.e., replacement of the vaginal flora by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria including G. vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, A. vaginae, Megasphaera type 1, and numerous other fastidious or uncultivated anaerobes), trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal vaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually transmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently diagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are being evaluated for an STI.
Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH , a potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH (i.e., >4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although trichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH ). Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of $0.9 \%$ normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in $10 \% \mathrm{KOH}$ solution (samples that emit an amine odor immediately upon application of KOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e., epithelial cells with borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which are characteristic of BV . The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately $50 \%$ compared with NAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast) (670). Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).
In settings where pH paper, KOH , and microscopy are unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, described in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be used. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing indicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or
other noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. For women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

\section*{Bacterial Vaginosis}

BV is a vaginal dysbiosis resulting from replacement of normal hydrogen peroxide and lactic-acid-producing Lactobacillus species in the vagina with high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria, including G. vaginalis, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, A. vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. A notable feature is the appearance of a polymicrobial biofilm on vaginal epithelial cells (970). Certain women experience transient vaginal microbial changes, whereas others experience them for longer intervals (971). BV is a highly prevalent condition and the most common cause of vaginal discharge worldwide (972). However, in a nationally representative survey, the majority of women with BV were asymptomatic (310).
BV is associated with having multiple male sex partners, female partners, sexual relationships with more than one person (973), a new sex partner, lack of condom use (974), douching (975,976), and HSV-2 seropositivity (977). Male circumcision reduces the risk for BV among women (978). In addition, BV prevalence increases during menses $(979,980)$. Women who have never been sexually active are rarely affected (981). The cause of the microbial alteration that precipitates BV is not fully understood, and whether BV results from acquisition of a single sexually transmitted pathogen is unknown. BV prevalence has been reported to increase among women with copper-containing IUDs (972,982). Hormonal contraception does not increase risk for BV (983) and might protect against BV development $(983,984)$. Vitamin D deficiency has not been reported to be a risk factor for BV (985).
Women with BV are at increased risk for STI acquisition, such as HIV, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis (977), M. genitalium (986), HPV (987), and HSV-2 (988); complications after gynecologic surgery; complications of pregnancy; and recurrence of BV (971,989-991). BV also increases HIV infection acquisition (992) because specific BV-associated bacteria can increase susceptibility to HIV $(993,994)$ and the risk for HIV transmission to male sex partners (187). Evaluation of short-term valacyclovir suppression among women with HSV-2 did not decrease the risk for BV, despite effective suppression of HSV-2 (995).
Although BV-associated bacteria can be identified on male genitalia $(996,997)$, treatment of male sex partners has not been beneficial in preventing the recurrence of BV (998). Among WSW, a high level of BV concordance occurs between sex partners (292); however, no studies have evaluated treatment of female sex partners of WSW to prevent BV recurrence.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

BV can be diagnosed by using clinical criteria (i.e., Amsel's diagnostic criteria) (999) or by determining the Nugent score from a vaginal Gram stain (1000). Vaginal Gram stain, considered the reference standard laboratory method for diagnosing BV, is used to determine the relative concentration of lactobacilli (i.e., long gram-positive rods), small gram-negative and gram-variable rods (i.e., G. vaginalis or Bacteroides), and curved gram-negative rods (i.e., Mobiluncus) characteristic of BV. A Nugent score of $0-3$ is consistent with a Lactobacillus-predominant vaginal microbiota, 4-6 with intermediate microbiota (emergence of G. vaginalis), and 7-10 with BV . Clinical diagnosis of BV by Amsel criteria requires at least three of the following four symptoms or signs:
- Homogeneous, thin discharge (milklike consistency) that smoothly coats the vaginal walls
- Clue cells (e.g., vaginal epithelial cells studded with adherent bacteria) on microscopic examination
- pH of vaginal fluid >4.5
- A fishy odor of vaginal discharge before or after addition of $10 \% \mathrm{KOH}$ (i.e., the whiff test)
Detection of at least three Amsel criteria has been correlated with results by Gram stain (1001). The sensitivity and specificity of the Amsel criteria are $37 \%-70 \%$ and $94 \%-99 \%$, respectively, compared with the Nugent score (1002).

In addition to the Amsel criteria, multiple POC tests are available for BV diagnosis. The Osom BV Blue test (Sekisui Diagnostics) detects vaginal sialidase activity (1003,1004). The Affirm VP III (Becton Dickinson) is an oligonucleotide probe test that detects high concentrations of G. vaginalis nucleic acids ( $>5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{CFU}$ of G. vaginalis $/ \mathrm{mL}$ of vaginal fluid) for diagnosing BV, Candida species, and T. vaginalis. This test has been reported to be most useful for symptomatic women in conjunction with vaginal pH measurement and presence of amine odor (sensitivity of $97 \%$ ); specificity is $81 \%$ compared with Nugent. Finally, the FemExam Test Card (Cooper Surgical) measures vaginal pH, presence of trimethylamine (a metabolic by-product of G. vaginalis), and proline aminopeptidase (1005). Sensitivity is $91 \%$ and specificity is $61 \%$, compared with Nugent. This test has primarily been studied in resource-poor settings (1005), and although it has been reported to be beneficial compared with syndromic management, it is not a preferred diagnostic method for BV diagnosis.

Multiple BV NAATs are available for BV diagnosis among symptomatic women (1002). These tests are based on detection of specific bacterial nucleic acids and have high sensitivity and specificity for BV (i.e., G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, BVAB2, or Megasphaera type 1) (1006) and certain lactobacilli (i.e.,

Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus gasseri). They can be performed on either clinician- or selfcollected vaginal specimens with results available in $<24$ hours, depending on the availability of the molecular diagnostic platform (1002). Five quantitative multiplex PCR assays are available: Max Vaginal Panel (Becton Dickinson) (1007), Aptima BV (Hologic), NuSwab VG (LabCorp) (1008), OneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by qPCR (Medical Diagnostic Laboratories) (1009), and SureSwab BV (Quest Diagnostics). Two of these assays are FDA cleared (BD Max Vaginal Panel and Aptima BV), and the other three are laboratory-developed tests.

The Max Vaginal Panel provides results by an algorithmic analysis of molecular DNA detection of Lactobacillus species (L. crispatus and L. jensenii) in addition to G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, BVAB2, and Megasphaera type 1. This test has $90.5 \%$ sensitivity and $85.8 \%$ specificity for BV diagnosis, compared with Amsel criteria and Nugent score. It also provides results for Candida species and T. vaginalis. The Aptima BV detects G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and certain Lactobacillus species including L. crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. gasseri, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from $95.0 \%$ to $97.3 \%$ and $85.8 \%$ to $89.6 \%$, respectively (using either clinician- or patient-collected vaginal swabs). The three laboratory-developed tests (NuSwab VG, OneSwab BV Panel PCR with Lactobacillus Profiling by qPCR, and SureSwab BV) have to be internally validated before use for patient care yet have good sensitivity and specificity, similar to FDA-cleared assays. BV NAATs should be used among symptomatic women only (e.g., women with vaginal discharge, odor, or itch) because their accuracy is not well defined for asymptomatic women. Despite the availability of BV NAATs, traditional methods of BV diagnosis, including the Amsel criteria, Nugent score, and the Affirm VP III assay, remain useful for diagnosing symptomatic BV because of their lower cost and ability to provide a rapid diagnosis. Culture of G. vaginalis is not recommended as a diagnostic tool because it is not specific. Cervical Pap tests have no clinical utility for diagnosing BV because of their low sensitivity and specificity.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment for BV is recommended for women with symptoms. Established benefits of therapy among nonpregnant women are to relieve vaginal symptoms and signs of infection. Other potential benefits of treatment include reduction in the risk for acquiring C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HIV, HPV, and HSV-2 (971,986$988,990,1010$ ). No data are available that directly compare the efficacy of oral and topical medications for treating BV.

\section*{Recommended Regimens for Bacterial Vaginosis}

\section*{Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days}
or
Metronidazole gel 0.75\% one full applicator ( 5 g ) intravaginally, once
daily for 5 days
or
Clindamycin cream $2 \%$ one full applicator ( 5 g ) intravaginally at bedtime for 7 days

A review regarding alcohol consumption during metronidazole treatment reported no in vitro studies, animal models, reports of adverse effects, or clinical studies providing convincing evidence of a disulfiram-like interaction between alcohol and metronidazole (1011). The previous warning against simultaneous use of alcohol and metronidazole was based on laboratory experiments and individual case histories in which the reported reactions were equally likely to have been caused by alcohol alone or by adverse effects of metronidazole.
Metronidazole does not inhibit acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, as occurs with disulfiram. Ethanol alone or ethanolindependent side effects of metronidazole might explain the suspicion of disulfiram-like effects. Thus, refraining from alcohol use while taking metronidazole (or tinidazole) is unnecessary. Clindamycin cream is oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms for 5 days after use (refer to clindamycin product labeling for additional information).

Women should be advised to refrain from sexual activity or to use condoms consistently and correctly during the BV treatment regimen. Douching might increase the risk for relapse, and no data support use of douching for treatment or symptom relief.
Alternative Regimens
Clindamycin 300 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days
or
Clindamycin ovules 100 mg intravaginally once at bedtime for 3 days* or
Secnidazole 2 g oral granules in a single dose ${ }^{\dagger}$
or
Tinidazole 2 g orally once daily for 2 days
or
Tinidazole 1 g orally once daily for 5 days
* Clindamycin ovules use an oleaginous base that might weaken latex or rubber products (e.g., condoms and diaphragms). Use of such products within 72 hours after treatment with clindamycin ovules is not recommended.
${ }^{\dagger}$ Oral granules should be sprinkled onto unsweetened applesauce, yogurt, or pudding before ingestion. A glass of water can be taken after administration to aid in swallowing.

Alternative regimens include secnidazole oral granules (1012-1014), multiple oral tinidazole regimens (1015), or clindamycin (oral or intravaginal) (1016). In a phase 3 clinical trial of secnidazole 2 g oral granules versus placebo, BV clinical cure rates at days 21-30 were 53\% in the secnidazole
arm compared with $19 \%$ in the placebo arm ( $\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ) (1013). Secnidazole is listed as an alternative regimen, due to its higher cost and lack of long-term outcomes compared with recommended BV treatments. A patient savings card for secnidazole is available at https://www.solosec.com/ savings-card.

Additional BV treatment regimens include metronidazole $1.3 \%$ vaginal gel in a single dose $(1017,1018)$ and clindamycin phosphate (Clindesse) $2 \%$ vaginal cream in a single dose (1019). In a phase 3 clinical trial of metronidazole $1.3 \%$ vaginal gel versus placebo, BV clinical cure rates at day 21 were $37.2 \%$ in the metronidazole $1.3 \%$ vaginal gel arm, compared with $26.6 \%$ in the placebo arm ( $\mathrm{p}=0.01$ ) (1018). A patient savings card for metronidazole $1.3 \%$ vaginal gel is available at https:// nuvessa.com/nuvessa_files/19_Nuvessa_WEB_Card_032819. pdf. In a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, parallelgroup study of Clindesse $2 \%$ vaginal cream single dose versus clindamycin $2 \%$ vaginal cream at bedtime for 7 days among 540 women with BV, no statistically significant difference existed between groups in clinical cure at days 21-30 ( $64.3 \%$ versus $63.2 \% ; \mathrm{p}=0.95$ ) (1019); however, this study had methodologic problems. A patient savings card for Clindesse $2 \%$ vaginal cream is available at https://www.clindesse.com/ pdf/CLINDESSE_SavingsCard.pdf.

BV biofilm disrupting agents (i.e., TOL-463) (1020) are being investigated to determine their role in enhancing the likelihood of BV cure relative to approved therapies. Studies have evaluated the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of intravaginal Lactobacillus and other probiotic formulations to treat BV and restore normal vaginal microbiota (1021-1025); overall, no studies support these products as an adjunctive or replacement therapy for women with BV .

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

All women with BV should be tested for HIV and other STIs.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Follow-up visits are unnecessary if symptoms resolve. Because persistent or recurrent BV is common, women should be advised to return for evaluation if symptoms recur. Limited data are available regarding optimal management strategies for women with persistent or recurrent BV. Using a different recommended treatment regimen can be considered for women who have a recurrence; however, retreatment with the same recommended regimen is an acceptable approach for treating persistent or recurrent BV after the first occurrence (1026). For women with multiple recurrences after completion of a recommended regimen, either $0.75 \%$ metronidazole gel or 750 mg metronidazole vaginal suppository twice weekly for $>3$ months has been reported to reduce recurrences, although this benefit does not persist when
suppressive therapy is discontinued $(1027,1028)$. Limited data indicate that for women with multiple recurrences, an oral nitroimidazole (metronidazole or tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/ day for 7 days), followed by intravaginal boric acid 600 mg daily for 21 days and suppressive $0.75 \%$ metronidazole gel twice weekly for 4-6 months, might be an option for women with recurrent BV (1029). Monthly oral metronidazole 2 g administered with fluconazole 150 mg has also been evaluated as suppressive therapy; this regimen reduced the BV incidence and promoted colonization with normal vaginal microbiota (1030). A randomized controlled trial of a dendrimer-based microbicide $1 \%$ vaginal gel (Astodrimer) also reported favorable results in prolonging the time to BV recurrence, compared with placebo (1031). In addition, a clinical trial of $L$. crispatus CTV-05 (Lactin-V), administered vaginally in 4 consecutive daily doses for 4 days in week 1 followed by twice weekly doses for 10 weeks (after initial treatment with 5 days of $0.75 \%$ vaginal metronidazole gel), reported a substantially lower incidence of BV recurrence at 12 weeks in the Lactin-V arm, compared with placebo (1032); however this medication is not yet FDA cleared or commercially available. High-dose Vitamin D supplementation has not been determined to decrease BV recurrence in randomized controlled trials (1033) and is not recommended.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Data from earlier clinical trials indicate that a woman's response to therapy and the likelihood of relapse or recurrence are not affected by treatment of her sex partner (998). Therefore, routine treatment of sex partners is not recommended. However, a pilot study reported that male partner treatment (i.e., metronidazole 400 mg orally 2 times/ day in conjunction with $2 \%$ clindamycin cream applied topically to the penile skin 2 times/day for 7 days) of women with recurrent BV had an immediate and sustained effect on the composition of the vaginal microbiota, with an overall decrease in bacterial diversity at day 28 (1034). Male partner treatment also had an immediate effect on the composition of the penile microbiota; however, this was not as pronounced at day 28, compared with that among women. A phase 3 multicenter randomized double-blinded trial evaluating the efficacy of a 7-day oral metronidazole regimen versus placebo for treatment of male sex partners of women with recurrent BV did not find that male partner treatment reduced BV recurrence in female partners, although women whose male partners adhered to multidose metronidazole were less likely to experience treatment failure (1035).

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, or Adverse Reactions}

Intravaginal clindamycin cream is preferred in case of allergy or intolerance to metronidazole or tinidazole. Intravaginal metronidazole gel can be considered for women who are not allergic to metronidazole but do not tolerate oral metronidazole.

\section*{Pregnancy}

BV treatment is recommended for all symptomatic pregnant women because symptomatic BV has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including premature rupture of membranes, preterm birth, intra-amniotic infection, and postpartum endometritis (989,991,1036). Studies have been undertaken to determine the efficacy of BV treatment among this population, including two trials demonstrating that oral metronidazole was efficacious during pregnancy by using the 250 mg 3 times/day regimen (1037,1038); however, oral metronidazole administered as a 500 mg 2 times/day regimen can also be used. One trial involving a limited number of participants revealed treatment with oral metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days to be equally effective as metronidazole gel $0.75 \%$ for 5 days, with cure rates of $70 \%$ by using Amsel criteria to define cure (1039). Another trial demonstrated a cure rate of $85 \%$ by using Gram-stain criteria after treatment with oral clindamycin 300 mg 2 times/day for 7 days (1040-1043).
Although older studies indicated a possible link between using vaginal clindamycin during pregnancy and adverse outcomes for the newborn, newer data demonstrate that this treatment approach is safe for pregnant women (1044). Although metronidazole crosses the placenta, no evidence of teratogenicity or mutagenic effects among infants has been reported in multiple cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies of pregnant women (1041-1043). These data indicate that metronidazole therapy poses low risk during pregnancy. Data from human studies are limited regarding the use of tinidazole in pregnancy; however, animal data demonstrate that such therapy poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should be avoided during pregnancy (431). Data are insufficient regarding efficacy and adverse effects of secnidazole, Clindesse $2 \%$ vaginal cream, metronidazole $1.3 \%$ vaginal gel, and $750-\mathrm{mg}$ vaginal metronidazole tablets during pregnancy; thus, their use should be avoided.
Oral therapy has not been reported to be superior to topical therapy for treating symptomatic BV in effecting cure or preventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy. Pregnant women can be treated with any of the recommended regimens for nonpregnant women, in addition to the alternative regimens of oral clindamycin and clindamycin ovules.

Treatment of asymptomatic BV among pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery (i.e., those with a previous preterm birth or late miscarriage) has been evaluated by multiple studies, which have yielded mixed results. Seven trials have evaluated treatment of pregnant women with asymptomatic BV at high risk for preterm delivery: one revealed harm (1045), two reported no benefit (1046,1047), and four demonstrated benefit (1037,1038,1048,1049).

Treatment of asymptomatic BV among pregnant women at low risk for preterm delivery has not been reported to reduce adverse outcomes of pregnancy in a large multicenter randomized controlled trial (1050). Therefore, routine screening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at high or low risk for preterm delivery for preventing preterm birth is not recommended.

Metronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal oral therapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses that are less than those used to treat infections among infants, although the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. Plasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but remain less than maternal plasma levels (https://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922/?report=classic). Although multiple reported case series identified no evidence of metronidazole-associated adverse effects for breastfed infants, certain clinicians recommend deferring breastfeeding for 12-24 hours after maternal treatment with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole (1051). Lower doses produce a lower concentration in breast milk and are considered compatible with breastfeeding (1052,1053).

\section*{HIV Infection}

BV appears to recur with higher frequency among women who have HIV infection (1054). Women with HIV infection and BV should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

\section*{Trichomoniasis}

Trichomoniasis is estimated to be the most prevalent nonviral STI worldwide, affecting approximately 3.7 million persons in the United States (838,1055). Because trichomoniasis is not a reportable disease (1056), and no recommendations are available for general screening for T. vaginalis, the epidemiology of trichomoniasis has largely come from population-based and clinic-based surveillance studies. The U.S. population-based T. vaginalis prevalence is $2.1 \%$ among females and $0.5 \%$ among males, with the highest rates among Black females (9.6\%) and Black males $(3.6 \%)$, compared with non-Hispanic White women (0.8\%) and Hispanic women (1.4\%) (1057,1058). Unlike chlamydia and gonorrhea, T. vaginalis prevalence
rates are as high among women aged $>24$ years as they are for women aged <24 years (1057). Among persons attending nine geographically diverse STD clinics, the trichomonas prevalence was $14.6 \%$ among women (1059), and a study of STD clinic attendees in Birmingham, Alabama, identified a prevalence of $27 \%$ among women and $9.8 \%$ among men (1060). Symptomatic women have a four times higher rate of infection than asymptomatic women (26\% versus 6.5\%) (1061). Rates are also high among incarcerated persons of both sexes at $9 \%-32 \%$ of incarcerated women (386,387,391,392,1062) and $3.2 \%-8 \%$ of incarcerated men (388). Women with a history of incarceration are two to five times more likely to have T. vaginalis (387,388,1063,1064). Other risk factors for T. vaginalis include having two or more sex partners during the previous year, having less than a high school education, and living below the national poverty level (1065). Women with BV are at higher risk for T. vaginalis (1066). Male partners of women with trichomoniasis are likely to have infection (1067), although the prevalence of trichomoniasis among MSM is low $(179,1068)$.

The majority of persons who have trichomoniasis ( $70 \%-85 \%$ ) either have minimal or no genital symptoms, and untreated infections might last from months to years (137,1069,1070). Men with trichomoniasis sometimes have symptoms of urethritis, epididymitis, or prostatitis, and women with trichomoniasis sometimes have vaginal discharge, which can be diffuse, malodorous, or yellow-green with or without vulvar irritation, and might have a strawberry-appearing cervix, which is observed more often on colposcopy than on physical examination (1071). Although many persons might be unaware of their infection, it is readily passed between sex partners during penile-vaginal sex (1072) or through transmission of infected vaginal fluids or fomites among women who have sex with women (275,294).

Among persons who are sexually active, the best way to prevent genital trichomoniasis is through consistent and correct use of condoms (external or internal) (18). Partners of men who have been circumcised might have a somewhat reduced risk for T. vaginalis infection (1072,1073). Douching is not recommended because it might increase the risk for vaginal infections, including trichomoniasis (1074).
T. vaginalis causes reproductive morbidity and has been reported to be associated with a 1.4 -times greater likelihood of preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, and infants who are small for gestational age (1075). T. vaginalis was also determined to be associated with a 2.1 -fold increased risk for cervical cancer in a meta-analysis (1076). Another meta-analysis of six studies reported a slightly elevated but not statistically significant association between T. vaginalis and prostate cancer (1077).
T. vaginalis infection is associated with a 1.5 -fold increased risk for HIV acquisition and is associated with an increase in HIV vaginal shedding, which is reduced with T. vaginalis treatment among women without viral suppression (1078,1079). Among women with HIV infection, T. vaginalis infection is associated with increased risk for PID (1080-1082).

Diagnostic testing for T. vaginalis should be performed for women seeking care for vaginal discharge. Annual screening might be considered for persons receiving care in highprevalence settings (e.g., STD clinics and correctional facilities) and for asymptomatic women at high risk for infection (e.g., multiple sex partners, transactional sex, drug misuse, or a history of STIs or incarceration). However, data are lacking regarding whether screening and treatment for asymptomatic trichomoniasis in high-prevalence settings for women at high risk can reduce any adverse health events and health disparities or reduce community infection burden. Decisions about screening can be guided by local epidemiology of T. vaginalis infection. Routine annual screening for T. vaginalis among asymptomatic women with HIV infection is recommended because of these adverse events associated with trichomoniasis and HIV infection.

Extragenital T. vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon compared with genital infections. A study of 500 men in San Francisco, California, reported a $0.6 \%$ rate of rectal T. vaginalis (1083); however, this might reflect deposition of T. vaginalis DNA and not necessarily active infection. Few studies of extragenital T. vaginalis among women have been published. The efficacy, benefit, and cost-effectiveness of extragenital screening are unknown, and no tests are FDA cleared for extragenital testing; therefore, rectal and oral testing for T. vaginalis is not recommended.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Wet-mount microscopy traditionally has been used as the preferred diagnostic test for T. vaginalis among women because it is inexpensive and can be performed at the POC; however, it has low sensitivity ( $44 \%-68 \%$ ) compared with culture (1084-1086). To improve detection, clinicians using wet mounts should attempt to evaluate slides immediately after specimen collection because sensitivity decreases quickly to $20 \%$ within 1 hour after collection (1087). More highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic options are available, which should be used in conjunction with a negative wet mount when possible.

NAATs are highly sensitive, detecting more T. vaginalis infections than wet-mount microscopy among women (1060). The Aptima T. vaginalis assay (Beckton Dickinson) is FDA cleared for detection of T. vaginalis from symptomatic or asymptomatic women. Reliable samples include
clinician-collected endocervical swabs, clinician-collected vaginal swabs, female urine specimens, and liquid Pap smear specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution (Hologic) (698, 1088). This assay detects RNA by transcriptionmediated amplification with a sensitivity of $95.3 \%-100 \%$ and specificity of $95.2 \%-100 \%$, compared with wet mount and culture (1088,1089). Among women, vaginal swabs and urine specimens have $<100 \%$ concordance (1084). This assay has not been FDA cleared for use among men and should be internally validated in accordance with CLIA regulations before use with urine or urethral swabs from men. The Probe Tec TV $\mathrm{Q}^{\mathrm{x}}$ Amplified DNA Assay (Becton Dickinson) is FDA cleared for detection of T. vaginalis from vaginal (patient-collected or clinician-collected) swabs, endocervical swabs, or urine specimens from women and has sensitivity of $98.3 \%$ and specificity of $99.6 \%$, compared with wet mount and culture (1090). Similar to the Aptima T. vaginalis assay, this test is only FDA cleared for use among women and should be internally validated for use with men. The Max CTGCTV2 assay (Becton Dickinson) is also FDA cleared for detection of T. vaginalis in patient-collected or clinician-collected vaginal swab specimens and male and female urine specimens, with sensitivity and specificity of $96.2 \%-100 \%$ and $99.1 \%-100 \%$, respectively, depending on the specimen type, compared with wet mount and culture (1091). GeneXpert TV (Cepheid) is a moderately complex rapid test that can be performed in $\leq 1$ hour and can be used at the POC (1092). It has been FDA cleared for use with female urine specimens, endocervical swabs, patient-collected or clinician-collected vaginal specimens, and male urine specimens, with sensitivity and specificity of $99.5 \%-100 \%$ and $99.4 \%-99.9 \%$ (1007), respectively, compared with wet mount and culture.

Multiple FDA-cleared rapid tests are available for detecting T. vaginalis with improved sensitivities and specificities, compared with wet mount. The Osom trichomonas rapid test (Sekisui Diagnostics) is an antigen-detection test that uses immunochromatographic capillary flow dipstick technology that can be performed at the POC by using clinician-obtained vaginal specimens. Results are available in approximately 10-15 minutes, with sensitivities of $82 \%-95 \%$ and specificity of $97 \%-100 \%$, compared with wet mount, culture, and transcription-mediated amplification (1089,1093,1094). A study of 209 women aged 14-22 years reported that $>99 \%$ could correctly perform and interpret a vaginal self-test by using the Osom assay, with a high correlation with clinician interpretation ( $96 \%$ agreement; $\kappa=0.87$ ) (1094). The Osom test should not be used with men because of low sensitivity (38\% compared with Aptima) (1095). The Solana trichomonas assay (Quidel) is another rapid test for the qualitative detection of T. vaginalis DNA and can yield results <40 minutes after
specimen collection. This assay is FDA cleared for diagnosing T. vaginalis from female vaginal and urine specimens from asymptomatic and symptomatic women with sensitivity $>98 \%$, compared with NAAT for vaginal specimens, and $>92 \%$ for urine specimens (1096). The Amplivue trichomonas assay (Quidel) is another rapid test providing qualitative detection of T. vaginalis that has been FDA cleared for vaginal specimens from symptomatic and asymptomatic women, with sensitivity of $90.7 \%$ and specificity of $98.9 \%$, compared with NAAT (1097). Neither the Osom assay nor the Affirm VP III test is FDA cleared for use with specimens from men.
Culture, such as the InPouch system (BioMed Diagnostics), was considered the most sensitive method for diagnosing T. vaginalis infection before molecular detection methods became available. Culture has sensitivity of $44 \%-75 \%$ and specificity of $<100 \%$ (698,1086,1098). For women, vaginal secretions are the preferred specimen type for culture because urine culture is less sensitive (698,1099,1100). For men, culture specimens require a urethral swab, urine sediment, or semen. To improve diagnostic yield, multiple specimens from men can be used to inoculate a single culture. Cultures require an incubator and are necessary for T. vaginalis drug susceptibility testing. The InPouch specimen should be examined daily for 5 days over a 7 -day period to reduce the possibility of false negatives (1101).
Although T. vaginalis might be an incidental finding on a Pap test, neither conventional nor liquid-based Pap smears are considered diagnostic tests for trichomoniasis; however, women with T. vaginalis identified on a Pap smear should be retested with sensitive diagnostic tests and treated if infection is confirmed (1102,1103).

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection and might reduce transmission. Treatment recommendations for women are based on a meta-analysis (1104) and a multicenter, randomized trial of mostly symptomatic women without HIV infection (1105). The study demonstrated that multidose metronidazole ( 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days) reduced the proportion of women retesting positive at a 1 -month test of cure visit by half, compared with women who received the 2-g single dose. No published randomized trials are available that compare these doses among men.

The nitroimidazoles are the only class of medications with clinically demonstrated efficacy against T. vaginalis infections. Tinidazole is usually more expensive, reaches higher levels in serum and the genitourinary tract, has a longer half-life than metronidazole ( 12.5 hours versus 7.3 hours), and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects (1106,1107). In randomized clinical trials, recommended metronidazole regimens have resulted in cure rates of approximately $84 \%-98 \%$ (1108), and the recommended tinidazole regimen has resulted in cure rates of approximately $92 \%-100 \%$ (1108-1112). Randomized controlled trials comparing single 2-g doses of metronidazole and tinidazole indicated that tinidazole is equivalent or superior to metronidazole in achieving parasitologic cure and symptom resolution (1110,1113,1114).

Metronidazole gel does not reach therapeutic levels in the urethra and perivaginal glands. Because it is less efficacious than oral metronidazole, it is not recommended.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Providers should advise persons with T. vaginalis infections to abstain from sex until they and their sex partners are treated (i.e., when therapy has been completed and any symptoms have resolved). Testing for other STIs, including HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia, should be performed for persons with T. vaginalis.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Because of the high rate of reinfection among women treated for trichomoniasis, retesting for T. vaginalis is recommended for all sexually active women $<3$ months after initial treatment regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were treated $(137,1115)$. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical care <12 months after initial treatment. Data are insufficient to support retesting men after treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Concurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for preventing reinfections. Current partners should be referred for presumptive therapy. Partners also should be advised to abstain from intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated and any symptoms have resolved. EPT might have a role in partner management for trichomoniasis $(129,1116)$ and can be used in states where permissible by law (https://www.cdc.gov/std/ept/legal/default.htm); however, no partner management intervention has been demonstrated to be superior in reducing reinfection rates (129,130). Although
no definitive data exist to guide treatment for partners of persons with persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis among whom nonadherence and reinfection are unlikely, partners might benefit from being evaluated and receiving treatment (see Recurrent Trichomoniasis).

\section*{Recurrent Trichomoniasis}

A recurrent infection can result from treatment failure (antimicrobial-resistant T. vaginalis or host-related problems), lack of adherence, or reinfection from an untreated sex partner. In the case of a recurrent infection, the origin of the repeat infection should be assessed because most recurrent infections likely result from reinfection. Retesting can be considered in cases of persistent or recurrent trichomoniasis with culture, the preferred test. If NAAT is used, it should not be conducted before 3 weeks after treatment completion because of possible detection of residual nucleic acid that is not clinically relevant (1117).
The nitroimidazoles are the only class of antimicrobials known to be effective against trichomonas infection. Metronidazole resistance occurs in $4 \%-10 \%$ of cases of vaginal trichomoniasis (1116,1118). Tinidazole resistance is less well studied but was present in $1 \%$ of infections in one study (1116). Overall, more T. vaginalis isolates have reported susceptibility to tinidazole than metronidazole (1119). Multidose oral metronidazole is more effective than single-dose treatment, particularly for women who are symptomatic or have a history of T. vaginalis (1120).
Nitroimidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is concerning because few alternatives to standard therapy exist. If treatment failure occurs in a woman after completing a regimen of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days and she has been reexposed to an untreated partner, a repeat course of the same regimen is recommended. If no reexposure has occurred, she should be treated with metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g once daily for 7 days. If a man has persistent T. vaginalis after a single 2-g dose of metronidazole and has been reexposed to an untreated partner, he should be retreated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole. If he has not been reexposed, he should be administered a course of metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/ day for 7 days.
For persons who are experiencing persistent infection not attributable to reexposure, clinicians should request a kit from CDC to perform drug-resistance testing (https:// www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail. html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10239). CDC is experienced with susceptibility testing for nitroimidazole-resistant T. vaginalis and can provide guidance regarding treatment in cases of drug resistance. On the basis of drug resistance testing, an alternative treatment regimen might be recommended. Treatments for infections demonstrating in vitro resistance
can include metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g daily for 7 days. If a patient has treatment failure after the 7 -day regimen of high-dose oral metronidazole or tinidazole, two additional treatment options have been determined to have successful results for women. The first is high-dose oral tinidazole 2 g daily plus intravaginal tinidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 14 days (1121). If this regimen fails, high-dose oral tinidazole ( 1 g 3 times/day) plus intravaginal paromomycin ( 4 g of $6.25 \%$ intravaginal paromomycin cream nightly) for 14 days should be considered (1122).

Alternative regimens might be effective but have not been systemically evaluated; therefore, consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended. Clinical improvement has been reported with intravaginal boric acid $(1123,1124)$ but not with nitazoxanide (1123-1125). The following topically applied agents have minimal success (<50\%) and are not recommended: intravaginal betadine (povidone-iodine), clotrimazole, acetic acid, furazolidone, GV, nonoxynol-9, and potassium permanganate (1126). No other topical microbicide has been reported to be effective against trichomoniasis.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions}

Metronidazole and tinidazole are both nitroimidazoles. Patients with an IgE-mediated-type hypersensitivity reaction to 5-nitroimidazole antimicrobials should be managed by metronidazole desensitization according to published regimens $(1127,1128)$ and in consultation with an allergy specialist. The optimal treatment for patients with T. vaginalis who are unable to be desensitized has not been systematically investigated and is based on case reports, some of which report using paromomycin or boric acid for treating T. vaginalis (1123,1129).

\section*{Pregnancy}
T. vaginalis infection among pregnant women is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, and delivery of infants who are small for gestational age (1075). One randomized trial of pregnant women with asymptomatic trichomoniasis reported no substantial difference in preterm birth after treatment with 2 g of metronidazole 48 hours apart during 16-23 and 24-29 weeks' gestation, compared with placebo (1130). However, that trial had multiple limitations, including use of an atypical metronidazole regimen. Another multicenter observational study of asymptomatic pregnant women in subSahara African, the majority with HIV infection, reported neither trichomoniasis nor its treatment appeared to influence the risk for preterm birth or a low-birthweight infant (1131).

Although metronidazole crosses the placenta, data indicate that it poses a low risk to the developing fetus (1040,1042,1132). No evidence of teratogenicity or mutagenic effects among infants has been found in multiple cross-sectional and cohort studies among pregnant women examining single-dose ( 2 g ) and multidose metronidazole regimens (1040,1131-1135).

Symptomatic pregnant women, regardless of pregnancy stage, should be tested and treated. Treatment of T. vaginalis infection can relieve symptoms of vaginal discharge for pregnant women and reduce sexual transmission to partners. Although perinatal transmission of trichomoniasis is uncommon, treatment might also prevent respiratory or genital infection in the newborn (1136,1137). Clinicians should counsel symptomatic pregnant women with trichomoniasis about the potential risks and benefits of treatment and about the importance of partner treatment and condom use in the prevention of sexual transmission. The benefit of routine screening for T. vaginalis in asymptomatic pregnant women has not been established.

Metronidazole is secreted in breast milk. With maternal oral therapy, breastfed infants receive metronidazole in doses that are lower than those used to treat infections among infants, although the active metabolite adds to the total infant exposure. Plasma levels of the drug and metabolite are measurable but remain less than maternal plasma levels (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/books/NBK501922). Although multiple reported case series studies demonstrated no evidence of adverse effects among infants exposed to metronidazole in breast milk, clinicians sometimes advise deferring breastfeeding for 12-24 hours after maternal treatment with metronidazole (1051). In one study, maternal treatment with metronidazole ( 400 mg 3 times/day for 7 days) produced a lower concentration in breast milk and was considered compatible with breastfeeding over longer periods (1052).

Data from studies involving human subjects are limited regarding tinidazole use during pregnancy; however, animal data indicate this drug poses moderate risk. Thus, tinidazole should be avoided for pregnant women, and breastfeeding should be deferred for 72 hours after a single 2-g oral dose of tinidazole (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501922).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Up to $53 \%$ of women with HIV have T. vaginalis infection $(1115,1138)$. T. vaginalis infection among these women is substantially associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (1082). Among women who are not virally suppressed, treatment of trichomoniasis is associated with decreases in genital tract HIV viral load and viral shedding (1079,1139); however, no difference might occur among women who are virally suppressed (1140). Because of the high prevalence of T. vaginalis among women with HIV and the potential
for adverse reproductive health, poor birth outcomes, and possibly amplified HIV transmission, routine screening and prompt treatment are recommended for all women with HIV infection; screening should occur at entry to care and then at least annually thereafter.

A randomized clinical trial involving women with HIV and T. vaginalis infection demonstrated that a single dose of metronidazole 2 g orally was less effective than 500 mg 2 times/day for 7 days (1105). Factors that might interfere with standard single-dose treatment for trichomoniasis among women with HIV include high rates of asymptomatic BV infection, ART use, changes in vaginal ecology, and impaired immunity (1141). Thus, to improve cure rates, women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection should be treated with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days. For pregnant women with HIV, screening at the first prenatal visit and prompt treatment, as needed, are recommended because T. vaginalis infection is a risk factor for vertical transmission of HIV (1142).

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment reduces symptoms and signs of T. vaginalis infection, cures infection, and might reduce transmission. Likelihood of adverse outcomes among women with HIV infection is also reduced with T. vaginalis therapy.

Recommended Regimen for Trichomonas and HIV Infection Among Women

Metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days

If a woman with HIV infection experiences treatment failure, the protocol outlined is recommended (see Recurrent Trichomonas). Other management considerations, follow-up, and management of sex partners should be performed as for women without HIV infection. Treatment of men with HIV infection should follow the same guidelines as for men without HIV.

For women with HIV who receive a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection, retesting is recommended 3 months after treatment; NAAT is encouraged because of higher sensitivity of these tests. Data are insufficient to support retesting of men with trichomonas and HIV infection.

\section*{Vulvovaginal Candidiasis}

VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated $75 \%$ of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and $40 \%-45 \%$ will have two or more episodes. On the basis of
clinical presentation, microbiology, host factors, and response to therapy, VVC can be classified as either uncomplicated or complicated (Box 4). Approximately $10 \%-20 \%$ of women will have complicated VVC, requiring special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

\section*{Uncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis}

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, $10 \% \mathrm{KOH})$ of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (<4.5). Use of $10 \% \mathrm{KOH}$ in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with

}
symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately $10 \%-20 \%$ of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar with the performance characteristics of the specific test used. Yeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic yeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

\section*{Treatment}

Short-course topical formulations (i.e., single dose and regimens of 1-3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated VVC. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in $80 \%-90 \%$ of patients who complete therapy.

The creams and suppositories in these regimens are oil based and might weaken latex condoms and diaphragms. Patients should refer to condom product labeling for further information. Even women who have previously received a diagnosis of VVC by a clinician are not necessarily more likely to be able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an over-the-counter preparation or who has a recurrence of symptoms $<2$ months
after treatment for VVC should be evaluated clinically and tested. Unnecessary or unapproved use of over-the-counter preparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment of other vulvovaginitis etiologies, which can result in adverse outcomes. No substantial evidence exists to support using probiotics or homeopathic medications for treating VVC.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Follow-up typically is not required. However, women with persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be instructed to return for follow-up visits.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Uncomplicated VVC is not usually acquired through sexual intercourse, and data do not support treatment of sex partners. A minority of male sex partners have balanitis, characterized by erythematous areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction with pruritus or irritation. These men benefit from treatment with topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions}

Topical agents usually cause no systemic side effects, although local burning or irritation might occur. Oral azoles occasionally cause nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Therapy with the oral azoles has rarely been associated with abnormal elevations of liver enzymes. Clinically important interactions can occur when oral azoles are administered with other drugs (1141).

\section*{Complicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis}

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Vaginal culture or PCR should be obtained from women with complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and identify non-albicans Candida. Candida glabrata does not form pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized on microscopy. C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common in vaginal isolates (1144,1145), and non-albicans Candida is intrinsically resistant to azoles; therefore, culture and susceptibility testing should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic.

\section*{Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis}

Recurrent VVC, usually defined as three or more episodes of symptomatic VVC in $<1$ year, affects $<5 \%$ of women but carries a substantial economic burden (1146). Recurrent VVC can be either idiopathic or secondary (related to frequent antibiotic use, diabetes, or other underlying host factors). The pathogenesis of recurrent VVC is poorly understood, and the majority of women with recurrent VVC have no apparent
predisposing or underlying conditions. C. glabrata and other non-albicans Candida species are observed in 10\%-20\% of women with recurrent VVC. Conventional antimycotic therapies are not as effective against these non-albicans yeasts as against C. albicans.

\section*{Treatment}

Most episodes of recurrent VVC caused by C. albicans respond well to short-duration oral or topical azole therapy. However, to maintain clinical and mycologic control, a longer duration of initial therapy (e.g., 7-14 days of topical therapy or a $100-\mathrm{mg}, 150-\mathrm{mg}$, or $200-\mathrm{mg}$ oral dose of fluconazole every third day for a total of 3 doses [days 1, 4, and 7]) is recommended, to attempt mycologic remission, before initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen.
Oral fluconazole (i.e., a $100-\mathrm{mg}, 150-\mathrm{mg}$, or $200-\mathrm{mg}$ dose) weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen. If this regimen is not feasible, topical treatments used intermittently can also be considered. Suppressive maintenance therapies are effective at controlling recurrent VVC but are rarely curative long-term (1147). Because C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common, susceptibility tests, if available, should be obtained among symptomatic patients who remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy. These women should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

\section*{Severe Vulvovaginal Candidiasis}

Severe VVC (i.e., extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and fissure formation) is associated with lower clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses of topical or oral therapy. Either 7-14 days of topical azole or 150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses (second dose 72 hours after initial dose) is recommended.

\section*{Non-albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis}

Because approximately 50\% of women with a positive culture for non-albicans Candida might be minimally symptomatic or have no symptoms, and because successful treatment is often difficult, clinicians should make every effort to exclude other causes of vaginal symptoms for women with non-albicans yeast (1148). The optimal treatment of non-albicans VVC remains unknown; however, a longer duration of therapy (7-14 days) with a nonfluconazole azole regimen (oral or topical) is recommended. If recurrence occurs, 600 mg of boric acid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for 3 weeks is indicated. This regimen has clinical and mycologic eradication rates of approximately $70 \%$ (1149). If symptoms recur, referral to a specialist is advised.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

No data exist to support treating sex partners of patients with complicated VVC. Therefore, no recommendation can be made.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Compromised Host}

Women with underlying immunodeficiency, those with poorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising conditions (e.g., HIV), and those receiving immunosuppression therapy (e.g., corticosteroid treatment) might not respond as well to short-term therapies. Efforts to correct modifiable conditions should be made, and more prolonged (i.e., 7-14 days) conventional treatment is necessary.

\section*{Pregnancy}

VVC occurs frequently during pregnancy. Only topical azole therapies, applied for 7 days, are recommended for use among pregnant women. Epidemiologic studies indicate a single $150-\mathrm{mg}$ dose of fluconazole might be associated with spontaneous abortion (1150) and congenital anomalies; therefore, it should not be used (1151).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Vaginal Candida colonization rates among women with HIV infection are higher than among women without HIV with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics, and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of immunosuppression (1152). Symptomatic VVC is also more frequent among women with HIV infection and similarly correlates with severity of immunodeficiency (1153). In addition, among women with HIV, systemic azole exposure is associated with isolation of non-albicans Candida species from the vagina.

Treatment for uncomplicated and complicated VVC among women with HIV infection should not differ from that for women who do not have HIV. Although longterm prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly has been effective in reducing C. albicans colonization and symptomatic VVC (1154), this regimen is not recommended for women with HIV infection in the absence of complicated VVC (98). Although VVC is associated with increased HIV seroconversion among HIV-negative women and increased HIV cervicovaginal levels among women with HIV infection, the effect of treatment for VVC on HIV acquisition and transmission remains unknown.

\section*{Pelvic Inflammatory Disease}

PID comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis (1155-1157). Sexually transmitted organisms, especially N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis, often are implicated. Recent studies report that the proportion of PID cases attributable to N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis is decreasing; of women who received a diagnosis of acute PID, approximately $50 \%$ have a positive test for either of those organisms (1158-1160). Micro-organisms that comprise the vaginal flora, such as strict and facultative anaerobes (1160) and G. vaginalis, H. influenzae, enteric gram-negative rods, and Streptococcus agalactiae, have been associated with PID (1161). In addition, cytomegalovirus (CMV), T. vaginalis, M. hominis, and $U$. urealyticum might be associated with certain PID cases (1072). Data also indicate that M. genitalium might have a role in PID pathogenesis $(765,928)$ and might be associated with milder symptoms (919,923,928), although one study failed to demonstrate a substantial increase in PID after detection of M. genitalium in the lower genital tract (925).

Screening and treating sexually active women for chlamydia and gonorrhea reduces their risk for PID (1162,1163). Although BV is associated with PID, whether PID incidence can be reduced by identifying and treating women with BV is unclear (1161). Whether screening young women for M. genitalium is associated with a reduction in PID is unknown.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Acute PID is difficult to diagnose because of the considerable variation in symptoms and signs associated with this condition. Women with PID often have subtle or nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic. Delay in diagnosis and treatment probably contributes to inflammatory sequelae in the upper genital tract. Laparoscopy can be used to obtain a more accurate diagnosis of salpingitis and a more complete bacteriologic diagnosis. However, this diagnostic tool frequently is not readily available, and its use is not easily justifiable when symptoms are mild or vague. Moreover, laparoscopy will not detect endometritis and might not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes. Consequently, a PID diagnosis usually is based on imprecise clinical findings (1164-1166).

Data indicate that a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic PID has a positive predictive value for salpingitis of $65 \%-90 \%$, compared with laparoscopy (1167-1170). The positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis of acute PID depends on the epidemiologic characteristics of the population, with higher positive predictive values among sexually active young women (particularly adolescents), women attending STD clinics, and
those who live in communities with high rates of gonorrhea or chlamydia. Regardless of positive predictive value, no single historical, physical, or laboratory finding is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of acute PID. Combinations of diagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity (i.e., detect more women who have PID) or specificity (i.e., exclude more women who do not have PID) do so only at the expense of the other. For example, requiring two or more findings excludes more women who do not have PID and reduces the number of women with PID who are identified.

Episodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g., abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility (1157). Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID (1158). The recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g., ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for STIs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness.
More specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies indicating pelvic infection (e.g., tubal hyperemia); and laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis is the only sign of PID for certain women.
Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also
consider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis:
- Oral temperature $>38.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(>101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$
- Abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical friability
- Presence of abundant numbers of WBCs on saline microscopy of vaginal fluid
- Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
- Elevated C-reactive protein
- Laboratory documentation of cervical infection with N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis

The majority of women with PID have either mucopurulent cervical discharge or evidence of WBCs on a microscopic evaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal fluid (i.e., wet prep). If the cervical discharge appears normal and no WBCs are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid, a PID diagnosis is unlikely, and alternative causes of pain should be considered. A wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of concomitant infections (e.g., BV or trichomoniasis).

\section*{Treatment}

PID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broadspectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Multiple parenteral and oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up (1171-1173). However, only a limited number of studies have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to infection elimination in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications (e.g., tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens (1159,1164,1174). The optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper genital tract of women who have PID, and data from in vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides fragilis) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. BV is often present among women who have PID (22,1160,1161,1175).

Addition of metronidazole to IM or oral PID regimens more effectively eradicates anaerobic organisms from the upper genital tract (1160). Until treatment regimens that do not cover anaerobic microbes have been demonstrated to prevent long-term sequelae (e.g., infertility and ectopic pregnancy) as successfully as the regimens that are effective against these microbes, using regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of recommended antimicrobials. For women with PID of mild or moderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. The decision of whether hospitalization is necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether the woman meets any of the following criteria:
- Surgical emergencies (e.g., appendicitis) cannot be excluded
- Tubo-ovarian abscess
- Pregnancy
- Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature $>38.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$
- Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen
- No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy

No evidence is available to indicate that adolescents have improved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, and the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar among younger and older women. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria used for older women.

\section*{Parenteral Treatment}

Randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of parenteral regimens (1160,1171,1172,1176). Clinical experience should guide decisions regarding transition to oral therapy, which usually can be initiated within 24-48 hours of clinical improvement. For women with tubo-ovarian abscesses, >24 hours of inpatient observation is recommended.

\section*{Recommended Parenteral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease}

Ceftriaxone 1 g by every 24 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
plus
Metronidazole 500 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefotetan 2 g IV every 12 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours

Because of the pain associated with IV infusion, doxycycline should be administered orally when possible. Oral and IV administration of doxycycline and metronidazole provide similar bioavailability. Oral metronidazole is well absorbed and can be considered instead of IV for women without severe illness or tubo-ovarian abscess when possible. After clinical improvement with parenteral therapy, transition to oral therapy with doxycycline 100 mg 2 times/day and metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day is recommended to complete 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

\section*{Alternative Parenteral Regimens}

Only limited data are available to support using other parenteral second- or third- generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftizoxime or cefotaxime). Because these cephalosporins are less active than cefotetan or cefoxitin against anaerobic bacteria, the addition of metronidazole should be considered.

Ampicillin-sulbactam plus doxycycline has been investigated in at least one clinical trial and has broad-spectrum coverage (1177). Ampicillin-sulbactam plus doxycycline is effective against C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and anaerobes for women with tubo-ovarian abscess. Another trial demonstrated short-term clinical cure rates with azithromycin monotherapy or combined with metronidazole (1178).

When using the clindamycin and gentamicin alternative parenteral regimen, women with clinical improvement after 24-28 hours can be transitioned to clindamycin ( 450 mg orally 4 times/day) or doxycycline ( 100 mg orally 2 times/day) to complete the 14 -day therapy. However, when tubo-ovarian abscess is present, clindamycin ( 450 mg orally 4 times/day) or metronidazole ( 500 mg orally 2 times/day) should be used to complete 14 days of therapy with oral doxycycline to provide more effective anaerobic coverage.

Alternative Parenteral Regimens
Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally or IV every 12 hours
or
Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours
plus
Gentamicin loading dose IV or IM ( $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight), followed by a maintenance dose ( $1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) every 8 hours; single daily dosing ( $3-5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) can be substituted

\section*{Intramuscular or Oral Treatment}

IM or oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-to-moderate acute PID because the clinical outcomes among women treated with these regimens are similar to those treated with IV therapy (1158). Women who do not respond to IM or
oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and be administered therapy IV.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Recommended Intramuscular or Oral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease \\
\hline Ceftriaxone $500 \mathrm{mg}^{*}$ IM in a single dose plus \\
\hline \\
\hline \\
\hline \\
\hline Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftizoxime or cefotaxime) \\
\hline Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole \\
\hline * For persons weighing $\geq 150 \mathrm{~kg}, 1 \mathrm{~g}$ of ceftriaxone should be administered. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

These regimens provide coverage against frequent etiologic agents of PID; however, the optimal choice of a cephalosporin is unclear. Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, has better anaerobic coverage than ceftriaxone, and, in combination with probenecid and doxycycline, has been effective in shortterm clinical response among women with PID. Ceftriaxone has better coverage against N. gonorrhoeae. The addition of metronidazole to these regimens provides extended coverage against anaerobic organisms and will also effectively treat BV, which is frequently associated with PID.

\section*{Alternative Intramuscular or Oral Regimens}

No data have been published regarding use of oral cephalosporins for treating PID. As a result of the emergence of quinolone-resistant $N$. gonorrhoeae, regimens that include a quinolone agent are not recommended for PID treatment. However, if the patient has cephalosporin allergy, the community prevalence and individual risk for gonorrhea are low, and follow-up is likely, alternative therapy can be considered. Use of either levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days (1179-1181) or azithromycin 500 mg IV daily for 1-2 doses, followed by 250 mg orally daily in combination with metronidazole 500 mg 2 times/day for 12-14 days (1178), can be considered. Moxifloxacin is the preferred quinolone antimicrobial for M. genitalium infections; however, the importance of providing coverage for M. genitalium is unknown. Diagnostic tests for gonorrhea should be obtained before starting therapy, and persons should be managed as follows:
- If a culture for gonorrhea is positive, treatment should be based on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
- If the isolate is determined to be quinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae or if antimicrobial susceptibility cannot be assessed (e.g., if only NAAT testing is available), consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

To minimize disease transmission, women should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until therapy is complete, symptoms have resolved, and sex partners have been treated (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). All women who receive a diagnosis of PID should be tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and syphilis. The value of testing women with PID for M. genitalium is unknown (see Mycoplasma genitalium). All contraceptive methods can be continued during treatment.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Women should demonstrate clinical improvement (e.g., defervescence; reduction in direct or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness) $<3$ days after therapy initiation. If no clinical improvement has occurred $<72$ hours after outpatient IM or oral therapy, then hospitalization, assessment of the antimicrobial regimen, and additional diagnostics, including consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses, are recommended. All women who have received a diagnosis of chlamydial or gonococcal PID should be retested 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex partners have been treated (753). If retesting at 3 months is not possible, these women should be retested whenever they next seek medical care <12 months after treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Persons who have had sexual contact with a partner with PID during the 60 days preceding symptom onset should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia and gonorrhea, regardless of the PID etiology or pathogens isolated. If the last sexual intercourse was $>60$ days before symptom onset or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated. Sex partners of persons who have PID caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. If linkage is delayed or unlikely, EPT is an alternative approach to treating sex partners who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection $(125,126)$ (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they
and their sex partners have been treated (i.e., until therapy is completed and symptoms have resolved, if originally present).

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions}

The risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is highest with firstgeneration cephalosporins but is negligible between the majority of second-generation (e.g., cefoxitin) and all thirdgeneration (e.g., ceftriaxone) cephalosporins (619,631,653,656) (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy).

\section*{Pregnancy}

Pregnant women suspected of having PID are at high risk for maternal morbidity and preterm delivery. These women should be hospitalized and treated with IV antimicrobials in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.

\section*{HIV Infection}

Differences in PID clinical manifestations among women with HIV infection and those without have not been well delineated (1182). In early observational studies, women with HIV infection and PID were more likely to require surgical intervention. More comprehensive observational and controlled studies have demonstrated that women with HIV infection and PID coinfection have similar symptoms, compared with women without HIV (1183-1185), except they are more likely to have a tubo-ovarian abscess. Women with HIV responded equally well to recommended parenteral and IM or oral antibiotic regimens as women without HIV. The microbiologic findings for women with HIV and women without HIV were similar, except women with HIV had higher rates of concomitant M. hominis and streptococcal infections. These data are insufficient for determining whether women with HIV infection and PID coinfection require more aggressive management (e.g., hospitalization or IV antimicrobial regimens).

\section*{Intrauterine Devices}

IUDs are one of the most effective contraceptive methods. Copper-containing and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are available in the United States. The risk for PID associated with IUD use is primarily confined to the first 3 weeks after insertion (1186-1188). If an IUD user receives a diagnosis of PID, the IUD does not need to be removed $(59,1189)$. However, the woman should receive treatment according to these recommendations and should have close clinical follow-up. If no clinical improvement occurs within 48-72 hours of initiating treatment, providers should consider removing
the IUD. A systematic review of evidence demonstrated that treatment outcomes did not differ between women with PID who retained the IUD and those who had the IUD removed (1190). These studies primarily included women using coppercontaining or other nonhormonal IUDs. No studies are available regarding treatment outcomes among women using levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs.

\section*{Epididymitis}

Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting $<6$ weeks (1191). Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index of suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency.

Acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g., C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e., Escherichia coli) (1192). Acute epididymitis caused by an STI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men who are the insertive partner during anal sex. Nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia) (1193). Among older men, nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression. Uncommon infectious causes of nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis (e.g., Fournier's gangrene) should be managed in consultation with a urologist.

Chronic epididymitis is characterized by a $\geq 6$-week history of symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently observed with conditions associated with a granulomatous reaction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is the most common granulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be suspected, especially among men with a known history of or recent exposure to TB. The differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious epididymitis, sometimes termed orchialgia or epididymalgia, is broad (e.g., trauma, cancer, autoimmune conditions, or idiopathic conditions). Men with this diagnosis should be referred to a urologist for clinical management $(1191,1192)$.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following POC tests:
- Gram, MB, or GV stain of urethral secretions demonstrating $\geq 2$ WBCs per oil immersion field (737) (see Urethritis). These stains are preferred POC diagnostic tests for evaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and specific for documenting both urethral inflammation and presence or absence of gonococcal infection. Gonococcal infection is established by documenting the presence of WBC-containing intracellular gram-negative or purple diplococci on urethral Gram, MB, or GV stain, respectively.
- Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine.
- Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun firstvoid urine demonstrating $\geq 10$ WBCs/HPF.
All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae by NAAT. Urine is the preferred specimen for NAAT for men (553). Urine cultures for chlamydial and gonococcal epididymitis are insensitive and are not recommended. Urine bacterial cultures should also be performed for all men to evaluate for the presence of genitourinary organisms and to determine antibiotic susceptibility.

\section*{Treatment}

To prevent complications and transmission of STIs, presumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated at the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are available. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. Treatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic infection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal epididymitis complications (e.g., infertility or chronic pain). Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses (e.g., torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization (1193).

Recommended Regimens for Epididymitis
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea:
Ceftriaxone $500 \mathrm{mg}^{*}$ IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, or enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex):
Ceftriaxone $500 \mathrm{mg}^{*} \mathrm{IM}$ in a single dose
plus
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only: Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
* For persons weighing $\geq 150 \mathrm{~kg}, 1 \mathrm{~g}$ of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Levofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and gonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain. This includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures. Treatment
should be guided by bacterial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibilities. As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Complete resolution of discomfort might not occur for a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Men who have acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved. All men with acute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Men should be instructed to return to their health care providers if their symptoms do not improve $<72$ hours after treatment. Signs and symptoms of epididymitis that do not subside in $<3$ days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and therapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that persist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, infarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Men who have acute sexually transmitted epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be instructed to refer all sex partners during the previous 60 days before symptom onset for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). If the last sexual intercourse was $>60$ days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. EPT is an effective strategy for treating sex partners of men who have or are suspected of having chlamydia or gonorrhea for whom linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed $(125,126)$ (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are treated and symptoms have resolved.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions}

The risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is negligible between all third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) $(658,681)$ (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin

Allergy). Alternative regimens have not been studied; therefore, clinicians should consult an infectious disease specialist if such regimens are required.

\section*{HIV Infection}

Men with HIV infection who have uncomplicated acute epididymitis should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV. Other etiologic agents have been implicated in acute epididymitis among men with HIV, including CMV, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, U. urealyticum, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma species, and Mima polymorpha (1192).

\section*{Human Papillomavirus Infections}

Approximately 150 types of HPV have been identified, at least 40 of which infect the genital area (1194). The majority of HPV infections are self-limited and are asymptomatic or unrecognized. Sexually active persons are usually exposed to HPV during their lifetime (838,1195,1196). Oncogenic, high-risk HPV infection (e.g., HPV types 16 and 18) causes the majority of cervical, penile, vulvar, vaginal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers and precancers (1197), whereas other HPV infection (e.g., HPV types 6 and 11) causes genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection is the strongest risk factor for development of HPV-attributable precancers and cancers. A substantial proportion of cancers and anogenital warts are attributable to HPV in the United States. An estimated 34,800 new HPV-attributable cancers occurred every year during 2012-2016 (1198). Before HPV vaccines were introduced, approximately 355,000 new cases of anogenital warts occurred every year (1199).

\section*{Prevention}

\section*{HPV Vaccines}

Three HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States: Ceravrix, a 2 -valent vaccine ( 2 vHPV ) that targets HPV types 16 and 18; Gardasil, a 4 -valent vaccine ( 4 vHPV ) that targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18; and Gardasil 9, a 9-valent vaccine ( 9 vHPV ) that targets HPV types $6,11,16,18,31$, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Types 16 and 18 account for $66 \%$ of all cervical cancers, whereas the five additional types targeted by the 9 -valent vaccine account for $15 \%$. Types 6 and 11 cause $>90 \%$ of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine is available in the United States.

ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination (https://www. cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html) include the following:
- Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years.
- Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.
- Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously.
- Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged $>26$ years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged 27-45 years not vaccinated previously.
- A 2 -dose vaccine schedule (at 0 - and $6-12$-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday.
- A 3 -dose vaccine schedule (at $0-$, $1-2$-, and 6 -month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation.
HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of history of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or anogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged <19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (additional information is available at https:// www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html or by calling CDC INFO 800-232-4636). For uninsured persons aged <19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the vaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety evaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. With >120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are safe (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety). Impact-monitoring studies in the United States have demonstrated reductions of genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within the quadrivalent vaccine (1200-1203). Settings that provide STI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible clients within the routine and catch-up age groups through age 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series, or link these persons to another facility equipped to provide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, adolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/who/ teens/for-hcp/hpv-resources.html). HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors (1204, 1205).
Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct condom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although these interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they can decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

HPV tests are available for detecting oncogenic types of HPV infection and are used in the context of cervical cancer screening and management or follow-up of abnormal cervical cytology or histology (see Cervical Cancer). These tests should not be used for male partners of women with HPV or women aged <25 years, for diagnosis of genital warts, or as a general STI test.

Application of $3 \%-5 \%$ acetic acid, which might cause affected areas to turn white, has been used by certain providers to detect genital mucosa infected with HPV. The routine use of this procedure to detect mucosal changes attributed to HPV infection is not recommended because the results do not influence clinical management.

\section*{Treatment}

Treatment is directed to the macroscopic (e.g., genital warts) or pathologic precancerous lesions caused by HPV. Subclinical genital HPV infection typically clears spontaneously; therefore, specific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate HPV infection. Precancerous lesions are detected through cervical cancer screening; HPV-related precancer should be managed on the basis of existing guidance (see Cervical Cancer).

\section*{Counseling}

\section*{Key Messages for Persons with Human Papillomavirus Infection}

When counseling persons with anogenital HPV infection, the provider should discuss the following:
- Anogenital HPV infection is common. It usually infects the anogenital area but can infect other areas, including the mouth and throat. The majority of sexually active persons get HPV at some time during their lifetime, although most never know it.
- Partners tend to share HPV, and it is not possible to determine which partner transmitted the original infection. Having HPV does not mean that a person or his or her partner is having sex outside the relationship.
- Persons who acquire HPV usually clear the infection spontaneously, meaning that HPV becomes undetectable with no associated health problems.
- If HPV infection persists, genital warts, precancers, and cancers of the cervix, anus, penis, vulva, vagina, head, or neck might develop.
- Discussion of tobacco use, and provision of cessation counseling, is important because of its contribution to the progression of precancer and cancer.
- The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
- Many types of HPV are sexually transmitted through anogenital contact, mainly during vaginal and anal sex. HPV also might be transmitted during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact without penetration. In rare cases, a pregnant woman can transmit HPV to an infant during delivery.
- Treatments are available for the conditions caused by HPV but not for the virus itself.
- Having HPV does not make it harder for a woman to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. However, certain precancers or cancers that HPV can cause, and the surgical procedures needed to treat them, can affect a woman's ability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term.
- No HPV test can determine which HPV infection will become undetectable and which will persist or progress to disease. However, in certain circumstances, HPV tests can determine whether a woman is at increased risk for cervical cancer. These tests are not for detecting other HPV-related problems, nor are they useful for women aged<25 years or men of any age.

\section*{Prevention}
- Three HPV vaccines can prevent diseases and cancers caused by HPV. The 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV vaccines protect against the majority of cervical cancer cases, although the 4 vHPV and 9 vHPV vaccines also protect against the majority of genital warts. Only 9vHPV vaccine is available in the United States. HPV vaccines are safe and effective and are recommended routinely for adolescents aged 11-12 years. Catch-up vaccination is also recommended for older adolescents and young adults through age 26 years (https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/hcp/ index.html). Shared clinical decision-making is recommended regarding HPV vaccination for certain adults aged 27-45 years who are not adequately vaccinated per guidance (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/ wr/pdfs/mm6832a3-H.pdf).
- Condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the chances of acquiring and transmitting HPV and developing HPV-related diseases (e.g., genital warts or cervical cancer). However, because HPV can infect areas not covered by a condom, condoms might not fully protect against HPV.
- Limiting the number of sex partners can reduce the risk for HPV. However, even persons with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV.
- Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection.

\section*{Anogenital Warts}

Anogenital warts are a common disease, and $90 \%$ are caused by nononcogenic HPV types 6 or 11. These types can be commonly identified before or at the same time anogenital warts are detected (1206). HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and 35 also are occasionally identified in anogenital warts (usually as infections with HPV 6 or 11) and can be associated with foci of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), particularly among persons who have HIV infection. In addition to anogenital warts, HPV types 6 and 11 have been associated with conjunctival, nasal, oral, and laryngeal warts.

Anogenital warts are usually asymptomatic; however, depending on the size and anatomic location, they can be painful or pruritic. They are usually flat, papular, or pedunculated growths on the genital mucosa. Anogenital warts occur commonly at certain anatomic sites, including around the vaginal introitus, under the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and on the shaft of the circumcised penis. Warts can also occur at multiple sites in the anogenital epithelium or within the anogenital tract (e.g., cervix, vagina, urethra, perineum, perianal skin, anus, or scrotum). Intra-anal warts are observed predominantly in persons who have had receptive anal intercourse; however, they also can occur among men and women who have not had a history of anal sexual contact.

\section*{Prevention}

Anogenital warts have decreased among adolescents, young women, and heterosexual men with use of HPV vaccination in multiple countries, including the United States (1203,1207-1216).

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual inspection but can be confirmed by biopsy, which is indicated if lesions are atypical (e.g., pigmented, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated lesions). Biopsy might also be indicated in the following circumstances, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised (including those with HIV infection): the diagnosis is uncertain, the lesions do not respond to standard therapy, or the disease worsens during therapy. HPV testing is not recommended for anogenital wart diagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not guide genital wart management. Some anogenital lesions can resemble anogenital warts (condyloma accuminata), but do not respond to anogenital wart treatment. Condyloma lata, a manifestation of secondary syphilis, can be diagnosed by serologic tests or through direct detection from serous fluid from the lesions (see Syphilis, Diagnostic Considerations).

\section*{Treatment}

The aim of treatment is removal of the warts and amelioration of symptoms, if present. The appearance of warts also can result in considerable psychosocial distress, and removal can relieve cosmetic concerns. For most patients, treatment results in resolution of the warts. If left untreated, anogenital warts can resolve spontaneously, remain unchanged, or increase in size or number. Because warts might spontaneously resolve in $<1$ year, an acceptable alternative for certain persons is to forego treatment and wait for spontaneous resolution. Available therapies for anogenital warts might reduce, but probably do not eradicate, HPV infectivity. Whether reduction in HPV viral DNA resulting from treatment reduces future transmission remains unknown.

Treatment of anogenital warts should be guided by wart size, number, and anatomic site; patient preference; cost of treatment; convenience; adverse effects; and provider experience. No definitive evidence indicates that any one recommended treatment is superior to another, and no single treatment is ideal for all patients or all warts. Shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding treatment algorithms has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and should be encouraged. Because all available treatments have shortcomings, clinicians sometimes use combination therapy (e.g., provideradministered cryotherapy with patient-applied topical therapy between visits to the provider). However, limited data exist regarding the efficacy or risk for complications associated with combination therapy. Treatment regimens are classified as either patient-applied or provider-administered modalities. Patientapplied modalities are preferred by certain persons because they can be administered in the privacy of their home. To ensure that patient-applied modalities are effective, instructions should be provided to patients while in the clinic, and all anogenital warts should be accessible and identified during the clinic visit. Follow-up visits after weeks of therapy enable providers to answer any questions about use of the medication, address any side effects experienced, and facilitate assessment of the response to treatment.

Imiquimod is a patient-applied, topically active immune enhancer that stimulates production of interferon and other cytokines. Imiquimod 5\% cream should be applied once at bedtime, 3 times/week for <16 weeks (1217). Similarly, imiquimod $3.75 \%$ cream should be applied once at bedtime every night for $<8$ weeks (1218). With either formulation, the treatment area should be washed with soap and water 6-10 hours after the application. Local inflammatory reactions, including redness, irritation, induration, ulceration or erosion, and vesicles might occur with using imiquimod, and hypopigmentation has also been described (1219). Limited case reports demonstrate an association between treatment with imiquimod cream and worsened inflammatory or autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., psoriasis, vitiligo, or lichenoid dermatoses) (1220-1222). Data from studies of human participants are limited regarding use of imiquimod during pregnancy; however, animal data indicate that this therapy poses low risk (431).

Podofilox (podophyllotoxin) is a patient-applied antimitotic drug that causes wart necrosis. Podofilox solution (using a cotton swab) or podofilox gel (using a finger) should be applied to anogenital warts 2 times/day for 3 days, followed by 4 days of no therapy. This cycle can be repeated, as necessary, for up to four cycles. The total wart area treated should not exceed $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the total volume of podofilox should be limited to $0.5 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day. If possible, the health care provider should apply the initial treatment to demonstrate proper application technique and identify which warts should be treated. Mild to moderate pain or local irritation might develop after treatment. After each treatment, the gel or solution should be allowed to dry. Patients should wash their hands before and after each application. Podofilox is contraindicated during pregnancy (431).

Sinecatechins is a patient-applied, green-tea extract with an active product (catechins). Sinecatechins $15 \%$ ointment should be applied 3 times/day ( $0.5-\mathrm{cm}$ strand of ointment to each wart) by using a finger to ensure coverage with a thin layer of ointment until complete clearance of warts is achieved. This product should not be continued for $>16$ weeks (1223-1225). The medication should not be washed off after use. Genital, anal, and oral sexual contact should be avoided while the ointment is on the skin. The most common side effects of sinecatechins are erythema, pruritus or burning, pain, ulceration, edema, induration, and vesicular
rash. This medication is not recommended for persons with HIV infection, other immunocompromised conditions, or genital herpes because the safety and efficacy of therapy has not been evaluated. The safety of sinecatechins during pregnancy is unknown.

Cryotherapy is a provider-administered therapy that destroys warts by thermal-induced cytolysis. Health care providers should be trained on the correct use of this therapy because overtreatment or undertreatment can result in complications or low efficacy. Pain during and after application of the liquid nitrogen, followed by necrosis and sometimes blistering, is common. Local anesthesia (topical or injected) might facilitate therapy if warts are present in many areas or if the area of warts is large. Surgical therapy has the advantage of eliminating the majority of warts at a single visit, although recurrence can occur. Surgical removal requires substantial clinical training, additional equipment, and sometimes a longer office visit. After local anesthesia is applied, anogenital warts can be physically destroyed by electrocautery, in which case no additional hemostasis is required. Care should be taken to control the depth of electrocautery to prevent scarring. Alternatively, the warts can be removed either by tangential excision with a pair of fine scissors or a scalpel, by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ laser, or by curettage. Because most warts are exophytic, this procedure can be accomplished with a resulting wound that only extends into the upper dermis. Hemostasis can be achieved with an electrocautery unit or, in cases of minor bleeding, a chemical styptic (e.g., an aluminum chloride solution). Suturing is neither required nor indicated in the majority of cases. For patients with large or extensive warts, surgical therapy, including $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ laser, might be most beneficial; such therapy might also be useful for intraurethral warts, particularly for those persons whose warts have not responded to other treatments. Treatment of anogenital and oral warts should be performed in a ventilated room by using standard precautions (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/ guidelines/isolation/index.html/Isolation2007.pdf\#page) and local exhaust ventilation (e.g., a smoke evacuator) (1226).
Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and bichloroacetic acid (BCA) are provider-administered caustic agents that destroy warts by chemical coagulation of proteins. Although these preparations are widely used, they have not been investigated thoroughly. TCA solution has a low viscosity, comparable with that of water, and can spread rapidly and damage adjacent tissues if applied excessively. A small amount should be applied only to the warts and allowed to dry (i.e., develop white frost on tissue) before the patient sits or stands. If pain is intense or an excess amount of acid is applied, the area can be covered with sodium bicarbonate (i.e., baking soda), washed with liquid soap preparations, or be powdered with talc to neutralize the
acid or remove unreacted acid. TCA or BCA treatment can be repeated weekly if necessary.

\section*{Alternative Regimens for External Genital Warts}

Fewer data are available regarding the efficacy of alternative regimens for treating anogenital warts, which include podophyllin resin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic therapy, and topical cidofovir. Shared clinical decisionmaking between the patient and provider regarding benefits and risks of these regimens should be provided. In addition, alternative regimens might be associated with more side effects. Podophyllin resin is no longer a recommended regimen because of the number of safer regimens available, and severe systemic toxicity has been reported when podophyllin resin was applied to large areas of friable tissue and was not washed off within 4 hours (1227-1229). Podophyllin resin 10\%-25\% in a compound tincture of benzoin might be considered for provider-administered treatment under conditions of strict adherence to recommendations. Podophyllin should be applied to each wart and then allowed to air dry before the treated area comes into contact with clothing. Overapplication or failure to air dry can result in local irritation caused by spread of the compound to adjacent areas and possible systemic toxicity. The treatment can be repeated weekly, if necessary. To avoid the possibility of complications associated with systemic absorption and toxicity, application should be limited to $<0.5 \mathrm{~mL}$ of podophyllin or an area of $<10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of warts per session; the area to which treatment is administered should not contain any open lesions, wounds, or friable tissue; and the preparation should be thoroughly washed off $1-4$ hours after application. Podophyllin resin preparations differ in the concentration of active components and contaminants. Shelf life and stability of podophyllin preparations are unknown. The safety of podophyllin during pregnancy has not been established.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Anogenital warts typically respond within 3 months of therapy. Factors that might affect response to therapy include immunosuppression and treatment compliance. Warts located on moist surfaces or in intertriginous areas respond best to topical treatment. A new treatment modality should be selected when no substantial improvement is observed after a complete course of treatment or in the event of severe side effects; treatment response and therapy-associated side effects should be evaluated throughout the therapy course. Complications occur rarely when treatment is administered correctly. Persistent hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation can occur with ablative modalities (e.g., cryotherapy and electrocautery) and have been described with immune modulating therapies (e.g., imiquimod cream). Depressed or hypertrophic scars are uncommon but can occur, especially if patients have insufficient time to heal between treatments. Rarely, treatment can result in chronic pain syndromes (e.g., vulvodynia and hyperesthesia of the treatment site) or, in the case of anal warts, painful defecation or fistulas.

\section*{Counseling}

When counseling persons with anogenital warts, the provider should discuss the following:
- If left untreated, genital warts might resolve, stay the same, or increase in size or number. The types of HPV that cause genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer.
- Women with genital warts do not need Pap tests more often than other women.
- Time of HPV acquisition cannot be definitively determined. Genital warts can develop months or years after acquiring HPV.
- HPV types that cause genital warts can be passed on to another person, even without visible signs of warts. Sex partners tend to share HPV, even though signs of HPV (e.g., warts) might occur in only one or neither partner.
- Although genital warts are common and benign, certain persons might experience considerable psychosocial impact after receiving this diagnosis.
- Although genital warts can be treated, such treatment does not cure the virus itself. For this reason, genital warts often recur after treatment, especially during the first 3 months.
- Because genital warts can be sexually transmitted, persons with genital warts benefit from testing for other STIs. HPV might remain present and can still be transmitted to partners even after the warts are gone.
- Condoms might lower the chances of transmitting genital warts if used consistently and correctly; however, HPV can infect areas that are not covered by a condom and might not fully protect against HPV.
- A vaccine is available for males and females to prevent genital warts (Gardasil 9) but it will not treat existing HPV or genital warts. This vaccine can prevent the majority of cases of genital warts among persons who have not yet been exposed to wart-causing types of HPV.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Persons should inform current partners about having genital warts because the types of HPV that cause warts can be passed on to partners. Partners should be counseled that they might already have HPV despite no visible signs of warts; therefore, HPV testing of sex partners of persons with genital warts is not recommended. Partners might benefit from a physical examination to detect genital warts and tests for other STIs. No recommendations can be made regarding informing future sex partners about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration of viral persistence after warts have resolved is unknown.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Podofilox, podophyllin, and sinecatechins should not be used during pregnancy. Imiquimod appears to pose low risk but should be avoided until more data are available. Anogenital warts can proliferate and become friable during pregnancy. Although removal of warts during pregnancy can be considered, resolution might be incomplete or poor until pregnancy is complete. Rarely, HPV types 6 and 11 can cause respiratory papillomatosis among infants and children, although the route of transmission (i.e., transplacental, perinatal, or postnatal) is not completely understood. Whether cesarean delivery prevents respiratory papillomatosis among infants and children also
is unclear (1230); therefore, cesarean delivery should not be performed solely to prevent transmission of HPV infection to the newborn. Cesarean delivery is indicated for women with anogenital warts if the pelvic outlet is obstructed or if vaginal delivery would result in excessive bleeding. Pregnant women with anogenital warts should be counseled about the low risk for warts on the larynx of their infants or children (recurrent respiratory papillomatosis).

\section*{HIV and Other Causes of Immunosuppression}

Persons with HIV infection or who are otherwise immunosuppressed are more likely to develop anogenital warts than those who do not have HIV (1231). Moreover, such persons can have larger or more numerous lesions, might not respond to therapy as well as those who are immunocompetent, and might have more frequent recurrences after treatment (1231,1232-1234). Despite these factors, data do not support altered approaches to treatment for persons with HIV infection. Squamous cell carcinomas arising in or resembling anogenital warts might occur more frequently among immunosuppressed persons, therefore requiring biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis for suspicious cases (1235-1237).

\section*{High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions}

Biopsy of an atypical wart might reveal HSIL or cancer of the anogenital tract. In this instance, referral to a specialist for treatment is recommended.

\section*{Cancers and Precancers Associated with Human Papillomavirus}

Persistent infection with high-risk (oncogenic) types of HPV has a causal role in approximately all cervical cancers and in certain vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers (1238). However, cervical cancer is the only HPV-associated cancer for which routine screening is recommended.

\section*{Cervical Cancer}

\section*{Screening Recommendations}

Recommendations for cervical cancer screening in the United States are based on systematic evidence reviews by major medical and advocacy organizations, including USPSTF (174), ACS (177), and ACOG (175). Over time, general alignment across these organizations has emerged as to when to start and end cervical cancer screening as well as the periodicity of screening. Although no single guideline universally guides screening practices in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act required Medicaid and new private health insurance plans to provide coverage for preventive services graded A or B by USPSTF, which includes
cervical cancer screening. In addition, the National Center for Quality Assurance provides a set of measures (the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS]) for up-todate cervical cancer screening that aligns with USPSTF recommendations (https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/ cervical-cancer-screening). The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services uses the same measure as HEDIS to measure cervical cancer screening performance.

USPSTF screening recommendations apply to persons with a cervix at average risk, defined as those with no previous cervical cancer or high-grade precancer, not currently under close follow-up for a recent abnormal result, not immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV), and who had no exposure to diethylstilbestrol in utero. Among these persons, screening should be performed starting at age 21 years and continue through age 65 years. Testing can be performed using either conventional or liquid-based cytologic tests (i.e., Pap tests). For persons aged $\geq 30$ years, screening can include FDA-cleared tests for high-risk, oncogenic types of HPV. For cytopathologic testing, clinics should use CLIA-certified laboratories using acceptable terminology (Bethesda 2001 or LAST terminology) (1239).

Annual cervical cancer screening is not recommended for persons at average risk. Instead, cytology testing is recommended every 3 years for persons aged 21-29 years. For persons aged 30-65 years, a cytology test every 3 years, an HPV test alone every 5 years, or a cytology test plus an HPV test (cotest) every 5 years is recommended. Cotesting can be done by either collecting one sample for the cytology test and another for the HPV test or by using the remaining liquid cytology material for the HPV test. Cervical screening programs should screen those who have received HPV vaccination in the same manner as those that are unvaccinated. Screening is not recommended before age 21 years among those at average risk. For those aged 30-65 years, cytology alone or primary HPV testing is preferred by USPSTF; however, cotesting can be used as an alternative approach. ACOG (1240), ACS (177), and USPSTF (174) each have screening recommendations (1241) (Table 1).

Clinics should weigh the benefits of each screening strategy as well as their resources, such as time and cost, in deciding on which of the three possible screening strategies to implement. Decision analytic models (1242) estimating the benefits, harms, and costs (1243) of several different strategies might be useful in making this determination (174,1244,1245). Adopting recommended screening and follow-up procedures, including screening methods, results provision, and follow-up, can lead to success in implementing cervical cancer screening in clinics (1246).

Patients should be provided a copy of their test results; those with normal results should be provided information on follow-up visits and the importance of continued cervical

cancer screening, if applicable. Those with abnormal screening tests should be managed per published guidelines. National consensus guidelines are available for the management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests (1247). HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology alone for surveillance after an abnormal screening test result. These guidelines base management recommendations on case-by-case assessment of risk considering past screening history and current results (see Follow-Up). Patients with abnormal cervical cancer screening test results should be counseled about those results (see Counseling Messages).
The following additional management considerations are associated with performing Pap tests and HPV tests:
- Cytology (Pap tests) and HPV tests should not be considered screening tests for STIs.
- All persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer screening, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity (i.e., those who identify as lesbian, bisexual, heterosexual, or transgender).
- A conventional cytology test (in which the sample is smeared onto a dry slide) should ideally be scheduled for 10-20 days after the first day of menses. Liquid-based cytology can be performed at any time during the menstrual cycle.
- If specific infections other than HPV (e.g., chlamydia or gonorrhea) are identified at the visit, a repeat cytology test after appropriate treatment for those infections might be indicated. However, in most instances (even in the presence of certain severe cervical infections), cytology tests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation, and reliable final reports can be produced without the need to repeat the cytology test after treatment.
- The presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not postpone cytology testing. The test can be performed after removal of the discharge with a saline-soaked cotton swab.
- HPV testing can be performed either as a separate test or by using material from the liquid-based cytology specimen.
- In the absence of other indications, the presence of external genital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical cancer screening.
- The sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection of other endocervical specimens does not influence Pap test results or their interpretation (600). Typically, vaginal specimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea screening; however, during a pelvic examination, endocervical specimens for STI testing can be collected first.
- Persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal of the cervix do not require screening unless cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2, CIN 3, or adenocarcinoma in situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years
( 175,1247 ). If the cervix remains intact after a supracervical hysterectomy, regularly scheduled Pap tests should be performed as indicated (1248-1250).
- Health care facilities that train providers on cytology test collection and use simple quality assurance measures are more likely to obtain satisfactory test results (as determined by the laboratory).
- The use of instruments designed to sample the cervical transformation zone (e.g., cytobrushes) improves the accuracy of cytology tests (1251).
- Both liquid-based and conventional cytology are acceptable because they have similar test-performance characteristics.
- At an initial visit, providers should ask patients about their recent cytology test and HPV results and any history of evaluation and treatment (e.g., loop electrosurgical excision procedure and colposcopy) to assist with management; effort should be made to obtain copies of recent results. The importance and frequency of screening should be reinforced.

\section*{Counseling}

Persons might believe the cytology (Pap test) or HPV test screens for conditions other than cervical cancer, or they might be confused by abnormal results (1252-1254). Health care providers, as trusted sources of information about HPV infections and abnormal cytology test results, have an important role in educating persons about HPV and can moderate the psychosocial impact of abnormal results (1255,1256). Persons should be counseled on the risks, uncertainties, and benefits of screening (174,1257).

An abnormal cytology test or a positive HPV test can cause short-term anxiety, stress, fear, and confusion, possibly decreasing the patient's ability to absorb and retain information and acting as a barrier to follow-up care (1258-1261). A positive HPV test might elicit concerns about partners, worries about disclosure, and feelings of guilt, anger, and stigmatization (1260). Providers should frame HPV positivity in a neutral, nonstigmatizing context and emphasize its common, asymptomatic, and transient nature. Providers also should emphasize that HPV infections often are shared between partners but it is often not possible to know the origin of an HPV infection; HPV tests might become positive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections in both male and female partners. Having an HPV infection should not raise concerns about a male partner's health (1262). Providers should communicate the meaning of both the cytology and HPV test results to patients at screening.

Providers also should screen for tobacco use and perform cessation counseling (www.acog.org/clinical/ clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2011/09/
tobacco-use-and-womens-health). Smoking contributes to the progression of CIN, with both active and passive smoking associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix in women with HPV 16 or 18 infection (1263-1266).

\section*{Promoting Cervical Cancer Screening}

Clinics can use the evidence-based interventions in the Community Preventive Services Task Force guidelines to promote cervical cancer screening in their communities (https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/cancer-screening-multicomponent-interventions-cervical-cancer). Implementing interventions that increase community demand for screening (1266) (e.g., client reminders, client incentives, media, group education, or one-on-one education) together with those that increase community access to screening (e.g., reducing structural barriers and reducing client out-of-pocket costs) is effective in increasing cervical cancer screening coverage. These interventions are more effective if they are implemented with interventions to increase provider delivery of screening services (e.g., provider assessment and feedback, provider incentives, and provider reminders). Print materials and online resources are available at https://www.cdc.gov/ cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm and https://www. cdc.gov/std/hpv/facts-brochures.htm. Patient navigators can be effective in improving both screening and follow-up after abnormal results (1267).

\section*{Key Messages About Cervical Cancer Screening}

When counseling persons about cervical cancer screening, the provider should discuss the following:
- Cervical cancer can be prevented with regular screening tests, like the Pap test (cytology) and HPV tests. Those at average risk should start getting cytology tests at age 21 years.
- The cytology test can find abnormal cervical cells, which could lead to cervical cancer over time, and an HPV test detects HPV infection of the cervix. The HPV test can be used alone for cervical cancer screening or at the same time as the cytology test (known as cotesting) for those aged $\geq 30$ years to 65 years. The HPV test is also used after a cytology test result of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) among persons aged $>25$ years (known as reflex HPV testing).
- Positive cytology and HPV tests are markers of cervical precancerous lesions, which often do not cause symptoms until they become invasive. Appropriate follow-up is essential to ensure that cervical cancer does not develop.
- HPV is a common infection and is often controlled by the body without any medical interventions. A positive HPV test does not mean that a person has cancer.
- Providers should emphasize that HPV infections often are shared between partners, and it is often not possible to know the origin of an HPV infection; HPV tests might become positive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections in both male and female partners.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

The benefit of disclosing a positive HPV test to current and future sex partners is unclear. The following counseling messages can be communicated to sex partners:
- Sex partners do not need to be tested for HPV.
- Sex partners tend to share HPV. Sex partners of persons with HPV infection also are likely have an HPV infection.
- Female sex partners of men who disclose they had a previous female partner with HPV should be screened at the same intervals as women with average risk. No data are available to suggest that more frequent screening is of benefit.
- When used correctly and consistently, condoms might lower the risk for HPV infection and might decrease the time to clear in those with HPV infection. However, HPV can infect areas not covered by the condom, and condoms might not fully protect against HPV $(24,25)$.
Additional messages for partners include the messages for persons with HPV (see Cervical Cancer Screening; Counseling Messages).

\section*{Screening Recommendations in Special Populations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Persons who are pregnant should be screened at the same intervals as those who are not. A swab, Ayre's spatula, or cytobrush can be used for obtaining cytology test samples during pregnancy (1268-1270).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Several studies have documented an increased risk for cervical precancers and cancers in individuals with HIV infection (1271-1273). Adolescents with HIV should be screened 1 year after onset of sexual activity but no later than age 21 years. Sexually active persons should be screened at the time of the initial HIV diagnosis. Conventional or liquid-based cytology (Pap test) should be used as primary HPV testing and is not recommended in individuals with HIV. Cotesting (cytology and HPV test) can be done in individuals aged $\geq 30$ years with HIV. Annual screening is recommended for persons with HIV infection; after 3 years of consecutive normal cytology results or normal cotest (normal cytology and negative HPV test), the screening interval can be increased to every 3 years. Lifelong screening is recommended among persons with HIV infection.

Providers should defer to existing Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults and Adolescents with HIV for guidance on cervical cancer screening and management of results in persons with HIV (98).

\section*{Adolescents}

Prevalence of HPV infection is high among those aged <21 years (174); however, HPV infections and squamous intraepithelial lesions caused by HPV in adolescents are more likely to regress than those in older persons. For these reasons, cervical cancer screening and HPV testing are not recommended in immunocompetent adolescents. However, for adolescents with HIV infection, providers should screen 1 year after onset of sexual activity, regardless of age or mode of HIV acquisition (e.g., perinatally acquired or sexually acquired) (98); such screening is warranted because of the reported high rate of progression of abnormal cytology in adolescents with HIV.

\section*{Human Papillomavirus Tests for Cervical Cancer Screening}

Clinical tests for HPV are used for the following: cervical cancer screening as a primary test, cervical cancer screening with a cytology test, triage of some abnormal cervical cytology results, follow-up after abnormal screening test results, follow-up after a colposcopy in which no CIN 2 or CIN 3 is found, and follow-up after treatment of cervical precancers. These tests are only FDA cleared for use with cervical specimens, not oral or anal specimens. Testing for nononcogenic HPV types (e.g., types 6 and 11) is not recommended (https://www.asccp.org/guidelines).
FDA-cleared HPV tests detect viral DNA or messenger RNA. Several FDA-cleared tests for HPV are available for use in the United States. The Cobas 4800 HPV test (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and the Onclarity HPV test (Becton Dickinson) can detect the presence of 14 oncogenic HPV types (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68), as well as individual types 16 and 18, and are cleared for primary cervical cancer screening.
Other HPV tests are cleared for use in conjunction with a cytology test or to triage some abnormal cervical cytology results; they should not be used for primary HPV testing because they are not cleared for this purpose. These tests include the Hybrid Capture 2 High-Risk HPV DNA test (Qiagen), the Cervista HPV High-Risk DNA and HPV 16/18 DNA tests (Hologics), and the APTIMA HR HPV (Gen Probe) test. All HPV assays should be FDA cleared and used only for the appropriate indications (https://www.fda.gov/ media/122799/download) (158).
HPV testing should not be performed in the following situations:
- Deciding whether to vaccinate against HPV
- Conducting HPV tests for low-risk (nononcogenic) HPV types (e.g., types 6 and 11)
- Providing care to persons with genital warts or their partners
- Testing persons aged $<25$ years as part of routine cervical cancer screening
- Testing oral or anal specimens

Unlike cytology, samples for HPV testing have the potential to be collected by the patient and mailed to health programs for analysis, thus self-collection might be one strategy for increasing screening rates among populations where screening rates are low. Self-collection for HPV testing is not cleared by FDA or recommended by U.S. medical organizations (174).

\section*{Follow-Up of Abnormal Cytology and Human Papillomavirus Test Results}

If the result of the cytology (Pap test) is abnormal, follow-up care should be provided according to the 2019 ASCCP RiskBased Management Consensus Guidelines for Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests and Cancer Precursors (158). Clinics that serve clients who might have difficulty adhering to follow-up recommendations and for whom linkage to care is unlikely should consider offering in-house colposcopy and biopsy services.

Consensus guidelines for management of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests combine patient-level risk data with clinical action thresholds to generate personalized management recommendations (Table 2). This framework allows management on the basis of risk for CIN 3, not specific test results. The guidelines were designed to identify persons at high risk who require colposcopy or expedited treatment and persons at low risk who might be able to safely defer invasive diagnostic procedures. The risk-based framework was designed to easily incorporate future revisions, such as the inclusion of new technologies for screening and management. Use of the guidelines can be facilitated by electronic technology that is continually updated, such as a smartphone application or the website (https://www.asccp.org/Default.aspx).

The following are highlights of the new management guidelines:
- Colposcopy can be deferred for patients at low risk.
- If a patient has a minimally abnormal test result (i.e., negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy HPV positive, ASC-US HPV positive, LSIL, or HPV positive) that was preceded by a negative screening HPV test or cotest within the past 5 years, follow-up in 1 year instead of colposcopy is recommended (a negative HPV test or cotest performed during follow-up of abnormal results would not similarly reduce risk).
- Referral to colposcopy is recommended if cytology test results are abnormal or the HPV test is positive at the 1-year follow-up visit.
- Treatment can be expedited for high-risk patients.

Abbreviations: AGC = atypical glandular cells; AIS = adenocarcinoma in situ; ASC-H = atypical squamous cells cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; ASC-US = atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance; CIN = cervical intraepithelial neoplasia; HPV = human papillomavirus; HSIL = high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; LSIL = low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion; NILM = negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy; Pap = Papanicolaou.
* Colposcopy may be warranted for patients with a history of high-grade lesions (CIN 2 or CIN 3, histologic or cytologic HSIL, ASC-H, AGC, or AIS).
${ }^{\dagger}$ Previous Pap test results do not modify the recommendation; colposcopy is always recommended for two consecutive HPV-positive tests.
${ }^{\S}$ Negative HPV test or cotest (HPV plus Pap test) results only reduce risk sufficiently to defer colposcopy if performed for screening purposes within the last 5 years. Colposcopy is still warranted if negative HPV test or cotest results occurred in the context of surveillance for a previous abnormal result.
${ }^{\mathbb{1}}$ Expedited treatment is preferred for nonpregnant patients aged $\geq 25$ years. Colposcopy with biopsy is an acceptable option if desired by patient after shared decision-making.
${ }^{\circ}$ If a patient has a high-grade cytology (Pap test) result (i.e., HSIL) and an HPV test that is positive for HPV type 16, then treatment with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first.
${ }^{-}$If a patient who has not been screened in more than 5 years (i.e., rarely screened) has an HSIL cytology result and a positive HPV test (regardless of type), then treatment with LEEP is preferred. A colposcopy with biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis first.
${ }^{\circ}$ When considering treatment without confirmatory biopsy, shared decision-making with the patient is important. Considerations include age, concern about cancer, ability to follow up, financial concerns, and
concerns about the potential effect of treatment on a future pregnancy.
- When primary HPV testing is used for screening, cytology testing should be performed for all positive HPV test results to help determine the next steps in management.
- Ideally, cytology testing should be performed by the laboratory as a reflex test from the same specimen so the patient does not need to return to the clinic. Colposcopy is recommended if HPV genotyping is positive for types 16 or 18, and it can be considered if it is infeasible for the patient to return for cytology alone (1274).
- HPV 16 is the highest-risk HPV type. Expedited treatment should be considered for HSIL cytology results, and colposcopy is recommended in all other cases, even if the cytology test is normal.
- HPV 18 has a relatively high association with cancer, and colposcopy is recommended in all cases, even if the cytology test is normal. Because of the association of HPV 18 with adenocarcinoma, endocervical sampling is acceptable at the time of colposcopy.
- If the HPV type is not HPV 16 or 18, and the cytology test is normal, return in 1 year is recommended in most cases.
- HPV testing or cotesting is preferred to cytology testing alone for follow-up after an abnormal test result.
- Negative HPV testing or cotesting is less likely to miss disease than normal cytology testing alone. Therefore, cytology testing is recommended more often than HPV testing or cotesting for follow-up of abnormal results. Specifically, cytology testing is recommended annually when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended at 3-year intervals, and cytology testing is recommended at 6-month intervals when HPV testing or cotesting is recommended annually.
- After treatment for a high-grade precancer (moderate or severe dysplasia), surveillance should continue for at least 25 years.
- Initial testing includes an HPV test or cotest at 6, 18, and 30 months. If cytology alone is used, testing should occur at $6,12,18,24$, and 30 months.
- After completing initial testing, long-term surveillance includes testing at 3-year intervals if using HPV testing or cotesting, or annual testing if using cytology testing alone.
- Surveillance should continue for at least 25 years after the initial treatment, even if this extends beyond age 65 years. If a woman undergoes hysterectomy during the surveillance period, vaginal screening should continue.

\section*{Anal Cancer}

Anal cancer is rare in the general population (1-2 cases per 100,000 person-years); however, incidence is substantially higher among specific populations, including MSM with HIV infection (80-131 cases per 100,000 person-years), men with HIV infection (40-60 cases per 100,000 person-years), women with HIV infection (20-30 cases per 100,000 person-years), and MSM without HIV infection (14 cases per 100,000 person-years) (1275-1279). Incidence is variable among women with previous HPV-related gynecologic dysplasia and cancer (6-63 cases per 100,000 person-years) (1280,1281). Persistent HPV infection might be a risk factor for preventable HPV-associated second primary cancers among survivors of HPV-associated cancers (1282).

Data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology in persons with HIV infection, MSM without HIV infection, and the general population. An annual digital anorectal examination (DARE) might be useful
to detect masses on palpation in persons with HIV infection and possibly in MSM without HIV with a history of receptive anal intercourse (98). More evidence is needed concerning the natural history of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the best screening methods and target populations, the safety and response to treatments, and other programmatic considerations before screening can be routinely recommended.

\section*{Populations at High Risk and Digital Anorectal Examination}

Providers should discuss anal cancer risk with their patients among specific populations to guide management. According to the HIV Opportunistic Infection guidelines and the International Anal Neoplasia Society, a DARE should be performed to detect early anal cancer in persons with HIV infection and MSM without HIV with a history of receptive anal intercourse (98,1283). DARE is acceptable to patients and has a low risk for adverse outcomes (1284,1285).

Data are insufficient to guide initiation of DARE at a defined age or optimal intervals for examination. Whereas anal HSIL is observed among young adults, cancer incidence begins to increase after the early 30s and continues to increase as a function of age.

\section*{Populations at High Risk and Anal Cytology}

Data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology among populations at risk for anal cancer. Certain clinical centers perform anal cytology to screen for anal cancer among populations at high risk (e.g., persons with HIV infection, MSM, and those having receptive anal intercourse), followed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) for those with abnormal cytologic results (e.g., ACS-US, LSIL, or HSIL). Sensitivity and specificity of anal cytology to detect HSIL are limited (sensitivity 55\%-89\% and specificity 40\%$67 \%)$ (1286-1291). Health centers that initiate a cytologybased screening program should only do so if referrals to HRA and biopsy are available.

HRA can be used for diagnosis of HSIL, to monitor response to therapy, or to conduct surveillance of HSIL for evidence of progression. HRA is the primary method used for diagnosis of superficially invasive squamous carcinoma, a very early form of anal cancer that is not palpable on DARE. However, data are insufficient to conclude whether use of HRA leads to reductions in anal cancer incidence or improves anal cancer morbidity and mortality. An ongoing clinical trial is investigating whether treatment of HSIL is effective in reducing the incidence of anal cancer among persons with HIV infection (NCT02135419).

\section*{Human Papillomavirus Testing}

HPV tests (using high-risk HPV types) are not clinically useful for anal cancer screening because of a high prevalence
of anal HPV infection among populations at high risk, particularly MSM (1278,1289,1290). No standard HPV-based algorithms exist for anal cancer screening due to the high prevalence of high-risk HPV infection among groups at risk.

\section*{Treatment of Anal High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion}

Multiple office-based treatments exist for anal HSIL, including ablative methods (e.g., laser, electrocautery, or infrared coagulation) and topical patient-applied therapies (e.g., imiquimod). Recurrence rates with both providerapplied and patient-applied treatments are high, ranging from approximately $50 \%$ at 1 year to $77 \%$ after 3 years (1289, 1292, 1293). In addition, evidence exists that HSIL might spontaneously regress without treatment $(1294,1295)$. Shared decision-making about treatment for anal HSIL is recommended because of limited data on the natural history of anal HSIL, including factors related to progression or regression of lesions.

\section*{Viral Hepatitis}

\section*{Hepatitis A Virus Infection}

HAV infection has an incubation period of approximately 28 days (range: 15-50 days) (1296). HAV replicates in the liver and is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2-3 weeks before to 1 week after the onset of clinical illness. HAV infection produces a self-limited disease that does not result in chronic infection or chronic liver disease. However, approximately $10 \%$ of patients experience a relapse of symptoms during the 6 months after acute illness. Acute liver failure from hepatitis A is rare (overall case-fatality rate: $0.5 \%$ ). The risk for symptomatic infection is directly related to age, with approximately $70 \%$ of adults having symptoms compatible with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having either asymptomatic or unrecognized infection. Antibody produced in response to HAV infection persists for life and confers protection against reinfection (1297).

HAV infection is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, by either person-to-person contact or through consumption of contaminated food or water (1298). Transmission of HAV during sexual activity probably results from fecal-oral contact. Although viremia occurs early during infection and can persist for weeks after symptom onset, bloodborne transmission of HAV is uncommon (1299). Transmission by saliva has not been demonstrated.

In the United States, of the hepatitis A cases accompanied by risk information, a particular risk was identified among only $23.8 \%$ (13,372). Among cases with a risk factor identified, a
recognized foodborne or waterborne outbreak was the most commonly identified risk (49.6\%). Other infection sources identified in the United States include MSM; persons who use injecting drugs; sexual and household contacts; those experiencing homelessness; international travelers; those with children attending a nursery, childcare, or preschool; and persons working in such settings $(13,372)$.

\section*{Diagnostic Considerations}

Diagnosis of HAV infection cannot be made on a clinical basis alone but requires serologic testing. Presence of IgM antibody to HAV is diagnostic of acute HAV infection. A positive test for total anti-HAV indicates immunity to HAV infection but does not differentiate current from previous HAV infection. Although usually not sensitive enough to detect the low level of protective antibody after vaccination, anti-HAV tests also might be positive after hepatitis A vaccination.

\section*{Treatment}

Patients with acute HAV infection usually require only supportive care, with no restrictions in diet or activity. Hospitalization might be necessary for patients who become dehydrated because of nausea and vomiting and is crucial for patients with signs or symptoms of acute liver failure. Medications that might cause liver damage or are metabolized by the liver should be used with caution among persons with HAV infection.

\section*{Prevention}

Vaccination is the most effective means of preventing HAV transmission among persons at risk for infection (e.g., MSM, injecting drug users, and persons with chronic liver disease) who did not receive hepatitis A vaccination during childhood. Hepatitis A vaccines are prepared from formalin-inactivated, cell-culture-derived HAV. Two monovalent vaccines (Havrix and Vaqta are approved by FDA for persons aged $\geq 12$ months (Table 3). These vaccines are available for eligible children and adolescents aged <19 years through the VFC program (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html). Administered IM in a 2 -dose series at 0 and $6-12$ months, hepatitis A vaccines induce protective antibody levels among virtually all adults. By 1 month after the first dose, $94 \%-100 \%$ of adults have protective antibody levels, and after a second dose, $100 \%$ achieve protective levels (1297,1300,1301). Kinetic models of antibody decrease among adults indicate that protective levels persist for $>40$ years (1302-1304). A study of Alaska Natives demonstrated that seropositivity for hepatitis A persists for $>20$ years after completing 2 -dose vaccination at age 12-21 months (1302). Anti-HAV persistence of >20 years was demonstrated among immunocompetent adults vaccinated
with a 2 -dose hepatitis A schedule as adults (1303,1305). A combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) has been developed and licensed for use as a 3-dose series for adults aged $\geq 18$ years at risk for HAV or HBV infections. When administered IM on a $0-1$-, and 6 -month schedule, the vaccine has equivalent immunogenicity to that of the monovalent hepatitis A vaccines.

\section*{Pre-Exposure Vaccination}

Persons at risk for HAV infection (Box 5) (1297) should be offered vaccine (Table 3). If persons are at risk for both HAV and HBV, the combined vaccine can be considered.

\section*{Prevaccination Serologic Testing}

Among U.S.-born adults aged $>20$ years, HAV susceptibility prevalence (i.e., total antibody to HAV was negative) was 74.1\% (95\% CI: 72.9\%-75.3\%) during 2007-2016 (1306). Prevaccination serologic testing for HAV immunity before vaccination is not routinely recommended; however, it can be considered in specific settings to reduce costs by not vaccinating persons who are already immune. Prevaccination serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination of susceptible persons, especially for populations that are difficult to access. If prevaccination testing is performed, commercially available tests for total anti-HAV or IgG anti-HAV should be used (1297).

}

Persons for whom prevaccination testing will likely be most cost-effective include adults who were either born in or lived for extensive periods in geographic areas where HAV endemicity is high or intermediate (1297). Prevaccination serologic testing of children is not indicated because of the low prevalence of infection among that age group.

For populations who are expected to have high rates of previous HAV infection, vaccination history should be obtained when feasible before testing or vaccination. Vaccination should not be postponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained, records are unavailable, or prevaccination testing is infeasible. Vaccinating persons immune from natural infection carries no known risk, nor does giving extra doses of hepatitis A vaccine (1307). Vaccination of a person who is already immune is not harmful. Persons who have a documented history of $\geq 2$ doses of hepatitis $A$ vaccine do not need further vaccination or serologic testing.

\section*{Postvaccination Serologic Testing}

Serologic testing for immunity is unnecessary after routine vaccination of infants, children, or adults (1297). Testing for anti-HAV antibody after vaccination is recommended for persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status and persons for whom revaccination might be indicated (e.g., persons with HIV infection and other immunocompromising conditions).

\section*{Postexposure Prophylaxis}

Persons who recently have been exposed to HAV and who previously have not received hepatitis A vaccine should be administered a single dose of monovalent hepatitis A vaccine or immunoglobulin (IG) ( $0.1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) as soon as possible, ideally $<2$ weeks after exposure because the efficacy of vaccine or IG when administered $>2$ weeks after exposure has not been established (1297). In most cases, monovalent hepatitis A vaccine at the age-appropriate dose is preferred over IG for PEP. Advantages of hepatitis A vaccine for PEP include induction of active immunity, longer-term protection, ease of administration, and better acceptability and availability. Decisions to use vaccine versus IG should be guided by patient characteristics associated with more severe manifestations of HAV infection (e.g., older age, immunocompromising conditions, and chronic liver disease) and the magnitude of the risk for HAV transmission resulting from the exposure (1297).

IG should be used for children aged $<6$ months, immunocompromised persons, persons with chronic liver disease, and persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated. IG can be administered to persons aged $>40$ years, in addition to hepatitis A vaccine (1297).

IG administered IM can provide PEP against HAV (Table 4). IG is a sterile solution of concentrated immunoglobulins prepared

from pooled human plasma processed by cold ethanol fractionation. In the United States, IG is produced only from plasma that has tested negative for HBsAg, antibodies to HIV and HCV, and HIV and HCV RNA. In addition, the process used to manufacture IG inactivates viruses (e.g., HBV, HCV, and HIV). When administered IM <2 weeks after exposure to HAV, IG is $>85 \%$ effective in preventing HAV infection (1308).

If IG is administered to persons for whom hepatitis A vaccine also is recommended, a dose of vaccine should be provided simultaneously with IG in different anatomic sites (e.g., different limbs) as soon as possible, and the second vaccine dose should be administered according to the licensed schedule to complete the series. The combined vaccine can be considered for persons among whom both hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine is recommended (13,1297,1302-1304).

\section*{Special Considerations}

For persons with HIV infection, antibody response can be directly related to $\mathrm{CD4}^{+}$T-cell levels. Although persons with HIV who have lower $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$T-cell counts or percentages might have a weaker response to the vaccine, vaccination should not be delayed for the $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$T-cell count to exceed a certain threshold because of the prolonged risk for HAV exposure created by missed opportunities to vaccinate.

\section*{Hepatitis B Virus Infection}

The incubation period for HBV infection from time of exposure to symptom onset ranges from 6 weeks to 6 months. The highest concentrations of HBV are located in blood, with lower concentrations in other body fluids including wound exudates, semen, vaginal secretions, and saliva (1309,1310). HBV is more infectious and more stable in the environment than other bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HCV or HIV).

HBV infection can be either self-limited or chronic. Among adults, approximately half of newly acquired HBV infections are symptomatic, and approximately $1 \%$ of reported cases result in acute liver failure and death (1311). Risk for chronic infection is inversely related to age at acquisition; approximately $90 \%$ of infected infants and $30 \%$ of infected children aged $<5$ years become chronically infected, compared with $2 \%-6 \%$ of persons who become infected as adults (1312). Among persons with chronic HBV infection, the risk for premature death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma is $15 \%-25 \%(1313)$.

HBV is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous membrane exposure to HBV-infected blood or body fluids that contain HBV. The primary risk factors associated with infection among adolescents and adults are unprotected sex with an infected partner, having multiple partners, men having
sex with men, having history of other STIs, and injecting drug use (233). In addition, studies have demonstrated other modes of HBV transmission, including premastication and lapses in health care infection control procedures, as less common sources of transmission (1314-1317).

CDC's national strategy for eliminating transmission of HBV infection includes prevention of perinatal infection through routine screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg and immunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with HBsAg or mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown, routine infant vaccination, vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents through age 18 years, and vaccination of previously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection (12). High vaccination coverage rates with subsequent decreases in acute HBV infection incidence have been achieved among infants and adolescents (1318). The vaccination of persons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved vaccination coverage among adults aged <30 years (1319) and corresponding lower rates of acute HBV infection among this group. In contrast, vaccination coverage among the majority of adult populations at high risk aged $\geq 30$ years (e.g., persons with multiple sex partners, MSM, and injecting drug users) has remained low (1320,1321); these groups account for the highest rates of preventable acute infections (12,1319,1322). STD clinics and other health care settings providing STI services to adults at high risk for infection should administer hepatitis B vaccine to those who are unvaccinated.

\section*{Diagnosis}

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

\section*{Treatment}

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease (1323).

\section*{Prevention}

Two products have been approved for HBV prevention: hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) for PEP and hepatitis B vaccine (12). HBIG provides temporary (i.e., 3-6 months) protection from HBV infection and is typically used as PEP as an adjunct to hepatitis B vaccination for previously unvaccinated persons or for persons who have not responded to vaccination. HBIG is prepared from plasma known to contain high concentrations of anti-HBs. The recommended dose of HBIG is $0.06 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight.

Hepatitis B vaccine contains HBsAg produced in yeast by recombinant DNA technology and provides protection from HBV infection when used for both pre-exposure vaccination and PEP. The three available monovalent hepatitis $B$ vaccines for use in the United States are Recombivax HB, Engerix-B, and Heplisav-B. A combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine for use among persons aged $\geq 18$ years, Twinrix, also is available.

When selecting a hepatitis B vaccination schedule, health care providers should consider the need to achieve completion of the vaccine series. The recommended HBV dose and schedule varies by product and age of recipient (Table 6). Three different 3-dose schedules for adolescents and adults have been approved for both monovalent hepatitis B vaccines (i.e., Engerix-B and Recombivax HB); these vaccines can be administered at 0,1 , and 6 months; 0,1 , and 4 months; or 0,2 , and 4 months. A 4 -dose schedule of Engerix-B at $0,1,2$, and 12 months is licensed for all age groups. A 2-dose schedule of Recombivax HB adult formulation ( $10 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ ) is licensed for adolescents aged 11-15 years, with a 4-month minimal interval between doses. When scheduled to receive the second dose, adolescents
aged 16-19 years should be switched to a 3-dose series, with doses 2 and 3 consisting of the pediatric formulation ( $5 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ ) administered on a recommended schedule. Heplisav-B is a new single-antigen recombinant hepatitis $B$ vaccine with a novel cytosine-phosphate-guanine 1018 oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant for prevention of HBV infection among persons aged $\geq 18$ years, administered as a 2 -dose series at 0 and 1 month ( $>4$ weeks apart) (156). Twinrix is a 3-dose schedule administered at 0,1 , and 6 months to persons aged $\geq 18$ years at risk for both HAV and HBV infections.

Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered IM in the deltoid muscle and can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines. If the vaccine series is interrupted after the first or second dose of vaccine, the missed dose should be administered as soon as possible. The series does not need to be restarted after a missed dose. HBV vaccination is available for eligible children and adolescents aged <19 years through the VFC program (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/contacts-state. html). When feasible, the same manufacturer's vaccines should be used to complete the series; however, vaccination should not be deferred when the manufacturer of the previously administered vaccine is unknown or when the vaccine from the same manufacturer is unavailable (1324).

Among adolescents and healthy adults aged <40 years, approximately $30 \%-55 \%$ achieve a protective antibody response (i.e., anti-HBs $\geq 10 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) after the first single-antigen vaccine dose, $75 \%$ after the second, and $>90 \%$ after the third. Recent clinical trials reported a protective antibody response achieved among approximately $90 \%$ of participants receiving Heplisav-B, compared with $70.5 \%-90.2 \%$ of participants receiving Engerix-B (12). Vaccine-induced immune memory has been demonstrated to persist for $>30$ years (1325-1327).

Periodic testing to determine antibody levels after routine vaccination among immunocompetent persons is unnecessary, and booster doses of vaccine are not recommended.

Hepatitis B vaccination is usually well tolerated by the majority of recipients. Pain at the injection site and low-grade fever are reported by a minority of recipients. For children and adolescents, a causal association exists between receipt of hepatitis B vaccination and anaphylaxis. For each 1.1 million doses of vaccine administered, approximately one recipient will experience this type of reaction (1328); however, no deaths have been reported among these patients (1318,1328). Vaccine is contraindicated for persons with a history of anaphylaxis after a previous dose of hepatitis $B$ vaccine and persons with a known anaphylactic reaction to any vaccine component (1329). No other adverse events after administration of hepatitis B vaccine have been demonstrated.

\section*{Pre-Exposure Vaccination}

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated children and adolescents; all unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV infection, especially injecting drug users; MSM; adults with multiple sex partners; sex partners, needle-sharing contacts, or household contacts of persons with chronic hepatitis B ; and persons with diabetes and all adults seeking protection from HBV infection (1318). For adults, acknowledgment of a specific risk factor is not a requirement for vaccination.

Hepatitis B vaccine should be routinely offered to all unvaccinated persons attending STD clinics and to all unvaccinated persons seeking evaluation or treatment for STIs in other settings, especially correctional facilities, facilities providing substance misuse treatment and prevention services, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and settings serving MSM (e.g., HIV infection care and prevention settings). If hepatitis $B$ vaccine is unavailable at a particular facility, persons should be linked to a setting where they can receive vaccine. Persons with a reliable vaccination history (i.e., a written, dated record of each dose of a complete series) or reliable history of hepatitis $B$ infection (i.e., a written record of infection and serologic results providing evidence of previous infection) do not require vaccination. In all settings, vaccination should be initiated at the initial visit, even if concerns about completion of the vaccine series exist.

\section*{Prevaccination Serologic Testing}

Conducting prevaccination serologic testing for susceptibility just before the initial vaccine dose is administered can be considered for identifying persons with chronic HBV infection and, potentially, reducing the cost of completing the vaccination series for adult populations that have an expected high prevalence ( $20 \%-30 \%$ ) of HBV infection (e.g., injecting drug users and MSM, especially those among older age groups, or persons born where HBV endemicity is moderate to high). In addition, prevaccination testing for susceptibility is
recommended for unvaccinated household, sexual, and needlesharing contacts of HBsAg-positive persons (1318). Serologic testing should not be a barrier to vaccination. The first vaccine dose should be administered immediately after collection of the blood sample for serologic testing. Vaccination of persons who are immune to HBV infection because of current or previous infection or vaccination is not harmful and does not increase the risk for adverse events.

Prevaccination testing should be performed with HBsAg , anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc to define patients' HBV clinical status and deliver recommended care (1330). Persons who test HBsAg positive should receive prevention counseling and evaluation for antiviral treatment (see Management of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive). Persons who test total anti-HBc positive and anti-HBs positive should be counseled that they have had previous HBV infection and are immune. Those persons with isolated anti- HBc (i.e., negative HBsAg and anti-HBs) need further assessment to rule out occult HBV infection, and they are at higher risk for reactivation if exposed to immunosuppressants. Persons who test negative to all three HBV seromarkers should receive the complete vaccination series, with the first vaccine dose administered immediately.

\section*{Postvaccination Serologic Testing for Response}

Postvaccination serologic testing for immunity is unnecessary after routine vaccination of adolescents or adults. However, such testing is recommended for persons whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status. Persons recommended to receive postvaccination serologic testing include health care personnel and public safety workers, persons with HIV infection, sex and needle-sharing partners of HBsAg -positive persons, hemodialysis patients and others who might require outpatient hemodialysis (e.g., predialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or home dialysis), and other immunocompromised persons (e.g., hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients or persons receiving chemotherapy) (1318).
If indicated, anti-HBs testing should be performed 1-2 months after administration of the last dose of the vaccine series. Persons determined to have anti-HBs levels of $<10 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}$ after the primary vaccine series should be revaccinated with a 3-dose series and tested again for anti-HBs 1-2 months after the third dose. Persons who do not respond to revaccination should be tested for HBsAg and HBc . If HBsAg positive, persons should receive recommended management (see Management of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive). If HBsAg negative, persons should be considered susceptible to HBV infection and counseled about precautions for preventing HBV infection and the need for HBIG PEP for any known exposure. If isolated anti- HBc positive (i.e., negative HBsAg and anti-HBs), persons will need further assessment to rule out
occult HBV infection and are at higher risk for reactivation if exposed to immunosuppressants.

\section*{Postexposure Prophylaxis}

Both passive and active PEP (simultaneous administration of HBIG [i.e., $0.06 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight] and hepatitis B vaccine at separate anatomic sites) and active PEP (administration of hepatitis B vaccination alone) have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing transmission after exposure to HBV (12). HBIG alone also has been demonstrated to be effective in preventing HBV transmission; however, with the availability of hepatitis B vaccine, HBIG typically is used as an adjunct to vaccination.

\section*{Exposure to a Source Who Is HBsAg Positive}

Unvaccinated persons or persons known not to have responded to a complete hepatitis B vaccine series should receive both HBIG and hepatitis vaccine as soon as possible (preferably $\leq 24$ hours) after a discrete, identifiable exposure to blood or body fluids that contain blood from a person with HBsAg (Table 7). Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered simultaneously with HBIG at a separate anatomic site, and the vaccine series should be completed by using the age-appropriate vaccine dose and schedule (Table 6). Exposed persons who are not fully vaccinated because they have not completed the vaccine series should receive HBIG (i.e., $0.06 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) and complete the vaccine series. Persons who have written documentation of a complete hepatitis $B$ vaccine series who did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a single vaccine booster dose. Exposed persons who are known to have responded to vaccination by postvaccination testing are considered protected; therefore, they need no additional doses of vaccine or HBIG. All persons with an occupational exposure to blood or body fluids that contain HBV should be managed according to guidelines (12).

\section*{Exposure to a Source with Unknown HBsAg Status}

Unvaccinated persons and persons with previous nonresponse to hepatitis B vaccination who have a discrete, identifiable exposure to blood or body fluids containing blood from a person with unknown HBsAg status should receive the hepatitis B vaccine series, with the first dose initiated as soon as possible after exposure (preferably $<24$ hours) and the series completed according to the age-appropriate dose and schedule. Exposed persons who are not fully vaccinated but started the series should complete the vaccine series. Exposed persons with written documentation of a complete hepatitis $B$ vaccine series who did not receive postvaccination testing require no further treatment.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

All persons with HBV infection should be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.

\section*{Management of Persons Who Are HBsAg Positive}

Recommendations for management of all persons with HBsAg include the following:
- All persons with HBsAg documented on laboratory results should be reported to the state or local health department.
- To verify the presence of chronic HBV infection, persons with HBsAg should be retested. The absence of IgM antiHBc or the persistence of HBsAg for $\geq 6$ months indicates chronic HBV infection.
- Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a specialist experienced in managing chronic hepatitis B infection.
- Household, sexual, and needle-sharing contacts of persons with chronic infection should be evaluated. Unvaccinated sex partners and household and needle-sharing contacts should be tested for susceptibility to HBV infection and receive the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine immediately after collection of the blood sample for serologic testing (see Prevaccination Serologic Testing). Susceptible persons
should complete the vaccine series by using an ageappropriate vaccine dose and schedule.
- Sex partners of persons with HBsAg should be counseled to use latex condoms (1331) to protect themselves from sexual exposure to infectious body fluids (e.g., semen and vaginal secretions), unless they have been demonstrated to be immune after vaccination (anti-HBs $\geq 10 \mathrm{mIU} / \mathrm{mL}$ ) or previously infected (anti-HBc positive).
- To prevent or reduce the risk for transmission to others in addition to vaccination, persons with HBsAg also should be advised to
- use methods (e.g., condoms) to protect nonimmune sex partners from acquiring HBV infection from sexual activity until the partner can be vaccinated and immunity documented;
o cover cuts and skin lesions to prevent spread by infectious secretions or blood;
- refrain from donating blood, plasma, body organs, other tissue, or semen; and
o refrain from sharing household articles (e.g., toothbrushes, razors, or personal injecting equipment) that could become contaminated with blood, and refrain from premastication of food.
- To protect the liver from further harm, persons with HBsAg should be advised to
- avoid or limit alcohol consumption because of the effects of alcohol on the liver;
- refrain from starting any new medicines, including over-the-counter and herbal medicines, without checking with their health care provider; and
o obtain vaccination against hepatitis A.
When seeking medical or dental care, persons who are HBsAg positive should be advised to inform their health care providers of their HBsAg status so that they can be evaluated and managed. The following are key counseling messages for persons with HBsAg:
- HBV is not usually spread by hugging, coughing, food or water, sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses, or casual contact.
- Persons should not be excluded from work, school, play, childcare, or other settings because they are infected with HBV.
- Involvement with a support group might help patients cope with chronic HBV infection.
- HBV infection is a chronic condition that can be treated, and patients should receive prevention counseling and be evaluated for antiviral treatment.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Regardless of whether they have been previously tested or vaccinated, all pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg at the first prenatal visit and again at delivery if at high risk for HBV infection (see STI Detection Among Special Populations). Pregnant women at risk for HBV infection and without documentation of a complete hepatitis $B$ vaccine series should receive hepatitis B vaccination. All pregnant women with HBsAg should be reported to state and local perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs and referred to a specialist. Information about management of pregnant women with HBsAg and their infants is available at https://www.cdc.gov/ hepatitis/hbv/perinatalxmtn.htm.

\section*{HIV Infection}

HIV infection can impair the response to hepatitis B vaccination. Persons with HIV should be tested for anti-HBs 1-2 months after the third vaccine dose (see Postvaccination Serologic Testing). Modified dosing regimens, including a doubling of the standard antigen dose and administration of additional doses, might increase the response rate and should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Additional recommendations for management of persons with HBsAg and HIV infection are available (98).

\section*{Hepatitis C Virus Infection}

HCV infection is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States, with an estimated 2.4 million persons living with chronic infection (1332). HCV is not efficiently transmitted through sex (1333-1335). Studies of HCV transmission between heterosexual couples and MSM have yielded mixed results; however, studies have reported either no or minimally increased rates of HCV infection among partners of persons with HCV infection compared with partners of those without HCV (1334, 1336-1338). However, data indicate that sexual transmission of HCV can occur, especially among persons with HIV infection. Increasing incidence of acute HCV infection among MSM with HIV infection has been reported in multiple U.S. (96,236,239,1339) and European cities (237,1340-1342). A recent systematic review reported an HCV incidence of 6.35 per 1,000 person years among MSM with HIV infection (1343). An association exists with high-risk and traumatic sexual practices (e.g., condomless receptive anal intercourse or receptive fisting) and concurrent genital ulcerative disease or STI-related proctitis (237,1342). HCV transmission among MSM with HIV infection has also been associated with group sex and chemsex (i.e., using recreational drugs in a sexual context) (1344-1348). Shedding of HCV in the semen and in the rectum of men with HIV infection has been documented (1349,1350). Certain studies have revealed that risk increases commensurate with increasing numbers of sex partners among heterosexual persons (1337,1338,1351-1353) and MSM with HIV infection (1349,1354-1357), especially if their partners are also coinfected with HIV (237,1340,1354-1356,1358). More recently, acute HCV infections have been reported among MSM on PrEP, increasing concerns that certain MSM might be at increased risk for incident HCV infection through condomless sexual intercourse with MSM with HCV infection (1359,1360).

Persons newly infected with HCV typically are either asymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness. HCV RNA can be detected in blood within 1-3 weeks after exposure. The average time from exposure to antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) seroconversion is 4-10 weeks, and anti-HCV can be detected among approximately $97 \%$ of persons by 6 months after exposure (1361-1364) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/ hcvfaq.htm\#section3).

Chronic HCV infection develops among 75\%-85\% of persons with HCV infection $(1365,1366)$, and $10 \%-20 \%$ of persons with chronic infection develop cirrhosis in 20-30 years of active liver disease (1367). The majority of infected persons remain unaware of their infection because they are not clinically
ill. However, infected persons are a source of transmission to others and are at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma decades after infection.

HCV is primarily transmitted parenterally, usually through shared drug-injecting needles and paraphernalia. HCV also can be transmitted through exposures in health care settings as a consequence of inadequate infection control practices (1314). Transmission after receipt of blood from donors and from transplantation of tissues and organs with HCV infection has occurred only rarely since 1992, when routine screening of these donated products was mandated in the United States (1367,1369). Tattoos applied in regulated settings have not been associated with HCV transmission, although those obtained in certain settings have been linked to such transmission (1336). Occupational and perinatal exposures also can result in transmission of HCV; however, such transmission is uncommon.
Acute HCV infection is a reportable condition in 49 states. Matching viral hepatitis and HIV surveillance registries, and molecular epidemiologic assessments, can facilitate early detection of social networks of HCV transmission among MSM with HIV infection.

CDC recommends hepatitis C screening at least once in a lifetime for all adults aged $\geq 18$ years and for all women during each pregnancy, except in settings where the prevalence of HCV infection is $<0.1 \%$ (156). One-time hepatitis C testing is also recommended regardless of age, setting, or recognized conditions or exposures (e.g., HIV infection, history of injecting drug use, or children born to women with HCV infection). Routine periodic HCV testing is recommended for persons with ongoing risk factors (e.g., injecting drug use or hemodialysis).

\section*{Diagnosis}

Testing for HCV infection should include use of an FDAcleared test for antibody to HCV (i.e., immunoassay, EIA, or enhanced CIA and, if recommended, a supplemental antibody test) followed by NAAT to detect HCV RNA for those with a positive antibody result (1370). Persons with HIV infection with low $\mathrm{CD4}^{+}$T-cell count might require further testing by NAAT because of the potential for a false-negative antibody assay.
Persons determined to have HCV infection (i.e., positive for HCV RNA) should be evaluated for treatment. Antibody to HCV remains positive after spontaneously resolving or successful treatment; therefore, subsequent testing for HCV reinfection among persons with ongoing risk factors should be limited to HCV RNA. Persons who have spontaneous resolution or who have undergone successful treatment are not immune to reinfection.

\section*{Treatment}

HCV infection is curable, and persons with diagnosed HCV infection should be linked to care and treatment. Providers should consult existing guidelines to learn about the latest advances in treating HCV infection (https://www.hcvguidelines. org) and with hepatitis specialists, as needed. Persons at high risk for transmitting HCV to others should be treated both for individual benefit and to prevent HCV transmission.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Because incident HCV has not been demonstrated to occur among heterosexual couples followed over time (1334,1371-1373), condom use might not be necessary in such circumstances. Persons with HCV infection with one long-term, steady sex partner do not need to change their sexual practices. However, they should discuss the risk for transmission with their partner and discuss the need for testing (234) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/index.htm). Heterosexual persons and MSM with HCV infection and more than one partner, especially those with concurrent HIV infection, should protect their partners against HCV and HIV acquisition by using external latex condoms (237,1358,1374) and HIV PrEP. Partners of persons with HCV and HIV should be tested for both infections.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

All persons with HCV infection for whom HIV and HBV infection status is unknown should be tested for these infections. Those who have HIV or HBV infection should be referred for or provided with recommended care and treatment. Persons without previous exposure to HAV or HBV should be vaccinated.

\section*{Prevention}

Reducing the burden of HCV infection and disease in the United States requires implementing both primary and secondary prevention activities. Primary prevention reduces or eliminates HCV transmission, whereas secondary prevention identifies persons through screening and then provides treatment to reduce chronic liver disease and other chronic diseases and HCV transmission. No vaccine for hepatitis C is available, and prophylaxis with IG is not effective in preventing HCV infection after exposure. PEP using directacting antivirals is not recommended.

Persons with HCV infection should be provided information about how to protect their liver from further harm (i.e., hepatotoxic agents); for instance, persons with HCV infection should be advised to avoid drinking alcohol and taking any new medicines, including over-the-counter or herbal medications, without checking with their clinician. In addition, a need for
hepatitis $A$ and $B$ vaccination should be determined; persons who are not immune should be vaccinated.

To reduce the risk for transmission to others, persons with HCV infection should be advised not to donate blood, body organs, other tissue, or semen; not to share any personal items that might have blood on them (e.g., toothbrushes or razors); and to cover cuts and sores on the skin to keep the virus from spreading by blood or secretions. Women with HCV infection do not need to avoid pregnancy or breastfeeding, although children born to women with HCV also should be tested for HCV.

Persons who use or inject drugs should be counseled about the importance of prevention and provided access to substance misuse treatment, including medication-assisted treatment, if indicated. Persons who inject drugs should be encouraged to take the following additional steps to reduce personal and public health risks:
- Never reuse or share syringes, water, or drug preparation equipment.
- Only use syringes obtained from a reliable source (e.g., a syringe services program or a pharmacy).
- Use a new, sterile syringe to prepare and inject drugs each time.
- If possible, use sterile water to prepare drugs; otherwise, use clean water from a reliable source (e.g., fresh tap water).
- Use a new or disinfected container (i.e., cooker) and a new filter (i.e., cotton) to prepare drugs.
- Clean the injection site with a new alcohol swab before injection.
- Safely dispose of syringes after one use.

\section*{Postexposure Follow-Up}

No PEP has been demonstrated to be effective against HCV infection. Testing for HCV is recommended for health care workers after percutaneous or perimucosal exposures to HCVpositive blood. Prompt identification of acute infection is vital because outcomes are improved when treatment is initiated early during the illness course.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

All pregnant women should be screened with each pregnancy for HCV antibodies at the first prenatal visit in settings where the HCV prevalence is $>0.1 \%$ (https://www.cdc.gov/ hepatitis/hcv/index.htm) (154,155). Although the rate of transmission is highly variable, more than six of every 100 infants born to women with HCV infection become infected; this infection occurs predominantly during or near delivery, and no treatment or delivery method (e.g., cesarean delivery) has been demonstrated to decrease this risk (1375). However, the risk is increased by the presence of maternal HCV viremia
at delivery and is twofold to threefold greater if the woman has HIV infection. Although no recommendations are available for HCV treatment during pregnancy, discussion about the individual risks and benefits of postpartum treatment can be considered in accordance with existing guidance (https://www. hcvguidelines.org/unique-populations/pregnancy).

HCV has not been reported to be transmitted through breast milk, although mothers with HCV infection should consider abstaining from breastfeeding if their nipples are cracked or bleeding. Infants born to mothers with HCV infection should be tested for HCV infection; children should be tested for anti-HCV no sooner than age 18 months because anti-HCV from the mother might last until that age. If diagnosis is desired before the child reaches age 18 months, testing for HCV RNA can be performed at or after the infant's first well-child visit at age $1-2$ months. HCV RNA testing can be repeated at a subsequent visit, independent of the initial HCV RNA test result (1376) (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/hcvfaq. htm\#section3).

\section*{HIV Infection}

All persons with HIV infection should undergo serologic screening for HCV at initial evaluation (98) (https://www. hcvguidelines.org). Providers should be aware of the likelihood that MSM with HIV infection can acquire HCV after initial screening. Because acute HCV infection acquisition among persons with HIV infection can occur, especially among MSM, and regular screening of those with HIV is costeffective (238,239,1377), periodic HCV screening should be conducted (1378-1380). For persons with HIV infection, hepatitis C screening with HCV antibody assays (followed by HCV RNA if antibody positive) can be considered at least yearly, for those at high risk for infection, and more frequently depending on specific circumstances (e.g., community HCV infection prevalence and incidence, high-risk sexual behavior, and concomitant ulcerative STIs and proctitis). Antibody to HCV remains positive after spontaneously resolved infection or successful treatment; therefore, subsequent testing for potential HCV reinfection among persons with ongoing risk should be limited to HCV RNA testing only. Indirect testing (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) is not recommended for detecting incident HCV infections because such testing, especially if performed once a year, can miss persons who have reverted after acute HCV infection to a normal ALT level at the time of testing (239) (https://www.hcvguidelines.org). Conversely, ALT can be elevated by antiretroviral and other medications, alcohol, and toxins. If ALT levels are being monitored, persons with HIV infection who experience new or unexplained increases in ALT should be tested for acute

HCV infection and evaluated for possible medication toxicity or excessive alcohol use.

Continued unprotected sexual contact between partners with HIV can facilitate spread of HCV infection because the virus can be recovered from the semen of men with HIV infection (1349,1381). Specific prevention practices (e.g., barrier precautions that limit contact with body fluids during sexual contact with other MSM) should be discussed.

Because a minimal percentage of persons with HIV infection do not develop HCV antibodies, HCV RNA testing should be performed for persons with HIV infection and unexplained liver disease who are anti-HCV negative. The course of liver disease is more rapid among persons with HIV and HCV, and the risk for cirrhosis is higher than that for persons with HCV infection alone.

\section*{Proctitis, Proctocolitis, and Enteritis}

Sexually transmitted gastrointestinal syndromes include proctitis, proctocolitis, and enteritis. Evaluation for these syndromes should include recommended diagnostic procedures, including anoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, stool examination for WBCs, and microbiologic workup (e.g., gonorrhea, chlamydia [LGV PCR if available], herpes simplex NAAT, and syphilis serology). For those with enteritis, stool culture or LGV PCR also is recommended.

Proctitis is inflammation of the rectum (i.e., the distal $10-12 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) that can be associated with anorectal pain, tenesmus, or rectal discharge. Fecal leukocytes are common. Proctitis occurs predominantly among persons who have receptive anal exposures (oral-anal, digital-anal, or genitalanal). N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis (including LGV serovars), HSV, and T. pallidum are the most common STI pathogens. Genital HSV and LGV proctitis are more prevalent among persons with HIV infection (545,556,1382). M. genitalium has been detected in certain cases of proctitis and might be more common among persons with HIV infection $(937,1382)$. N. meningitidis has been identified as an etiology of proctitis among MSM with HIV infection (1383).

Proctocolitis is associated with symptoms of proctitis, diarrhea or abdominal cramps, and inflammation of the colonic mucosa extending to 12 cm above the anus. Fecal leukocytes might be detected on stool examination, depending on the pathogen. Proctocolitis can be acquired through receptive anal intercourse or by oral-anal contact, depending on the pathogen.

Pathogenic organisms include Campylobacter species, Shigella species, E. histolytica, LGV serovars of C. trachomatis, and T. pallidum. Among immunosuppressed persons with HIV infection, CMV or other opportunistic agents should be considered. The clinical presentation can be mistaken for
inflammatory bowel disease or malignancy, resulting in a delayed diagnosis $(1384,1385)$.

Enteritis usually results in diarrhea and abdominal cramping without signs of proctitis or proctocolitis. Fecal leukocytes might be detected on stool examination, depending on the pathogen. When outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness occur among social or sexual networks of MSM, clinicians should consider sexual transmission as a mode of spread and provide counseling accordingly. Sexual practices that can facilitate transmission of enteric pathogens include oral-anal contact or, in certain instances, direct genital-anal contact. G. lamblia is the most frequently implicated parasite, and bacterial pathogens include Shigella species, Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter species, and Cryptosporidium. Outbreaks of Shigella species, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, and microsporidiosis have been reported among MSM (259,274,1386,1387). Multiple enteric pathogens and concurrent STIs have also been reported. Among immunosuppressed persons with HIV infection, CMV or other opportunistic pathogens should be considered.

\section*{Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations for Acute Proctitis}

\section*{Diagnosis}

Persons with symptoms of acute proctitis should be examined by anoscopy. A Gram-stained smear of any anorectal exudate from anoscopic or anal examination should be examined for polymorphonuclear leukocytes. All persons should be evaluated for herpes simplex (preferably by NAAT of rectal lesions), N. gonorrhoeae (NAAT or culture), C. trachomatis (NAAT), and T. pallidum (darkfield of lesion if available and serologic testing). If the C. trachomatis NAAT test is positive on a rectal swab and severe symptoms associated with LGV are present (including rectal ulcers, anal discharge, bleeding, $\geq 10$ WBCs on Gram stain, and tenesmus), patients should be treated empirically for LGV. Molecular testing for LGV is not widely available or not FDA cleared, and results are not typically available in time for clinical decision-making. However, if available, molecular PCR testing for C. trachomatis serovars L1, L2, or L3 can be considered for confirming LGV (553).

The pathogenic role of M. genitalium in proctitis is unclear. For persons with persistent symptoms after standard treatment, providers should consider testing for M. genitalium with NAAT and treat if positive (see Mycoplasma genitalium).

\section*{Treatment}

Acute proctitis among persons who have anal exposure through oral, genital, or digital contact is usually sexually acquired (1382,1388). Presumptive therapy should be
initiated while awaiting results of laboratory tests for persons with anorectal exudate detected on examination or polymorphonuclear leukocytes detected on a Gram-stained smear of anorectal exudate or secretions. Such therapy also should be initiated when anoscopy or Gram stain is not available and the clinical presentation is consistent with acute proctitis for persons reporting receptive anal exposures.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Recommended Regimen for Acute Proctitis \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Ceftriaxone $500 \mathrm{mg}^{*} \mathrm{IM}$ in a single dose plus \\
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 7 days ${ }^{\dagger}$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
* For persons weighing $\geq 150 \mathrm{~kg}, 1 \mathrm{~g}$ of ceftriaxone should be administered. \\
${ }^{\dagger}$ Doxycycline course should be extended to 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 21 days in the presence of bloody discharge, perianal or mucosal ulcers, or tenesmus and a positive rectal chlamydia test.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Bloody discharge, perianal ulcers, or mucosal ulcers among persons with acute proctitis and rectal chlamydia (NAAT) should receive presumptive treatment for LGV with an extended course of doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 3 weeks $(1389,1390)$ (see Lymphogranuloma Venereum). If painful perianal ulcers are present or mucosal ulcers are detected on anoscopy, presumptive therapy should also include a regimen for genital herpes (see Genital Herpes).

\section*{Diagnostic and Treatment Considerations for Proctocolitis or Enteritis}

Treatment for proctocolitis or enteritis should be directed to the specific enteric pathogen identified. Multiple stool examinations might be necessary for detecting Giardia, and special stool preparations are required for diagnosing cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis. Diagnostic and treatment recommendations for all enteric infections are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Providers should be aware of the potential for antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, particularly during outbreaks of Shigella and Campylobacter among sexual networks of MSM where increased resistance to azithromycin, fluoroquinolones, and isolates resistant to multiple antibiotics have been described (266,272,273,1391,1392).

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

To minimize transmission and reinfection, patients treated for acute proctitis should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated (i.e., until completion of a 7-day regimen and symptoms have resolved). Studies have reported that behaviors that facilitate enteric pathogen transmission might be associated with acquisition of other STIs, including HIV infection. All persons with acute proctitis and concern for sexually
transmitted proctocolitis or enteritis should be tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia (at other exposed sites). PEP should be considered for exposures that present a risk for HIV acquisition. For ongoing risk for HIV acquisition, PrEP should be considered.

Evidence-based interventions for preventing acquisition of sexually transmitted enteric pathogens are not available. However, extrapolating from general infection control practices for communicable diseases and established STI prevention practices, recommendations include avoiding contact with feces during sex, using barriers, and washing hands after handing materials that have been in contact with the anal area (i.e., barriers and sex toys) and after touching the anus or rectal area.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Follow-up should be based on specific etiology and severity of clinical symptoms. For proctitis associated with gonorrhea or chlamydia, retesting for the respective pathogen should be performed 3 months after treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Partners who have had sexual contact with persons treated for gonorrhea or chlamydia <60 days before the onset of the persons symptoms should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for the respective infection. Partners of persons with proctitis should be evaluated for any diseases diagnosed in the index partner. Sex partners should abstain from sexual contact until they and their partners are treated. No specific recommendations are available for screening or treating sex partners of persons with diagnosed sexually transmitted enteric pathogens; however, partners should seek care if symptomatic.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions}

Allergic reactions with third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., ceftriaxone) are uncommon among persons with a history of penicillin allergy (620,631,658,896).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with HIV infection and acute proctitis might present with bloody discharge, painful perianal ulcers, or mucosal ulcers and LGV and herpes proctitis are more prevalent among this population. Presumptive treatment in such cases should include a regimen for genital herpes and LGV.

\section*{Ectoparasitic Infections}

\section*{Pediculosis Pubis}

Persons who have pediculosis pubis (i.e., pubic lice) usually seek medical attention because of pruritus or because they notice lice or nits on their pubic hair. Pediculosis pubis is caused by the parasite Phthirus pubis and is usually transmitted by sexual contact (1393).

\section*{Diagnosis}

The clinical diagnosis is based on typical symptoms of itching in the pubic region. Lice and nits can be observed on pubic hair.

\section*{Treatment}

\section*{Recommended Regimens for Pediculosis Pubis}

Permethrin 1\% cream rinse applied to affected areas and washed off after 10 minutes
or
Pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide applied to the affected area and washed off after 10 minutes

\section*{Alternative Regimens}

Malathion 0.5\% lotion applied to affected areas and washed off after 8-12 hours
or
Ivermectin $250 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight orally, repeated in 7-14 days

Reported resistance to pediculcides (permethrin and pyrethrin) has been increasing and is widespread (1394,1395). Malathion can be used when treatment failure is believed to have occurred as a result of resistance. The odor and longer duration of application associated with malathion therapy make it a less attractive alternative compared with the recommended pediculicides. Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity (1396). Ivermectin might not prevent recurrences from eggs at the time of treatment, and therefore treatment should be repeated in $7-14$ days (1397,1398). Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, thus increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. Adjustment of ivermectin dosage is not required for persons with renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses among persons with severe liver disease is unknown. Lindane is not recommended for treatment of pediculosis because of toxicity, contraindications for certain populations (pregnant and breastfeeding women, children aged $<10$ years, and those with extensive dermatitis), and complexity of administration.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

The recommended regimens should not be applied to the eyes. Pediculosis of the eyelashes should be treated by applying occlusive ophthalmic ointment or petroleum jelly to the eyelid
margins 2 times/day for 10 days. Bedding and clothing should be decontaminated (i.e., machine washed and dried by using the heat cycle or dry cleaned) or removed from body contact for at least 72 hours. Fumigation of living areas is unnecessary. Pubic hair removal has been associated with atypical patterns of pubic lice infestation and decreasing incidence of infection $(537,1399)$. Persons with pediculosis pubis should be evaluated for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.

\section*{Follow-Up}

Evaluation should be performed after 1 week if symptoms persist. Retreatment might be necessary if lice are found or if eggs are observed at the hair-skin junction. If no clinical response is achieved to one of the recommended regimens, retreatment with an alternative regimen is recommended.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners}

Sex partners within the previous month should be treated. Sexual contact should be avoided until patients and partners have been treated, bedding and clothing decontaminated, and reevaluation performed to rule out persistent infection.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Pregnancy}

Existing data from human participants demonstrate that pregnant and lactating women should be treated with either permethrin or pyrethrin with piperonyl butoxide. Because no teratogenicity or toxicity attributable to ivermectin has been observed during human pregnancy experience, ivermectin is classified as "human data suggest low risk" during pregnancy and probably compatible with breastfeeding (431).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons who have pediculosis pubis and HIV infection should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV.

\section*{Scabies}

Scabies is a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes pruritus. Sensitization to S. scabiei occurs before pruritus begins. The first time a person is infested with S. scabiei, sensitization takes weeks to develop. However, pruritus might occur $<24$ hours after a subsequent reinfestation. Scabies among adults frequently is sexually acquired, although scabies among children usually is not (1400-1402).

\section*{Diagnosis}

Scabies diagnosis is made by identifying burrows, mites, eggs, or the mites' feces from affected areas. Skin scrapings can be examined under the microscope to identify organisms, although
this method has low sensitivity and is time consuming (1403). Alternatively, noninvasive examination of the affected skin by using videodermatoscopy, videomicroscopy, or dermoscopy can be used, each of which has high sensitivity and specificity, particularly when performed by experienced operators (1404). Low-technology strategies include the burrow ink test and the adhesive tape test.

\section*{Treatment}
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Recommended Regimens for Scabies } \\

\end{aligned}$$

Alternative Regimen
Lindane 1\% 1 oz of lotion or 30 g of cream applied in a thin layer to all areas of the body from the neck down and thoroughly washed off after 8 hours*
*Infants and children aged <10 years should not be treated with lindane.
Topical permethrin and oral and topical ivermectin have similar efficacy for cure of scabies (1405-1410). Choice of treatment might be based on patient preference for topical versus oral therapy, drug interactions with ivermectin (e.g., azithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [Bactrim], or cetirizine [Zytrec]), and cost. Permethrin is safe and effective with a single application (1411). Ivermectin has limited ovicidal activity and might not prevent recurrences of eggs at the time of treatment; therefore, a second dose of ivermectin should be administered 14 days after the first dose (1412). Ivermectin should be taken with food because bioavailability is increased, thereby increasing penetration of the drug into the epidermis. Adjustments to ivermectin dosing are not required for patients with renal impairment; however, the safety of multiple doses among patients with severe liver disease is unknown.
Lindane is an alternative regimen because it can cause toxicity (1413); it should be used only if the patient cannot tolerate the recommended therapies or if these therapies have failed (1414-1416). Lindane is not recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women, children aged $<10$ years, and persons with extensive dermatitis. Seizures have occurred when lindane was applied after a bath or used by patients who had extensive dermatitis. Aplastic anemia after lindane use also has been reported (1413). Lindane resistance has been reported in some areas of the world, including parts of the United States (1413).

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Bedding and clothing should be decontaminated (i.e., either machine washed and dried by using the heat cycle or dry cleaned) or removed from body contact for $>72$ hours. Fumigation of living areas is unnecessary. Persons with scabies should be advised to keep fingernails closely trimmed to reduce injury from excessive scratching (1417).

\section*{Crusted Scabies}

Crusted scabies is an aggressive infestation that usually occurs among immunodeficient, debilitated, or malnourished persons, including persons receiving systemic or potent topical glucocorticoids, organ transplant recipients, persons with HIV infection or human T -lymphotrophic virus-1 infection, and persons with hematologic malignancies. Crusted scabies is transmitted more easily than scabies (1418). No controlled therapeutic studies for crusted scabies have been conducted, and a recommended treatment remains unclear. Substantial treatment failure might occur with a single-dose topical scabicide or with oral ivermectin treatment. Combination treatment is recommended with a topical scabicide, either 5\% topical permethrin cream (full-body application to be repeated daily for 7 days then 2 times/week until cure) or $25 \%$ topical benzyl benzoate, and oral ivermectin $200 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight on days $1,2,8,9$, and 15 . Additional ivermectin treatment on days 22 and 29 might be required for severe cases (1419). Lindane should be avoided because of the risks for neurotoxicity with heavy applications on denuded skin.

\section*{Follow-Up}

The rash and pruritus of scabies might persist for $<2$ weeks after treatment. Symptoms or signs persisting for $>2$ weeks can be attributed to multiple factors. Treatment failure can occur as a result of resistance to medication or faulty application of topical scabicides. These medications do not easily penetrate into thick, scaly skin of persons with crusted scabies, perpetuating the harboring of mites in these difficult-to-penetrate layers. In the absence of recommended contact treatment and decontamination of bedding and clothing, persisting symptoms can be attributed to reinfection by family members or fomites. Finally, other household mites can cause symptoms to persist as a result of cross-reactivity between antigens. Even when treatment is successful, reinfection is avoided, and cross-reactivity does not occur, symptoms can persist or worsen as a result of allergic dermatitis.
Retreatment 2 weeks after the initial treatment regimen can be considered for those persons who are still symptomatic or when live mites are observed. Use of an alternative regimen is recommended for those persons who do not respond initially to the recommended treatment.

\section*{Management of Sex Partners and Household Contacts}

Persons who have had sexual, close personal, or household contact with the patient within the month preceding scabies infestation should be examined. Those identified as being infested should be provided treatment.

\section*{Management of Outbreaks in Communities, Nursing Homes, and Other Institutional Settings}

Scabies epidemics frequently occur in nursing homes, hospitals, residential facilities, and other communities (1420,1421). Control of an epidemic can only be achieved by treating the entire population at risk. Ivermectin can be considered in these settings, especially if treatment with topical scabicides fails. Mass treatment with oral ivermectin is highly effective in decreasing prevalence in settings where scabies is endemic (1422). Epidemics should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

\section*{Special Considerations}

\section*{Infants, Young Children, and Pregnant or Lactating Women}

Infants and young children should be treated with permethrin; the safety of ivermectin for children weighing $<15 \mathrm{~kg}$ has not been determined. Infants and children aged <10 years should not be treated with lindane. Ivermectin likely poses a low risk to pregnant women and is likely compatible with breastfeeding; however, because of limited data regarding ivermectin use for pregnant and lactating women, permethrin is the preferred treatment (431) (see Pediculosis Pubis).

\section*{HIV Infection}

Persons with HIV infection who have uncomplicated scabies should receive the same treatment regimens as those who do not have HIV. Persons with HIV infection and others who are immunosuppressed are at increased risk for crusted scabies and should be managed in consultation with a specialist.

\section*{Sexual Assault and Abuse and STIs}

\section*{Adolescents and Adults}

These guidelines are primarily limited to the identification, prophylaxis, and treatment of STIs and conditions among adolescent and adult female sexual assault survivors. However, some of the following guidelines might still apply to male sexual assault survivors. Documentation of findings, collection of nonmicrobiologic specimens for forensic purposes, and management of potential pregnancy or physical and
psychological trauma are beyond the scope of these guidelines. Examinations of survivors of sexual assault should be conducted by an experienced clinician in a way that minimizes further trauma to the person. The decision to obtain genital or other specimens for STI diagnosis should be made on an individual basis. Care systems for survivors should be designed to ensure continuity, including timely review of test results, support adherence, and monitoring for adverse reactions to any prescribed therapeutic or prophylactic regimens. Laws in all 50 states limit the evidentiary use of a survivor's previous sexual history, including evidence of previously acquired STIs, as part of an effort to undermine the credibility of the survivor's testimony. Evidentiary privilege against revealing any aspect of the examination or treatment also is enforced in most states. Although it rarely occurs, STI diagnoses might later be accessed, and the survivor and clinician might opt to defer testing for this reason. Although collection of specimens at initial examination for laboratory STI diagnosis gives the survivor and clinician the option of deferring empiric prophylactic antimicrobial treatment, compliance with follow-up visits is typically poor (1423-1425). Among sexually active adults, identification of an STI might represent an infection acquired before the assault, and therefore might be more important for the medical management of the patient than for legal purposes.

Trichomoniasis, BV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are the most frequently diagnosed infections among women who have been sexually assaulted. Such conditions are prevalent among the population, and detection of these infections after an assault does not necessarily imply acquisition during the assault. However, a postassault examination presents an important opportunity for identifying or preventing an STI. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections among women are of particular concern because of the possibility of ascending infection. In addition, HBV infection can be prevented through postexposure vaccination (see Hepatitis B Virus Infection). Because persons who have been sexually assaulted also are at risk for acquiring HPV infection, and the efficacy of the HPV vaccine is high (1426,1427), HPV vaccination is also recommended for females and males through age 26 years (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/ hpv.html) (11). Reproductive-aged female survivors should be evaluated for pregnancy and offered emergency contraception.

\section*{Evaluating Adolescents and Adults for STIs}

\section*{Initial Examination}

Decisions to perform the following tests should be made on an individual basis. An initial examination after a sexual assault might include the following:
- NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae at the sites of penetration or attempted penetration should be performed (553). These tests are preferred for diagnostic evaluation of adolescent or adult sexual assault survivors.
- Females should be offered NAAT testing for T. vaginalis from a urine or vaginal specimen. POC or wet mount with measurement of vaginal pH and KOH application for the whiff test from vaginal secretions should be performed for evidence of BV and candidiasis, especially if vaginal discharge, malodor, or itching is present.
- MSM should be offered screening for C. trachomatis and $N$. gonorrhoeae if they report receptive oral or anal sex during the preceding year, regardless of whether sexual contact occurred at these anatomic sites during the assault. Anoscopy should be considered in instances of reported anal penetration.
- A serum sample should be performed for HIV, HBV, and syphilis infection.

\section*{Treatment}

Compliance with follow-up visits is poor among survivors of sexual assault (1423-1425). Consequently, the following routine presumptive treatments after a sexual assault are recommended:
- An empiric antimicrobial regimen for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas for women and chlamydia and gonorrhea for men.
- Emergency contraception should be considered when the assault could result in pregnancy (see Emergency Contraception).
- Postexposure hepatitis B vaccination (without HBIG) if the hepatitis status of the assailant is unknown and the survivor has not been previously vaccinated. If the assailant is known to be HBsAg positive, unvaccinated survivors should receive both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. The vaccine and HBIG, if indicated, should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses of vaccine should be administered 1-2 and 4-6 months after the first dose. Survivors who were previously vaccinated but did not receive postvaccination testing should receive a single vaccine booster dose (see Hepatitis B Virus Infection).
- HPV vaccination for female and male survivors aged 9-26 years who have not been vaccinated or are incompletely vaccinated (11) (https://www.cdc.gov/ vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html). The vaccine should be administered to sexual assault survivors at the time of the initial examination, and follow-up doses should be administered at $1-2$ months and 6 months after the first dose. A 2-dose schedule ( 0 and 6-12 months) is
recommended for persons initiating vaccination before age 15 years.
- Recommendations for HIV PEP are made on a case-bycase basis according to risk (see Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection; Recommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk Assessment of Adolescents and Adults <72 Hours After Sexual Assault).

\begin{table}

* For persons weighing $\geq 150 \mathrm{~kg}, 1 \mathrm{~g}$ of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Clinicians should counsel persons regarding the possible benefits and toxicities associated with these treatment regimens; gastrointestinal side effects can occur with this combination. The efficacy of these regimens in preventing infections after sexual assault has not been evaluated. For those requiring alternative treatments, refer to the specific sections in this report relevant to the specific organisms.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

At the initial examination and, if indicated, at follow-up examinations, patients should be counseled regarding symptoms of STIs and the need for immediate examination if symptoms occur. Further, they should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until STI prophylactic treatment is completed.

\section*{Follow-Up}

After the initial postassault examination, follow-up examinations provide an opportunity to detect new infections acquired during or after the assault, complete hepatitis B and HPV vaccinations, if indicated, complete counseling and treatment for other STIs, and monitor side effects and adherence to PEP, if prescribed. If initial testing was performed, follow-up evaluation should be conducted in $<1$ week to ensure that results of positive tests can be discussed promptly with the survivor, treatment is provided if not administered at the initial visit, and any follow-up for infections can be arranged. If initial tests are negative and treatment was not provided,
examination for STIs can be repeated 1-2 weeks after the assault; repeat testing detects infectious organisms that might not have reached sufficient concentrations to produce positive test results at the time of initial examination. For survivors who are treated during the initial visit, regardless of whether testing was performed, posttreatment testing should be conducted only if the person reports having symptoms. If initial test results were negative and infection in the assailant cannot be ruled out, serologic tests for syphilis can be repeated at 4-6 weeks and 3 months; HIV testing can be repeated at 6 weeks and at 3 months by using methods to identify acute HIV infection.

\section*{Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection}

HIV seroconversion has occurred among persons whose only known risk factor was sexual assault or sexual abuse; however, the frequency of this occurrence likely is low (1428,1429). In consensual sex, the per-act risk for HIV transmission from vaginal intercourse is $0.08 \%$, and for receptive anal intercourse, $1.38 \%$ (192). The per-act risk for HIV transmission from oral sex is substantially lower. Specific circumstances of an assault (e.g., bleeding, which often accompanies trauma) might increase risk for HIV transmission in cases involving vaginal, anal, or oral penetration. Site of exposure to ejaculate, viral load in ejaculate, and the presence of an STI or genital lesions in the assailant or survivor also might increase risk for HIV acquisition.

PEP with a 28-day course of zidovudine was associated with an $81 \%$ reduction in risk for acquiring HIV in a study of health care workers who had percutaneous exposures to HIV-infected blood (1430). On the basis of these results and results from animal studies, PEP has been recommended for health care workers who have occupational exposures to HIV (1431). These findings have been extrapolated to nonoccupational injecting drug and sexual HIV exposures, including sexual assault. The possibility of HIV exposure from the assault should be assessed at the initial examination; survivors determined to be at risk for acquiring HIV should be informed about the possible benefit of PEP in preventing HIV infection. Initiation of PEP as soon as possible after the exposure increases the likelihood of prophylactic benefit.

Multiple factors affect the medical recommendation for PEP and affect the assault survivor's acceptance of that recommendation. These factors include the likelihood of the assailant having HIV, any exposure characteristics that might increase the risk for HIV transmission, the time elapsed after the event, and the potential benefits and risks associated with PEP (1431). Determination of the assailant's HIV status at the time of the postassault examination is usually not possible. Therefore, health care providers should assess any available information concerning the characteristics and

HIV risk behaviors of the assailant (e.g., being an MSM or using injecting drugs), local epidemiology of HIV/AIDS, and exposure characteristics of the assault. When an assailant's HIV status is unknown, determinations about risk for HIV transmission to the survivor should be based on whether vaginal or anal penetration occurred; whether ejaculation occurred on mucous membranes; whether multiple assailants were involved; whether mucosal lesions were present in the assailant or survivor; and any other characteristics of the assault, survivor, or assailant that might increase risk for HIV transmission.

If PEP is offered, the following information should be discussed with the survivor: the necessity of early initiation of PEP to optimize potential benefits (i.e., as soon as possible after and <72 hours after the assault), the importance of close follow-up, the benefit of adherence to recommended dosing, and potential adverse effects of antiretroviral medications. Providers should emphasize that severe adverse effects are rare from PEP (1431-1435). Clinical management of the survivor should be implemented according to the HIV PEP guidelines and in collaboration with specialists (1436). Health care providers should provide an initial course of $3-7$ days of medication (i.e., a starter pack) with a prescription for the remainder of the course, or, if starter packs are unavailable, they should provide a prescription for an entire 28 -day course. Provision of the entire 28-day PEP medication supply at the initial visit has been reported to increase likelihood of adherence, especially when patients have difficulty returning for multiple follow-up visits (1437). Routinely providing starter packs or the entire 28-day course requires that health care providers stock PEP drugs in their practice setting or have an established agreement with a pharmacy to stock, package, and urgently dispense PEP drugs with required administration instructions. Uninsured patients or those with high copayments can be enrolled in a patient-assistance program to ensure access to PEP medications. An early follow-up visit should be scheduled at which health care providers can discuss the results of HIV and STI testing, provide additional counseling and support, provide indicated vaccines not administered at the initial evaluation, assess medication side effects and adherence, or provide an altered PEP medication regimen if indicated by side effects or laboratory test results.

\section*{Recommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk Assessment of Adolescents and Adults <72 Hours After Sexual Assault}

Health care providers should do the following:
- Assess risk for HIV infection in the assailant, and test that person for HIV whenever possible.
- Use the algorithm to evaluate the survivor for the need for HIV PEP (Figure) (1436).

Abbreviation: PEP = postexposure prophylaxis.
- Consult with a specialist in HIV treatment if PEP is being considered.
- If the survivor appears to be at risk for acquiring HIV from the assault, discuss PEP, including benefits and risks.
- If the survivor chooses to start PEP, provide an initial course of 3-7 days of medication (i.e., a starter pack) with a prescription for the remainder of the course or provide a prescription for an entire 28 -day course. Schedule an early follow-up visit to discuss test results and provide additional counseling (1438).
- If PEP is started, obtain serum creatinine, AST, and alanine aminotransferase at baseline.
- Perform an HIV antibody test at original assessment; repeat at 6 weeks and 3 months.
- Counsel the survivor regarding ongoing risk for HIV acquisition and about HIV PrEP, and provide referrals to a PrEP provider.
Assistance with PEP-related decisions can be obtained by calling the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline (PEP Line) (telephone: 888-448-4911).

\section*{Sexual Assault or Abuse of Children}

These guidelines are limited to the identification and treatment of STIs in prepubertal children. Management of the psychosocial or legal aspects of the sexual assault or abuse of children is beyond the scope of these guidelines.
Identification of STIs in children past the neonatal period strongly indicates sexual abuse (1438). The importance of
identifying a sexually transmitted organism for such children as evidence of possible child sexual abuse varies by pathogen. Postnatally acquired gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and T. vaginalis infection and nontransfusion, nonperinatally acquired HIV infection are indicative of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse should be suspected when anogenital herpes or anogenital warts are diagnosed. Investigation of sexual abuse among children who have an infection that might have been transmitted sexually should be conducted in compliance with recommendations by clinicians who have experience and training in all elements of the evaluation of child abuse, neglect, and assault. The social significance of an infection that might have been acquired sexually varies by the specific organism, as does the threshold for reporting suspected child sexual abuse (Table 8). When any STI has been diagnosed in a child, efforts should be made in consultation with a specialist to evaluate the possibility of sexual abuse, including conducting a history and physical examination for evidence of abuse and diagnostic testing for other commonly occurring STIs (1439-1441).

The general rule that STIs beyond the neonatal period are evidence of sexual abuse has exceptions. For example, genital infection with T. vaginalis (1442) or rectal or genital infection with C. trachomatis among young children might be the result of perinatally acquired infection and has, in certain cases of chlamydial infection, persisted for as long as $2-3$ years (1443-1445), although perinatal chlamydial infection is now uncommon because of prenatal screening and treatment of pregnant women. Genital warts have been diagnosed among children who have been sexually abused (1426) but also among children who have no other evidence of sexual abuse (1446,1447); lesions appearing for the first time in a child aged $>5$ years are more likely to have been caused by sexual transmission (1448). BV has been diagnosed among children
who have been abused but its presence alone does not prove sexual abuse. The majority of HBV infections among children result from household exposure to persons who have chronic HBV infection rather than sexual abuse.

\section*{Reporting}

All U.S. states and territories have laws that require reporting of child abuse. Although the exact requirements differ by state or territory, if a health care provider has reasonable cause to suspect child abuse, a report must be made (1448). Health care providers should contact their state or local child protection service agency regarding child abuse reporting requirements.

\section*{Evaluating Children for STIs}

Evaluating children for sexual assault or abuse should be conducted in a manner designed to minimize pain and trauma to the child. Examinations and collection of vaginal specimens in prepubertal girls can be extremely uncomfortable and should be performed by an experienced clinician to avoid psychological and physical trauma to the child. The decision to obtain genital or other specimens from a child to evaluate for STIs should be made on an individual basis. However, children who received a diagnosis of one STI should be screened for other STIs. History and reported type of sexual contact might not be a reliable indicator, and urogenital, pharyngeal, and rectal testing should be considered for preverbal children and children who cannot verbalize details of the assault (1438,1449). Factors that should lead the physician to consider testing for STIs include the following (1449):
- The child has experienced penetration or has evidence of recent or healed penetrative injury to the genitals, anus, or oropharynx.
- The child has been abused by a stranger.

** Report if evidence exists to suspect abuse, including history, physical examination, or other identified infections. Lesions appearing for the first time in a child aged $>5$ years are more likely to have been caused by sexual transmission.
- The child has been abused by an assailant known to be infected with an STI or at high risk for STIs (e.g., injecting drug user, MSM, person with multiple sex partners, or person with a history of STIs).
- The child has a sibling, other relative, or another person in the household with an STI.
- The child lives in an area with a high rate of STIs in the community.
- The child has signs or symptoms of STIs (e.g., vaginal discharge or pain, genital itching or odor, urinary symptoms, or genital lesions or ulcers).
- The child or parent requests STI testing.
- The child is unable to verbalize details of the assault.

If a child has symptoms, signs, or evidence of an infection that might be sexually transmitted, the child should be tested for common STIs before initiation of any treatment that might interfere with diagnosing other STIs. Because of the legal and psychosocial consequences of a false-positive diagnosis, only tests with high specificities should be used. The potential benefit to the child of a reliable STI diagnosis justifies deferring presumptive treatment until specimens for highly specific tests are obtained by providers with experience in evaluating sexually abused and assaulted children.
Evaluations should be performed on a case-by-case basis, according to history of assault or abuse and in a manner that minimizes the possibility for psychological trauma and social stigma. If the initial exposure was recent, the infectious organisms acquired through the exposure might not have produced sufficient concentrations to result in positive test results or examination findings (1450). Alternatively, positive test results after a recent exposure might represent the assailant's secretions (but would nonetheless be an indication for treatment of the child). A second visit approximately $2-6$ weeks after the most recent sexual exposure should be scheduled to include a repeat physical examination and collection of additional specimens to identify any infection that might not have been detected at the time of initial evaluation. A single evaluation might be sufficient if the child was abused for an extended period and if a substantial amount of time elapsed between the last suspected episode of abuse and the medical evaluation. Compliance with follow-up appointments might be improved when law enforcement personnel or child protective services are involved.

\section*{Initial Examination}

Visual inspection of the genital, perianal, and oral areas for genital discharge, odor, bleeding, irritation, warts, and ulcerative lesions should be performed during initial examination. The clinical manifestations of certain STIs are different for children than for adults. For example, typical
vesicular lesions might be absent even in the presence of HSV infection. The following should be performed during the initial examination, if STI testing is indicated:
- Testing for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis can be performed from specimens collected from the pharynx and rectum, as well as the vagina for girls and urine for boys. Cervical specimens are not recommended for prepubertal girls. For boys with a urethral discharge, a meatal specimen discharge is an adequate substitute for an intraurethral swab specimen. Culture or NAAT can be used to test for N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis. Although data regarding NAAT for children are more limited and performance is test dependent (553), no evidence demonstrates that performance of NAAT for detection of N. gonorrhoea or C. trachomatis among children differs from that among adults. Only FDA-cleared NAAT assays should be used. Consultation with an expert is necessary before using NAAT in this context, both to minimize the possibility of cross-reaction with nongonococcal Neisseria species and other commensals (e.g., N. meningitidis, N. sicca, N. lactamica, N. cinerea, or M. catarrhalis) and to ensure correct interpretation of results. Because of the implications of a diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis infection in a child, only CLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAATs should be used (837). If culture for the isolation of N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis is performed, only standard culture procedures should be followed. Specimens from the vagina, urethra, pharynx, or rectum should be streaked onto selective media for isolation of N. gonorrhoeae, and all presumptive isolates of $N$. gonorrhoeae should be identified definitively by at least two tests that involve different approaches (e.g., biochemical, enzyme substrate, or molecular probes). Gram stains are inadequate for evaluating prepubertal children for gonorrhea and should not be used to diagnose or exclude gonorrhea. Specimens (either NAAT or culture, including any isolates) obtained before treatment should be preserved for further validation if needed. When a specimen is positive, the result should be confirmed either by retesting the original specimen or obtaining another. Because of the overall low prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis among children, false-positive results can occur, and all specimens that are initially positive should be confirmed.
- Testing for T. vaginalis should not be limited to girls with vaginal discharge if other indications for vaginal testing exist because evidence indicates that asymptomatic sexually abused children might be infected with T. vaginalis and might benefit from treatment $(1451,1452)$. NAAT can be used as an alternative or in addition to culture and wet
mount, especially in settings where culture and wet mount of vaginal swab specimens are not obtainable. Data regarding use of NAATs for detection of T. vaginalis among children are limited; however, no evidence indicates that performance of NAAT for detection of T. vaginalis for children would differ from that for adults. Consultation with an expert is necessary before using NAAT in this context to ensure correct interpretation of results. Because of the implications of a diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection in a child, only CLIA-validated, FDA-cleared NAATs should be used (837). POC tests for T. vaginalis have not been validated for prepubertal children and should not be used. In the case of a positive specimen, the result should be confirmed either by retesting the original specimen or obtaining another. Because of the overall low prevalence of T. vaginalis among children, false-positive results can occur, and all specimens that are initially positive should be confirmed.
- HSV can be indicative of sexual abuse; therefore, specimens should be obtained from all vesicular or ulcerative genital or perianal lesions and sent for NAAT or viral culture.
- Wet mount can be used for a vaginal swab specimen for BV if discharge is present.
- Collection of serum samples should be evaluated, preserved for subsequent analysis, and used as a baseline for comparison with follow-up serologic tests. Sera can be tested for antibodies to T. pallidum, HIV, and HBV. Decisions regarding the infectious agents for which to perform serologic tests should be made on a case-by-case basis.

\section*{Treatment}

The risk for a child acquiring an STI as a result of sexual abuse or assault has not been well studied. Presumptive treatment for children who have been sexually assaulted or abused is not recommended because the incidence of most STIs among children is low after abuse or assault, prepubertal girls appear to be at lower risk for ascending infection than adolescent or adult women, and regular follow-up of children usually can be ensured. However, certain children or their parent or guardian might be concerned about the possibility of infection with an STI, even if the health care provider has perceived the risk to be low. Such concerns might be an indication for presumptive treatment in certain settings and might be considered after all relevant specimens for diagnostic tests have been collected.

\section*{Other Management Considerations}

Children who are survivors of sexual assault or abuse are at increased risk for future unsafe sexual practices that have been
linked to higher risk for HPV acquisition $(1426,1453)$ and are more likely to engage in these behaviors at an earlier age; therefore, ACIP recommends vaccination of these children at age $\geq 9$ years if they have not initiated or completed HPV vaccination (see Human Papillomavirus Infections, Prevention) (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/ hpv.html). Although HPV vaccine will not protect against progression of infection already acquired or promote clearance of the infection, the vaccine protects against HPV types not yet acquired.

\section*{Follow-Up}

If no infections were identified at the initial examination after the last suspected sexual exposure, and if this exposure was recent, a follow-up evaluation approximately 2 weeks after the last exposure can be considered. Likewise, if no physical examination or diagnostic testing was performed at the initial visit, a complete examination can be scheduled approximately 2 weeks after the last exposure to identify any evidence of STIs. In circumstances in which transmission of syphilis, HIV, HBV, or HPV is a concern but baseline tests for syphilis, HIV, and HBV are negative and examinations for genital warts are negative, follow-up serologic testing and examination approximately 6 weeks and $<3$ months after the last suspected sexual exposure is recommended to allow time for antibodies to develop and signs of infection to appear. In addition, results of HBsAg testing should be interpreted carefully because HBV can be transmitted nonsexually. Decisions regarding which tests should be performed should be made on a case-by-case basis.

\section*{Risk for Acquiring HIV Infection}

HIV has been reported among children for whom sexual abuse was the only known risk factor. Serologic testing for HIV should be considered for sexually abused children. The decision to test for HIV should involve the family, if possible, and be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the likelihood of infection in the assailant (1448,1454). Although data are insufficient concerning the efficacy of PEP among children, treatment is well tolerated by infants and children with and without HIV, and children have a minimal risk for serious adverse reactions because of the short period recommended for prophylaxis (1455).

\section*{Recommendations for Postexposure HIV Risk Assessment of Children <72 Hours After Sexual Assault}

Providers should do the following:
- Review local HIV epidemiology, assess risk for HIV in the assailant, and test for HIV.
- Evaluate the circumstances of the assault or abuse that might affect risk for HIV transmission.
- Perform HIV antigen or antibody testing (or antibody testing, if antigen or antibody testing is unavailable) during the original assessment and again at follow-up visits, in accordance with CDC guidelines (https://stacks.cdc.gov/ view/cdc/38856). In considering whether to offer PEP, health care providers should consider whether the child can be treated soon after the sexual exposure (i.e., $<72$ hours), the likelihood that the assailant has HIV infection, and the likelihood of high compliance with the prophylactic regimen (1436). Potential benefit of treating a sexually abused child should be weighed against the risk for adverse reactions.
- Consult with a provider specializing in evaluating or treating children with HIV infection to determine ageappropriate dosing and regimens and baseline laboratory testing, if PEP is being considered.
- Discuss PEP with the caregivers, including its toxicity, unknown efficacy, and possible benefits, for children determined to be at risk for HIV transmission from the assault or abuse.
- Provided adequate doses of medication, if PEP is begun, to last until the follow-up visit 3-7 days after the initial assessment, at which time the child should be reevaluated and tolerance of medication assessed (139).

PREFACE

Male circumcision has been performed on boys and young men for many years, primarily for religious and cultural reasons or as a rite of passage to mark the transition to adulthood. Data from cross-sectional epidemiological studies conducted since the mid-1980s showed that circumcised men have a lower prevalence of HIV infection than uncircumcised men. This finding was supported by data from prospective studies that showed a lower incidence of HIV infection in circumcised men than in uncircumcised men. Although the analysis adjusted for cultural and social factors associated with male circumcision, it was not clear from these studies whether promoting male circumcision among men who would not otherwise be circumcised would result in a lower incidence of HIV infection. To address this question, three randomized controlled trials were launched in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa in 2004. The results from the South African study were published in late 2005, and showed a 60\% lower incidence of HIV infection among men randomly assigned to undergo immediate circumcision compared with those assigned to delayed circumcision. Confirmatory results from the two other trials were released in December 2006. These data led WHO and UNAIDS to recommend in 2007 that male circumcision should be considered an additional way of reducing risk of HIV infection in men and programmes for safe male circumcision should be expanded rapidly in countries and settings with generalized HIV epidemics and low prevalence of circumcision.
\end{abstract}

There is increased demand for male circumcision in several countries with a high incidence of HIV, but there is little technical guidance on how services can be safely expanded given the limited resources available. Reports of high complication rates following circumcisions performed on young men by traditional circumcisers in southern and eastern Africa are common, but the true incidence is not known. Technical guidance on the provision of safe male circumcision services is therefore necessary. Although circumcisions are widely performed by surgeons and general practitioners in an appropriate clinical environment, resources are not currently adequate to meet the anticipated increased demand.

This technical manual on male circumcision is aimed at providers of male circumcision services and programme managers. No attempt is made to describe all possible methods for male circumcision. The methods covered have been selected on the basis of their safety and practicality for use in resource-limited settings. The manual forms part of a comprehensive package, which includes training guides and materials, as well as a male circumcision quality improvement framework for use by providers, programme managers and national medical authorities to ensure high-quality services. While providing detailed technical information on the different surgical approaches, the manual also addresses broader issues of sexual and reproductive health of men, and emphasizes that male circumcision must be set within the context of other strategies for reducing risk of HIV infection. A full description of best practices for surgery and anaesthesia in resource-limited settings can be found in the WHO publication, Surgical care at the district hospital (Geneva, WHO, 2003).

The manual has been developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), in collaboration with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and Jhpiego, as part of work to support countries in providing safe male circumcision services, and ensuring that circumcised men do not perceive themselves as fully protected against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and consequently forgo other HIV risk-reduction strategies.

The manual was developed from reproductive health and surgery training materials, as well as on the basis of experience with service provision in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean,
and developed countries. The manual and materials were reviewed by actual and potential providers of male circumcision services representing a range of health care and cultural settings where demand for male circumcision services is high.

This manual is one of several documents and guidelines developed by WHO, UNAIDS and partners to assist countries develop and implement programmes for safe medical male circumcision for HIV prevention within the context of their existing HIV prevention activities, and sexual and reproductive health programmes. All documents can be downloaded from the Clearinghouse on Male Circumcision for HIV Prevention (www.malecircumcision.org), a web site created to share technical and policy guidance, knowledge, tools and experience relevant to implementing male circumcision programmes. The most relevant documents include:

New data on male circumcision and HIV prevention: Policy and programme implications - provides guidance to policy makers and programme managers on issues that need to be considered and addressed when planning for programme scale-up.

Operational guidance for scaling up male circumcision services for HIV prevention. This document provides operational and programmatic guidance to decision-makers, programme managers and technical support agencies on scaling up programmes in the public and private sectors.

Male Circumcision Quality Assurance: A Guide to Enhancing the Safety and Quality of Services - outlines the roles and responsibilities of national and district programme managers for implementing safe quality male circumcision services and provides guidance for the planning of a national quality assurance programme. It defines ten quality standards against which the quality of services can be measured and used as part of a continuous process of service improvement. The guide is supplemented by the Male circumcision services quality assessment toolkit which is used by facility managers and providers to assess their own performance. It can be used by national and district managers to conduct external assessments of facilities. The toolkit includes a scoring tool, into which users can enter assessment findings and monitor progress towards meeting the standards.

Considerations for implementing models for optimizing the volume and efficiency of male circumcision services for HIV prevention. This document provides guidance to help programmes improve the efficiency of clinical and surgical activities so that they can strengthen their capacity to meet demand for male circumcision services. It addresses clinical techniques, staffing, facility space, client scheduling and flow, commodities management, cost efficiencies, and quality assurance. It also includes detailed model lists of equipment and supplies required to support a male circumcision programme.

A guide to indicators for male circumcision programmes in the formal health care system lists indicators that programmes can use to monitor and evaluate progress towards their programme objectives. Adaptable to different country situations, the guide includes indicators of demand for, and supply of, male circumcision services, as well as measures to assess secondary effects of the programme, such as changes in sexual behaviours at the individual and community levels.

\section*{Benefits and risks of male circumcision}

\section*{Summary}
- Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, the fold of skin that covers the head of the penis (glans).
- The benefits of male circumcision include a reduced risk of urinary tract infections in childhood, a reduced risk of ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases in adulthood, protection against penile cancer, a reduced risk of cervical cancer in female sex partners, and prevention of balanitis (inflammation of the glans), posthitis (inflammation of the foreskin), phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (inability to return the retracted foreskin to its original location).
- Complication rates following male circumcision are very low when it is performed by well equipped and trained health care providers.
- Numerous regional and global studies since the 1980 s have noted a lower risk of HIV infection in circumcised men, as well as lower HIV prevalence in populations where male circumcision is common.
- Randomized controlled trials in Kenya, South Africa and Uganda have demonstrated that male circumcision reduces the individual man's risk of acquiring HIV infection by 60\%.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

\section*{What is male circumcision?}

Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, the fold of skin that covers the head of the penis. It is widely practised for religious and traditional reasons, often within the first two weeks after birth, or at the beginning of adolescence as a rite of passage into adulthood. It may also be performed for medical reasons to treat problems involving the foreskin.

\section*{How circumcision is performed}

During a circumcision, the foreskin is freed from the head of the penis (glans) and removed. When done in a newborn baby, the procedure is simpler and quicker than in adolescents and adults. Superficial wound healing after circumcision in adults generally takes 5-7 days. However, about 4-6 weeks are needed for the wound to heal fully. In babies and young boys, the healing time is considerably shorter.

\section*{BENEFITS AND RISKS}

Whether or not circumcision is necessary has been a subject of heated debate in many countries. In some settings, circumcision is
widely performed for religious or cultural reasons, while in others it is performed principally on medical grounds. In order to make an informed decision, every potential client or parent is entitled to full information about the benefits and risks of the procedure.

The decision of an adult or young man to be circumcised, and the decision of a parent to have his or her son circumcised, should be based on culture, religion, personal preference, and evidence-based information provided by a health care worker.

\section*{Benefits}

If circumcision is being done for reasons other than the treatment of a specific medical problem, the health benefits are primarily preventive, and may only be realized long after the procedure. Circumcision may reduce the risk of acquiring some infections and related complications, but does not guarantee complete protection. Some of these conditions are common, while others are less so, and the degree of risk of the individual is likely to depend on his behaviour and where he lives. Although the strength of the evidence varies by disease, the benefits of circumcision include the following:
- It is easier to keep the penis clean.
- There is a reduced risk of urinary tract infections in childhood. ${ }^{1}$
- Circumcision prevents inflammation of the glans (balanitis) and the foreskin (posthitis).
- Circumcision prevents the potential development of scar tissue on the foreskin, which may lead to phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (swelling of the retracted foreskin resulting in inability to return the foreskin to its normal position).
- There is a reduced risk of some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially ulcerative diseases, such as chancroid and syphilis. ${ }^{2,3}$
- There is a reduced risk of becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- There is a reduced risk of penile cancer. ${ }^{9,10}$
- There is a reduced risk of cancer of the cervix in female sex partners. ${ }^{11}$

\section*{Risks}

As for any surgical procedure, there are risks associated with circumcision. While the benefits of circumcision may be wide-ranging and long-term, any problems generally occur during or soon after the procedure. They include:
- pain;
- bleeding;
- haematoma (formation of a blood clot under the skin);
- infection at the site of the circumcision;
- increased sensitivity of the glans penis for the first few months after the procedure;
- irritation of the glans;
- meatitis (inflammation of the opening of the urethra);
- injury to the penis;
- adverse reaction to the anaesthetic used during the circumcision.

These complications are rare when circumcision is performed by well trained, adequately equipped, experienced health care personnel, and are usually easily and rapidly resolved. Data from controlled trials show that fewer than 1 in 50 procedures result in complications. ${ }^{4,6}$

\section*{MALE CIRCUMCISION AND HIV INFECTION}

There is currently great interest in the role of male circumcision in preventing HIV infection. Research studies have shown a lower risk of infection in circumcised compared with uncircumcised men, as well as a lower prevalence of HIV infection in populations where male circumcision is common. These data led WHO and UNAIDS to recommend that male circumcision be promoted as an additional method of HIV prevention and that countries or settings with generalized HIV epidemics and low prevalence of circumcision should urgently scale up circumcision services. ${ }^{12}$

\section*{The evidence linking male circumcision and HIV}

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 published studies found that uncircumcised men are 2-3 times more likely to be infected with HIV than circumcised men, with the difference being most pronounced in men with high exposure to HIV infection. ${ }^{5}$ A sub-analysis of 10 African studies, involving men considered to be at high risk of becoming infected, found a 3.4 times higher incidence of HIV infection among those who had not been circumcised. ${ }^{5}$ In a prospective study in Uganda of HIV-negative men whose partners were HIV-positive, none of 50 circumcised men became infected within two years, compared with 40 of 137 uncircumcised men. ${ }^{13}$

\section*{Male circumcision and regional differences in HIV prevalence}

The geographical regions in sub-Saharan Africa where men are more commonly circumcised overlap with areas of lower HIV prevalence. An extensive study by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) investigated behavioural and other factors that could account for the large disparities in HIV prevalence across different African regions. ${ }^{14}$ A low prevalence of male circumcision and a high prevalence of genital herpes (which is more common in uncircumcised men) emerged as the principal determinants of the differences in HIV rates.

Table 1.1 shows the prevalence of HIV infection in a number of countries with low or high rates of male circumcision. Countries in subSaharan Africa where male circumcision is common ( $>80 \%$ ) generally have HIV prevalence levels well below those of countries where circumcision is less common (<20\%), despite the presence of other risk factors for heterosexual HIV transmission, such as high frequency of multiple sexual partners, low rates of condom use and high prevalence of other STIs. HIV prevalence in the countries of south and south-east Asia where nearly all men are circumcised (Bangladesh,

Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines) remains extremely low, despite patterns of risk factors for HIV and other STIs similar to those found elsewhere in the region.

A study in India followed 2298 men attending three STI clinics. ${ }^{17}$ A significantly lower incidence of HIV infection was observed among the circumcised men, although rates of STIs, such as syphilis and gonorrhoea, were similar. The similar incidence of STIs in the two groups indicates similar sexual risk behaviour, and suggests a biological rather than a behavioural explanation for the observed lower rate of HIV. However, it is important to note that, of the 191 circumcised men, $62 \%$ were Muslim. When non-Muslim men were assessed separately, the circumcised group was small and no significant protective effect was found. This illustrates the difficulty of separating the effect of male circumcision from that of other cultural factors. Only randomized controlled trials can determine the efficacy of male circumcision in reducing the risk of HIV infection.

\section*{Randomized controlled trials to assess the efficacy of male circumcision in reducing risk of HIV infection}

In July 2005 the results of the Orange Farm Intervention Trial in South Africa were made public; they were subsequently published in November 2005. ${ }^{6}$ This was the first report from a randomized controlled trial of male circumcision as a means to prevent HIV infection. A total of 3274 uninfected men, aged 18-24 years, were randomly assigned to undergo circumcision either immediately or after 21 months. The incidence of HIV infection was found to be $60 \%$ lower among those who were circumcised. On the strength of these results, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended that the men initially assigned to the delayed circumcision group should be offered the procedure without further delay, without waiting the full 21 months.

Two further trials on male circumcision and HIV infection were stopped in December 2006 and published in early 2007. Both trials involved random allocation of HIV-negative volunteers to either immediate circumcision, performed by trained medical professionals in a clinic setting (intervention group), or circumcision delayed for 2 years (control group). The first trial, in Kisumu, western Kenya, was conducted among men aged 18-24 years, and showed a $53 \%$ reduction in HIV incidence. ${ }^{7}$ The second study was conducted in Rakai, Uganda, among men aged 15-49 years, and showed a 51\% reduction in HIV incidence. ${ }^{8}$ Following release of the study results, circumcision was offered without further delay to the men in both nonintervention groups.

\section*{Possible biological explanations for the protective effect of male circumcision}

The primary cells through which HIV enters the body are Langerhans cells. These cells are present in high density in the epithelium of the inner foreskin, and are close to the surface because the layer of keratin is thin. ${ }^{18,19}$

In an in vitro study, viral uptake by cells from the mucosal surface of foreskin was 7 times more efficient than that by tissue from the female cervix. ${ }^{20}$ The inner mucosal surface of the foreskin lacks the thick layer of keratin that covers most exposed skin. This leaves numerous mucosal Langerhans cells and other immune cell targets easily accessible to HIV infection. ${ }^{21}$

The highly vascularized foreskin mucosa, and in particular the frenulum, is prone to tearing and bleeding during intercourse. These micro-injuries allow easy access of HIV to the bloodstream.

A further factor that may facilitate entry of the virus is the presence of an ulcerative STI, such as herpes simplex, chancroid or syphilis, which tend to be more common in uncircumcised men. ${ }^{5}$

\section*{Protection for women}

A study in Uganda observed lower rates of male-to-female transmission of HIV if the man was circumcised. ${ }^{13}$ Among 47 couples in which the circumcised male partner was infected with HIV and whose viral load was below 50000 copies per ml, none of the female partners became infected in two years. By contrast, 26 of the 147 women whose HIV-infected partners were not circumcised became infected.

A subsequent randomized controlled trial of circumcision among men with HIV infection did not confirm this result. It showed there might be a higher risk of HIV transmission to women in the first two years after the operation. ${ }^{22}$

A further observational study has shown a $40 \%$ lower risk of HIV infection in couples where the male partner was infected and the female partner not infected with HIV, but the reduction in risk was not significant. ${ }^{23}$

\section*{Other health benefits of circumcision}

A multicountry study ${ }^{24}$ found a lower prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in circumcised men than in uncircumcised men. HPV infection is a necessary causal factor for cervical cancer and is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the vulva, vagina and anus in women, and of the penis and anus in men. Prospective studies have shown that circumcised men are less likely to have HPV infection. ${ }^{25,26,27}$

The incidence of invasive penile cancer is significantly lower in circumcised men than in uncircumcised men, though this condition is extremely rare. ${ }^{28,10}$

\section*{Acceptability of circumcision among African men}

Surveys and qualitative studies among young as well as older men in six African countries have found that a considerable proportion expressed interest in circumcision, ranging from $45 \%$ in Harare, Zimbabwe, to over $80 \%$ in a large survey in Botswana. ${ }^{29}$ These studies indicate that many men would willingly undergo circumcision if it could be performed safely and at reasonable cost.

In the surveys, the men reported that their main interest in circumcision was related to hygiene, infection control and, for some, a belief that condom use is easier for men who are circumcised.

\section*{Chapter 2}

\section*{Linking male circumcision to other male sexual and reproductive health services}

\section*{Summary}
- Men have different sexual and reproductive health needs at different ages.
- Male circumcision reduces the risk of acquiring HIV infection by $50-60 \%$, but does not guarantee complete protection. In addition, it may provide some protection against other sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis and herpes, but offers little or no protection against gonorrhoea and chlamydia.
- Male circumcision does not prevent unwanted pregnancy. Comprehensive education and information programmes, and the provision of services for contraception and STI prevention and management, are needed to address male sexual and reproductive health needs.
- WHO and UNAIDS recommend HIV testing and counselling for all patients who have signs and symptoms of HIV infection. In certain epidemic situations, they recommend routinely offering an HIV test at every contact with health services.
- WHO and UNAIDS recommend that all men who request circumcision to reduce their risk of HIV infection should be offered an HIV test.
- The core goals for male sexual and reproductive health services include promoting responsible male sexual behaviour and encouraging men to support their female partners and children in meeting their sexual and reproductive health needs.
- Sexual and reproductive health education and services are important for men and adolescents, as well as for women. A wide range of people and organizations can provide information and services, including parents, teachers, nongovernmental organizations, churches and youth groups, as well as health care providers in outpatient, family planning, STI, and HIV clinics. Every opportunity to provide education and services should be taken.
- Male circumcision services for older boys and young men offer an opportunity to provide sexual and reproductive health education and counselling to these key groups.

\section*{MEN'S SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NEEDS AND SERVICES}

For many men, accessing circumcision services may be their first contact with health services. This contact offers an opportunity to address other aspects of men's sexual and reproductive health.

As noted in Chapter 1, male circumcision does not provide full protection against HIV, but appears to reduce the risk of infection by $50-60 \%$. It gives little or no protection against STIs that affect the urethra, such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. It provides no protection against acquisition of HIV infection from unsafe injections, from infected blood products, or through receptive anal intercourse. It also does not prevent pregnancy.

To reduce the risk of STIs, including HIV, and unwanted pregnancy, comprehensive education and information programmes are needed, as well as services for contraception and STI prevention and management. A possible consequence of promoting male circumcision for HIV prevention is that circumcised men may perceive themselves as immune, and subsequently increase their exposure to HIV, ignoring other important strategies to reduce risk. These strategies include delaying the onset of sexual activity, reducing the number of sexual partners, and using condoms correctly and consistently every time they have sex.

In many societies where male circumcision is performed at the beginning of adolescence, as a rite of passage to adulthood, the circumcision festival period is used also to educate young men about various health and social issues. These cultural traditions can be harmonized with modern clinical practice, to ensure the safety of circumcision, and to use the opportunity to educate the young men about a number of sexual and reproductive health issues.

Male circumcision should therefore be regarded as an entry point for sexual, reproductive and other health services for men (Fig. 2.1), including:
- sexual and reproductive health education and counselling;
- screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections;
- counselling and testing for HIV (with referral for care and support for those testing positive);
- family planning education, counselling and services, including provision of condoms and vasectomy;
- evaluation and management of infertility;
- counselling on gender issues, including promotion of respect for women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health needs and rights and the importance of preventing gender-based violence;
- education about cancers of the male reproductive organs (testes, penis and prostate);
- counselling for alcohol dependence and other substance abuse, which are associated with a number of health risks.

No opportunity should be missed for education and counselling about male sexual and reproductive health issues, before and after the initiation of sexual intercourse.

\section*{Counselling and testing for HIV Infection}

Men considering circumcision do not need to know their HIV status; circumcision can be offered to men irrespective of whether they are infected with HIV or not. The procedure can be performed safely on men who have HIV infection, and may confer some benefit by reducing the risk of HIV transmission to their female partners. The surgical staff who perform male circumcision should take full precautions to avoid acquiring HIV infection during surgery ("universal" or "standard" precautions).

WHO and UNAIDS promote testing and counselling for HIV at all contacts with health services, particularly in settings with high HIV prevalence and incidence. ${ }^{1}$ However, clients should have the option to refuse an HIV test, without affecting the care and services they receive. This approach is referred to as "routine offer of testing with optional opt-out".

It is estimated that fewer than $10 \%$ of people in developing countries are aware of their HIV status, and access to, and uptake of,
counselling and testing services are limited. Knowledge of HIV status is important, so that those infected can seek advice, support and proper care, and can take measures to avoid passing the infection to others. Care includes prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole to reduce the rate of progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and antiretroviral treatment when clinically indicated. These treatments are becoming more widely available in developing countries. Specific information and messages can also be given to people known to be uninfected with HIV to help them remain free of infection.

\section*{Barriers to male sexual and reproductive health services}

There are a number of barriers to the development and use of reproductive health services for men, including:
- a lack of information on men's needs and concerns that could be used to design appropriate programmes and services;
- embarrassment and alienation among men about using health facilities that are primarily designed to address women's reproductive health issues;
- men's reluctance to seek medical care;
- inadequate training of health workers to address men's sexual and reproductive health issues;
- limited availability of contraceptive methods for men;
- negative attitudes of policy-makers and service providers towards men; for example, viewing men as irresponsible, or not interested in playing a positive role in support of women's reproductive health needs, or not an appropriate clientele for sexual and reproductive health services;
- unfavourable legal and policy constraints, such as bans on promotion of condoms;
- logistic constraints such as lack of separate waiting and service areas for men, lack of trained male staff, lack of male-friendly clinics, and inconvenient clinic hours.

These barriers must be addressed if men are to become more involved in sexual and reproductive health matters.

\section*{MEETING THE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NEEDS OF MEN}

Access to sexual and reproductive health services is a human rights issue for women, men and young people. The lack of services to address the sexual and reproductive health needs of men contributes to stress and anxiety among them. ${ }^{2}$ Various strategies have been used to extend sexual and reproductive health services to men, and to engage men as partners in improving women's sexual and reproductive health:
- Services for men may be offered in existing clinic-based services.
- Separate services may be established to provide information, education and counselling on sexuality, physiological development, family planning, STIs and HIV, genital health and hygiene, interpersonal communication, and sexual and reproductive behaviour.
- Special services may be established to offer diagnosis and treatment of sexual dysfunction, STIs and HIV, cancer of the prostate, testis and penis, and medical indications for male circumcision.

Other approaches include:
- community-based distribution and social marketing of condoms;
- reaching men with information and services through the workplace, the military and men's groups;
- special outreach campaigns to young men;
- educational campaigns through the media;
- special initiatives, such as outreach through football matches or other popular sporting events;
- promotion of vasectomy.

Because gender inequality has a strong influence on women's sexual and reproductive health, programme managers need to consider the needs and perspectives of men, women and young people. It is also important to use gender-related and gender-disaggregated indicators when evaluating programmes.

\section*{MEN'S ROLES IN WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH}

Men can influence women's health in numerous ways. ${ }^{3}$ As husbands, boyfriends, fathers, brothers, and friends, men can have a positive effect on women's health by:
- preventing the spread of STIs by using condoms consistently and correctly and supporting and encouraging regular condom use by others;
- using, or supporting the use by partners, of contraception, so that couples are better able to control the number and timing of their children;
- supporting women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period;
- supporting women to take decisions about their health without reference to their partner;
- responding to the physical and emotional needs of women prior to and following miscarriage and abortion;
- refraining from, and insisting others avoid and prevent, all forms of violence against women and girls;
- working to end harmful sexual practices, such as female genital mutilation and "dry sex";
- sharing financial resources with women, and supporting the notion of shared property rights;
- supporting women's full participation in civil society, including their access to social, political and educational opportunities, many of which have a direct or indirect impact on women's health;
- supporting the rights of daughters to the same health care, education, and respect as sons.

\section*{Who should provide sexual and reproductive health services and information to boys and men?}

A wide range of people and organizations can provide sexual and reproductive health services and information to boys and men. Some of the key providers are listed below. ${ }^{4}$
- Parents. Ideally, boys and young men should receive information and basic education on sexual and reproductive health from their parents. However, available data suggest that less than half of boys and young men discuss HIV/AIDS, STIs or family planning with their parents.
- Teachers. Many adolescent boys now receive some education on health, family life and sexuality in school. However, for some, the instruction comes after they have begun having sexual intercourse.
- Peers. Boys and men of all ages often get information on sexual and reproductive issues from their peers. Much of this information, however, may be inaccurate. One approach is to educate key youth leaders, who can then pass on accurate information to their peers. This has to be an ongoing process, to reach each new generation or group of young men.
- Community-based organizations. Places of worship and youth groups are important sources of information, and also provide an opportunity for counselling and skill-building in relation to sexuality, relationships, marriage and parenting. In some cases, the only method taught for preventing pregnancy and STIs is sexual abstinence, despite the fact that young people find it difficult to adhere to abstinence. As a result, they may not know how to protect themselves from risk when they become sexually active. ${ }^{5,6}$
- Family planning clinics. Some family planning clinics reach out to men, particularly to the partners of their female clients. The availability of male health care providers and separate consultation sessions for men may encourage men to use these services. Although family planning clinics have a long history of providing both medical and counselling services, many men see them as being only for women; equally, some providers may be uncomfortable serving men.
- Youth-friendly services. Some countries have developed programmes that specifically address the needs of young people,
either through special "youth-friendly services", or by making existing services more welcoming and accessible to young people. Such programmes are an important way of reaching young men who often feel excluded from family planning and other reproductive health services;
- STI clinics. These facilities have a long experience addressing sexual health matters, and many men are comfortable seeking services in such settings. However, STI clinics tend to focus on treatment and secondary prevention. Primary prevention of STIs must, therefore, be addressed through other mechanisms.
- HIV services. HIV testing and counselling centres can also provide counselling on sexual and reproductive health. If such centres are integrated within primary health care services, they can also provide some sexual and reproductive health services. Facilities providing care for patients with HIV infection and AIDS also have a role to play in promoting sexual and reproductive health for men, women and young people.
- Physicians, clinical officers, nurses and other health care professionals. Health care professionals play a critical role, not just as health care providers, but also as educators and counsellors. Urologists and other specialists commonly deal with certain aspects of male sexual and reproductive health, such as diagnosing and treating prostate cancer and performing circumcision or vasectomy. Primary care physicians treat large numbers of men for their general health needs, but may not have the necessary training to provide comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education and services, or be comfortable doing so. Staff providing male circumcision services should be trained to educate and counsel men about their sexual and reproductive health, and should take the time to do this. Male circumcision services provide a unique opportunity to reach men with education and counselling about sexual and reproductive health.

\section*{DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF SELECTED MALE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROBLEMS}

Some common reproductive health problems are described below.

\section*{Sexually transmitted infections}

More than twenty species of microorganisms are known to be transmissible through sexual intercourse.

STIs in men include:
- gonorrhoea;
- chlamydial infection (this is the commonest cause of nongonococcal urethritis);
- balanitis caused by Candida albicans;
- trichomoniasis;
- chancroid (soft chancre);
- syphilis
- lymphogranuloma venereum;
- granuloma inguinale (donovanosis);
- genital herpes;
- genital warts (condylomata acuminata).

The most common symptom of an STI is pain on urination, a burning sensation in the penis, or an ulcer on the genitals. Male patients who complain of urethral discharge or pain when passing urine should be examined for evidence of a discharge. If none is seen, the urethra should be gently massaged from the ventral part of the penis towards the meatus. Examination of a urethral smear under a microscope may show an increased number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In men, a finding of more than 5 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per highpower field ( $\times 1000$ ) is indicative of urethritis. A Gram stain may demonstrate the presence of gonococci.

If a urethral discharge or genital ulcer is confirmed, the patient should be managed according to local treatment guidelines and procedures (syndromic approach). For both conditions, non-medically indicated male circumcision should be delayed until the condition has been satisfactorily resolved.

\section*{Balanitis}

Balanitis is an inflammation of the foreskin and the glans of the penis. The condition occurs most often in men and boys who have not been circumcised and who have poor personal hygiene. The inflammation can occur if the sensitive inside surface of the foreskin is not washed regularly.

Symptoms of balanitis include redness or swelling, itching, rash, pain, and foul-smelling discharge.

Factors that predispose to or cause balanitis include:
- Phimosis. This is a condition in which the foreskin is too tight to be retracted. Dead skin cells, smegma (a white substance excreted by small glands around the corona of the glans penis) and bacteria accumulate under the foreskin. It is difficult to keep the area clean and inflammation can easily develop.
- Dermatitis. This is an inflammation of the skin, with irritation, itching and rash, often caused by an irritating substance or an allergic reaction to chemicals in certain products, such as soaps, detergents, perfumes and spermicides.
- Infection with the yeast Candida albicans can result in an itchy, spotty rash.
- Certain sexually transmitted infections (including gonorrhoea, herpes and syphilis) can produce symptoms of balanitis.

In addition, men with diabetes are at greater risk of balanitis. Glucose (sugar) in the urine that is trapped under the foreskin serves as a breeding ground for bacteria.

\section*{Treatment for balanitis}

Treatment for balanitis depends on the underlying cause. If there is an infection, treatment should include an appropriate antibiotic or antifungal medication, according to national guidelines. In cases of severe or persistent inflammation, or if there is difficulty in retracting the foreskin, circumcision is usually recommended.

If the diagnosis or treatment of balanitis is uncertain, the patient should be referred to a higher level of care. Maintaining good personal hygiene can help prevent balanitis. In addition, the patient should be advised to avoid strong soaps or chemicals, especially those known to cause a skin reaction.

\section*{Phimosis}

Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin of the penis is so tight that it cannot be pulled back (retracted) from the head of the penis (Fig. 2.2).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-031.jpg?height=489&width=464&top_left_y=1410&top_left_x=619}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 2.2 Phimosis showing that the foreskin cannot be retracted at erection
Reproduced with permission from www.netterimages.com (image no. 1468).}
\end{figure}

\section*{Causes of phimosis}

Phimosis can occur at any age and may be present at birth. It may be caused by an infection (balanitis) or by scar tissue formed as a result of injury or chronic inflammation. A tight phimosis can interfere with urination, resulting in a thin urinary stream. In extreme cases, urine may collect between the foreskin and the glans, causing ballooning of the foreskin. In this situation an urgent circumcision is necessary, usually using the dorsal slit method.

\section*{Treatment for phimosis}

If seen at a peripheral health facility, adult patients with phimosis should be referred to a higher level of care for proper assessment and treatment; this will usually involve circumcision.

\section*{Paraphimosis}

Paraphimosis occurs when the retracted foreskin cannot be put back in place because of swelling (Fig 2.3). This usually occurs when the penis is erect and during sexual intercourse. The retracted foreskin swells and tightens around the penis. This tightening in turn causes more swelling. Men with paraphimosis should be referred to the district hospital for emergency treatment. If left untreated the condition can result in serious complications, such as skin loss and infection; in extreme cases, it could result in loss of the penis.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-032.jpg?height=618&width=997&top_left_y=1136&top_left_x=731}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 2.3 Paraphimosis. A tight band of foreskin constricts the shaft of the penis; the foreskin is swollen with oedema beyond the band. Reproduced with permission from www.netterimages.com (image no. 1468).}
\end{figure}

\section*{Treatment of paraphimosis}

Treatment depends on how long the paraphimosis has been present. For acute paraphimosis, wrap the swollen area in gauze and apply increasing pressure on the gauze to squeeze the tissue fluid (oedema) out of the penis. This may take $10-15$ minutes. Once the fluid has been squeezed out, it is usually possible to replace the foreskin over the glans. Circumcision can then be done as a planned procedure a few days later. If this procedure fails, or in cases of chronic paraphimosis, the man should be sent to the nearest surgical referral centre.

\section*{Urinary tract infections}

Urinary tract infections are infrequent in adult men, but more frequent in children and older men. Usually there is an underlying cause, for example, kidney or bladder stones. Symptoms include:
- frequent urge to urinate;
- pain and a burning feeling in the area of the bladder or urethra during urination (dysuria);
- feeling tired, shaky, and weak (malaise);
- feeling pain in the bladder or urethra even when not urinating;
- passing only a small amount of urine, despite an intense urge to urinate;
- milky or cloudy urine; sometimes urine may be reddish, indicating that blood is present;
- fever (suggesting that the infection has reached the kidneys);
- pain in the back or side, below the ribs;
- nausea;
- vomiting.

Urinary tract infections in men should be distinguished from urethral discharge caused by an STI. A patient with a urinary tract infection should be told to drink plenty of water, starting immediately. He should also be given an appropriate. Men and boys with recurrent urinary tract infection, or who do not respond to treatment at the first level of care, should be referred for further investigations.

\section*{Infertility}

Between 60 and 80 million couples around the world are infertile, and most of them live in developing countries. Infertility is defined as failure to conceive after at least 12 months of unprotected vaginal intercourse. A large proportion of cases of infertility in developing countries are attributable to STIs, which can damage the fallopian tubes in women and obstruct the sperm ducts in men, particularly when left untreated. Reproductive tract infections in men can affect the prostate (prostatitis), the epididymis (epididymitis), and the testes (orchitis). In many societies, childlessness is highly stigmatizing, and the couple's emotional response to their infertility is often exacerbated by family, peer and media pressure. Frequently the female partner is considered responsible for the failure to conceive, commonly resulting in marital tension, divorce, polygamy or ostracism. However, a WHO investigation of 5800 infertile couples found that reduced male reproductive capacity was a contributory factor in at least 50\% of infertile couples. ${ }^{7}$ In order to provide more efficient, systematic and cost-effective care for infertile couples, and to improve the accuracy of diagnoses, health care providers managing an infertile couple should ensure that all essential information is collected. The WHO Manual for the Standardized Investigation and Diagnosis of the Infertile Couple provides clear guidelines and a logical sequence of steps for clinicians to follow in evaluating both partners in an infertile couple. ${ }^{8}$

\section*{Educating and counselling clients, and obtaining informed consent}

\section*{Summary}
- Group education is used to support counselling services. It allows clients to be given basic information on sexual and reproductive health, including HIV, before an individual counselling session.
- Providers of male circumcision services have a duty to (a) ensure that voluntary and informed consent is obtained before the procedure is performed, (b) maintain confidentiality, and (c) provide services without discrimination.
- Where tradition demands group circumcision for boys, health care providers should work with the community to design a way of combining the surgical procedure with education, integrating traditional customs and practices with modern clinical techniques.
- All counsellors need basic counselling skills in order to talk with clients in a helpful way.

\section*{EDUCATION ABOUT SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND MALE CIRCUMCISION}

Group education is used to support individual counselling services. It allows clients to be given basic information about male circumcision before an individual counselling session. Counsellors can then work with clients, and/or their parents, on specific issues related to male circumcision, or sexual and reproductive health in general. Group education allows the first counselling session to be shorter, which is an advantage in busy clinics.

The information given to clients during an education session may differ slightly from site to site. Counsellors should be familiar with the standard education on male circumcision offered at the place where they work, so that messages and information given are consistent.

In conducting group education on male circumcision, the counsellor should include the following main messages:
- Underline that, like women and girls, men and boys have sexual health and reproductive health needs.
- Explain what male circumcision is, outline the benefits and risks, and describe how the surgical procedure is performed and what happens afterwards.
- Emphasize that male circumcision does not provide complete protection against HIV infection. Explain that circumcised men can become infected and can pass on HIV infection to their sexual partners.
- Describe the measures that the service takes to ensure that patient records are kept confidential and provide assurance that confidentiality will be maintained.
- Discuss the importance of knowing one's HIV status. Explain how HIV is transmitted, how a person can protect himself or herself from HIV infection, and where people with HIV infection can find support.
- Explain that men with an STI have a greater risk of becoming infected with, and transmitting, HIV.
- Emphasize the importance of avoiding HIV infection and outline different ways of reducing the risk of acquiring the infection.
- Explain that patients with an STI have a greater risk of becoming infertile in the future.
- Emphasize that only condoms, consistently and properly used, protect against STIs, HIV, and unwanted pregnancy. Other methods of contraception, even those that are highly effective in preventing pregnancy, do not protect against STIs, HIV or possible future infertility.
- Emphasize that vasectomy is the most effective and permanent method of contraception available for men, but that it does not protect against STIs or HIV.
- Emphasize that men should treat women as equal partners in decision-making related to sexual and reproductive health.
- Emphasize that men should support the sexual and reproductive health of women and the well-being of their children, with equal regard for female and male children.
- Underscore the importance of not perpetrating gender-based violence, especially against women and girls.
- Emphasize that responsible men do not force or coerce their partners to have sex against their will (rape).

\section*{Group education script}

Below is a sample script that shows how a group education session might be conducted. ${ }^{\text {a }}$ The script should be adapted to the specific situation in the clinic or region.

The text in italics contains instructions for the group educator.

\section*{Opening}
- Hello, my name is $\qquad$ , and I am a $\qquad$ here at this clinic.

For some time we have been aware that the reproductive health needs of men and boys have not been receiving enough attention.

At this clinic we provide the following services for men:
- information and education on male circumcision (including the management of postoperative complications);
- male circumcision for men who choose to have the procedure;

\footnotetext{
${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ Adapted from JHPIEGO's Counselling and Testing reference manual. [Full reference required]
}
- information and counselling on sexual intercourse, safer sex, and health problems related to the reproductive system;
- diagnosis and management of sexually transmitted infections;
- counselling and testing for HIV and AIDS and referral for care and support;
- contraception, through vasectomy or the use of condoms; condoms will prevent both pregnancy and.

Physical and sexual maturity comes with many social responsibilities. These include:
- Recognizing that safer sex can prevent STIs and HIV infection. Safer sex includes using condoms the right way every time you have sex, reducing the number of sexual partners, delaying the start of sexual relations, and avoiding penetrative sex.
- Never putting yourself in a situation in which you lose control of your judgement, for example because you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This may lead to behaviour that will increase your risk of becoming infected with STIs and HIV, such as having unprotected sex with strangers or with multiple sexual partners.
- Treating women as equal partners in sexual relations and deciding together whether and when to have children.
- Respecting the sexual and reproductive health rights of girls and women, including the right to refuse sex, both within and outside marriage.
- Supporting women's sexual and reproductive health. Such support is particularly important during pregnancy.
- Supporting children's well-being, with equal regard for female and male children.
- Stopping all kinds of violence against women and girls, and not forcing or coercing girls or women to have sex against their will.

\section*{Male circumcision}

For those of you who are here to find out more about male circumcision, let's talk a bit about that.
- What is male circumcision? Male circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis (also called the prepuce). It is one of the oldest surgical procedures in history.
- Male circumcision has been shown to have several health benefits including:
- a reduced risk of urinary tract infections in childhood;
- a reduced risk of some sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes and syphilis;
- some protection against cancer of the penis;
- a reduced risk of cervical cancer in female sex partners;
- prevention of several medical problems of the penis and foreskin, such as inflammation, scarring and swelling of the foreskin.
- Some of you may have heard that male circumcision reduces the
risk of HIV infection. This is correct. However, I must remind you that male circumcision does not protect completely against HIV infection - it only reduces the risk of becoming infected by about one half. It is very important to continue using other ways of reducing the risk of infection - using condoms the right way every time you have sex, reducing the number of sexual partners, delaying the start of sexual relations, avoiding penetrative sexual intercourse, and avoiding unsafe injections.
- As with any surgical procedure, complications may occur after the operation. However, in our clinic we do everything we can to reduce this risk. Possible problems include pain, bleeding, swelling of the penis caused by bleeding under the skin, infection of the surgical wound, and increased sensitivity of the exposed head of the penis (glans). On average, if we operate on 50 men or boys, one will need to come back to the clinic for the treatment of a complication. However, the problems usually settle down quickly with additional treatment.
- Many men ask how soon after circumcision sex can be resumed. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks for the wound to become strong enough to withstand sex and about 3-4 months for the wound to heal completely. We always advise clients to avoid sex or masturbation for the first 4-6 weeks after circumcision, and to use a condom during sex until the wound has completely healed (at least 6 months). It is always best to use a condom whenever there is any risk of STI or HIV infection.
- At this clinic, we perform circumcision using local anaesthesia to take away the pain of the procedure. Patients can go home the same day but it is important that they come back for follow-up.
- Do any of you have any questions or concerns about male circumcision? I know that there are many myths about male circumcision that circulate. For example, some people think that circumcision can cause impotence (failure of erection) or reduce sexual pleasure. Others think that circumcision will cure impotence. Let me assure you that none of these is true.

If time permits, other sexual and reproductive health topics can be covered (see Appendix 3.1).

\section*{Summary}

We have talked about the different services that we offer in this clinic. It is up to you to let us know what services are of interest to you. If you are worried that you may be infected with an STI or HIV, or if you want to be tested, counselling and testing services are available here. If you want to register yourself or your son for circumcision, please let us know. We will be very pleased to assist you in any way you wish.

Please take some of the information leaflets we have here. They may answer other questions that you may have. Thank you for your attention.

\section*{COUNSELLING}

\section*{Basic facts about counselling ${ }^{\text {b }}$}

Counselling is a process in which individual communication is used to help people examine personal issues, make decisions, and make plans for taking action. In some types of counselling, the counsellor and client talk about whatever the client wishes. In counselling for male circumcision, the provider ensures that the client (or, if the client is a child, his parents) has all the information he needs to make a decision about undergoing the procedure. HIV

\section*{Counselling is not:}
- telling clients what to do;
- criticizing clients;
- forcing ideas or values on clients;
- taking responsibility for clients' actions or decisions. counselling concentrates on helping clients reduce their risk of becoming infected with HIV - or for those already infected - transmitting the virus to others. In family planning counselling, the provider helps the clients make an informed decision based on their reproductive intentions and personal situation.

Counselling may involve some or all of the following:
- Listening to clients (or parents, for circumcision in boys who are too young to understand fully the reasons for circumcision and the risks associated with it, or who are below the legal age to consent to the operation).
- Respecting clients' needs, values, culture, religion, and lifestyle.
- Talking with clients about the risks and benefits of the service requested, in this case male circumcision.
- Answering questions about the male circumcision procedure and correcting any false information.
- Allowing clients and/or their parents to make their own informed decision on whether or not to choose male circumcision.
- Asking clients questions that help them identify behaviour that puts them at risk of STIs or HIV infection, or might do so after circumcision.
- Helping clients understand the benefits of knowing their HIV status.
- Helping clients understand their HIV or STI test results.
- Helping HIV-negative clients understand that male circumcision does not provide full protection against HIV infection, and suggesting how they can stay negative.
- Helping HIV-positive clients find support and treatment services, and discussing ways to avoid transmitting HIV to others.
- Helping clients obtain other services, such as family planning, screening and treatment for STIs, and counselling and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse.

\section*{Confidentiality}

Confidentiality is an important characteristic of all sexual and reproductive health services. Counsellors should keep all client

\footnotetext{
b Adapted from JHPIEGO's Counseling and testing reference manual for lay counselors, 2002. [Full reference required]
}
information private and allow clients to decide when and with whom to discuss their sexual and reproductive health problems. Clients will feel more comfortable about sharing personal information with counsellors and being tested for STIs or HIV if they know that this information will remain secret. This also applies when the client's main interest is male circumcision. An atmosphere of trust will encourage clients to discuss other sexual and reproductive health needs.

Another reason why confidentiality is so important is that many people have negative feelings about STIs, HIVIAIDS and sexual health concerns. There is strong social pressure to conform, and considerable social stigma is associated with behaviours or conditions perceived as unusual.

Sometimes, health care workers at a clinic need to know a client's HIV status. This happens, for example, when a client is sick and the best treatment depends on knowing whether the person is HIV-positive or HIV-negative. The counsellor should tell the client about this possibility during counselling. An HIV test is recommended for all clients requesting circumcision, but is not required for the operation to go ahead. Male circumcision can be safely performed in men whose HIV status is unknown and in those with HIV infection, provided that they are clinically healthy. However, except in some rare cases where circumcision is necessary to correct a health problem of the glans or foreskin in a man with HIV infection, there are no medical or public health reasons to perform circumcision in men with HIV infection. HIV testing of clients before circumcision is not necessary to protect the clinic or surgical staff during the operation. It is important that the clinic applies high infection-control standards, including proper implementation of universal precautions to minimize the risk of transmission of HIV and other infections to health care workers or other patients. Universal precautions are discussed in full in Chapter 8.

\section*{Counselling skills}

All counsellors need certain basic counselling skills in order to talk with clients in a helpful way. Some of these skills are explained below.

\section*{Empathizing}

Empathy is the ability to see the world through another person's eyes and understand how that person feels. Counsellors should listen to clients carefully and show them that they understand without judging. Empathy is not sympathy; it is not feeling sorry for the client. Empathy is understanding the client's feelings.

\section*{Example:}

An adolescent says to the counsellor: "My girlfriend keeps asking me to go for circumcision. I feel embarrassed and angry."

Counsellor's empathic response: "So you often feel irritated, uncomfortable, and pressured by your girlfriend. That must be difficult for you."

\section*{Active listening}

Active listening involves paying attention to what a client says and does, in a way that shows respect, interest and empathy. Active listening is more than just hearing what clients say. It is paying attention to the content of the message, as well as the client's feelings and worries that show through his movements, tone of voice, facial expressions, and posture.

\section*{Example:}

The client looks very nervous and is biting his nails, but tells the counsellor he is fine.

Counsellor: "Sometimes when we think we are relaxed, we can still feel quite anxious inside. I see you are biting your nails. Perhaps something is bothering you that you do not know how to express. Do you have any idea what that might be?"

\section*{Open questioning}

Open questions are questions that require more than a one-word answer. They usually begin with words such as "how", "what" or "why". Open questions encourage clients to express their feelings and share information about their situation.

\section*{Examples:}
"Why have you decided to come for male circumcision?"
"How do you think circumcision can reduce your risk of STI or HIV infection?"
"What do you do that may make it possible for you to get infected with an STI or HIV?"
"What are you currently doing to protect yourself against STIs and HIV? How is this working?"

\section*{Probing}

Probing is using questions to help clients express themselves more clearly. Probing is necessary when the counsellor needs more information about the client's feelings or situation. Asking a probing question is a good way to follow up on a question that has been answered by "yes" or "no."

\section*{Examples:}
"Can you tell me more about that?"
"How do you feel about that?"

\section*{Focusing}

Clients are often overwhelmed by emotional or personal problems related to their particular sexual and reproductive health problems. They may want to address all the issues at once. If clients start to talk about problems or situations that will be discussed later in the session, the counsellor may want to bring the topic of discussion back to the current issue.

Example:
At the beginning of the first counselling session, the client begins talking about the most recent situation when he may have been exposed to HIV. He asks about where and how he can get condoms.

The counsellor does not want to interrupt the flow of the discussion, so says: "Using condoms is an excellent way to reduce your risk of getting an STI or HIV infection. We can talk about that in a few minutes. Right now, let's continue talking about your HIV situation."

If the client wants to talk about other emotional or personal issues, such as problems at home or a partner's drug use problem, the counsellor should help the client find appropriate support.

\section*{Affirming}

Affirming is congratulating or complimenting clients on the positive actions that they have taken. It is important to encourage success. Complimenting clients helps them feel respected and valued and encourages them to try to make other changes to reduce their risk of HIV infection. It may also make them more willing to share information about other actions they have taken.

Example:
Client: "I've recently started using condoms each time I have sex".
Counsellor: "That's a really positive step in protecting yourself against HIV and sexually transmitted infections. Well done!"

\section*{Clarifying}

Counsellors clarify in order to make sure that they understand a client's statements or questions. Clarifying also helps the client understand his own situation or feelings better and identify uncertainty or conflict between his thoughts and behaviour.

\section*{Example:}

Client: "My partner gave me gonorrhoea. I'm afraid of getting HIV. But I'm also afraid that, if I use condoms when I have sex with her, she'll think I am not faithful."

Counsellor: "Help me understand this. You are afraid you might get HIV from your partner, but you do not want to use condoms with her."

Pointing out a conflict may help the client identify which of two issues is more important to him. It is better than the counsellor telling the client to do something that he is not ready to accept. Clarifying also helps clients make their own choices and draw their own conclusions. Saying "help me understand this" is a good way to begin this type of discussion.

\section*{Correcting false information}

It is important to provide correct information to clients and to correct any myths and false information. There are many incorrect rumours about HIV, AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, male circumcision and vasectomy. These should be corrected. However, this needs to be done in a sensitive way, without making the client feel stupid or defensive. Counsellors should acknowledge false information and then correct it quickly. It is not necessary to give detailed explanations.

\section*{Example:}

Counsellor: "You mentioned that it is possible to cure HIV by having sex with a child or virgin. Many people believe this, but it is untrue. Firstly sex with a child is wrong and is a crime. Second, it has no benefit to you - at present, there is no cure for HIV or AIDS. Third, and most important, you are likely to transmit the virus to the child"

Counsellor: "You mentioned that you want to have a circumcision in order to prevent you from getting HIV from your multiple sexual partners. I think you need to know that male circumcision does not fully protect a man against HIV infection. Circumcised men who do not use protection or who engage in risky sexual behaviour are more likely to contract HIV infection than circumcised men who practise safer sex. Having sex with multiple sexual partners certainly is risky behaviour. You can reduce your risk of HIV infection by cutting down on the number of your sexual partners, avoiding full sexual intercourse (penetrative sex) and using condoms correctly every time you have sex."

\section*{Summarizing}

Counsellors summarize in order to present the main points of the conversation to the client. Summarizing can be useful when moving to another topic or ending the session, and to make sure that counsellor and client have understood each other correctly. Summarizing also
helps clients see the whole picture and understand the situation better.

Example:

> Counsellor: "We have discussed several ways in which you can reduce your risk of getting infected with an STI or HIV. For example, you seem comfortable with starting to use condoms during sex and drinking less alcohol when you go out with friends. You have many choices and we will develop a specific plan later. First, let's talk about HIV testing because your plan could change depending on your test result."

\section*{INFORMED CONSENT FOR SURGERY}

\section*{General}

Clients (or parents, in the case of a child) must give informed consent before a circumcision is performed. Health care providers should give clients all the information they need to make a fully informed decision. The following elements should be included.
- Provide information. Clients (or parents) should be given an explanation, in plain language, of male circumcision and the nature of the surgery. They should be informed about the risks and benefits of the procedure and of other ways to reduce the risk of HIV infection. They should know that they can choose not to be circumcised.
- Assess whether the client understands the information provided.
- Assess the capacity of the client to make the necessary decisions.
- Assure the client that he is free to choose whether or not to be circumcised. If there is any suggestion that the client is not ready to provide consent, advise him to reflect on it for a few days.
- Ask clients who decide to undergo circumcision to sign a consent document.

The goal of this consent process is to ensure that the clients (or parents) understand the surgical procedure. At the same time, they should be given the opportunity to make use of other sexual and reproductive health services.

Only clients who have appropriate decision-making capacity and legal status can give their informed consent to medical care. Where a child (usually defined as a person under the age of majority in national law) lacks the legal status required to provide independent, informed consent, or lacks the capacity to appreciate the risks and benefits associated with the procedure, written consent based on full information must be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian should make the decision according to the best interests of the child.

Children nevertheless have a right to participate in decisions affecting their health, according to their evolving capacities. Even where the law
does not allow a child to give his own consent, providers of circumcision should explain the risks and benefits to the child in a way appropriate to his capacity. If the child has sufficient capacity, he should be given the opportunity to give or withhold assent to the procedure.

\section*{Adolescent boys: consent and confidentiality}

Male circumcision is often performed during adolescence or early adulthood. It is important that health care workers know how to respond to an adolescent boy's request for circumcision in a way that respects confidentiality, but does not put the health care worker in conflict with the law.

Health care workers need to know what the law says about consent for minors. They need to know at what age and in what circumstances minors can legally make an independent decision to seek clinical or medical services without the agreement of their parents or guardian. The age at which an adolescent is allowed to give his own consent may differ for different procedures. For example, in some countries, an adolescent may be able to consent to be tested for HIV or receive condoms at a younger age than that at which he can consent to circumcision. The Ministry of Health and the National Medical or Nursing Associations should be able to provide information on national rules and regulations.

Adolescent boys who are mature enough to appreciate the risks and benefits associated with a medical procedure, such as circumcision or HIV testing, should not be subjected to the procedure without their informed consent, whether or not parental consent is required by law. All health services provided to adolescents should be confidential. Where the law allows minors to provide independent informed consent, providers must ensure that information is not disclosed to the parents without the child's consent.
"Children are more likely to use services that are friendly and supportive, provide a wide range of services and information, are geared to their needs, give them the opportunity to participate in decisions affecting their health, are accessible, affordable, confidential and non-judgemental, do not require parental consent and are not discriminatory."

Committee on the Rights of the Child. General Comment No. 3: HIVIAIDS and the rights of the child. Thirty-second session, January 2003 (UN Document CRC/GC/2003/3) para. 20.

Health care workers should be guided in their response to adolescents by human rights principles: all adolescents have a right to use health services. Health care workers should act in the best interest of the adolescent with an understanding of his evolving capacities and ability
to make independent decisions. In some situations, health care workers may need to judge whether an adolescent has the maturity to request, and consent to, circumcision, independent of his parent or guardian.

Circumcision is an opportunity to make contact with adolescent boys, and provide them with information and counselling about their own sexual and reproductive health and that of their current or future partners. Adequate time should be allowed for counselling before and after the operation. Adolescents should be advised that it is important to return after the procedure for a check-up and further counselling and information on condom use and other aspects of sexual and reproductive health.

\section*{Documenting informed consent for surgery}

The circumcision team should ensure that the client has been informed about the risks and benefits of male circumcision, that the information has been given in an understandable way, using everyday local language. The oral information should be backed up by written information sheets in the local language (see the sample information sheet for adult and adolescent clients in Appendix 3.2). After receiving the information the client should be allowed to ask questions. He should then be given time to reflect before being asked to sign the consent document (see the sample certificate of consent for adults and adolescents in Appendix 3.3).

\section*{INFANT CIRCUMCISION}

Circumcision can be performed with the least physical risk on infants. When counselling parents who have been offered, or have requested, circumcision for their infant, health care providers have a responsibility to explain all the associated benefits and risks. Any benefits with regard to preventing HIV infection will be realized only many years in the future when the child becomes sexually active.

Parents or guardians should use the information they are given to evaluate what is in the best interests of the child. They may also wish to consider cultural and religious factors in reaching a fully informed decision.

More information on counselling parents who wish to have their baby circumcised is given in Chapter 6.

\section*{INTEGRATION OF TRADITIONAL CIRCUMCISION EVENTS WITH CLINICAL CIRCUMCISION}

In some communities, groups of boys are circumcised at the same time, by a traditional circumciser who uses a traditional technique without anaesthesia. This group activity coincides with the "rites of passage" from adolescence to adulthood, and often takes place in circumcision "camps" or ceremonies. The event is usually both festive and educational for the participants and the community. The goals are
to acknowledge the boy's physical and emotional maturity and readiness to face the challenges of adulthood, as well as to support him during the painful circumcision procedure. In the camps, young boys attend various civic education classes, facilitated by the traditional circumciser, community leaders or event organizer. Essentially, they are taught how to behave as men.

Some parents prefer to have their sons circumcised individually. They may take the boy to a hospital or clinic, and have a health care provider perform a medical circumcision under local anaesthesia. If they choose to have the boy circumcised at home, they may engage either a nurse or a traditional circumciser. They may also specify which technique they prefer.

The increasing interest in medical circumcision in communities with a culture of traditional circumcision provides an opportunity to integrate the traditional event with safer clinical procedures including appropriate follow-up. There are many reports of high complication rates following traditional circumcision ceremonies and circumcisions performed by traditional providers. Safety can be improved by introducing medical circumcision into traditional ceremonies, or by performing the circumcision under local anaesthesia in a clinic separate from, but linked to, the traditional ceremony.

Educational topics during a circumcision event may include the following:
- the physical and psychological changes that occur in boys and girls during adolescence;
- sexuality and gender issues;
- male and female sexual and reproductive health and rights;
- sexually transmitted infections;
- HIV infection;
- safer sex practices (correct and consistent use of condoms, reducing the number of sexual partners, delaying the start of sexual relations, and avoiding penetrative sex);
- family planning;
- substance use (drugs, alcohol, tobacco);
- violence, including gender-based violence;
- community expectations of men;
- goal-setting and decision-making.

Health institutions that want to organize group circumcision events should do so in partnership with traditional circumcisers and the community. A joint educational programme can be drawn up, under shared responsibility. The decision to circumcise boys in camps will depend on resources, customs and traditions in the community. A mobile outreach service during the holidays is a convenient way to reach many boys and their parents. Whichever approach is adopted, the quality of the clinical circumcision should be ensured, in order to build and maintain confidence in the community regarding the safety and advisability of medical circumcision.

\section*{ADDITIONAL SCRIPT FOR COUNSELLING ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH}

\section*{HIV testing and counselling}
- You have all probably heard of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. We do not talk about it much in the community, but we are going to talk about it here because it is important to your health.
- HIV is increasing all over the world. How many of us know family members or friends who have HIV or who have died from illnesses related to HIV and AIDS?
- During this session, I will give you some basic information about HIV and AIDS and how being tested for HIV can be beneficial to you, your partner, family and community. You will also learn about the relationship between male circumcision and HIV infection.
- I will also tell you about services that are available locally, especially about the counselling and testing services that are offered here or at $\qquad$ facility. We will also talk about family planning.
- HIV testing is recommended for individuals who are at risk of HIV infection, for example by having unprotected sexual intercourse with an HIV-infected person or with someone whose HIV status is unknown. Using non-sterile needles to inject drugs is another risk for HIV.
- For those who are tested and find out they have HIV, there are medicines that help them stay healthy longer and that may reduce the risk of infecting others with HIV.
- People living with HIV have the same rights as everyone else. Discrimination against people living with HIV is against the law. There are organizations such as $\qquad$ that can provide legal and other types of support for people with HIV infection.
- While medicines do not provide answers to all of our problems in dealing with HIV, they do allow people with HIV to live longer, healthier and productive lives. Before going into detail about the services we offer, here are a few facts about HIV and AIDS.

\section*{The difference between HIV and AIDS}
- HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV is a slow-acting virus and it is possible for a person to be infected with HIV for many years without knowing it or feeling ill. AIDS is a condition caused by HIV. AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Immune deficiency means that the immune system, which protects your body from infection, does not function properly. AIDS develops because HIV weakens the body's defence system.
- There is no cure for HIV infection, but medicines are available that can help prevent other infections in people who are living with HIV. Other medicines can slow down the virus and help HIV-infected people stay healthy longer.
- The increasing availability of medicines and other resources to support people with HIV means that more and more people with HIV infection can live a full and productive life, including a healthy sexual life.

\section*{Country statistics on HIV}
- Here is some information on HIV infections in our country and region. (Share with the group recent national statistics on the prevalence of HIV and the numbers of clients with HIV in antenatal and STI clinics.)

\section*{How HIV is transmitted}

HIV is transmitted:
- through unprotected sexual intercourse, vaginal or anal, with a person who has HIV infection;
- through infected transfused blood or blood products, or by using needles that an HIV-infected person has already used for injecting drugs, body piercing or tattooing; and
- from an infected mother to her baby during pregnancy and childbirth and through breast milk.

HIV is not transmitted through mosquito bites, everyday contacts, sharing workplace or home utensils, hugging or kissing.

\section*{Sexually transmitted infections}
- Sexually transmitted infections are quite common in our community. The most common STIs are syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and herpes.
- It is important that these infections are promptly diagnosed and treated, in order to avoid complications such as infertility.
- Men should be responsive to requests from STI clinics to come for testing if their spouse or partner is diagnosed with an STI. Treatment of both partners is an important element of STI control in the family and the community at large.
- Having a sexually transmitted infection (especially one that causes sores or ulcers on the genital area) increases the risk of getting HIV by up to five times. People living with HIV are more likely to infect others when they also have such an STI.
- Individuals with a sexually transmitted infection should carefully consider the benefits of HIV testing.

\section*{Preventing HIV infection and reducing risk behaviour}
- A person may be exposed to HIV once or many times before he or she becomes infected. The more often exposure occurs, the more likely a person is to become infected. Most people do not know their HIV status or whether they have been infected, and may continue to behave in a way that puts them at risk of infection or risks giving HIV to others.
- HIV infection can be avoided by avoiding penetrative sexual intercourse, by having only one partner, who is HIV-negative and faithful, by using condoms the right way every time you have sex, and by using only clean needles for injections.
- Correct and consistent condom use prevents not only HIV, but also other sexually transmitted infections (thereby protecting future fertility) and unwanted pregnancy. When used correctly every time, condoms are an excellent method of family planning and help prevent the spread of HIV and other STIs.

\section*{Reducing the risk of getting infected with HIV}
- Do you know of ways in which people can reduce their risk of getting infected with HIV? (Add to participants' suggestions: not having sex with high-risk partners, talking to a partner about testing, talking about HIV concerns with a partner or friend, decreasing alcohol or drug use, increasing condom use, avoiding places where you often have high risk behaviour, abstaining from sex, avoiding penetrative sex, correctly using condoms every time until you and your partner have been tested, etc.)
- Try to think of some ways in which you personally could decrease your risk of getting infected with HIV.
- When you think of some ways that you can reduce your risk of getting infected with HIV, share them with someone you trust, such as a close friend.
- Now I will show you the proper use of a condom. (Include a condom demonstration here if appropriate. Use models and ask participants to do some demonstrations themselves.)

\section*{HIV testing}
- Our health facility offers HIV testing and counselling. Each person has the right to choose whether or not to be tested for HIV.
- Before you make a decision about HIV testing, you will have the chance to talk with a counsellor about your specific situation with regard to STI and HIV infection, and about ways to reduce your risk of getting infected.
- The test result shows your HIV status as of 3 months earlier. If you became infected in the 3 months before your test, it may not be detected. For this reason, some people will need to be retested.

For example, if you had unprotected sex in May and were tested in June, you may want to be tested again in August.
- A positive HIV test means you have been infected with HIV. It does not mean you have AIDS, and it does not tell us when you were infected or when you will get sick.
- A negative HIV test means you have not been infected with HIV or were infected too recently for the test to detect your infection. (Share information on how to remain HIV-negative).
- If you are ill with signs and symptoms of HIV infection, medical staff will recommend an HIV test in order to determine the best way of treating and helping you.
- [Only relevant if the country has adopted a national policy of provider-initiated testing and counselling at all contacts with health-care services]: It is the policy of our country to routinely offer an HIV test for all people who come to health care services, even if it is for reasons not linked to HIV infection. This policy has been adopted to encourage more and more people to know their HIV status. Those who are infected with HIV will then be able to take better care of themselves, their partners and their family members For those who are not infected, a negative test will be a strong motivation to remain free from HIV infection and can reinforce good practices that reduce the risk of infection.
- Here is how the testing works at our facility. (Describe the testing process at your clinic. Emphasize the confidentiality of test results).

\section*{Medicines}
- In this facility, medicines are available to slow down the progression of HIV infection to AIDS and therefore prolong life. The medicines are safe to take.

Discuss the medicines that are available in your country for people who test positive and how to get them.

\section*{Contraception for men}
- Two methods of male contraception are available in this clinic: a temporary method (male condoms) and a permanent method (male sterilization or vasectomy).
- The male condom is suitable for those wanting to space pregnancies, to protect themselves against STIs and HIV, and to preserve their future fertility. In fact, the condom is the only method that both prevents pregnancy and provides protection against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.
- Vasectomy is a surgical procedure, in which the tubes (vas deferens) that transport sperm cells from the testes to the penis are cut and tied off (show drawing of male reproductive system to illustrate vasectomy). Vasectomy is a permanent method of contraception, and should be used only by men who are very sure that they do not want to have more children. You will still need to
use a condom to protect yourself against STIs, including HIV.
- Vasectomy is done in this clinic as an outpatient procedure under local anaesthesia. That means that patients go home the same day.
- Vasectomy does not change a man's ability to have erections and does not interfere with sexual intercourse.

Does anyone have any questions or concerns?

\section*{SAMPLE INFORMATION SHEET FOR ADULT AND ADOLESCENT CLIENTS}

\section*{Normal anatomy}

The head (glans) of the penis is covered by a fold of skin (foreskin). As the penis becomes erect, this skin withdraws freely so that the head of the penis is fully exposed.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{A Normal uncircumcised penis}

\section*{What is circumcision?}

Circumcision is surgical removal of the foreskin. It is an ancient practice that has its origin in religious and traditional rites. Many parents have their sons circumcised for religious reasons. More and more men are now choosing circumcision for health and hygiene reasons.

\section*{Who will do the operation?}

A specially-trained member of the circumcision team will do the operation.

\section*{Is circumcision a painful operation?}

Normally, circumcision is done with a local anaesthetic. This is given by injection through the skin near the base of the penis. Although you will be awake during the operation, you will not feel it being done. When the local anaesthetic wears off after the operation, it is usual to feel some discomfort; this can be reduced by taking pain-relieving tablets. For some clients, it is preferable to do the operation in a hospital or under general anaesthesia, rather than in a clinic.

\section*{Effects of circumcision}

After the operation, the head of the penis is exposed all the time. The skin on the shaft of the penis is left intact. In adults, it is left slightly loose to allow enough skin for erection. The penis looks different and this may take some getting used to. It takes some months for the stitch marks to fade completely.

\section*{Benefits of circumcision}

There is more and more evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of catching HIV infection. In countries where most men are circumcised, the number of people with HIV is much lower than in countries where most men are not circumcised. However, male circumcision gives only partial protection against HIV infection; correct and consistent use of condoms is the best form of protection. Other ways of reducing the risk of acquiring HIV infection include not having sex and reducing the number of sexual partners. Sexual behaviour remains the most important factor in HIV transmission. Avoiding multiple partners and high-risk sexual behaviour, and always using condoms, reduce substantially the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV.

Circumcision also reduces the risk of some other sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes and genital ulcers.

Sometimes circumcision is performed for medical reasons, such as when the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back from the glans. After circumcision, it is much easier to wash the head of the penis and keep it clean.

\section*{Problems and complications after the operation}

\section*{Immediate problems}

Some swelling and discomfort can be expected after the operation, but this normally gets better after the first day or two. No special treatment is needed.

One of the possible complications of circumcision is bleeding or accumulation of blood under the skin. This is because the skin of the penis is less tight than other parts of the body and has a very good blood supply. If a large blood clot forms, it is sometimes necessary to perform another small operation to remove it. If this happens, it may be necessary to stay in hospital for a few days and rest for a week or two.

The wound can become infected, particularly in men with diabetes. The operation is performed in sterile conditions, but the penis is in an area that is not as clean as other parts of the body. The first signs of infection are increasing pain, redness and swelling at the site of the operation. If this happens, you should return to the clinic for follow-up, as antibiotic treatment may be needed. Antibiotics are not given routinely and antibiotic ointment should not be used unless given to you by a nurse or doctor. The actual risk of having a complication, such as bleeding or infection, is about one for every fifty men who have the operation.

If you are unable to pass urine or have any difficulty in doing so, you should return to the clinic for assessment.

Most men get erections during the night while sleeping. If this occurs after the circumcision operation, you may experience some minor discomfort because of pulling on the stitches. This is nothing to worry about.

\section*{Other complications}

Occasionally the head of the penis may remain very sensitive after the operation. This increased sensitivity will become less over the first few weeks, as the skin of the glans becomes slightly thicker.

\section*{Instructions to follow before the operation}

Please bring a pair of well-fitting clean underpants to wear after the operation. They will hold the wound dressing in place for the first day or two. A day or two after the operation, once the dressing has been removed, it is better to wear loose underwear. On the morning of the operation, wash the genital area and the penis carefully with water and mild soap, giving special attention to the area under the foreskin. If you have long pubic hair, it is a good idea to clip this with scissors before the operation, so that it does not interfere with the dressing that will be put on after the circumcision. There is no need to shave your pubic hair in advance of the operation.

You will be more comfortable if you empty your bladder before the operation.

\section*{Instructions to follow after the operation}

In the first three days after the operation, it is helpful to avoid strenuous physical activity and rest at home. Lying on your back means that the penis is the highest point in your body and this takes the pressure off the area. However, you should also walk about regularly, for example to get meals or visit the toilet. You should not ride a bicycle for the first five days after the operation.

Keep the area of the operation dry for 24 hours. Keep the area clean. Do not use any antiseptic cream, ointment or any other substance. If clean water is available, wash carefully twice a day in a shower or sitz bath (a warm-water bath taken in the sitting position, in which the hips and buttocks are in the water). Do not remove the bandage until told to do so by the clinic staff.

The circumcision wound is closed with absorbable stitches. These dissolve by themselves and it is not necessary to return to the clinic to have them removed.

You should return to the clinic if any of the following occurs:
- Continued bleeding from the wound.
- Formation of a large blood clot under the skin near the site of the operation.
- Pain (you will feel some pain when the local anaesthetic wears off, but this should diminish after the first few hours. However, if the pain comes back, return to the clinic).
- Swelling (after the procedure some swelling is normal and return to normal over the first few days. If the swelling gets worse, return to the clinic).
- Discharge of fluid or pus; this may indicate infection.

Avoid any sport or other strenuous activity for $4-6$ weeks. The healing process will be well advanced after 7 days, but it takes 4-6 weeks for the wound to become strong. Full healing
takes longer ( 3 to 4 months). It is best to avoid sexual intercourse or masturbation for the first four to six weeks after circumcision. It is very important to use a condom during sexual intercourse to protect the healing wound for at least six months after the operation. It is always wise to use a condom whenever there is any risk of STI or HIV infection.

\section*{Chapter 4}

\section*{Facilities and supplies, screening of patients and preparations for surgery}

\section*{Summary}
- Circumcision should be performed in appropriate facilities, with proper equipment and supplies.
- Surgical instruments wear out with use and with repeated disinfection and sterilization. Therefore, each clinic should carry out a periodic review of all surgical instruments.
- The surgeon must use good aseptic technique to prevent infection.
- Before circumcision, clients should be assessed for contraindications to surgery and conditions that need treatment or referral.
- The assessment includes history-taking and physical examination.

\section*{EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES}

This chapter describes the facilities and equipment needed to perform male circumcision safely in a clinic setting. The clinic should be equipped with a narrow operating table, which is high enough to allow the surgeon to operate without stooping or bending. Ideally, this should be a purpose-built operating or minor procedures table, which can be pumped up and down according to the surgeon's height. Also, ideally, the table should tip so that, if the client feels faint, he can be put in the headdown position. However, such tables are expensive and circumcision under local anaesthetic can be safely performed with a fixed-height table. Steps can be provided for the client to climb up onto the table, and bricks can be put under the table legs to create the head-down position.

An instrument trolley or table is required on which the instrument tray can be unpacked.

The procedure room floor should be made of material that can be easily cleaned and disinfected. Between cases the instrument trolley and the operating table top should be disinfected. If there is any spillage on the floor, this should be mopped with clean water and detergent and then disinfected. At the end of the operating day, the procedure room should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected starting at the top and continuing to the floor, including all flat surfaces. A liquid disinfectant should be used,
diluted as recommended by the manufacturer. Other parts of the clinic, such as the waiting and recovery areas, should be cleaned regularly with water and detergent.

The lighting in the procedure room should be arranged so that the penis is well lit, and the surgeon can see what he is doing. Ideally, the clinic should be equipped with an operating theatre minor procedures lamp, but these are expensive. Adequate illumination can be provided by fluorescent lighting over the operating table.

Emergency medications and equipment for managing anaphylactic reactions ${ }^{1}$ should be available in or near the procedure room. These should be kept in a clearly labelled box, and the contents should be checked periodically (at least every 6 months) to ensure that they are complete and that none of the medications are approaching or beyond their expiry date. The box should be kept in a cool place, away from direct sunlight. In addition, it is important to have available, in or near the procedure room, alternative antiseptic surgical cleaning solution, such as chlorhexidine, for patients allergic to povidone iodine, and spare sutures and needles.

The following equipment and instruments are required for standard adult male circumcision: ${ }^{2}$
- instrument tray wrapped with sterile drape
- dissecting forceps (finely toothed)
- artery forceps (2 straight, 2 curved)
- curved Metzenbaum's scissors
- stitch scissors
- Mayo's needle holder
- sponge-holding forceps
- scalpel knife handle and blades
- "O" drape ( $80 \mathrm{~cm} \times 80 \mathrm{~cm}$, with $\sim 5 \mathrm{~cm}$ hole)
- gallipot for antiseptic solution (e.g. povidone iodine)
- povidone iodine ( 50 ml of $10 \%$ solution)
- plain gauze swabs ( $10 \times 10 \mathrm{~cm}$; 10 for the procedure, 5 for dressing)
- petroleum-jelly-impregnated gauze ( $5 \times 5 \mathrm{~cm}$ or $5 \times 10 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) (tulle gras) and sticking plaster
- 15 ml of 1\% plain lidocaine (without epinephrine) anaesthetic solution
- syringe, 10 ml (if single-use syringes and needles are unavailable, use equipment suitable for steam sterilization)
- injection needles (18- or 21-gauge)

\footnotetext{
1 Emergency medications and equipment:
Essential: pocket mask with one-way valve, atropine ( $0.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}$ ampoules), epinephrine ( 1 in 1000 solution ( 1 mg in 1 ml ) ampoules).
Desirable: diazepam suppositories for rectal administration ( 10 mg in 2.5 ml ), oxygen supply with mask and reservoir bag, saline for intravenous administration and giving set.

- gentian violet (no more than 5 ml ) or sterile marker pen
- gloves, masks, caps and aprons
- condoms and information materials for client.

A specimen list of the disposable materials required for one adult circumcision is given in Appendix 4.2. Equipment should be disinfected and cleaned as described in Chapter 8.

A detailed discussion of kits and bundles of supplies (consumables, reusable and disposable instrument sets) for efficient delivery of circumcision programmes is included in the WHO document Considerations for implementing models for optimizing the volume and efficiency of male circumcision services. ${ }^{3}$ This discusses various combinations of consumables and supplies required according to circumcision method and approaches to implementing a high throughput circumcision service.

\section*{MAINTENANCE AND REVIEW OF EQUIPMENT}

Surgical instruments wear out with use and with repeated disinfection and sterilization. Each clinic should therefore carry out a periodic review of all surgical instruments. Failure to maintain instruments in good working condition can cause operative difficulties and complications. A haemostatic artery forceps with bent blades, for instance, will not properly occlude a bleeding vessel, while blunt dissection scissors can result in a ragged wound.

\section*{Checklist for haemostatic artery forceps}
- Do the points meet accurately?
- Is the grip on the points worn?
- Does the ratchet lock securely or is it worn?

\section*{Checklist for surgical dissection scissors}
- Is the cutting edge of the blade sharp?
- Do the blades meet securely?
- Is the screw loose?

\section*{Checklist for needle holders}
- Do the points meet accurately?
- Is the grip on the points worn?

\section*{Checklist for dissection forceps (tweezers)}

- Do the points meet accurately (crossed points are a common problem with old instruments)?
- If toothed, are the teeth worn?

\section*{SCREENING ADULT CLIENTS}

The circumcision team needs to ensure that clients are fit for surgery, are well informed about the surgery and are suitable for circumcision under local anaesthesia in their clinic. If there is any doubt as to a client's suitability, he should be referred to the district hospital or higher level of care.

The circumcision team should take a focused medical history and perform a clinical examination of the penis. Both the history and the examination should be documented (see sample record form in Appendix 4.1).

\section*{History}

When taking the medical history, enquire about:
- current general health;
- whether the client is taking any medicines;
- whether the client has any known allergies to medicines;
- history of haemophilia, bleeding disorders or anaemia;
- any current genital infection, ulcer or penile discharge (see Chapter 2);
- whether the client has problems with penile erection or any other concerns about sexual function.

There are few medical contraindications to circumcision under local anaesthesia. However, as for all elective surgery, circumcision should not be performed on anyone suffering from an acute disorder, infection or febrile illness. In this case, the operation should be postponed until the problem has been resolved.

\section*{Physical examination}

The anatomy and structure of the normal penis are described and illustrated in Appendix 4.3. When examining the penis, retract the foreskin and inspect the glans. The urinary opening (urethral meatus) should be near the tip of the glans, and should not be scarred or diseased. The foreskin should be easily retractable and not inflamed or narrowed. If the penis, glans, meatus and foreskin are healthy, the client is suitable for circumcision in the clinic.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 4.1 Appearance of the normal penis. A: Uncircumcised. B: Circumcised}
\end{figure}

Absolute contraindications to clinic-based circumcision include:
- Anatomical abnormality of the penis. Men whose urethral meatus is on the underside of the penis (hypospadias) or on the upper side of the penis (epispadias) must not be circumcised, because the foreskin may be needed in a repair operation (see illustrations in Appendix 4.4).
- Chronic paraphimosis. In this situation the foreskin is permanently retracted. It is thickened and swollen, and the client will indicate that this is a longstanding problem (see illustration in Appendix 4.4).
- Genital ulcer disease. This should be investigated and treated (see Chapter 2). Once treatment has been completed, the client may be suitable for clinic-based circumcision.
- Urethral discharge. This should be investigated and treated (see Chapter 2). Once treatment has been completed the client may be suitable for clinic-based circumcision.
- Other obvious visible pathology, such as penile cancer. The client should be referred to a specialist.
- Chronic disorders of the penis and foreskin, such as filariasis (a parasitic infestation that blocks the lymph ducts and prevents drainage). The client should be referred to a specialist.
- Bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia. The client should be referred to a higher level. Careful preoperative assessment and medical preparation are required, and there may be a need to give a preoperative infusion of factor VIII, or to give vitamin K or other medication.

There are a number of relative contraindications to clinic-based circumcision. Whether circumcision can go ahead in these circumstances will depend on the experience of the surgeon. They include:
- A tight foreskin as a result of scar tissue (phimosis). This may make it impossible to retract the foreskin (see illustration in Appendix 4.4). If there is a history of penile discharge or repeated infections (balanitis), the client should be referred to a specialist. Thick adhesions between the glans and foreskin may also require referral to a specialist.
- Scar tissue at the frenulum. Sometimes young men suffer from repeated tearing of the frenulum. This can result in thick scar tissue in the frenulum area and may make circumcision and healing more difficult.
- Penile warts. Penile warts can cause a lot of bleeding. Whether the circumcision can proceed will depend on the extent of the warts. It is usually possible to proceed with circumcision if there are one or two small warts on the foreskin, as these will be removed with the foreskin. However, if there are extensive warts, circumcision is best undertaken in a specialist hospital where diathermy is available.
- Balanitis xerotica obliterans. This is a plaque of scar tissue that extends onto the surface of the glans and involves the urethral meatus and the foreskin. It is also called lichen planus et atrophicus. In mild cases, circumcision can proceed as normal. If the process involves the urethral meatus, the client should be referred to a district hospital or specialist centre where, in addition to the foreskin being removed, the meatus may be widened.
- Other abnormalities of the genitalia, such as hydrocele causing scrotal swelling. The patient should be referred to a specialist centre for assessment.

\section*{HIV testing and informed consent for surgery}

All men requesting circumcision for HIV prevention should be offered an HIV test, and appropriate post-test counselling. The purpose of this test is to ensure that more people in the community know their HIV status and are thus better able to take care of themselves, either to remain free of HIV infection, or to take medicine that will slow the progression to AIDS.

While an HIV test is recommended for all men requesting circumcision to reduce their risk of HIV infection, the test is not mandatory before the operation can be performed. No person should be forced to have an HIV test against his or her will, and men have the right to refuse without affecting their clinical care. The purpose of the HIV test is not to protect the clinic staff from HIV infection - they should, in any case, take
standard precautions to avoid infection with HIV and other organisms, and to avoid passing such infections from one patient to another. Men who are found to be infected with HIV can safely have a circumcision procedure, provided they are clinically healthy, but there is no point in having a circumcision to reduce the risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. It is most important that men with HIV infection take steps to reduce the likelihood of transmitting the virus to others by avoiding penetrative sexual intercourse or always using condoms.

The circumcision team should ensure that the client has been informed about the risks and benefits of male circumcision as described in Chapter 3. This information should be given in an understandable way, using everyday local language. The oral information should be backed up by written information sheets in the local language. After receiving the information the client should be allowed to ask questions. He should then be given time to reflect before being asked to sign the certificate of consent. An example information sheet and consent certificate can be found in the appendices to Chapter 3.

\section*{PREOPERATIVE WASHING BY THE PATIENT}

On the day of surgery, the client should wash his genital area and penis with water and soap, retracting the foreskin and washing under it. This ensures that the genital area is clean before he comes to the clinic. Immediately before the operation, the skin should be further cleaned with povidone iodine (see Chapter 5).

If the pubic hair is long and likely to get in the way of surgery or interfere with the dressing, it should be clipped before the patient enters the operating room. The patient can do this at home on the day of surgery, or it can be done at the clinic. Shaving is not necessary.

The patient should be given the opportunity to empty his bladder before going into the operating room.

\section*{SCRUBBING AND PUTTING ON PROTECTIVE CLOTHING}

Before entering the operating room area, all members of the surgical team should:
- Remove all jewellery and ensure nails are trimmed or filed.
- Remove any artificial nails or nail polish.
- Wash hands and arms up to the elbow with a nonmedicated soap.
- Make sure hands and nails are not visibly soiled.

Before the circumcision operation, anyone who will touch the sterile surgical field, the surgical instruments or the wound
should scrub their hands and arms to the elbows. Scrubbing cannot completely sterilize the skin, but will decrease the bacterial load and risk of wound contamination from the hands. Each scrub should take 5 minutes, and the process should be done at the start of the operating session and, if more than one circumcision is planned, between each operation.

The scrub can be done with a medicated soap and water, or with an alcohol-based preparation.

Surgical scrub with a medicated soap (Fig. 4.2)
- Start timing.
- Using a medicated soap, scrub each side of each finger, between fingers, and the back and front of each hand.
- Wash each side of the arms from wrists to elbows.
- Keep your hands higher than your arms at all times during the procedure.
- Rinse hands and arms by passing them through the water in one direction only, from fingertips to elbow. Do not move your arms back and forth.
- After scrubbing, hold up your arms to allow the water to drip off your elbows.
- Turn off the tap with your elbow.

}
- Dry the hands and arms with a sterile towel. Make sure the towel does not become contaminated by coming into contact with non-sterile surfaces.
- Hold your hands and forearms away from your body and higher than your elbows until you have put on the gloves (or gown and gloves, if gown is used) (Fig. 4.3).

Surgical scrub with an alcohol-based preparation
- Start timing.
- Use sufficient alcohol hand rub to keep the hands and forearms wet throughout the scrub.
- Rub each side of each finger, between fingers, the back and front of each hand, and each side of the arms from wrist to elbow.
- Allow hands and forearms to dry thoroughly.

After scrubbing, put on sterile operating gloves, taking care not to contaminate the sterile outer surface of the gloves (Fig. 4.3).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-067.jpg?height=889&width=912&top_left_y=1199&top_left_x=685}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 4.3 Putting on surgical gloves}
\end{figure}

Surgical gloves prevent transmission of HIV, hepatitis and other infections through contact with blood. However, there is always a possibility that a glove will be accidentally punctured. If this happens during an operation, promptly remove the glove, rinse the hand with antiseptic, and put on a new sterile glove. If the glove has leaked as a result of the puncture, re-scrub before putting on new gloves. Patient safety is of primary concern; do not compromise it. Change gloves only when it is safe for the patient. For example, if the patient is bleeding a lot,
stop the bleeding with an artery forceps before changing the punctured glove.

\section*{Whether to use a gown}

A surgical gown is recommended, though a circumcision operation may be performed with the surgeon wearing sterile operating gloves but without a sterile gown, or using full operating theatre gowning techniques. It is less expensive to use gloves only, and this is the practice in many clinic settings. The surgeon should, in any case, wear a clean theatre uniform, cap and theatre shoes. If a surgical gown is not used, it is important that the surgeon wears a clean apron to protect clothes from splashes during the operation.

\section*{Face masks and protective eyewear}

Face masks are recommended, as they reduce droplet contamination if the surgeon coughs or sneezes, and protect the surgeon's mouth from any spray of blood droplets. Eyewear is also recommended, and should be worn (together with a mask) whenever an accidental splash of blood onto the face is likely.

\section*{Appendix 4.3}

\section*{DETAILED ANATOMY OF THE PENIS}

It is important for the surgeon to have a good understanding of penile anatomy before undertaking male circumcision.

The penis is composed of two interconnected erectile bodies, the corpora cavernosa, which are attached and thus anchored to the underside of the front of the pubic bones. During erection, these bodies fill with blood, making the penis rigid. The wall of the erectile bodies is made of tough elastic tissue - the tunica albuginea. The urethra is on the underside of the corpora cavernosa. Surrounding the urethra is a quilt of erectile tissue, the corpus spongiosum, which continues and expands at the distal end of the penis to form the glans; this is like a helmet across the ends of the corpora cavernosa. The corpus spongiosum contributes to engorgement of the glans and to some expansion of the girth of the penis, but does not contribute significantly to its rigidity.

The urethra runs along the underside of the penis to the tip of the glans. The urethral meatus should be at the tip of the glans. In the malformation called hypospadias, it may emerge on the underside of the glans in the corona. Minor variations in the position of the urethral meatus are very common and do not require any treatment, provided that the man is able to pass urine freely and has a straight penile erection. The foreskin is the fold of skin that covers the glans when the penis is soft; during sexual intercourse, the foreskin is pulled back away from the glans. In the midline of the underside of the penis, there is a band of skin - the frenulum - which helps the foreskin to return to its usual position. Immediately underneath the frenulum is the frenular artery, which can cause troublesome bleeding during circumcision procedures. Immediately underneath the frenular artery is the urethra. It is important to understand the relative positions of the urethra, the frenular artery and the frenulum, because the urethra can easily be injured during attempts to stop bleeding from the frenular artery. The urethra is also vulnerable to injury in babies, because the tissue between the frenulum and the urethra is very thin and delicate.

The erectile bodies (corpora cavernosa), the urethra and its erectile tissue (corpus spongiosum) are in turn held together by a tough penile fascia (Buck's fascia). The penis has a plentiful blood supply from the internal iliac arteries in the pelvis via the pudendal arteries. These in turn divide to give rise to the dorsal penile artery on each side and an artery in the centre of each erectile body. In addition there are many small arteries linking these.

The dorsal penile nerves are located on the upper aspect of the penis, slightly to the side of the midline and deep to the penile fascia. At the base of the penis, these nerves are relatively compact but as they run towards the glans the nerve fibres fan out. This is why, in a penile block, most of the local anaesthetic is injected at the 1 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions at the base of the penis (see Chapter 5).

\section*{Surgical procedures for adults and adolescents}

\section*{SUMMARY}

This chapter gives step-by-step instructions for performing a circumcision on an adult or an adolescent. It covers tissue handling, skin preparation, local anaesthesia, the circumcision itself, suturing, and dressing the wound.

Three surgical techniques are described:
- the forceps-guided method;
- the dorsal slit method;
- the sleeve resection method.

\section*{SURGICAL SKILLS REQUIRED FOR SAFE CIRCUMCISION}

\section*{Anatomy of the penis and choice of surgical technique}

It is important to have a good understanding of penile anatomy before undertaking male circumcision. This is described and illustrated in detail in Chapter 4 and Appendix 4.3. Variations in technique for minor abnormalities of the foreskin are described in Appendix 5.1.

Three widely-used surgical techniques for adult and adolescent circumcision are described in detail in this chapter. They have been selected on the basis of extensive experience worldwide, as well as the results from three randomized controlled trials of circumcision in Kenya, South Africa and Uganda. It is not recommended that a nursing, clinical or medical officer learn all three surgical techniques - it is best to become a master of one adult technique and, if appropriate, one paediatric technique. This will produce the best results with the least complications. Providers should become expert in the technique most suited to the circumstances of their practice or the preferred technique adopted nationally. All three recommended techniques are fully illustrated and can be referred to in the context of a training course. After the training the illustrations and step-by-step guide can be used to reinforce what has been learnt and for retraining. Experienced surgeons should be able to perform all three techniques with little difficulty, and to train less experienced providers in any of the three techniques described.

\section*{Tissue handling}

The surgeon should handle tissue gently. Unnecessary crushing of tissue causes more scarring, delays healing and increases the risk of infection. Use dissecting forceps (tweezers) to hold the skin edge when suturing the circumcision wound; do not use artery forceps. Place haemostatic sutures accurately, taking care to avoid inserting the needle too deep into the surrounding tissue.

\section*{Haemostasis ${ }^{\text {a }}$}

Minimizing blood loss is part of good surgical technique and safe medical practice. It is very important, particularly for men who are anaemic. (Ideally, these men should not be circumcised in the clinic, but should be referred to a hospital.) Another important reason to minimize blood loss is to reduce contamination of instruments, operating theatre drapes and gowns, to lower the risk of transmitting blood-borne diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B, to theatre staff.

The following techniques can be used to reduce blood loss.
Compression. After the incision has been made, and at any time during the procedure, oozing of blood from cut surfaces can be controlled by applying pressure over a gauze swab for a few minutes. Usually, this will stop the bleeding.

Temporary occlusion of blood vessels. Control individual bleeding vessels by applying an artery forceps to the blood vessel (Fig 5.1), grasping a minimal amount of adjacent tissue.

An alternative technique is to pick up the vessel using forceps (tweezers) and then apply an artery forceps (Fig 5.2).

Tying and under-running. Either tie the vessel or under-run and tie it. The simplest procedure is to tie the vessel below the artery forceps (Fig. 5.3). The basic tie consists of two throws (Fig. 5.3A), but many surgeons make a third throw (Fig. 5.3B) to give the knot extra security.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

It is important to ensure that the tie is securely placed and not liable to slip off, particularly in the first few days following the operation during a penile erection. If there is any doubt about the security of the tie, it is better to use the under-running technique (Fig. 5.4). Secure the bleeding vessel with an artery forceps. Pass the suture needle just beneath the artery (not too deep!) and pull through, leaving enough suture material for the tie. Then pass the suture beneath the vessel a second time, pull gently to occlude it, and tie a knot, as above.

\section*{Diathermy}

In surgical diathermy coagulation is achieved by creating heat with an electrical current passing through the tissue. The techniques described in this manual can all be undertaken safely without diathermy equipment and any surgeon undertaking male circumcision should be adept at stopping bleeding without diathermy. Diathermy has the advantage of decreasing haemostasis time thereby reducing the total procedure time.

Monopolar and bipolar diathermy: There are two diathermy electrical circuits in common use - monopolar and bipolar. With monopolar diathermy the current runs from the machine through the diathermy forceps, through the tissue held by the forceps, through the patient's body to a grounding plate, and then back to the machine. In bipolar diathermy the current runs from the machine to one of the two prongs of the diathermy forceps, through the tissue grasped between the prongs and then back through the other prong to the machine. With both types care must be taken to ensure that the patient is not in contact with any metal or conducting material as there is a risk of earth leakage and burns at the point of contact. This risk is greatest with monopolar diathermy. Whenever diathermy is used, care must be taken in positioning on the operating table, the choice of operating table and clinic construction to prevent current leakage to earth. Some monopolar diathermy machines include automatic safety switch off in case of earth leakage, disconnected grounding plate, or poor contact between the grounding plate and skin. The grounding plate should be placed to ensure the whole surface is in contact with the patient's skin, usually on the thigh or buttocks. It may be necessary to shave hairs to ensure good contact.

If the machine fails to respond when the surgeon activates the current or there is no obvious and immediate visual evidence of coagulation, the surgeon should immediately stop applying current and check all connections. If current continues to flow, burns may occur where resistance is greatest, most commonly where the grounding plate is in contact with the body, or where the body is in contact with metal. In rare circumstances the burn may occur elsewhere in the body. Monopolar diathermy should not be used for infant circumcision because the point of greatest electrical resistance may be at the base of the penis with risk of coagulation and loss of the whole penis.

Further technical description of the current types is beyond the scope of this manual but the circumcision surgeon should be aware that many diathermy machines have different settings for coagulation or cutting currents. Only the former should be used for haemostasis.

Diathermy technique: When using diathermy, the surgeon should apply the forceps as precisely as possible. The best results will be obtained if the blood vessel is grasped between the diathermy prongs with minimal other tissue, and the current activated for the shortest time required to ensure haemostasis. If too much tissue is grasped, diathermy will not stop the bleeding because the heat is too diffuse. Prolonged diathermy causing large black burns should be avoided as these may increase the risk of infection, post operative pain or scar tissue formation. Particular care must be taken near the frenulum because there is a risk of burning through to the urethra which is near to the surface and creating a fistula. Diathermy should also be used with caution close to the skin and mucosal edges as transmitted heat may cause burns. Diathermy can be used to stop bleeding from small blood vessels, but it is safer to apply an artery forceps and tie or under-run larger vessels as described above.

\section*{Suture material}

Suture size is a compromise between ensuring adequate tensile strength and keeping the amount of foreign material to a minimum. Larger suture sizes produce a more unsightly scar, and small lumps can persist when large-size sutures have been used to tie the blood vessels. The preferred suture size for adult male circumcision is 3-0 or 4-0 chromic gut or vicryl rapide. Vicryl rapide is more expensive than chromic gut. The suture may be mounted on a taper-cut, round-bodied or reverse-cutting needle, according to the surgeon's preference. The taper-cut needle passes more easily through the skin, but easily tears the skin on the inner aspect at the corona.

\section*{Suturing}

The following are the basic suturing techniques:
Simple interrupted suture. This is the simplest type of stitch and results in good apposition. The point of the needle should pass through the skin at 90 degrees to the skin surface and exit at the same angle (Fig. 5.5). The nearer to the skin edge the needle goes in, the better the skin edge apposition but the higher the risk of the stitch cutting out. If the stitches are placed at a greater distance from the wound edge,
there is a risk of inversion (burying) of the skin edges and poor healing. For this reason, in male circumcision, a combination of simple and mattress sutures is recommended.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-086.jpg?height=420&width=1012&top_left_y=411&top_left_x=616}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.5 Simple interrupted suture. A: suture in place holding the skin edges together. B: simple sutures closing the circumcision incision.}
\end{figure}

Mattress sutures. Mattress sutures give a more precise apposition of the wound edges and reduce the risk of burying the skin edges. They are more complex than simple interrupted sutures, and therefore more time-consuming to put in.

Vertical mattress suture
The technique is illustrated in Fig. 5.6.
1. Start the first bite wide of the incision and pass to the same position on the other side of the wound.
2. Start the second bite on the side of the incision where the needle has just exited the skin. Pass the needle through the skin between the exit point and the wound edge, in line with the original entry point. From this point, take a small bite; the final exit point is in a similar position on the other side of the wound.
3. Tie the knot so that it does not lie over the incision line. This suture approximates the subcutaneous tissue and the skin edge.

When suturing the circumcision wound, vertical mattress sutures are usually placed in the 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions (taking the frenulum as the 6 o'clock position).

Horizontal mattress suture
The technique is illustrated in Fig. 5.7.
1. Make two sutures, aligned beside one another. Align the first stitch across the wound; begin the second on the side that the first ends.
2. Tie the knot on the side of the original entry point.

A horizontal mattress suture is placed in the 6 o'clock position (frenulum).

\section*{Tying knots}

Knots can be tied by hand or using instruments. It is more economical to tie knots using instruments, as this uses less suture material (Fig. 5.9).

\section*{SKIN PREPARATION AND DRAPING}

\section*{Skin preparation with povidone iodine}

Prepare the skin with povidone iodine antiseptic solution, starting with the glans and the shaft of the penis, and moving out to the periphery. Holding the penis with a swab, retract the foreskin in order to clean the glans. The prepared area should include the penis, the scrotum, the adjacent areas of the thighs and the lower part of the abdomen (suprapubic area), so that there is no risk of the surgeon touching unprepared skin during the procedure. If the patient has a history of allergy to iodine, use an alternative solution, such as chlorhexidine gluconate. The solution should remain wet on the skin for at least two minutes.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.10 Preoperative skin preparation with povidone iodine}
\end{figure}

\section*{Draping}

Draping provides a sterile operative field and helps prevent contamination of the wound. The edges of the drapes that hang below the operating table are considered to be non-sterile.

Scrub and put on gown (if worn) and gloves before covering the patient with sterile drapes. Leave uncovered only the operative area and the areas where the anaesthetic will be administered. A single drape with a hole in it for the penis is better than four drapes secured with towel clips (Fig. 5.11).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.11 Draping for male circumcision. The minimum sterile operative field is shown by the dotted lines.}
\end{figure}

\section*{ANAESTHESIA}

Circumcision can be done under general or local anaesthesia. Local anaesthesia is preferred, because it is less risky and less expensive. There are two possible techniques for local penile anaesthesia: the penile nerve block and the ring block. The ring block technique is used for circumcision of adults and adolescents and described below. The penile nerve block is used for circumcision of infants and described in Chapter 6.

\section*{Penile nerve supply}

The nerve supply of the penis is the twin dorsal penile nerves. These nerves are located on the top and sides of the penis, at the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock position near the base of the penis. They fan out towards the glans.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-092.jpg?height=664&width=886&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=616}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.12 Nerve supply to the penis. The twin dorsal penile nerves emerge from under the pubic bone at the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions and fan out towards the glans.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Maximum dose of local anaesthetic}

The local anaesthetic most often used is $1 \%$ plain lidocaine. The maximum dose that can safely be given is 3 mg per kg of body weight. The table below gives example volumes so that this maximum dose is not exceeded.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{4}{|l|}{Examples of maximum safe volume of plain lidocaine ( 3 mg per kg body weight).} \\
\hline Patient & 0.5\% lidocaine ( 5 mg per ml) & 1\% lidocaine ( 10 mg per ml ) & 2\% lidocaine ( 20 mg per ml ) \\
\hline 3 kg infant (e.g. 8 days old ) & 1.8 ml & 0.9 ml & Not applicable \\
\hline 15 kg boy (e.g. age 4 years) & 9 ml & 4.5 ml & 2.25 ml \\
\hline 40 kg boy & 24 ml & 12 ml & 6 ml \\
\hline 70 kg man & Not applicable & 21 ml & 10.5 ml \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Lidocaine with epinephrine must not be used because there is a risk of constriction of the blood vessels to the whole penis, which can cause gangrene and loss of the penis.

The advantage of lidocaine is that it works rapidly. An alternative is a mixture of 5 ml of lidocaine, 1\%, and 5 ml of plain bupivacaine, $0.25 \%$. This is more expensive but has the advantage of providing longerlasting anaesthesia (up to 4-5 hours after the operation).

\section*{Safe injection of local anaesthetic}

It is the surgeon's responsibility to check the vial of anaesthetic, to ensure that the correct agent at the correct concentration has been selected, and to check the expiry date. It is important to verify that the anaesthetic is clear and that there are no visible particles, which may suggest that the vial is contaminated.

Once the needle is in place, but before injecting any anaesthetic, the surgeon should gently aspirate to make sure that no blood enters the syringe. This is to ensure that anaesthetic is not injected into a blood vessel. This safety precaution should be repeated each time the needle is moved, before any additional anaesthetic is injected.

\section*{Additional analgesia}

Analgesics, such as paracetamol, may be given after the operation. However, best practice is to give one paracetamol tablet (adult dose $500 \mathrm{mg}) 1-2$ hours before surgery, and one tablet for the patient to take 6 hours later. This produces better postoperative analgesia than postoperative tablets alone.

\section*{Ring block technique}

Using a fine (23-gauge) needle, inject approximately 0.1 ml of anaesthetic subcutaneously at the 11 o'clock position. Then, without withdrawing the needle, advance it into the subdermal space, making sure that the needle is freely mobile. At this point, inject $2-3 \mathrm{ml}$ of anaesthetic to block the dorsal penile nerves (Fig. 5.13). Then advance the needle subcutaneously around the side of the penis and inject an additional 1 ml of anaesthetic. Withdraw the needle and repeat the procedure, starting at the 1 o'clock position so as to complete a ring of anaesthetic. In some cases it may be necessary to make an additional injection on the underside of the penis to fully complete the ring of anaesthetic. After injection, massage the base of the penis for 10-20 seconds to increase the diffusion of the lidocaine into the surrounding tissues. Once the anaesthetic has been injected, the surgeon should wait for 3-5 minutes (timed by the clock). A common mistake is to start the procedure before the anaesthetic has had time to work. Sensation should be tested before starting the surgery. This can be done by gently pinching the foreskin with an artery forceps. If there is any residual sensation, the surgeon should wait for a further 2-3 minutes and test again. If there is still sensation, more local anaesthetic should be given. Sometimes, it helps to give additional local anaesthetic separately to the frenulum area, but usually the ring block at the base of the penis is sufficient.

\section*{RETRACTION OF THE FORESKIN AND DEALING WITH ADHESIONS}

This step is common to all the methods of circumcision described below. After effective local anaesthesia has been achieved, the foreskin should be fully retracted. If the opening of the foreskin is tight, it may be necessary to dilate it with a pair of artery forceps (Fig. 5.15), but this is not usually necessary in adults and adolescents. Care must be taken to stretch just the aperture of the foreskin and not to push the forceps in too far, because there is a risk of dilating the urethra and causing injury to the urethra and glans.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-095.jpg?height=284&width=854&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=628}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.15 Dilation of the aperture of the foreskin. Do not push the forceps in too far, in order to avoid injury to the urethra}
\end{figure}

Once the foreskin has been retracted, separate any adhesions by gentle traction or using a blunt probe, such as a pair of closed artery forceps (Fig. 5.16). If adhesions are particularly dense, the surgeon may decide to abandon the procedure and refer the patient to a more experienced surgeon.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.16 Retracting the foreskin to fully expose the glans and separate any adhesions}
\end{figure}

\section*{MARKING THE LINE OF THE CIRCUMCISION}

This step is common to all the methods of circumcision described below. With the foreskin returned to a natural "resting" position, indicate the intended line of the incision with a marker pen. The line should correspond with the corona, just under the head of the penis (Fig. 5.17). Some uncircumcised men have a very lax foreskin, which is partially retracted in the resting position. In such cases it is better to apply artery forceps at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions, to apply a little tension to the foreskin before marking the circumcision line (illustrated in Fig 5.28 below). However, it is important not to pull the foreskin too hard before marking the line, as this will result in too much skin being removed.

If a marker pen is not available, dabs of gentian violet may be applied with a blunt probe, the tip of an artery forceps or other sterile instrument. Pinch marks made with a toothed forceps are also an alternative.

\section*{SURGICAL METHODS}

Three widely used methods of circumcision are described below. All three methods produce a good long-term result, but require different levels of skill. The sleeve method produces an excellent result, but requires the highest level of surgical skill. The forceps-guided method produces a less tidy result initially, but has the advantage that it is a simple technique suitable for a clinic setting. In clinical trials it has been shown to produce consistently good results with low complication rates. It cannot be used for men with phimosis, since the foreskin cannot be fully retracted. The dorsal slit method is probably the most widely used method worldwide.

At present, devices similar to those used for paediatric circumcision (see Chapter 6) are either not available or not suitable for adult circumcision. Evidence is needed from clinical trials before such devices can be recommended.

\section*{Forceps-guided method of circumcision}

This is a simple step-by-step procedure, which can be learnt by surgeons and surgical assistants who are relatively new to surgery. It can be used in clinics with limited resources, and it can be done without an assistant. A disadvantage of the procedure is that it leaves between 0.5 and 1.0 cm of mucosal skin proximal to the corona. The forceps-guided technique was used in the South African and Kenyan trials of circumcision and HIV infection. The version described here was standardized by the Kenyan study team.

Step 1. Prepare skin, drape and administer anaesthesia, as described above.

Step 2. Retract the foreskin and separate any adhesions, as described above.

Step 3. Mark the intended line of the incision, as described above.

Step 4. Grasp the foreskin at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions with two artery forceps. Place these forceps on the natural apex of the foreskin, in such a way as to put equal tension on the inside and outside surfaces of the foreskin. If this is not done correctly, there is a risk of leaving too much mucosal skin or of removing too much shaft skin.

Step 5. Put sufficient tension on the foreskin to pull the previously made mark to just beyond the glans. Taking care not to catch the glans, apply a long straight forceps across the foreskin, just proximal to the mark, with the long axis of the forceps going from the 6 o'clock to the 12 o'clock position (taking the frenulum as the 6 o'clock position).

Once the forceps is in position, feel the glans to check that it has not been accidentally caught in the forceps.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.18 Forceps-guided method. The forceps is applied taking care not to catch the glans.}
\end{figure}

Step 6. Using a scalpel, cut away the foreskin flush with the outer aspect of the forceps. The forceps protects the glans from injury, but nevertheless, particular care is needed at this stage.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Fig. 5.19 Forceps-guided method. Cutting off the foreskin.}
\end{figure}

Step 7. Pull back the skin to expose the raw area. Clip any bleeding vessels with artery forceps. Take care to catch the blood vessels as accurately as possible and with minimal adjacent tissue. Tie each vessel (see Fig. 5.3 and 5.4) or under-run with a suture and tie off. Take care not to place haemostatic stitches too deeply. When dealing with bleeding in the frenular area or on the underside of the penis, care must be taken not to injure the urethra.

Step 8. Place a horizontal mattress suture at the frenulum. The technique is shown in Fig. 5.5.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Fig 5.22 Horizontal mattress suture at the frenulum (6 o'clock position)}
\end{figure}

When placing the frenulum suture, take care to align the midline skin raphe with the line of the frenulum (Fig. 5.23). A common error is to misalign the frenulum and the midline skin raphe, which results in misalignment of the whole circumcision closure.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.23 Alignment of the midline skin raphe on the shaft of the penis and the line of the frenulum.}
\end{figure}

Step 9. Place a vertical mattress suture opposite the frenulum, in the 12 o'clock position (Fig. 5.24). The suture should be placed so that there is an equal amount of skin on each side of the penis between the 12 and 6 o'clock positions. The technique of vertical mattress suture is shown in Fig. 5.6. Place two further vertical mattress stitches in the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions (see Fig. 5.8).

\end{figure}

It is helpful to leave a long end on the horizontal mattress suture at the frenulum (at the 6 o'clock position) and on the vertical mattress suture opposite (at the 12 o'clock position). The long ends of the sutures can be held by an assistant with artery forceps to stabilize the penis during suturing (Fig. 5.25).

\begin{figure}

\caption{Fig. 5.25 Penis is stabilized by an assistant holding two artery forceps (arrows) attached to the long ends of the 6 and 12 o'clock sutures}
\end{figure}

Step 10. After placement of the sutures at the $6,12,3$ and 9 o'clock positions, place two or more simple sutures in the gaps between them. The technique of simple interrupted sutures is shown in Fig. 5.5.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-102.jpg?height=598&width=1432&top_left_y=251&top_left_x=365)

Depending on the skin pigmentation, there may be a strong contrast between the colour of the penile shaft skin and the remaining mucosa. With time the exposed mucosal skin will become darker and the contrast less marked.

Step 11. Once the procedure is finished, check for bleeding. If there is none, apply a dressing (see "Dressing" at the end of this chapter).

\section*{Dorsal slit method of circumcision}

The dorsal slit method requires more surgical skill than the forcepsguided method. It is helpful to have an assistant present during the procedure, although it can be done without one. There is a risk that more skin is cut away from one side than the other, giving an asymmetric result. Nevertheless, the technique is widely used by general and urological surgeons throughout the world. It is the technique illustrated in the WHO manual, Surgical care at the district hospital. ${ }^{1}$

Step 1. Prepare skin, drape and administer anaesthesia, as described above.

Step 2. Retract the foreskin and remove any adhesions, as described above.

Step 3. Mark the intended line of the incision, as described above.

Step 4 (optional). Some surgeons prefer to mark the line of incision by making a very shallow incision using a scalpel. This is useful on a deeply pigmented man on whom it is difficult to see the line of the marking pen or dabs of gentian violet. Before making the shallow incision, check carefully that the incision line is level with the corona and that even amounts of skin are marked for removal from each side of the penis. The incision should be made just through the skin; it is very important not to cut too deeply and divide blood vessels (Fig. 5.27).

One disadvantage of marking the line of incision with a scalpel is that there may be an increased risk of accidental injury to the surgical staff. In addition, a relatively inexperienced surgeon may cut too deeply. However, these risks must be balanced against the risk of a poor result of the circumcision operation if the marking is difficult to see and too much or uneven amounts of skin are removed.

Fig. 5.27 Superficial incision used to mark the line of incision on a man with deeply pigmented skin.

Step 5. Grasp the foreskin with artery forceps at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. Take care to apply the artery forceps so that there is equal tension on the inner and outer aspects of the foreskin (Fig 5.28).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-104.jpg?height=632&width=1335&top_left_y=588&top_left_x=479}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.28 Tensioning the foreskin.}
\end{figure}

Step 6. Place two artery forceps on the foreskin in the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions (Fig. 5.29). Check that the inside blades of the two artery forceps are lying between the glans and foreskin, and have not been inadvertently passed up the urethral meatus.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-104.jpg?height=652&width=1340&top_left_y=1584&top_left_x=422}

\caption{Fig. 5.29 Placing artery forceps at the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions (In the drawing the forceps in 3 and 9 o'clock positions are not shown).}
\end{figure}

Step 7. Between the two artery forceps, in the 12 o'clock position, use dissection scissors to make a cut (the dorsal slit) up to but not beyond the previously marked incision line (Fig. 5.30).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.30 Cutting the dorsal slit}

Step 8. Using dissection scissors, cut the foreskin free, following the previously marked circumcision line (Fig. 5.31).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.31 Cutting away the foreskin with dissection scissors}
\end{figure}

Step 9. Any skin tags on the inner edge of the foreskin can be trimmed to leave approximately 5 mm of skin proximal to the corona (Fig. 5.32). Care must be taken to trim only the skin and not to cut deeper tissue.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-106.jpg?height=649&width=1220&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=599}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.32 Trimming the inner edge of the foreskin}
\end{figure}

Step 10. Stop any bleeding and suture, as described in steps 7-10 of the forceps-guided method.

Step 11. Check for bleeding. If there is none, apply a dressing (see "Dressing" at the end of this chapter).

\section*{Sleeve resection method of circumcision}

The sleeve resection method requires good surgical skill and is better suited to a hospital rather than a clinic setting. The technique requires an assistant. If bipolar diathermy is available the procedure can be virtually bloodless. Although the cosmetic results are better than with the other two techniques, there is more room for surgical error, either by cutting too deep when making the two circular incisions or cutting too deep when dissecting the skin flap free.

Step 1. Prepare skin, drape and administer anaesthesia, as described above.

Step 2. Retract the foreskin and remove any adhesions, as described above.

Step 3. Mark the intended outer line of the incision, as described above (Fig. 5.33), with a $\vee$ shape, pointed towards the frenulum, on the underside (ventral aspect) of the penis (Fig. 5.34). The apex of the V should correspond with the midline raphe.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-107.jpg?height=553&width=1377&top_left_y=1244&top_left_x=605}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.34 A V is marked on the ventral side (underside) of the penis, with its point towards the frenulum.}
\end{figure}

Step 4. Retract the foreskin and mark the inner (mucosal) incision line, $1-2 \mathrm{~mm}$ proximal to the corona. At the frenulum, the incision line crosses horizontally (Fig. 5.35).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-108.jpg?height=643&width=1143&top_left_y=411&top_left_x=602}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.35 Marking the inner incision line}
\end{figure}

Step 5. Using a scalpel, make incisions along the marked lines, taking care to cut through the skin to the subcutaneous tissue but not deeper (Fig. 5.36, 5.37 and 5.38). As the incision is made, the assistant should retract the skin with a moist gauze swab.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-108.jpg?height=455&width=1052&top_left_y=1382&top_left_x=599}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.37 Incising the $\vee$ shape on the underside of the penis}
\end{figure}

Any significant bleeding vessels should be clipped with an artery forceps and tied or secured with an under-running suture. Provided the cut has not been made too deeply, most bleeding will be from the skin edge and can be stopped by simple pressure over a swab.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.38 Completed incisions leaving a sleeve of foreskin}
\end{figure}

Step 6. Cut the skin between the proximal and distal incisions with scissors, as shown in Fig. 5.39.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-109.jpg?height=526&width=1103&top_left_y=1359&top_left_x=605}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.39 Cutting the skin between the two incisions}
\end{figure}

Step 7. Hold the sleeve of foreskin under tension with two artery forceps, and dissect the skin from the shaft of the penis, using dissection scissors (Fig. 5.40).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-110.jpg?height=580&width=1191&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=608}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.40 Dissecting the sleeve of skin away from the shaft of the penis.}
\end{figure}

Tie off any bleeding vessels with under-running sutures.

Step 8. Stop any bleeding and suture, as described in steps $7-10$ of the forceps-guided method.

Step 9. Once the wound has been sutured, check for bleeding. If there is none, apply a dressing as described below.

\section*{DRESSING}

Irrespective of the method of circumcision, a standard penile dressing technique is used.

Check that there is no bleeding. Minor bleeding from a skin edge will often stop after five minutes of pressure with a gauze. Once all bleeding has stopped, place a piece of petroleum-jelly-impregnated gauze (tulle gras) around the wound. Place a sterile dry gauze over this, and secure in position with adhesive tape (Fig 5.41). Take care not to apply the dressing too tightly, as it could restrict the blood supply and cause necrosis of the glans.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-111.jpg?height=444&width=1192&top_left_y=810&top_left_x=616}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.41 Standard dressing.}
\end{figure}

The dressing should be left in position no longer than 48 hours. Either the patient can return to the clinic where the circumcision was performed, or go to another clinic for postoperative follow-up and removal of the dressing. If the dressing has dried out, it should be gently dabbed with antiseptic solution (aqueous cetrimide) until it softens. It can then be removed gently (Fig 5.42). It is important not to disrupt the wound by pulling at a dressing that has dried to the wound.

\section*{Appendix 5.1}

\section*{VARIATIONS IN TECHNIQUE FOR MINOR ABNORMALITIES OF THE FORESKIN}

The techniques described in this manual assume that the foreskin and frenulum are normal. However, clinic-based circumcision can be undertaken in the presence of minor abnormalities, if the circumcision team has sufficient experience. Any abnormalities should be detected in the preoperative examination of the penis, which should include full retraction of the foreskin. Two abnormalities - both of which are common indications for circumcision require a slight variation in technique.

\section*{Phimosis}

Phimosis is scarring of the aperture of the foreskin to the extent that the foreskin cannot be retracted. Often the tip of the foreskin will appear white because of scar tissue. If the scar tissue is extensive, then the man is not suitable for clinic-based circumcision and should be referred to a higher level of care.

The first step in all circumcision operations is to mark the foreskin with the line of the incision. If the sleeve resection method is used, the phimosis will prevent retraction of the foreskin and the line of incision near the corona cannot be marked. In this case, a small dorsal slit should be made, which is just long enough to allow the foreskin to be retracted. Once retracted, any adhesions can be divided and any debris under the foreskin cleaned with a swab soaked in povidone iodine or cetrimide. Once all adhesions have been divided, the second line of incision on the foreskin near the corona can be marked and the circumcision operation can proceed as usual.

In the forceps-guided or dorsal slit methods, the line of incision is marked on the outer aspect of the foreskin in the normal manner. However, with minor degrees of phimosis, it may be necessary to make a small dorsal slit to allow full retraction and cleaning under the foreskin before proceeding with the operation. The forceps-guided method should not be used if there is evidence of extensive scarring.

\section*{Tight or scarred frenulum}

All males have a band of tissue (the frenulum) on the ventral side of the penis, just below the glans. Usually the frenulum does not interfere with retraction of the foreskin. During early sexual experiences, the frenulum may be stretched as the foreskin is retracted, and minor tears are a frequent problem. Such tears can heal, leaving inelastic scar tissue, which tightens and makes further tearing and scarring more likely. The problem can be seen when the foreskin is retracted during physical examination. Instead of the normal pink frenulum, a tight band of white tissue is seen (Fig. 5.43A). This restrictive frenular band can be easily corrected during circumcision.

Spread open the foreskin and retract it ventrally to put the frenular band under tension. Using dissection scissors, snip the band at its centre, taking care not to injure the urethra, which is just under the frenulum. Any bleeding from the frenular artery should be controlled by careful tying or under-running. After the frenulum has been cut, there will be an inverted V-shaped defect (Fig. 5.43B).

The circumcision can then be performed as usual. In this case, however, do not suture the penile skin up to the edge of the foreskin defect, since this will cause increased tension on the ventral side. This tension may cause curvature of the penis or possibly make erection or
coitus uncomfortable. Instead, close the V-shaped defect by placing the frenular suture 1-2 cm (depending on age and penis size) back from the apex of the V , taking both sides of the defect (Fig. 5.43C). The V incision is thus converted into an inverted T . Suture the rest of the skin as in a normal circumcision (Fig. 5.43D).

\section*{Chapter 6}

\section*{Circumcision of infants and children}

\section*{SUMMARY}

This chapter gives step-by-step instructions for performing a circumcision on an infant or young child. Four surgical techniques are described:
- the dorsal slit method;
- the Plastibell method;
- the Mogen clamp method;
- the Gomco clamp method.

Four widely-used surgical techniques for paediatric circumcision are described in this chapter. The recommended techniques are shown in detail so that they can be referred to in the context of a training course. After the initial training, they can be used to reinforce what has been learnt. Surgeons should become expert in the technique most suited to the circumstances of their practice. It is not recommended that a nursing, clinical or medical officer learn all the techniques. It is best to become a master of one. This will produce the best results with the least complications.

Circumcision of infants and pre-pubertal boys is simpler than circumcision of older boys and adults, because the penis is relatively underdeveloped and the foreskin less vascular. Healing is quick and complication rates are low. A major disadvantage is that the child cannot give consent for the procedure. In addition, the primary health benefit - reduced risk of HIV infection - is not realized until many years later when he becomes sexually active. Circumcision can be delayed to an older age, when the boy can understand the risks and benefits of circumcision and consent to the procedure himself. Programmes that promote circumcision of young children are likely to have lower morbidity rates and lower cost than programmes targeting adolescents and adults. However, this must be balanced by concerns about consent.

\section*{SCREENING MALE BABIES AND YOUNG BOYS FOR CIRCUMCISION}

The screening procedures for infants and young children are similar to those for adolescents and adults, and are aimed at ensuring that the client is suitable for surgery at the clinic. If there is any doubt, surgery should be deferred or the client
referred to a specialist centre. The circumcision team should enquire about the health of the baby or young boy.

Neonatal circumcision (within the first 28 days of life) should be undertaken only if the birth was a full-term delivery and the baby has had no significant medical problems. Known haematological disorders and jaundice are contraindications to circumcision. Thus any baby with yellow sclera or purpuric skin lesions should not be accepted for clinic-based circumcision. Any congenital abnormality of the genitalia is a contraindication to circumcision. Only babies with a normal physical examination and an intact, completely normal appearing penis and foreskin should be considered for male circumcision. This is because the foreskin may be needed for plastic surgical repair of the abnormality.

\section*{CONSENT}

In all cases, the procedure can be undertaken only with the full consent of the parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian should be fully informed about how the procedure will be done, what type of anaesthetic will be used, what complications are possible, and what type of postoperative care should be provided. A summary of the information that needs to be provided is given in Appendix 6.1. The consent of the child should also be obtained, if he is able to give it (Chapter 3 addresses this issue in more detail). An example of a consent form is given in Appendix 6.2.

\section*{PREPARATION}

Before the procedure, the baby should be clean and have a clean, freshly-laundered or new disposable nappy. Because mothers may need to travel some distance to the clinic, any clinic offering infant circumcision should have facilities for washing babies and changing nappies.

\section*{ANAESTHESIA}

Anaesthesia is recommended for paediatric circumcision. Many studies have shown that babies react to pain, and that an effective method of providing local anaesthesia is with dorsal penile nerve block. ${ }^{\text {a }}$ The maximum safe dose of lidocaine in children is $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight. For a $3-\mathrm{kg}$ baby, this corresponds to 0.9 ml of $1 \%$ solution or 1.8 ml of $0.5 \%$ solution (see Table 5.1). Anaesthetic solutions containing epinephrine (adrenaline) should never be used.

\section*{Safe injection of local anaesthetic}

It is the surgeon's responsibility to check the vial of anaesthetic, to ensure that the correct agent at the correct concentration has been selected, and to check the expiry date. It is important to verify that the anaesthetic is clear and that there are no visible particles, which may suggest that the vial is contaminated.

Using a fine needle (e.g. 27-gauge), injections are made at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. Before injecting any local anaesthetic, the surgeon should gently aspirate to make sure that no blood enters the syringe. This is to ensure that anaesthetic is not injected into a blood vessel. This safety precaution should be repeated each time the needle is moved and before any additional local anaesthetic is injected.

Local anaesthesia alone can be used for most infants (under one year of age) who can be held during the procedure so that

}
they do not wriggle. It can also be used for boys who are old enough to cooperate during the procedure. For children between the ages of about 1 and 12 years, use of local anaesthetic alone is more problematic, since the boy may not remain still during the operation. Sedation may be required in addition to local anaesthesia, but there are risks, particularly of air-way obstruction and anoxia. If sedation is necessary to perform the procedure safely the patient should be referred to an appropriate facility.

\section*{EMLA cream}

EMLA 5\% cream (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetics, containing 2.5\% lidocaine and 2.5\% prilocaine) has been extensively used for Plastibell circumcision in children of all ages. It is safe and provides effective anaesthesia when correctly used. It must be applied with care in neonates, because of the potential risk of methaemoglobinaemia from prilocaine metabolites, which can oxidize haemoglobin and dangerously reduce the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Care must be taken to ensure that the cream is not accidentally rubbed onto a large area of the baby's body, as a result of the hands and feet wriggling during the procedure. This can be done by covering the penis with a small piece of polythene held in place with a sticking plaster. It has been shown that, provided the cream is applied only to the penis, EMLA is safe for both term and preterm infants. ${ }^{1}$ Possible minor adverse events include transient local skin reactions, such as blanching and redness.

EMLA cream should be applied to the whole penis $1-2$ hours before the procedure. In older boys whose foreskin can be retracted, the cream should be applied to the glans so that the glans and the underside of the foreskin are covered. Depending on local circumstances, it is often possible for the parent to apply the cream at home before coming to the clinic. If this is done, the clinic staff should ensure that the cream has been applied properly.

The maximum recommended doses and durations of exposure to EMLA cream are summarized in Table 6.1.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 6.1. Recommended maximum exposures to EMLA cream for infants and children ${ }^{\text {c }}$}

\hline Age group & Maximum dose & Maximum skin area* & Period of application ** \\
\hline 0-3 months & 1 g & $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ & 1 h \\
\hline 3-11 months & 2 g & $20 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ & 4 h \\
\hline 1-5 years & 10 g & $100 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ & 4 h \\
\hline 6-11 years & 20 g & $200 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ & 4 h \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Notes:
1. EMLA cream should be applied to the penis only. The maximum areas shown are those above which toxicity is likely to occur if larger areas are coated inadvertently.
2. EMLA cream will be removed when the penis is cleaned and prepared for surgery.

\section*{GLUCOSE BY MOUTH}

In addition to the other agents described, oral sucrose administration (sugar water) in the amount of 1-2 mls has been reported to ameliorate the pain of circumcision. ${ }^{\text {d }}$

\section*{VITAMIN K}

In many developed countries vitamin $K$ is routinely given to babies to prevent vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the newborn. Vitamin K at a dose of 1 mg intramuscularly given shortly after birth has been shown in studies in the USA to reduce bleeding after neonatal circumcision. There is a need for evaluation of oral or injectable Vitamin $K$ in the context of neonatal circumcision programmes in developing countries.

\section*{SKIN PREPARATION AND DRAPING}

The penis and lower abdomen should be cleaned with povidone iodine solution. If local anaesthetic injections are being used, the skin preparation should be done before the anaesthetic is injected. If EMLA cream is being used, skin preparation should be done 1-2 hours after the EMLA cream is applied, just before the procedure starts. The lower abdominal and thigh area should then be covered with a sterile operative drape with a hole to allow the penis through. The drape should not cover the baby's face.

\section*{RETRACTION OF THE FORESKIN AND DIVISION OF ADHESIONS}

In infants and children, the foreskin is commonly fused to the glans by fine adhesions. These adhesions are normal. Before circumcision is performed, it is necessary to separate them.

Before the foreskin can be retracted it may be necessary to stretch the opening with an artery forceps. Care must be taken to avoid putting the tips of the forceps into the urethral meatus, in order to avoid injury.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Fig. 6.2 Stretching the foreskin opening with an artery forceps}
\end{figure}

Once the opening has been dilated, slowly retract the foreskin and separate adhesions by gently running a blunt probe around the glans or using gauze to separate the glans from the foreskin, until the corona is exposed. An alternative to a blunt probe is the tip of a closed pair of mosquito artery forceps. It sometimes helps to moisten the glans with chlorhexidine or povidone iodine, or to apply some sterile gel when separating adhesions.

\section*{PAEDIATRIC SURGICAL METHODS}

Four techniques for circumcision of children are described in this section: the dorsal slit method, the Plastibell method, the Mogen clamp method, and the Gomco clamp method.

The dorsal slit method with closure of the wound with suture is not typically used for infant male circumcision and is more appropriate for older children, particularly in situations where the surgeon undertakes relatively few procedures so that it is not practical to stock devices. A small dorsal slit is a preliminary step when using the Gomco and Plastibell devices. Typically, in early infancy, the wound does not need to be closed with sutures, regardless of the device used.

In babies, the foreskin is long in relation to the penis, and there is little chance of penile erection. This has two important consequences. First, the glans will be further exposed towards puberty, as the penis grows relative to the foreskin. Second, clamping devices that remain on the penis for a few days (e.g. the Plastibell device) are more feasible than with adults, because there is less chance of the device being pushed off by an erection.

In early infancy (< 60 days of age), regardless of which technique is used, closure of the wound is typically not necessary. Beyond early infancy ( $>60$ days) better cosmetic outcomes may be achieved if the wound is closed with simple interrupted sutures. The Plastibell provides a unique benefit over the other techniques in that it can be used outside of the early infant period without regularly requiring surgical closure.

Extremely rare complications such as loss of the glans, urinary retention and bladder rupture have been reported with the use of the Plastibell device as a result of migration of the ring onto the shaft of the penis, which may happen if the wrong size is used. The Plastibell should only be considered in areas where follow up is both reliable and easily available.

The Plastibell is a disposable device, whereas the Mogen and Gomco clamps are reusable. The choice between the different techniques may depend on the cost of the Plastibell, the need to sterilize the Mogen and Gomco clamps, the ages at which circumcision is performed, and the possible need for suturing skills.

The advantages and disadvantages of the different methods of paediatric circumcision are summarized in Table 6.2.

\section*{Suture material}

Sutures are almost always used in the dorsal slit method but are typically not required for the Gomco and Mogen technique when used in early infancy (<60 days of age). The selection of suture size is a compromise between ensuring adequate tensile strength and keeping the amount of foreign material to a minimum. The preferred suture size for paediatric surgery is $5 / 0$ or $4 / 0$ chromic catgut or vicryl rapide. The suture should be mounted on a round-bodied needle.

\section*{Dorsal slit method for children}

The dorsal slit technique can be undertaken by any skilled surgeon, using standard operating instruments. The technique is useful in clinics undertaking limited numbers of paediatric circumcisions. The penis of an infant is small, and any surgeon who is going to undertake paediatric circumcision should already be competent with general surgical skills and adult procedures. There is a need for fine movements and small tissue bites. In particular, the surgeon must take care in the region of the frenulum, because the urethra is close to the skin, and can easily be injured.

Step 1. After cleaning, draping, and anaesthesia, a sterile marking pen or gentian violet is used to mark the line of the circumcision over the corona, with no tension on the foreskin, using the technique described in Chapter $5 .{ }^{\text {e }}$

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-123.jpg?height=675&width=766&top_left_y=1087&top_left_x=685}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.4 Marking the line of the circumcision.}
\end{figure}

Step 2. Clamp the foreskin at the 12 o'clock position, taking care not to place the tip of the clamp beyond the previously marked circumcision line (Fig. 6.5). Close the clamp to crush the skin and leave in place for one minute. This reduces bleeding.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.5 Clamping the foreskin}
\end{figure}

Open and remove the clamp then hold the foreskin with artery forceps on each side of the crushed area, at the 11 o'clock and 1 o'clock positions. Using scissors make a cut at the 12 o'clock position, through the crushed skin. Special care should be taken not to insert the artery forceps or scissors into the urethra. (Fig. 6.6).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-124.jpg?height=409&width=449&top_left_y=1296&top_left_x=679}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.6 The dorsal slit
[NOTE TO ARTIST: Use Fig 6.10 without the suture]}
\end{figure}

Step 3. Using scissors cut the foreskin free, following the previously marked circumcision line (Fig. 6.7). Some surgeons use the bell of the Plastibell as a guide. This has the advantage of protecting the glans but the disadvantage that a new Plastibell device is required each time.

It may be necessary in older boys to trim the mucosal layer of the foreskin to $2-3 \mathrm{~mm}$ from the corona. If this layer is left too long, the suture line can slip back over the glans, constricting it and making it appear as if the foreskin has not been removed ("concealed glans"). Control any significant bleeding by clipping the blood vessel with an artery forceps and then tying. Bipolar diathermy may be used, if available. Minor bleeding can be controlled with simple pressure for five minutes.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-125.jpg?height=380&width=500&top_left_y=250&top_left_x=685}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.7 Removing the foreskin by cutting along the marked line of circumcision}
\end{figure}

Step 4. Suture the edges of the incision with $5 / 0$ or $4 / 0$ vicryl or catgut sutures (depending on the age of the child) and a roundbodied needle. Cutting needles should not be used.

Approximate the skin edges and the frenulum using simple sutures; mattress sutures are not necessary. Take great care at the frenulum, because the urethra is near the surface and can easily be injured by too deep a bite. Place all sutures approximately 1 mm from the skin edge. Place the first two sutures at the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions, leaving them long and temporarily held with forceps (Fig. 6.8). This keeps the penis stable while the remaining sutures are completed. In babies, only two further stitches may be needed on each side. In older children, it is helpful to place sutures at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions, and then to place the final sutures in between.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.8 Suturing the circumcision wound.}
\end{figure}

Finally, inspect the wound and apply a piece of gauze impregnated with petroleum jelly or with petroleum jelly plus antibiotic.

\section*{Information for parents}

The parents of infants and children who have had a dorsal slit circumcision should be told that it is not necessary to use a dressing, and the baby can be looked after in the regular way, including normal washing and use of nappies. Healing is usually complete after about one week.

The parents should be told to come back to the clinic if:
- the child appears to be distressed or in pain;
- the child has fever;
- the child does not wake for feeding as per his usual pattern;
- the glans or wound becomes discoloured;
- there is any separation of the skin edges;
- there is any unusual swelling or bleeding;
- the child has any difficulties with urination;
- the parents have any other worry about healing.

\section*{The Plastibell method}

The Plastibell technique is widely used and has been shown to be acceptable and practical in developing country settings. This technique requires less surgical skill than the dorsal slit method to produce a neat result. It can be used in children up to age $10-12$ years, and can be used with EMLA anaesthetic cream. However, as for other surgical methods, incorrect technique can result in complications. Any clinic offering Plastibell circumcision needs to have in stock the full range of bell sizes. If the bell used is too small, it may cause pressure necrosis and injury to the glans. If the bell is too large, it may slip over the glans onto the shaft of the penis and cause constriction. In extreme cases this may result in gangrene and loss of the glans and/or urinary retention and bladder rupture. ${ }^{\text {fgh }}$ For these reasons, the Plastibell technique is only recommended for use in clinics that regularly perform paediatric circumcisions and follow-up can be assured; it is not recommended for occasional use.

The Plastibell is manufactured by the Hollister Company and comes in six different sizes each in a sterile package.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-127.jpg?height=649&width=798&top_left_y=1259&top_left_x=679}

\end{figure}

Step 1. Select the correct size of Plastibell according to the girth of the glans. The most commonly used sizes are 11 or 13 mm .

Step 2. After cleaning, draping anaesthesia, and marking the line of the circumcision over the corona. retract the foreskin

and separate the adhesions to expose the corona, as described above.

Step 3. It is usually necessary to make a dorsal slit (as described above) before the Plastibell can be placed on the glans. The slit needs only to be sufficiently long to allow the Plastibell to be placed over the glans. Each Plastibell is supplied in a sterile packet with a ligature - the Plastibell tie. The procedure is easier if, after opening the Plastibell package, the Plastibell tie is placed loosely around the shaft of the penis before the dorsal slit is made (Fig. 6.10).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.10 The dorsal slit, allowing access to the glans}
\end{figure}

Step 4. Place the Plastibell on the glans, as shown in Fig. 6.11.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.11 Placing the Plastibell on the glans}
\end{figure}

Step 5. Pull the foreskin back over the Plastibell. It is sometimes helpful to hold the foreskin in position by clipping it to the Plastibell handle with an artery forceps (Fig. 6.12).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-129.jpg?height=575&width=660&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=691}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.12 An artery forceps is used to secure the foreskin to the handle of the Plastibell}
\end{figure}

Step 6. Carefully place the ligature in the groove of the Plastibell. Ensure that it is in the correct position, then pull it tight and tie. Cut off the foreskin using scissors, leaving 12 mm of cuff to prevent the ligature from slipping off (Fig 6.13).

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.13 Cutting away the foreskin}
\end{figure}

Step 7. Snap off the handle of the Plastibell (Fig 6.14).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-130.jpg?height=615&width=775&top_left_y=239&top_left_x=685}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.14 Snapping off the Plastibell handle}
\end{figure}

Step 8. Check that there is no bleeding. If all is well, the child can be sent home and looked after in the normal way, including normal washing and use of nappies. The rim of tissue distal to the ligature will become necrotic and the Plastibell will drop off after 5-8 days. Alternatively the infant can be checked after 36-48 hours and the ligature cut.

\section*{Information for parents}

The parents of infants and children who have had a Plastibell circumcision should be told that it is not necessary to use a dressing, and the baby can be looked after in the normal way, including normal washing and use of nappies. Healing is usually complete after about one week. Bleeding is rare because the clamp crushes the edge of the foreskin. The parents should be told to come back to the clinic if:
- the child appears to be distressed or in pain;
- the child has fever;
- the child does not wake for feeding as per his usual pattern;
- there is any separation of the skin edges;
- there is any unusual swelling or bleeding;
- the child has any difficulties with urination;
- the plastic ring slips onto the shaft of the penis;
- the tip of the penis becomes swollen or changes colour
- one part of the foreskin remains pink or has not shrivelled after 48 hours;
- the plastic ring has not fallen off within 8 days;
- the parents have any other worry about healing.

\section*{The Mogen clamp method}

The Mogen clamp is widely used. There have been several studies comparing it with the Gomco clamp, another widely used device. The Mogen ("shield") clamp compares favourably, because it is easy to use and has no parts to assemble. The fewest complications with this method have been reported in the context of circumcision of 8-day-old babies. Since the Mogen clamp is reusable, careful precautions have to be taken to ensure the device is properly cleaned and sterilized between procedures. Also there is a risk that the glans can be pulled into the slit and crushed or partially severed.'

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-131.jpg?height=678&width=1078&top_left_y=813&top_left_x=679}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.15 The Mogen clamp}
\end{figure}

Step 1. After cleaning, draping, anaesthesia and marking the line of the circumcision over the corona, retract the foreskin and separate the adhesions to expose the corona, as described above.

It is important to separate all adhesions in order to prevent the glans from getting accidentally pulled into the Mogen clamp and injured.

Step 2. Put traction on the foreskin, and introduce it into the slit in the device, with the concavity facing the glans (Fig 6.16). It is important to ensure that the glans is not pulled into the slit. ${ }^{j}$ If there is any doubt, remove the clamp, inspect the glans for any sign of crushing injury and reapply the clamp.

\caption{Fig. 6.16 The Mogen device in situ}
\end{figure}

Step 3. Close the device, crushing the foreskin. Leave in the closed position for 3-5 minutes, to reduce the risk of bleeding. If the device is left too long it may be difficult to separate the foreskin to reveal the glans after the device is removed.

Step 4. Cut off the foreskin on the outer side of the clamp with a scalpel (Fig 6.17). Open the device and remove.

\begin{figure}

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 6.17 The foreskin is cut flush with the clamp using a scalpel. The Mogen clamp device protects the glans from injury.}
\end{figure}

Step 5. Manipulate the penis, using gentle pressure from the side, to allow the glans to emerge from under the crushed foreskin (Fig 6.18). This is an important step to ensure the foreskin heals below the level of the corona. In older infants (>60 days) it may be necessary to place some 5-0 simple sutures to approximate the edges.

Step 6. Wrap a piece of petroleum-jelly-impregnated gauze loosely around the penis.

\section*{Information for parents}

The parents of an infant or child who has had a circumcision using the Mogen clamp technique should be told that it is not necessary to use a dressing and the child can be looked after in the normal way, including normal washing and the use of nappies. Healing is usually complete after about one week. Bleeding is rare because the clamp crushes the edge of the foreskin.

The parents should be told to come back to the clinic if:
- the child appears to be distressed or in pain;
- the child has fever;
- the child does not wake for feeding as per his usual pattern;
- there is any separation of the skin edges;
- there is any unusual swelling or bleeding;
- the child has any difficulties with urination;
- the parents have any other worry about healing.

\section*{The Gomco clamp method}

The Gomco clamp has different bell sizes that can be used for infants, older children and adults. In addition, the crushing of the foreskin is circular (unlike with the Mogen clamp, which is linear).. A disadvantage of the Gomco clamp is that, unlike the Mogen clamp, it consists of four parts - base plate, rocker arm or top plate, nut and bell. A number of bells of different sizes are also needed. There is a risk that parts of the clamp may be mislaid or lost during cleaning and sterilization. Before the start of the procedure and before any anaesthetic is given the surgeon must check that likely sizes of Gomco clamps are available. Once the procedure has started and the correct size has been selected the clamp should be assembled to ensure parts are complete and fit correctly.

Meticulous care must be used to not mismatch device parts. If a small bell is used with a larger base plate the device will not crush the foreskin or protect the glans, possibly resulting in haemorrhage and penile laceration. Correctly matched and sized parts must be used.

Component parts from different clamps or manufacturers are not interchangeable and care must be taken to ensure that the clamp is assembled only from its original parts.

The Gomco clamp should also be thoroughly checked and not used if it has stripped threads, a warped or bent base plate, a bent arm, twisted forks on the rocker arm, or a scored or nicked bell. The clinic may mark clamp parts to ensure that they are correctly reassembled. If so, the manufacturer should be consulted on the best way to do this. Some marking methods may weaken the device or make it difficult to sterilize it.

Step 1. After cleaning, draping anaesthesia, and marking the line of the circumcision over the corona, retract the foreskin and separate the adhesions to expose the corona, as described above.

Step 2. It is usually necessary to make a small dorsal slit to allow the clamp to be placed on the glans (Fig 6.21). It is important not to make the dorsal slit too long. Otherwise, it will extend beyond the ring of crushed tissue produced by the Gomco clamp and may produce an untidy result with increased risk of bleeding. The dorsal slit should be long enough to allow all adhesions to be divided and the bell of the Gomco clamp to be placed over the glans.

\section*{Error! Objects cannot be created from editing field codes.}

Fig. 6.21 Making a small dorsal slit in preparation for placing the Gomco clamp.

Step 3. Choose the correct size of Gomco clamp bell to fit the glans. For neonatal circumcision, a bell size of 1.1 cm is usually appropriate. Introduce the bell through the aperture in the foreskin and place over the glans. Then pull the foreskin over the bell (Fig 6.22).

\section*{Error! Objects cannot be created from editing field codes.}

Step 4. Place the base plate of the Gomco clamp over the bell, keeping the foreskin pulled over the bell (Figs 6.22 and 6.23). Put the rocker arm of the clamp in position, taking care to place the crossbar at the top of the bell correctly in the yoke. The clamp is now ready for tightening.

Before tightening the clamp, make sure that the foreskin is symmetrical over the bell. The apex of the dorsal slit should be visible. Finally, the crossbar at the top of the bell should sit
squarely in the yoke of the clamp, otherwise there will be uneven crushing and a risk of bleeding.

Step 5. Once you are sure that the clamp is in the optimal position, tighten the nut until the foreskin is crushed (Fig 6.24).

Step 6. Using a scalpel, excise the foreskin circumferentially against the bell, distal to the clamp (Fig 6.25). The head of the penis is protected from being cut by the bell of the clamp. Leave the clamp in position for 5 minutes, then loosen and remove. ${ }^{\text {k }}$

Step 7. Once the clamp has been removed (Fig 6.26), the crushed skin edge will typically have resulted in haemostasis with good tissue alignment. Normally in early infancy, no sutures are required. In older infants (>60 days) it may be necessary to place some 5-0 simple sutures to approximate the edges.

To obtain a good result with the Gomco clamp, the surgeon must ensure:
(a) the dorsal slit is not made too long, the apex must be above the crushed skin edge.
(b) the crossbar of the bell is placed evenly in the yoke of the rocker arm, so that there is an even distribution of the crushing force; and
(c) the foreskin is symmetrically aligned over the bell.

\section*{Information for parents}

The parents of an infant or child who has had a Gomco clamp circumcision should be told that it is not necessary to use a dressing, and the baby can be looked after in the normal way, including normal washing and the use of nappies. Healing is usually complete after about one week. Bleeding is rare
because the clamp crushes the edge of the foreskin. Parents should be told to bring the child back to the clinic if:
- the child appears to be distressed or in pain;
- the child has fever;
- the child does not wake for feeding as per his usual pattern;
- there is any separation of the skin edges;
- there is any unusual swelling or bleeding;
- the child has any difficulties with urination;
- the parents have any other concern about healing.

\section*{INFORMATION FOR PARENTS CONSIDERING CIRCUMCISION FOR THEIR CHILD}

Parents should be given information about circumcision so that they can give informed consent to the procedure. The information should be given verbally in the local language using non-technical terms. In addition, the clinic should have printed information sheets that the parents can take home. Information given needs to be specific to the clinic, and should include the following topics.
- What circumcision is. Circumcision is removal of the foreskin. This means that the head of the penis is exposed all the time. It does not affect the ability to pass urine normally and does not affect the ability to father children in adult life.
- The benefits of circumcision. The main benefits of circumcision are improved penile hygiene, reduced risk of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and reduced risk of cancer of the penis.
- How circumcision is done. The technique to be used should be described, i.e. dorsal slit with sutures, Plastibell, Mogen or Gomco clamp methods.
- The risks of circumcision. It should be explained that complications from male circumcision are extremely rare but can include poor cosmetic outcome, bleeding, infection, or injury to surrounding structures.
- What to do before circumcision. No special precautions are needed before the operation. If the child becomes ill before the planned operation date, the parents should contact the clinic to postpone the procedure until after the child recovers.
- What to do after circumcision. The instructions will depend on the procedure that has been used (see descriptions of techniques in Chapter 6).
- What to do if there are any complications or problems after circumcision, in particular bleeding, infection or other concerns. This will usually be for the family to bring the baby back to the clinic, but if distance makes a return visit difficult then an alternative health facility should be identified.
- An emergency contact number or information about where to go in an emergency.

\section*{Postoperative care and management of complications}

\section*{Summary}
- Possible complications of male circumcision include excessive bleeding, formation of haematoma, infection, an unsatisfactory cosmetic effect, lacerations of the penile or scrotal skin, and injury to the glans.
- Certain complications can be managed in the clinic. For others, the patient may need to be referred to a higher level of care.
- Complications of circumcision can be avoided by ensuring asepsis during the procedure, performing careful and accurate excision of the inner and outer preputial layers, ensuring adequate haemostasis, and paying attention to the cosmetic result.

\section*{POSTOPERATIVE CARE}

\section*{Postoperative monitoring}

It is very important to monitor the client for at least 30 minutes after surgery, because it is during this period that the effects of surgical trauma and other complications become apparent. Nurses or other staff members can carry out the tasks related to postoperative recovery and discharge, but the surgeon is ultimately responsible for the quality of post-circumcision care.

The summary below assumes that the circumcision has been performed in a clinic under local anaesthetic. If circumcision was performed in a hospital under general anaesthetic, the normal hospital recovery room protocols should be followed. ${ }^{\text {a }}$
- Receive the client from the theatre; review the client record.
- Monitor the client's vital signs: check blood pressure, breathing, and pulse twice, at 15-minute intervals.
- Check the surgical dressing for oozing or bleeding.
- Ask the patient if he has any pain.
- Observe the general condition of the client.
- Administer any drugs or treatment prescribed.
- Provide bland carbohydrates (such as a biscuit) and liquids to raise blood sugar levels unless medically contraindicated.
- Handle the client gently when moving him.
- Make the client comfortable, according to the climate.
- Complete the client record form.

All men have occasional penile erections during sleep, and young men frequently get erections during the day. After the circumcision, the man will still have erections, which will not disrupt the process of wound healing. If, during the immediate recovery period, there is a particularly prolonged or painful erection, it can be stopped by letting the client inhale one ampoule of amyl nitrate.

\section*{Instructions for the client}

It is very important to inform the client that he should avoid sexual intercourse and masturbation for 4-6 weeks after the procedure, to allow the wound to heal. A condom should then be used to protect the wound during every act of sexual intercourse for at least six months. Thereafter condoms should always be used to prevent sexually transmitted infections, HIV or unwanted pregnancy.

The dressing applied during surgery should be removed $24-48$ hours later, provided that there is no bleeding or oozing. If there is any bleeding or oozing, a new dressing may be applied for a further 24-48 hours, and then checked again. Once bleeding has stopped, no further dressing is necessary and the patient should be instructed to wear freshly laundered, loose-fitting underwear. Underwear should be changed each day. After the dressing has been removed, the man can shower twice a day, and should gently wash the genital area with mild soap (baby soap) and water. (This advice may be adapted according to local conditions, including the availability of facilities for washing and showering.)

Before discharging the client, make sure that he understands that complications are infrequent, but that he should:
- look for signs of potential problems, namely:
- increasing bleeding,
- severe pain in the penis or genital area,
- inability to pass urine, or severe pain when passing urine,
- discharge of pus from the surgical wound
- increased swelling;
- return to the clinic immediately or seek emergency care if a problem develops.

Make sure the client knows where to go if complications arise.
Give the client postoperative instructions, verbally and in writing, if appropriate (see Appendix 7.1). Ask him to repeat the instructions, to make sure that he has understood them. Give him any medications prescribed, and arrange an appointment for follow-up (see below). Check that a responsible adult is available to accompany the client
home (this is of particular importance for clients who are below the age of consent). It is helpful if the instructions given to the client are also given to any accompanying adult.

The surgeon or designated member of the team should assess whether the client is ready for discharge.

Finally, the client record should be completed.

\section*{Transfer of client records}

All client records should be kept at the service site where the procedure took place. If the follow-up visit will take place at another facility, the client should be given a card to give to the follow-up provider. The card should indicate the date of the procedure, the type of procedure, and any special instructions. If it is necessary to transfer the client's records, a copy should be made and the original kept at the facility where the surgery took place.

\section*{FOLLOW-UP VISITS}

Ideally, the surgeon who performed the circumcision should conduct the follow-up examination. However, if this is not possible, a trained non-physician can perform the examination and manage minor complications. If the client goes to a different health centre for followup, it is important that the staff at that facility are trained to do a careful follow-up examination and report any complications to the facility where the circumcision took place.

\section*{Routine follow-up}

The follow-up visit should be within 7 days of surgery. The provider should assess the progress of healing and look for signs of infection. The operation site should be examined, and additional examinations should be done as required by the case history, symptoms or complaints of the client. If the client has a problem that cannot be resolved, another visit should be scheduled or he should be referred to a higher level of care.

At the follow-up visit:
- Check the medical record or referral form for background information on the client and the surgical procedure.
- Ask the client if he has had any problems or complaints since the surgery. Specifically, ask if he has experienced any of the following:
- discharge or bleeding from the wound,
- difficulty urinating,
- fever,
- pain or other distress, or
- swelling of the penis or scrotum.
- Examine the operation site to assess healing and ensure that there is no infection.
- Treat any complications found during the examination (see below), or refer the client to a higher level.
- Ask the client whether he is satisfied with the service provided or has any comments to make that will help improve the service.
- Document the follow-up visit in the client's medical record, including any complaints, diagnosis, treatment and comments.

\section*{Emergency follow-up}

Clients who come for an emergency follow-up visit should be seen immediately. Staff should be alert to the possibility of excessive bleeding or infection.

At an emergency visit:
- Examine the client immediately. Check all areas related to his complaint.
- Read the medical record, if available.
- Ask the client about the sequence of events since the operation. Ask about: any problems during the surgery or in the recovery period; how problems developed; any increase in discomfort; and any medication taken or other treatments obtained.
- Arrange for treatment of any problems that can be handled on an outpatient basis.
- Refer the client to a higher level of care for treatment of potentially serious complications.
- Note on the client record all problems and actions taken.
- Inform the facility where the male circumcision was performed about the emergency follow-up visit (if applicable).

\section*{RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS}

This section describes the complications that can be managed in the clinic setting, and the indications for referral to a higher level of care.

If complications occur during or after the circumcision, the team should take the time to inform the client, and if possible his family,
about what has happened and the plans to deal with the complication. Anxiety and fear of the unknown add to the distress caused by complications. These can be greatly reduced if the client is given clear explanations about what is happening.

For example, a complaint of increasing penile pain and fever 4-5 days after surgery is indicative of wound infection. If there are signs of infection on examination, the client should be given antibiotics and the situation reviewed after 24-48 hours, depending on the severity of the complaint. In these circumstances, the client and his family should be told there is an infection, that antibiotics are needed, and when the situation will be reviewed.

\section*{Organizing referrals}

A circumcision team working in a clinic setting should have a formal arrangement with the nearest referral centre, so that there are no bureaucratic obstacles when referral is required. When strengthening or establishing national or local circumcision services, adequate funding for referrals should be included as part of the cost of the circumcision service.

Many complications can be managed in the clinic setting, but occasionally emergency transfer may be needed. When there is a need for emergency transfer, the following general rules apply:
- The client should be transferred by ambulance, lying flat.
- The client and his family should be given a full explanation of what is happening and why.
- A clear note should be sent to the referral centre with the client.
- The client should be told not to eat and, depending on the length of the journey, not to drink, as a general anaesthetic may need to be given at the referral centre. Any accompanying family member should also be given this information.

\section*{Complications occurring during surgery}
- Excessive adhesions. If the client has phimosis, so that the foreskin cannot be retracted prior to surgery, there is uncertainty about what will be found once the dorsal slit has been made and the foreskin retracted. If there are excessive adhesions, it may be difficult to separate the foreskin from the glans. Depending on the experience of the circumcision team, it may be better to stop the procedure and refer the man to a hospital. In this situation, the dorsal slit will have to be repaired, using stitches to stop bleeding. It will not be possible to put on a dressing because the man will need to urinate. Nevertheless, the area should be kept as clean as possible. The wound should be covered with a gauze swab, which the man can keep in place by wearing tight underpants. Arrangements should be made for the man to attend the local
referral hospital as soon as convenient, and in any case within 2448 hours.
- Excess bleeding during surgery. If there is excessive bleeding during the surgery, the first rule for the surgeon is not to panic. More damage is caused by panic attempts to stop bleeding than by the original injury. Place a swab under the penis and a second swab over the bleeding point, apply firm pressure, and wait five minutes (timed by the clock). After five minutes, slowly lift off the swab. Often, the bleeding will have stopped Do not be tempted to look under the swab before five minutes have elapsed. If the bleeding has not stopped after five minutes, the site of the bleeding will be obvious. Apply a haemostatic artery forceps to the bleeding point. If this does not control the bleeding, apply pressure over a swab for a further 5 minutes (timed). At the end of this time, gently lift the swab again, and under-run the bleeding area with a suture. Remember that the larger blood vessels generally run along the length of the penis, and place the suture proximal to the bleeding (that is, on the side towards the base rather than the tip of the penis). It is very likely that these measures will control bleeding. If, exceptionally, the bleeding continues, the man should be transferred to a referral centre as an emergency, or a more experienced surgeon should be called to help.
- Bleeding from the frenular artery. If there is excessive bleeding from the frenular artery, an under-running haemostatic stitch should be used to occlude the artery (Fig. 7.1). Great care is needed not to bite too deeply, because the urethra is near to the surface skin and can easily be damaged.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-146.jpg?height=697&width=1138&top_left_y=1536&top_left_x=616}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 7.1 Suture under running the frenular artery}
\end{figure}
- Accidental injury. Accidental injury can include injury to the glans (e.g. partial severing of the glans) or too deep an incision, resulting in bleeding that is difficult to control. Any bleeding should be controlled by applying pressure over a piece of gauze, and the man should be transferred as an emergency to a referral centre. If
the transfer time is likely to be long, insert a urinary catheter, wrap the penis in sterile gauze, and tape the gauze in place. During the transfer, the client should lie flat. At all times, the client and his relatives should be kept informed about what has happened and what is going to be done. The risk of such accidents is reduced if the surgeon has received proper training and certification, and if there is a system of ongoing appraisal and recertification. Risks are higher if the surgeon becomes overconfident, or when timetable constraints result in operations being done in a hurry. To avoid this, countries need to have established and well-funded training and recertification procedures, and clinics need to ensure that adequate time is allowed for surgery.
- Severing of the glans. If part or all of the glans has been severed, it should be wrapped in a sterile paraffin gauze to prevent drying and placed in a polyethylene bag. The man and his glans should be transferred as soon as possible to a referral centre, where it may be possible to reattach the glans.

\section*{Complications occurring within the first 48 hours after surgery}
- Bleeding is the most likely complication during the first 24-48 hours. A small amount of bleeding onto the gauze dressings is usual, but may alarm the client. If he comes back to the clinic with blood-soaked dressings, these should be removed and the circumcision wound inspected for an obvious bleeding point. If there is fresh blood from the skin edge, a further suture should be inserted. This will require a full sterile procedure, as for the original circumcision, including local anaesthesia and sterile draping. Usually, placing one or two additional mattress sutures over the area will stop the bleeding.
- Haematoma may form and may be associated with considerable bruising and skin discoloration. In general, haematomas are best left alone, unless they are very large or there is continued bleeding. The choice is between applying a further clean dressing and reviewing the situation in 24 hours, or applying a clean dressing and sending the client to a referral centre. If the circumcision team is relatively inexperienced, it is safer to send the man to the referral centre.
- Wound disruption is unusual in the first few days, but is sometimes seen in association with subcutaneous bleeding and haematoma formation, when the stitches cut out. In this situation the man should be sent to a referral centre. The specialist at the referral centre may decide either to suture the wound or to leave it to heal by secondary intention, depending on the state of the skin edges. If the disruption occurs within 48 hours of the operation, it is usually better for the clinic surgeon to explore and re-suture the wound.

\section*{Complications that occur within the first two weeks after surgery}
- Infection. After 2-3 days, the most likely problem is wound infection. An infection often causes increasing pain, and there may be visible signs, such as redness or purulent discharge. The patient should be given an appropriate antibiotic and advised to take frequent showers and to put a clean dressing on the wound between showers. If the infection is severe, the man should be advised to lie on his back, so that his penis is the highest point of his body. This promotes drainage of lymphatic fluid and speeds up the healing process. Sitting in a chair is a bad position. Alternatively the wound can be left without a dressing, but should be protected from flies.
- Wound disruption and cutting out of stitches. When stitches cut out, this usually indicates that there is an infection, and the patient should be given antibiotics (see above). If more than 48 hours have passed since the operation, do not try to re-suture the wound, as the new stitches are likely to become infected and also cut out, making the situation worse. The wound should be left to heal by secondary intention. The man should be seen at the clinic as often as necessary until the wound has healed. In general, the healing process after infection leaves an untidy result, at least for the first few months. The man should be reassured that the appearance will usually become normal after about a year.
- Worsening wound infection with signs of gangrene. A rare risk of genital surgery is infection with multiple bacteria, causing progressive skin loss. In this situation, the blood supply is cut off, and the skin becomes necrotic and turns completely black. This condition is known as Fournier's gangrene (synergistic gangrene or necrotizing fasciitis) and is more common in men who have diabetes. Any man with signs of spreading infection or black gangrenous skin should be urgently transferred to a referral centre. At the referral centre, it is usually necessary to give a general anaesthetic and remove all the dead skin.

\section*{Late complications}

In the long term, the client may complain of:
- decreased sensitivity of the glans;
- oversensitivity of the glans;
- unsightly circumcision wounds, ragged scars or other cosmetic concerns;
- persistent adhesions at the corona and inclusion cysts. These problems can be avoided if the foreskin is fully retracted during the operation and all adhesions carefully divided;
- discomfort during erection from the scrotal being skin pulled up the shaft of the penis and a tight scrotal sac. This can result from removal of too much skin during the circumcision. These problems can be avoided by careful preoperative marking of the incision lines.
- torsion (misalignment) of the skin of the penile shaft. This can be avoided by taking care during the operation to align the midline raphe with the frenulum.

\section*{Appendix 7.1}

\section*{SAMPLE POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS FOR MEN WHO HAVE BEEN CIRCUMCISED}
- After the operation, rest at home for one or two days. This will help the wound to heal.
- You may bathe on the day after surgery, but do not let the dressing get wet.
- Remove the dressing 24-48 hours after surgery.
- Do not pull or scratch the wound while it is healing.
- Do not have sexual intercourse or masturbate for 4-6 weeks, and use condoms to protect the wound for every act of sexual intercourse for at least six months until the wound has healed completely. (Your health care provider will advise you about this during your follow-up visit.)
- You may have a little pain or swelling around the wound. This is normal. Check occasionally to make sure that it does not get worse. Take any medicines provided or recommended by the clinic. Be sure to follow the instructions given to you.
- Return to the clinic or call:
- if you notice increased bleeding from the surgical wound;
- if the pain or swelling at the surgical wound gets progressively worse;
- if you have difficulty in passing urine;
- if you develop a fever within one week of surgery;
- if you have severe pain in the lower abdomen;
- if the wound is discharging pus.
- If you have any of these problems, go to:
- Return to the clinic for a follow-up visit about one week after the operation. A health care worker will check to see how the wound is healing.

\section*{PREVENTION OF INFECTION}

\section*{SUMMARY}
- Health care workers need to follow recommended practices for preventing infection, in order to protect themselves, other health care workers, and their patients from exposure to HIV and other infections.
- Hand hygiene greatly reduces the number of disease-causing microorganisms on hands and arms. It is the most important way of limiting the spread of infection. If hands are visibly soiled, they should be washed with soap and water; otherwise, an alcohol-based handrub should be used.
- Personal protective equipment should be worn to protect both patients and staff from infectious microorganisms.
- Gloves should be worn: when there is a reasonable chance of hand contact with blood or other body fluids, mucous membranes, broken or cut skin; when performing any invasive procedure; and when handling contaminated items. A new pair of gloves should be worn for each new patient contact, to avoid spreading infection from person to person.
- Hypodermic (hollow-bore) needles can cause injuries to clinic staff at all levels: workers can be stuck by hypodermic needles during patient care, cleaning and housekeeping. Staff may be exposed to needle-stick and sharp injuries when washing soiled instruments and disposing of waste material.
- All staff should be trained in the proper handling of sharp instruments.
- Soiled instruments and other reusable items can transmit disease if not properly cleaned, disinfected and sterilized (or high-level disinfected). High-level disinfection destroys all microorganisms, except some bacterial endospores. Sterilization destroys all microorganisms, including bacterial endospores.
- Proper waste management is important to prevent accidental injury to people who handle waste items, and to prevent the spread of infection to health care workers and the local community.
- Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with antiretroviral drugs may reduce the risk of infection after exposure to HIV. It will be effective only if it is started as soon as possible after exposure (within 72 h ) and if the full course of treatment is adhered to.
- Post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis B can reduce the risk of hepatitis $B$ infection.

\section*{BASIC CONCEPTS}

Measures to prevent infection in male circumcision programmes have two primary objectives:
- to minimize the risk of infections in people having surgery;
- to minimize the risk of transmitting HIV and other infections to clients and health care staff, including cleaning and housekeeping staff.

In the context of circumcision services, there are two important pathways for transmission of infection:
- Direct transmission. Enteric and skin infections can be transmitted by this route, as can bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV and hepatitis B virus, either by direct contact with an open wound or blood, blood products and body fluids, or by accident through a needle stick injury.
- Airborne transmission. Pneumonia, pertussis, diphtheria, influenza, mumps, and meningitis can be transmitted through droplets in the air, usually within a range of about 1 m , while active pulmonary tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox, pulmonary plague, and haemorrhagic fever with pneumonia can be transmitted via droplet nuclei (small-particle aerosols) over larger ranges.

In male circumcision programmes, a major concern is the potential direct transmission of bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV and hepatitis B virus, to health care workers or patients. Exposure may take place during patient care, clinical or surgical procedures, processing of soiled instruments, cleaning and waste disposal. Needle-stick injuries carry a high risk of infection; the actual level of risk will depend on the type of needle, the depth of the injury, the amount of blood or blood product on the needle, and the viral load in the blood.

The risk of acquiring HIV from an HIV-infected person through a needle-stick injury is estimated at $0.3 \%$ (three HIV infections for every 1000 injuries). The risk of acquiring hepatitis $B$ virus infection, after being stuck with a needle that has been used on a person with hepatitis B infection ranges from $6 \%$ to $37 \%$, with an average of $18 \%$. Finally, the risk of acquiring hepatitis C infection after being stuck with a needle that has been used on a hepatitis-C-infected person is $1.8 \% .^{1}$

Most instances of transmission of infection in health care facilities can be prevented through the application of basic infection control precautions. In the circumcision clinic, standard precautions, as described below, should be applied to all patients at all times, regardless of their infection status.

\section*{STANDARD PRECAUTIONS}

Standard precautions are a set of practices to prevent and control infection. They include the use of personal protective equipment, designed to protect health care workers and patients from contact with infectious agents.

Laboratory and health care workers can protect themselves and their patients from exposure to HIV and other infections by following standard precautions.

Often, during clinical care, it is not known whether a patient is infected or colonized with potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Every patient, and every member of staff, should therefore be considered at risk, both of infecting others and of acquiring an infection. Standard precautions should be applied during all contact between health care workers and patients, in all health care facilities at all times.

The key components of standard precautions are:
- hand washing and antisepsis (hand hygiene);
- use of personal protective equipment when handling blood, blood products, body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or wound dressings;
- prevention of needle-stick and sharp injuries;
- appropriate handling of patient care equipment, environmental cleaning and management of spills;
- appropriate handling of waste.

Each of these components is discussed in detail below.

\section*{HAND HYGIENE}

Hand hygiene is the single most important and cost-effective measure to eliminate disease-causing microorganisms that contaminate hands, and to limit the spread of infection. Proper hand hygiene can be accomplished by frequent hand washing and frequent use of an alcohol-based handrub.

In most clinical situations, an alcohol-based handrub should be used for routine hand antisepsis. Commercial handrubs, liquid soaps and skin-care products are sold in disposable containers, and may be used provided they meet recognized international standards (such as those of the American Society for Testing and Materials or the European Committee for Standardization), and are well accepted by health care workers. Where such products are not available or are too costly, an alcohol-based handrub can be produced locally at low cost. ${ }^{2}$

Clean water ${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ should be available for hand hygiene in all health care settings providing services related to male circumcision (screening, surgery, and follow-up). All staff should wash their hands with soap and water before starting their clinic duties, and whenever hands are visibly soiled. In addition, staff should use an alcohol-based handrub frequently, particularly before and after direct contact with each patient.

Hands should be washed or treated with a handrub:
- before and after direct contact with each patient;
- after removing gloves;
- before handling an invasive device for patient care, whether or not gloves are used;
- after contact with blood, blood products, body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or wound dressings;
- after using the toilet (normal personal hygiene).

\footnotetext{
${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ If the tap water is contaminated, use either water that has been boiled for 10 minutes and filtered to remove particulate matter, or chlorinated water (water treated with a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) to give a final concentration of $0.001 \%$ ).
}

Fig. 8.2 Correct hand rubbing technique for health care workers

Keep in mind the following:
- Alcohol-based handrubs do not remove soil or organic matter. If hands are visibly soiled, wash them with soap and water.
- Staff who frequently wash hands or use an alcohol-based handrub should use hand lotions and creams regularly to minimize drying of the skin and reduce the risk of irritant contact dermatitis. Staff with an allergy or adverse reaction to alcohol-based handrubs should use other handrubs or soap and water.

If potentially infectious blood or other body fluid is splashed onto non-intact skin, or if there is a potentially infective percutaneous injury, do not use alcohol-based solutions or strong disinfectants; wash the affected part with water and soap, and seek advice on the need for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (see page 8-16).

\section*{Surgical hand scrub}

The hand scrub procedure for the surgeon is described in Chapter 4.

\section*{PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT}

Personal protective equipment provides a physical barrier against microorganisms, helping to prevent them from contaminating hands, eyes, clothing, hair and shoes, and from being transmitted to patients and staff.

Personal protective equipment includes gloves, masks, protective eyewear (face shield or goggles), cap or hair cover, apron, gown, and footwear (boot or shoe covers).

Personal protective equipment should be used by health care workers who provide direct care to patients, support staff, including medical aides, cleaners, and laundry staff, and family members who provide care to patients in situations where they may have contact with blood, blood products and body fluids. Laboratory staff who handle patient specimens should always use personal protective equipment.

Protective equipment that is designed for single use (e.g. disposable gloves, eyewear, masks, caps, gowns, aprons and footwear) should not be reused. It should be disposed of according to the health care facility protocol. Reusable equipment should be decontaminated according to the manufacturer's instructions or laundered according to the health care facility protocol.

\section*{Gloves}

The use of gloves does not replace the need for hand hygiene by either hand rubbing or hand washing. Gloves should be worn whenever the person is likely to come into contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin. Gloves should be removed
immediately after caring for a patient. Gloves should not be used for the care of more than one patient.

Change or remove gloves in the following situations: during patient care if moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site within the same patient; after patient contact before touching another patient.

In countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV infection, wearing two pairs of gloves (double gloving) may be appropriate for surgical procedures lasting more than 30 minutes or involving contact with large amounts of blood or body fluids. This situation is not likely to apply with properly screened patients undergoing clinic-based circumcision.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.1 Gloving requirements for common tasks in a male circumcision service}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Activity & Type of gloves \\
\hline Checking blood pressure or temperature, giving an injection & No gloves required \\
\hline Drawing blood and testing for HIV & Examination \\
\hline Handling and cleaning instruments, handling contaminated waste, cleaning spills of blood or other body fluid & Utility \\
\hline Surgery & Sterile surgical \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Keep in mind the following:
- Wear gloves of the correct size, particularly for surgery.
- Use water-soluble (non-fat-containing) hand lotions and moisturizers, to prevent skin from drying, cracking, and chapping. Avoid oil-based hand lotions and creams, because they can damage latex rubber surgical and examination gloves.
- Keep fingernails short: they should not extend beyond the fingertip. Bacteria and other microorganisms that cause disease can collect under long nails. Long nails also tend to puncture gloves more easily.
- Store gloves in an area where they are protected from extremes of temperature.
- Glove reprocessing is strongly discouraged and should be avoided. There is currently no standardized, validated and affordable procedure for reprocessing gloves.
- Using gloves when they are not necessary represents a waste of resources.

\section*{Masks, caps and protective eyewear}

Masks protect the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from possible infections, as well as reduce the risks of transmission of infections from the health care worker. They should be worn by anyone undertaking a procedure
that is likely to generate splashes of blood, blood products and body fluids. Surgical masks are designed to resist fluids, and are preferable to cotton or gauze masks.

Caps or hair covers and eyewear, such as plastic goggles, safety glasses, face shields and visors, protect against accidental splashes, spills and leaks of blood and other body fluids.

Protective eyewear should be worn by theatre staff during circumcision surgery. Caps are recommended, but are not essential.

\section*{Aprons and the surgeon's gown}

Aprons made of rubber or plastic provide a waterproof barrier to keep contaminated fluids off the health worker's clothing and skin. Staff should wear aprons when cleaning instruments and other items used for patient care.

If an apron is used, it is worn under the surgical gown. During circumcision surgery a surgeon's gown is recommended, though some surgeons prefer to use a clean or disposable apron.

\section*{Footwear}

Appropriate footwear is necessary to protect the feet from injury from sharp or heavy items. Rubber boots or leather shoes provide the best protection, but must be regularly cleaned. Avoid wearing sandals, thongs, or shoes made of soft material.

\section*{Immunizations}

Certain vaccines, such as hepatitis $B$, can be useful for protecting health care workers and laboratory staff against diseases they may be exposed to during their work.

\section*{SAFE HANDLING OF HYPODERMIC NEEDLES AND SYRINGES}

All clinic staff should be trained in the safe handling of sharp instruments. Single-use autodisable syringes with integrated needles are safer because they cannot be used again, but are expensive. Hypodermic (hollow-bore) needles are the most common cause of injuries to all types of clinic workers:
- Health care workers are most often stuck by hypodermic needles during patient care.
- Cleaning staff are most often stuck by needles when washing soiled instruments.
- Housekeeping staff are most often stuck by needles when disposing of waste material.

\section*{Tips for safe use of hypodermic needles and syringes}
- Disposable needles and syringes must be used only once.
- Do not disassemble the needle and syringe after use.
- Do not bend or break needles before disposal.
- Dispose of the needle and syringe together in a puncture-resistant container.

In general, it is safer to dispose of a needle and syringe directly into a sharps container without recapping. If a needle must be recapped, use the "one-handed" recapping method:
- Place the needle cap on a firm, flat surface.
- Holding the syringe with one hand, use the needle to "scoop up" the cap (see Fig. 8.3).
- With the cap over the needle tip, turn the syringe upright (vertical), so that the needle is pointing towards the ceiling.
- With the forefinger and thumb

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-160.jpg?height=660&width=586&top_left_y=1279&top_left_x=1182}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 8.3 One-handed needle recapping method}
\end{figure}
of your other hand, grasp the cap just above its open end and push it firmly down onto the hub (the place where the needle joins the syringe).

\section*{Sharps containers}

Clearly labelled, puncture- and tamper-proof sharps safety boxes or containers are a key component in efforts to keep injuries from disposable sharps to a minimum.
- Place sharps containers as close to the point of use as possible and practical (ideally within arm's reach), but away from busy areas. Avoid placing containers near light switches, overhead fans,
or thermostat controls, where people might accidentally put their hand into them.
- Attach containers to walls or other surfaces, if possible, at a convenient height, so that staff can use and replace them easily.
- Mark the container clearly, so that people will not mistakenly use it as a rubbish bin.
- Mark the fill line (at the three-quarters full level). Do not shake the container to settle its contents, to make room for more sharps.
- Never attempt to empty the sharps container.

\section*{PROCESSING OF INSTRUMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANING AND MANAGEMENT OF SPILLS}

Soiled instruments and other reusable items can transmit infection if they are not properly reprocessed. Effective and safe reprocessing includes disinfecting instruments and equipment immediately after use, cleaning to remove all organic matter and chemicals, and highlevel disinfection or sterilization for instruments that will be used in normally sterile critical sites, i.e. within the body, in sterile tissue, cavities or the bloodstream. Before sterilization, all equipment must be disinfected and then cleaned to remove debris. Sterilization is intended to kill living organisms, but is not a method of cleaning.

\section*{Disinfection}

Disinfectant solutions are used to inactivate any infectious agents that may be present in blood or other body fluids. They must always be available for cleaning working surfaces, equipment that cannot be autoclaved and non-disposable items, and for dealing with any spillages involving pathological specimens or other known or potentially infectious material.

Used instruments should routinely be soaked in a chemical disinfectant for 30 minutes before cleaning. Disinfection decreases the viral and bacterial burden of an instrument, but does not clean debris from the instrument or sterilize it. The purpose of disinfection is to reduce the risk to those who have to handle the instruments during further cleaning. Disinfection is not a sterilizing process and must not be used as a substitute for sterilization.

There are many disinfectant solutions, with varying degrees of effectiveness. In most countries, the most widely available disinfectant is sodium hypochlorite solution (commonly known as bleach or chloros), which is a particularly effective antiviral solution.

\section*{Cleaning}

All used instruments and equipment must be cleaned with detergent and water after disinfection and before being high-level disinfected or sterilized. Otherwise, organic matter may prevent adequate contact with the disinfectant or sterilizing agent. The organic matter may also bind and inactivate chemical disinfectants.

\section*{Instructions for manual cleaning}
- Wear thick household or utility gloves.
- Wear protective eyewear, mask and plastic apron, if available, to prevent contaminated fluids from splashing into your eyes or onto your body.
- Thoroughly wash items to be cleaned with soap and clean water:
- Use liquid soap, if available. Do not use abrasive cleaners or steel wool, especially on metal (they cause scratches and increase the risk of rusting).
- Using a soft brush, scrub instruments under the surface of the water to prevent splashing, paying particular attention to any teeth, joints, or screws.
- Rinse the instruments with clean water.
- Dry the instruments with a towel or allow them to air-dry.

\section*{High-level disinfection}

High-level disinfection destroys all microorganisms except some bacterial endospores. It is usually used for heat-sensitive instruments and equipment that are used in critical sites, but that cannot be sterilized. High-level disinfection is the only acceptable alternative to sterilization for heat-sensitive surgical instruments.

There is no single ideal disinfectant. Different grades of disinfectants are used for different purposes. However, glutaral (glutaraldehyde) is generally the most appropriate chemical for high-level disinfection. It must be used under very strictly controlled conditions, in a safe working environment, and the manufacturer's handling instructions must be strictly followed.

\section*{Sterilization}

Sterilization is the destruction of all microorganisms, including bacterial endospores. Sterilization can be achieved by either physical or chemical methods. Sterilization is necessary for medical devices that will be used in sterile body sites.

Sterilization can be done using:
- high-pressure steam (autoclave) or dry heat (oven);
- chemicals, such as ethylene oxide or formaldehyde;
- radiation.

Sterilization of all surgical instruments and supplies is crucial in preventing HIV transmission. All viruses, including HIV, are inactivated by high-pressure steam sterilization (autoclaving) for 20 minutes at $121-132^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, or for 30 minutes if the instruments are in wrapped packs.

Items that have been sterilized need to be properly stored, to ensure that they do not become recontaminated.
- The storage area should be clean, dry, and free of dust and lint.
- The temperature should be kept at approximately $24{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and the relative humidity at less than $70 \%$, if possible.
- Sterile packs and containers should be stored 20-25 cm off the floor, $45-50 \mathrm{~cm}$ from the ceiling and $15-20 \mathrm{~cm}$ from an outside wall.
- Do not use wooden or cardboard boxes for storage of sterile items, as they shed dust and debris and may harbour insects.
- Mark the date of sterilization on the package, and use the oldest packages first - "first in, first out". Dates serve as an indicator of when packs should be used, but do not guarantee the sterility of the packs.

\section*{Environmental cleaning}

Routine cleaning is important to ensure a clean and dust-free clinic environment. Visible dirt usually contains many microorganisms, and routine cleaning helps to eliminate such dirt. Administrative and office areas with no patient contact should be cleaned regularly in the same way as other offices. Most patient care areas should be cleaned by wet mopping; dry sweeping is not recommended. Hot water $\left(80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is a useful and effective environmental cleaner. The use of a detergent solution improves the quality of cleaning.

All horizontal surfaces and all toilet areas should be cleaned daily. The operating table and instrument trolley should be cleaned with detergent and water between cases.

\section*{Management of spills}

Any area that is visibly contaminated with blood or body fluids should be cleaned immediately with detergent and water. After cleaning, disinfect the area with $0.5 \%$ sodium hypochlorite solution.

\section*{SAFE DISPOSAL OF INFECTIOUS WASTE MATERIALS}

\section*{Waste management}

The purpose of waste management is to:
- protect people who handle waste items from accidental injury;
- prevent the spread of infection to health care workers and the local community.

\section*{Tips for safe handling and disposal of infectious waste}
- Place all waste in plastic or galvanized metal containers, with tightly fitting colour-coded covers that differentiate infectious from non-infectious waste.
- Place all disposable sharps in designated puncture-resistant containers.
- Place waste containers close to where the waste is generated, in a position that is convenient for users.
- Ensure that equipment used to hold and transport wastes is not used for any other purpose.
- Regularly wash all waste containers with a disinfectant solution ( $0.5 \%$ sodium hypochlorite solution), then wash with soap, rinse with water and allow to air-dry.
- When possible, use separate containers for waste that will be treated or that will be disposed of in a particular manner. In this way, workers will not have to handle and separate waste by hand.

When patients are being cared for at home, contaminated waste, such as dressings and other items that may have been in contact with blood or other body fluids, can be buried in a covered pit or burned in a drum incinerator in the yard.

\section*{Disposing of sharp items}

Disposable sharp items, such as hypodermic needles, require special handling. They are the items most likely to injure the health care workers who handle them. If these items are disposed of in a municipal landfill, they become a danger to people in the community.

Step 1. Do not recap a used hypodermic needle or disassemble the needle and syringe.

Step 2. Place the needle and syringe in a puncture-resistant sharps container. The opening should be large enough to allow items to be dropped through it easily, but small enough to prevent anything being removed from inside.

Step 3. When the container is three-quarters full, dispose of it.

When disposing of the sharps container:
Step 1. Wear heavy-duty utility gloves.
Step 2. Cap, plug, or tape the opening of the container tightly closed. Make sure that no sharp items are sticking out of the container.

Step 3. Dispose of the sharps container by burning, encapsulating, or burying it.

Step 4. Remove utility gloves.
Step 5. Wash hands and dry them with a clean cloth or towel or allow to air-dry.

\section*{Burning waste containers}

Burning destroys the waste and kills any microorganisms, and is the best method of disposing of contaminated waste. It reduces the bulk volume of waste and also ensures that items cannot be scavenged and reused.

\section*{Encapsulating waste containers}

Encapsulation is the easiest way to safely dispose of sharps containers. When the container is three-quarters full, pour cement (mortar), plastic foam, clay or other similar material into the container until it is completely full. After the material has hardened, seal the container and dispose of it in a landfill or bury it.

\section*{Burying waste}

In health care facilities with limited resources, burial of waste (such as excised foreskins) near the facility may be the only practical option for waste disposal. To limit health risks and environmental pollution, some basic rules should be followed:
- Restrict access to the disposal site. Build a fence around the site to keep animals and children away.
- Line the burial site with a material of low permeability (e.g., clay), if available.
- Select a site at least 50 meters away from any water source to prevent contamination of the water table.
- Ensure that the site has proper drainage, is located downhill from any wells, is free of standing water, and is not in an area that floods.

\section*{POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS}

Health care workers may be accidentally exposed to blood and other body fluids that are potentially infected with HIV, hepatitis virus or other bloodborne pathogens. Occupational exposure may occur through direct contact of non-intact skin with potentially infected blood or body fluids, from splashes into the eyes or mouth, or through injury with a used needle or sharp instrument. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can help prevent the transmission of pathogens after such a potential exposure.

\section*{Managing occupational exposure to hepatitis $B$, hepatitis $C$ and HIV}

The immediate response to exposure to blood or other fluids that are potentially infected with hepatitis $B$ virus (HBV), hepatitis $C$ virus (HCV) or HIV is as follows.

Step 1. Provide immediate first aid care to the exposure site:
- If a splash or a spill occurs on the skin, wash the area immediately with soap and water. Do not use caustic agents, alcohol or bleach, because they will irritate the skin and may increase the risk of infection. Do not apply a dressing.
- If a splash or a spill occurs in the eyes, the nose, the mouth, or on any mucous membrane, rinse the area with clean water for at least 10 minutes.
- If an injury has been caused by a potentially contaminated sharp, wash the area with soapy water, and allow the wound to bleed freely for a few minutes if possible. Then give normal first aid.

Step 2. Evaluate the risk by determining the type of fluid (blood, visibly bloody fluid, or other potentially infectious fluid), the severity and type of exposure (percutaneous or needle stick, mucous membranes, intact or non-intact skin), and the source of infection.

Step 3: If the source person is identified, it is important to try to obtain information on his or her hepatitis and HIV serostatus and, if positive, an evaluation of the clinical status and treatment history.
- Assess the risk of infection, using available information.
- The source person may be tested only with his or her informed consent.
- Do not test discarded needles or syringes for virus contamination.

\section*{Management of exposure to hepatitis B}

The medical response to exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV) depends on the patient's immune status, as determined by the history of hepatitis $B$ vaccination and vaccine response, and whether the exposure poses a risk of infection. Transmission of HBV may occur
following percutaneous injury, or contamination of mucous membranes or non-intact skin. The virus does not cross intact skin. HBV post-exposure prophylaxis is safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.2. Recommendations for HBV post-exposure prophylaxis, according to immune status of exposed person}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline HBV immune status & Post-exposure prophylaxis \\
\hline Unvaccinated & HBV vaccination and HB immunoglobulin (HB Ig) \\
\hline Previously vaccinated, known responder (anti-hepatitis B surface antigen positive) & None \\
\hline Previously vaccinated, known non-responder & HBV vaccination and HB Ig \\
\hline Antibody response unknown & Test. If antibody response is poor, give HB vaccination and HB Ig \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

People who receive hepatitis $B$ vaccine should be tested for antihepatitis B surface antigen 1-2 months after the last dose. Note that the anti-hepatitis $B$ surface antigen response to vaccine cannot be ascertained if the person was given HB Ig in the previous 3-4 months.

\section*{Management of exposure to hepatitis C}
- There is no post-exposure prophylaxis regimen for hepatitis C virus (HCV).
- Evaluate the person who has been exposed to hepatitis C virus by performing a baseline test for anti-HCV antibodies and alanine aminotransferase (ALAT).
- Perform follow-up testing for anti-HCV antibodies and ALAT 4-6 months after exposure.
- Repeatedly reactive anti-HCV enzyme immunoassays should be confirmed with supplemental tests.
- Any person who is found to have HCV antibodies should be referred to a specialist for care.

\section*{Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV ${ }^{\mathbf{3}}$}

Post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV is a set of comprehensive actions aimed at preventing infection in the exposed person. It includes first aid care, counselling and risk assessment, HIV testing following informed consent, and - depending on the risk assessment - the provision of a short course (28 days) of antiretroviral drugs, with follow-up and support.

Step 1. First aid
Provide immediate first aid care for the exposure site, as described above.

Step 2. Report and evaluation
After the incident, the exposed person should be referred to a trained service provider, who can give counselling, evaluate the risk of HIV transmission having occurred, and decide on the need to prescribe antiretroviral (ARV) medications to prevent HIV infection. The incident should be reported for further evaluation, according to national requirements regarding recording and notification of occupational injuries and diseases.

The recommendation for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis is based on an evaluation of the risk of infection according to the type of exposure and the HIV status of the source (see Table 8.3).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.3. Recommendations for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Type of exposure & Source known HIV-positive & Source of unknown HIV status & Source known HIV-negative \\
\hline Percutaneous, severe (e.g. injury with large hollow-bore needle, deep puncture, visible blood on device, needle used in artery or vein) & Two-drug regimen ${ }^{\text {a }}$ & Consider HIV prevalence in population or subgroup & PEP not recommended, unless there is risk that source is in window period ${ }^{\text {c }}$ \\
\hline Percutaneous, not severe (e.g. injury with small-bore or solid needle, superficial injury) & Two-drug regimen ${ }^{\text {a }}$ & PEP not recommended & PEP not recommended \\
\hline Splash on non-genital mucous membrane or non-intact skin, severe (e.g. exposure to large volume of blood or semen) & Two-drug regimen ${ }^{\text {a }}$ & Consider HIV prevalence in population or subgroup & PEP not recommended, unless there is risk that source is in window period \\
\hline Splash on non-genital mucous membrane or non-intact skin, not severe (e.g. exposure to small volume of blood or semen, or to less infectious fluid, such as cerebrospinal fluid) & PEP not recommended; two-drug regimen if circumstances require ${ }^{\text {b }}$ & PEP not recommended & PEP not recommended \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\footnotetext{
${ }^{\text {a }}$ Three drugs are recommended in certain settings; see discussion on choice of regimen in text.
${ }^{\text {b }}$ Although PEP is not recommended, it is inappropriate to withhold PEP if the exposed person insists. In this case the two drug regimen is given.
c Recent HIV infection not detected with antibody test
}

Post-exposure prophylaxis is not indicated:
1. if the exposed person is already HIV-positive from a previous exposure;
2. in the context of chronic exposure (e.g. repeated exposure to HIV from unprotected sexual intercourse with a known HIV-positive partner);
3. if the exposure poses no risk of transmission, e.g.:
- exposure of intact skin to potentially infectious body fluids;
- exposure to non-infectious body fluids (faeces, saliva, urine, sweat);
- exposure to body fluids from a person known to be HIV-negative, unless the source person is identified as being at high risk of having been recently infected and currently within the window period for seroconversion.

\section*{Step 3. Testing and counselling}
- If testing is available, the exposed person should be offered the chance to be tested for HIV and receive appropriate counselling. The person should always have the choice to refuse testing.
- Do not delay starting ARVs for PEP while waiting for HIV test results. The exposed person could start taking ARVs for PEP immediately, and stop the treatment if the test results reveal that he or she is already HIVpositive.
- Antiretroviral drugs for PEP should be started as soon as possible and in any case within 72 hours after exposure.
- The drugs should be taken continuously for 28 days.
- Each circumcision clinic should either have the necessary drugs in stock or know where they can be obtained, so that treatment can be started within 72 hours.
- Whenever possible, the source patient should also be tested, with his or her informed consent. If the test results show that the source person is negative, PEP can be stopped.
- Counselling should include provision of information on the importance of adhering to treatment, and information on HIV prevention in general and in the workplace. The person should be advised to use condoms, and not to donate blood or organs for up to 6 months after exposure.
- Women of childbearing age should be advised to use contraception, and alternatives to breastfeeding should be discussed with women currently feeding their infants. There is a high risk of transmitting HIV to the infant if the mother becomes infected during breastfeeding.

\section*{Step 4. Antiretroviral medications for post-exposure prophylaxis}

If national guidelines on post-exposure prophylaxis exist, these should be followed. If not, WHO recommendations may be applied. WHO recommends a two-drug PEP regimen, unless there is suspicion or evidence of drug resistance. The standard PEP regimen consists of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The possible regimens are given in Table 8.4.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.4 Recommended two-drug PEP regimens ${ }^{\text {a }}$}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline Preferred regimens & \begin{tabular}{l} 
zidovudine $($ ZDV $)+$ lamivudine $(3 T C)$, or \\
stavudine $(\mathrm{d} 4 T)+3 T C$
\end{tabular} \\
Alternative regimens & \begin{tabular}{l} 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate $(T D F)+3 T C$, or \\
TDF + emtricitabine $(F T C)^{a}$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
${ }^{\mathrm{a}}$ These combinations are currently commercially available as fixed-dose combinations.
Note that non-NRTIs are not recommended for PEP. In regions where the prevalence of drug resistance is above $15 \%$, or when there is suspicion that the virus could be resistant to one or more of the drugs included in the standard PEP regimen, a third drug - a protease inhibitor - should be added to the two chosen NRTIs. In this situation, it is recommended to consult an HIV expert.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.5 Recommended three-drug PEP regimens ${ }^{\text {a }}$}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Preferred regimens & & ZDV + 3TC + LPV/r \\

\hline & 3. & TDF + FTC + SQV/r or ATV/r or FPV/r \\
\hline & 4. & $\mathrm{d} 4 \mathrm{~T}+3 \mathrm{TC}+\mathrm{SQV} / \mathrm{r}$ or ATV/r or FPV/r \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
${ }^{\text {a }}$ ZDV: zidovudine; 3TC: lamivudine; LPV/r: lopinavir/ritonavir; SQV/r: saquinavir/ritonavir; ATV/r: atazanavir/ritonavir; FPV/r: fosamprenavir/ritonavir; d4T: stavudine; TDF: tenofovir; FTC: emtricitabine.
- Women of childbearing age not using reliable contraception should not be prescribed medications such as the combination didanosine + stavudine. They should be offered a pregnancy test before starting the PEP regimen.
- Lactating women should be aware that ARVs are excreted in breast milk, and that the virus itself can be transmitted during breastfeeding
- When and where safe and feasible, alternative feeding options should be discussed with breastfeeding mothers.

Step 5. Follow-up and testing
Follow-up visits should aim to support the person's adherence to PEP, prevent or treat side-effects of the medicines, and detect seroconversion, if it occurs. The following steps are recommended:
- There should be regular follow-up for the first six weeks after starting PEP to support good adherence.
- Perform HIV-antibody testing at baseline, 6-12 weeks and six months after exposure.
- Perform HIV-antibody testing if the person develops any illness compatible with an acute retroviral syndrome.
- Advise exposed persons to take precautions to prevent secondary transmission during the follow-up period. This includes:
- avoiding pregnancy and seeking safe alternatives to breastfeeding;
- avoiding donating blood, tissue or sperm;
- using condoms during sexual intercourse, until the test at six months confirms that the exposed person remains seronegative.
- Evaluate exposed persons taking PEP within 72 hours after exposure and monitor for drug adherence and possible drug-related side-effects and toxicity for at least two weeks.
- If the person develops HIV antibodies, he or she should be referred for treatment, care and support.

The incident report and the evaluation of the risk of exposure (see Step 2) should also lead to quality control and evaluation of working safety conditions. Appropriate correctional measures (such as strengthening adherence to standard precautions, if relevant) should be taken to prevent other exposures to HIV and other bloodborne pathogens

\section*{Clinic staff should know their HIV status}

It is advisable for all clinic staff who carry out surgical procedures to have an HIV test at periodic intervals, in accordance with national HIV testing guidelines. If a health care worker is known to have recently had a negative HIV test, then post-exposure prophylaxis can be started immediately, if relevant, following exposure to potentially infected blood. In addition, health care workers would be showing leadership in the context of national campaigns to increase awareness of HIV status.

\section*{MANAGING A CIRCUMCISION SERVICE}

\section*{Summary}
- The manager of a clinic circumcision service has a number of roles. These include ensuring quality of services, making sure that good quality records are kept, monitoring and evaluating the programme, and carrying out supportive supervision.
- To meet these responsibilities, the clinic manager must set the desired levels of performance for the services provided, assess current levels of performance, work with other clinic staff to analyse the causes of inadequate performance and find solutions for identified problems.

\section*{RECORD-KEEPING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION}

The clinic manager should ensure that the health care providers maintain adequate records on all clients. Records should include information on the identity of the client, the type of service provided, and any special circumstances associated with it. Sample record forms to assist this task are given in Appendices 9.1 (stock card), 9.2 (stock-taking card for consumables), 9.3 (adverse event form) and 9.4 (register).

A more detailed account of indicators and monitoring and evaluation of male circumcision programmes is given in the WHO/UNAIDS publication A guide to indicators for male circumcision programmes in the formal health care system, which can be downloaded from the Clearinghouse on Male Circumcision for HIV prevention (www.malecircumcision.org).

\section*{Indicators}

Health care facility managers need detailed information to allow them to make decisions about how best to use scarce resources. They might want to know the answers to questions such as:
- Are we reaching our target audience?
- Can we provide the necessary services (for example, do we have the appropriate equipment, staff and medications)?
- Are our services of high quality (for example, do they meet national and international standards)?
- Do our services meet the needs of our clients?
- Are we referring clients who need it?

For each question, managers should develop one or more indicators to monitor the services or the impact of changes. For example, to assess the quality of the circumcision service provided, an appropriate
indicator might be the percentage of male circumcision clients who are re-admitted or referred for management of an adverse event.

Answering these questions depends on careful record-keeping by staff who understand the purpose of the records.

\section*{What is monitoring?}

Monitoring is the routine assessment (e.g. daily, monthly, quarterly) of information or indicators related to ongoing activities.

Monitoring helps to:
- track progress towards the programme targets or performance standards; and
- identify aspects of the programme that are working according to plan and those that are in need of adjustment.

\section*{What is evaluation?}

Evaluation is the measurement of how much things have changed as a result of the interventions implemented.

There are, of course, many factors that can cause things to change. A formal evaluation tries to demonstrate how much a specific intervention contributed to an observed change.

\section*{Why evaluate male circumcision programmes?}

The purpose of evaluating a male circumcision programme is to:
- assess progress made at particular points in time;
- assess progress towards objectives;
- provide feedback on whether targets are being met;
- identify reasons for successes and failures; and
- provide a basis for future planning.

\section*{What is a monitoring system?}

Collecting information to track indicators requires the collaboration of dedicated and knowledgeable staff. Obtaining and reporting the required information represent an extra burden of work, and may even be impossible unless an effective monitoring system is in place. This implies:
- All those involved know what information is needed and by whom.
- The tools needed to collect the information are available.
- All those involved know how and when to report the information.
- One person is responsible for making sure the system is working, i.e. that indicators are up to date, that records are being properly kept, and that data are reported to appropriate partners.

The person responsible for the monitoring system must keep clinic staff informed about what needs to be recorded and reported. He or she must also adjust monitoring tools to reflect the information required.

\section*{Monitoring performance in male circumcision programmes}

Fig. 9.1 is a graphic representation of how monitoring through routine data collection can help identify how programme performance (represented by the thick arrow) relates to programme objectives, using as an example the cumulative number of circumcisions performed per month.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 9.1. Monitoring and evaluation of programme performance in relation to programme objectives}
\end{figure}

\section*{Evaluation \\ Evaluation can be done by:}
- reviewing available records and reports (client record forms, clinic register, theatre register, adverse events forms, drug inventory forms, referral forms, etc.);
- conducting supervisory assessments;
- having staff conduct self-assessments;
- conducting peer assessments;
- obtaining feedback from clients (e.g. through exit interviews);
- surveying community perceptions of the service;
- comparing the clinic's services with those of other facilities.

\section*{What are "good data"?}

A monitoring system will provide useful information only if the data recorded are "good". Clinic managers should ensure that staff are aware of the following:
- Understanding the data. Staff responsible for keeping records should know exactly what information is needed, for example, adverse events associated with male circumcision.
- Recording the data every time. Every time a staff member performs a procedure, sees a client, prescribes medication, receives a test result, or makes a referral, it should be recorded on the appropriate form.
- Recording all the data. All the information requested on the monitoring forms should be completed. This might require noting when a particular treatment was not provided.
- Recording the data in the same way every time. The same definitions, rules, and tests should always be used for reporting the same piece of information. In the long term, this may not be possible, as tests and definitions change, treatment evolves and new technologies are developed. When it is not possible to record data in the same way, a note should be made describing the change.

It is not the role of clinicians (surgeons or medical, clinical and nursing officers) to develop a functional monitoring system for the facility. That is the role of the health planner or clinic manager. However, the clinicians need to know who is responsible for the monitoring system, to record data accurately and reliably, and to know how and when to report information related to the service or to patients.

Clinicians can also help those responsible for the system by providing feedback about how the system is working, how information is shared with other clinicians, and how easy the various forms are for clinicians to complete accurately and reliably. In this way, the monitoring system to be as accurate and reliable as possible.

\section*{Using monitoring information for intervention-related decisionmaking}

In the context of record-keeping and monitoring, information is good only if it can be used. Data that cannot be used should not be collected.

\section*{QUALITY ASSURANCE}

Quality assurance is the assessment or measurement of the quality of care and services and the implementation of any necessary changes to either maintain or improve the quality of care rendered. Quality assurance has also been defined as a systematic process for closing the gap between actual performance and desirable outcomes.

The quality of male circumcision services can be defined through the development and communication of standards. Quality can then be measured by determining whether the standards are being met. Various methods can be used to measure quality, e.g. selfassessment, peer assessment and external assessment. Quality improvement methodology can be used to continuously improve the quality of male circumcision care and services.

WHO has developed a comprehensive guide to quality assurance ${ }^{1}$ for male circumcision programmes. The guide defines ten service standards that each programme should meet (Box) and includes the essential competences for male circumcision service provision. In addition it outlines the process of quality assessment and includes guidance for facility managers and staff. The guide is supplemented by a toolkit ${ }^{2}$ to assist managers and staff assess the quality of services.

\section*{Recommended male circumcision service standards}
1. An effective management system is established to oversee the provision of male circumcision services.
2. A minimum package of male circumcision services is provided.
3. The facility has the necessary medicines, supplies, equipment and environment for providing safe male circumcision services of good quality.
4. Providers are qualified and competent.
5. Clients are provided with information and education on HIV prevention and male circumcision.
6. Assessments are performed to determine the condition of clients.
7. Male circumcision surgical care is delivered according to evidence-based guidelines.
8. Infection prevention and control measures are practised.
9. Continuity of care is provided.
10. A system for monitoring and evaluation is established.

\section*{SUPERVISION}

Traditional approaches to supervision emphasize inspecting facilities and checking individual performance. They focus on finding fault or errors, and sanctioning those responsible, or thought to be responsible. This type of supervision often causes negative feelings and rarely results in an improved service.

In contrast, supervision for performance and quality improvement focuses on:

${ }^{2}$ World Health Organization. Male circumcision services quality assessment toolkit. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009 (available at www.malecircumcision.org)
}
- the goal of providing high-quality health services;
- a style of encouraging, inclusive and supportive interaction; and
- a process of continuous performance and quality improvement.

\section*{The goal}

The goal of supervision is to promote and maintain the delivery of high-quality health services. In a traditional system of supervision, this goal is often lost, or at least is not apparent to those being supervised. By clearly stating that the goal of supervision is the delivery of highquality health care services, the supervisor can transform the sometimes negative impression of supervision into a positive one.

\section*{The style}

Supervision for performance and quality improvement should be done in a style that involves as many stakeholders as possible, achieves results through teamwork, and provides constructive and useful feedback. The underlying assumption is that people work better when they actively participate and are listened to, treated well, encouraged to do a good job, and recognized for a job well done.

\section*{The process}

Supervisors can use the step-by-step process of performance and quality improvement presented here to help achieve a high-quality service. The process is illustrated in Fig. 9.2.

The process involves a cycle of logical steps, which are repeated until the desired performance is achieved. The cycle can be used to solve any type of performance problem, for instance involving infection prevention practices, management of stocks, or counselling.

\begin{figure}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Figure 9.2 The performance and quality improvement process ${ }^{3}$}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_398c86f803fa38555eb0g-178.jpg?height=789&width=1115&top_left_y=334&top_left_x=616}
\end{figure}

The performance and quality improvement process involves the following steps.
- Define desired performance. In order for people to perform well, they must know what they are expected to do. Performance standards need to be set. Staff must know not only what their duties are, but also how they are expected to perform them. The desired performance should be realistic and based on common goals, the expectations of the community and the resources available. Examples of desired performance standards related to male circumcision are:
- All clients over the age of 18 years must complete a written informed consent form before undergoing male circumcision.
- Instruments used during a male circumcision procedure must be decontaminated in $0.5 \%$ sodium hypochlorite solution for 10 minutes before being cleaned and sterilized.
- All clients undergoing male circumcision (and/or their parents) should be counselled about HIV.
- Assess performance. The team should continually assess its own performance in relation to how it is expected to perform. This assessment can be done on a continuous basis informally, or more formally at periodic intervals, by monitoring specific activities and steps, conducting self-assessments or obtaining feedback from clients. Using the above desired standards as examples, performance assessment may show the following:
- $76 \%$ of clients over the age of 18 years completed a written informed consent form before undergoing male circumcision (a gap of 24\%).
- Instruments used during male circumcision procedures were decontaminated in 0.5\% sodium hypochlorite solution for 10

\footnotetext{

}
minutes before being cleaned and sterilized 50\% of the time (a gap of $50 \%$ ).
- $36 \%$ of clients undergoing male circumcision (and/or their parents) were counselled about HIV (a gap of $74 \%$ ).
- Find the causes of performance gaps. A performance gap means that what is occurring does not meet the performance standards that have been set. If this is found to be the case, the manager needs to explore with staff why the gap is occurring. Sometimes the reasons for poor performance are not immediately obvious, and it may take some time to find the real cause. For example, if 74\% of clients undergoing male circumcision are not being counselled about HIV infection, analysis of the gap may reveal the following possible causes:
- shortage of staff (especially counsellors and nurses);
- a high client load;
- no space in the clinic for counselling clients;
- a shortage of test kits for HIV;
- staff not aware of facility policy; or
- no one in the facility has been trained in counselling and testing.
- Select and implement interventions to improve performance. Once the causes of the performance gap have been determined, the manager and staff will need to identify, put in order of priority, plan and implement interventions to improve performance. These interventions can be directed at improving the knowledge and skills of staff, or the environment and support systems. Many different types of interventions can improve worker performance. To make the best use of resources, it is important to select the most appropriate ones.
- Monitor and evaluate performance. Once an intervention has been implemented, it is important to determine whether it has had the desired result. In other words, did the intervention lead to improved performance? Did the team come closer to meeting established standards? If not, the team will need to look again at what is hindering performance, to make sure that the interventions were targeted at the real cause of the performance gap. If performance has improved, it is important to continue monitoring to make sure that the level of performance is maintained.

\section*{SECTION 2}

PROMOTION OF ADOLESCENT AND YOUTH SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

\section*{Objectives}
1. Role of the health service provider in creating awareness on the available SRH services.
2. Scope of youth friendly services.
3. Characteristics of youth friendly services.
4. Categories of Life Skills Training for the Adolescents
5. Barriers to the utilisation of existing RH services by adolescents/youth
6. Role of networking and collaboration in the promotion of SRH

\section*{Role of the health service provider in creating awareness on the available SRH services}
- The service provider has a major role in creating awareness to dispel fears, misconceptions and rumors about adolescent and SRH Issues.
- This will make the young people utilize the services available.
- This can be achieved through:
1. Counseling,
2. Education,
3. Provision of quality SRH Services,
4. Referral to Youth Friendly services for support.
- The counseling process involving the approaches of GATHER and REDI and by use of verbal and non verbal techniques; i.e. CLEAR ROLES.
2. Education is by giving relevant health education on SRH Issues, using appropriate Information, Education and Communication (IEC), aims at Behavior Change Communication (BBC) and providing Behavior Change Information (BCI). Micro teaching and utilization of Mass Media is also effective as well as facilitation of formation of youth groups and clubs in community, churches and schools.
3. Provision of quality SRH Services without bias to the individuals so long as you have given effective counseling and have made informed choices.
4. Referral can be done to youth-friendly clubs and other support organizations within their reach if you are not able to provide the services.
- The Scope of Youth Friendly Services (YFS)
- According to Musandu, et al (2006); the health facilities are underutilized due to health providers' attitude and non confidentiality to SRH Issues.
- Those with more education and those who have received continuing education on Adolescent sexuality and health embrace the adolescent youth-friendly attitudes.
- WHO \& MOH, (2005), defines Youth Friendly Services as services that are "accessible, acceptable, affordable and appropriate" for the adolescents and youths.
- The scope of YFS focuses on the;
- 1. Pillars of Safe motherhood and
- 2. Sexual reproductive health information or guidance and counselling

\section*{Safe motherhood}
he Safe motherhood focuses on reduction of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality rate by provision of:
Family Planning and preconception care: should be provided after counselling, using the Medical Eligibility Criteria for both regular and emergency contraceptives so that we reduce dangers related to pregnancy and childbirth
Focused Antenatal Care: Aims at giving 4 comprehensive pre natal visits to prevent complications, identify early and manage them appropriately. Give health education to improve the health of mother through good nutrition and emphasise on individualised birth plan and danger signs of pregnancy, labour and delivery as well as post natally.
Clean and Safe Delivery: Ensure birth attendants are knowledgeable and skilled (professionals), equipments to perform delivery and post partum care for mother and baby provided. Due to being tender in age they tend to have labour and delivery complications which need to be monitored well through partogram in a well equipped health facility ${ }_{2028}$
- Safe motherhood cont..
- Targeted Post partum care - Is very critical to help the adolescent adjust to parenthood. Schedule of post natal checks should be within the 1 st 48 hours, within the $1-2$ weeks, at 6 weeks and $4-6$ months. This enables the young mother adjust well or else home visits can be done more frequently if need arises.
- Maternal nutrition is an important area as we all know that a number of adolescents may have inadequate diet which impairs healthy development. This has serious effects on the growing adolescent resulting on stunted growth and poor performance. They must be encouraged to eat well in all forms of food groups available due to nutritional requirements for growth.
- Post abortion care entails giving adequate care to those affected but aims at prevention by providing health information on dangers of early/pre marital sex and how to prevent unwanted pregnancy
- Neonatal care- Most adolescents have complications related to pregnancy and child birth, they have higher incidences of low birth weight. Due to this the children need to be followed up at the CWC for monitoring and immunization and to provide health information on parenting.

\section*{2. Sexual Reproductive Health Information/Guidance and Counselling;}
- Young people should be given adequate information on sexuality, expectations and how to defend their rights.
- IEC material should be available on site and take away on critical issues related to SRH as:
- i. Life skills training to empower them to be in charge of their health
- ii. Counselling services on substance and drug abuse, STIs/HIV, FP etc.
- iii. School health talks to address critical issues as sexuality and sex education
- iv. Post rape care is deemed important as many children are usually helpless and the perpetrators are never charged for their actions due to fear and ignorance and socio-cultural issues.
- v. Referral for treatment and management in situations where the individual needs more care as necessary.

- Collaboration is when two or more organizations support each other to achieve certain set goals.
- However they have to be conversant with what each group does to avoid duplication of services to enable them effectively and efficiently utilize the funds.
- Networking and collaboration can be effectively used to pull resources together for a particular service with the concept of team spirit.
- As they pull resources together, particular goals like sharing materials in the form of videos, IEC and posters are achieved.
- The health professional should also ensure a functioning referral system so that the Adolescents are able to get services as appropriate. They should be well informed about the services available at all levels of the YFS so that they utilise
