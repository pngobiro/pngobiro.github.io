                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Adolescence is defined as the transition period between childhood and adulthood. It is a period of rapid growth and maturation as the person reaches puberty. The onset of adolescence varies from one individual to another, and between the two sexes. In girls, it may begin as early as 9 years while in boys it may begin at 12 years. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period between 10-19 years.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Physical Characteristics of Adolescence</h3>
                        <p>Adolescence is marked by the development of secondary characteristics under the influence of the gonadotrophic hormone from the anterior pituitary gland.</p>
                        <h4>In Girls (Puberty between ages 12-14)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The uterus, the uterine tubes and the ovaries reach maturity.</li>
                            <li>The menstrual cycle and ovulation begin (menarche).</li>
                            <li>The breasts develop and enlarge.</li>
                            <li>Pubic and axillary hair begins to grow.</li>
                            <li>Increase in height and widening of the pelvis.</li>
                            <li>Increased fat deposited in the subcutaneous tissue, especially at the hips and breasts.</li>
                            <li>Face may become smooth or facial pimples (acne) may develop.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>In Boys (Puberty between ages 10-14)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Marked increase in height and weight.</li>
                            <li>Enlargement of the larynx and deepening of the voice.</li>
                            <li>Growth of hair on the face, axillae, chest, abdomen and pubis.</li>
                            <li>Enlargement of the penis, scrotum and prostate gland.</li>
                            <li>Maturation of the seminiferous tubules and production of spermatozoa.</li>
                            <li>First ejaculation (spermache) and nocturnal emissions (wet dreams) occur.</li>
                            <li>The skin thickens and becomes oilier.</li>

                        <p>While physiological changes are taking place and can be observed, great emotional and psychological changes are taking place that may not be as noticeable. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Changing relationships with parents,</strong> which may involve the adolescent pulling away and becoming more independent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Changing relationships with friends.</strong> Adolescents often imitate the values and behaviors of friends rather than those of parents and other adults. Peers are an important influence but they care more about what their friends think of them.</li>
                            <li><strong>The relationship with the opposite sex increases</strong> as they learn how to cope with romantic and sexual feelings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal feelings are also affected</strong> and there is a need to accept themselves as an independent individual.</li>
                            <li><strong>Values and behaviors are affected.</strong> Adolescents may attempt to behave more as adults, resolving problems in a responsible manner and making decisions bearing in mind the possible consequences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Increase in mood swings</strong> as they seek attention and want to belong and be appreciated.</li>

                        <p>Young people have special needs in all circumstances, and each age group within this population has different problems and requirements. The Government of Kenya is particularly interested in the health of its young people for a number of reasons, including their significant proportion of the population and their impact on population growth.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Statistics Supporting a Need for Youth Reproductive Health Services</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>20% of Kenyan adolescents become sexually active as early as 9-14 years.</li>
                            <li>By 20 years of age 80% have experienced sexual intercourse.</li>
                            <li>HIV prevalence among adolescents of 15-19 years stands at 22.3% for females and 4.2% for males.</li>
                            <li>10,000 schoolgirls drop out of school every year due to pregnancy, which is quite alarming, as the rate of illiteracy and poverty keeps rising.</li>

                            <li><strong>Early child bearing (70% prevalence rates),</strong> which is usually due to girl child discrimination in educational opportunities. Girls, therefore, opt to marry early instead of staying at home.</li>
                            <li><strong>STIs/HIV/AIDS (45% prevalence rates),</strong> as a result of idleness among the youth due to lack of recreational facilities compounded by curiosity and peer pressure. This leads them into unsafe sexual practices and, in some cases, prostitution to earn a living.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unsafe abortion</strong> due to unplanned and unwanted pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>It has also been observed that most adolescents have inadequate information about their sexuality, which also compounds the risks of early childbearing, unsafe abortion, STIs/HIV/AIDS and subsequent risks of infertility and cancer.</li>
