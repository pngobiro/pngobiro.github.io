REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
}
K.KINYUA

\section*{INTRODUCTION TO RH}
- A state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity in all matters related to the reproductive system, its function and processes.
- Basic elements:
- Ability - to reproduce, regulate fertility and enjoy healthy relationships
- Success - result in child survival, growth and health development
- Safety - Fertility regulation, pregnancy and child health

\section*{Components of Reproductive health}
1. Safe motherhood - Pre/Peri/Postnatal care, breast feeding and neonatal care
2. Family planning information and services
3. Prevention and management of infertility and sexual dysfunction in both males and females
4. Prevention and management of complications of abortion
5. Prevention and management of reproductive tract infections especially STDs including HIV/AIDS
6. Early detection of cancer of the cervix and breast
7. Menopause - Prevention of osteoporosis, atherosclerosis
8. Gender based violence

\section*{SCOPE OF RH}
1. Family planning counselling,
2. Safe motherhood; education, and service for healthy pregnancy, safe delivery and postnatal care
3. Care of new born
4. Prevention and management of complications of abortion

\section*{Scope of RH}
5. Information, education, and counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood for individuals, couples, and adolescent
6. Prevention and management of sub fertility
7. Life-cycle issues including breast cancer, cancer of the reproductive system and care of the elderly

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF RH}
- Reproductive health is a right
$\square$ lead a responsible and satisfied sex life.
$\square$ to reproduce and freedom to decide when and how often to do so
$\square$ to be informed about advantages, possible risks and side effects of contraceptives
$\square$ to have free, equal access to safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable method of fertility regulation.
$\square$ to get access to appropriate health service of good quality to go through safe pregnancy and child

\section*{Major obstetric causes of maternal mortality}
1. Hemorrhage - Pre/Peri/Postnatal
2. Sepsis
3. Pregnancy induced hypertension (especially in primigravida)
4. Unsafe abortion
5. Obstructed labor

\section*{Maternal Mortality definition}
- "A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of the pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes."
- Causes of maternal mortality maybe direct or indirect

\section*{Direct Causes of Maternal Death}
- These result from obstetric complications of pregnancy, labour and the puerperium and from interventions or any after effects of these events.
- The Five major causes of direct maternal deaths in order of frequency are:
- Haemorrhage,
- Sepsis,
- Hypertensive disorders,
- Complications of abortion and
- obstructed labour

\section*{Indirect causes of Maternal Deaths}
- They result from previously existing disease or disease that develops during pregnancy which was not due to direct obstetric causes, but which was aggravated by physiologic effects of pregnancy.
- The major causes of indirect maternal deaths in our set up include:
- Malaria,
- HIV/AIDS, and
- anemia.

\section*{Maternal Morbidity}
- For every woman who dies another 30 suffer long term injuries and illness due to pregnancy and childbirth related complications.
- Maternal morbidity is any symptom or condition resulting from or made worse by pregnancy.
- Severe maternal morbidity (Near Miss) is defined as: "any pregnant or recently delivered woman (within six weeks after termination of pregnancy or delivery), in whom immediate survival is threatened and who survives by chance or because of the hospital care she receives."

\section*{Underlying causes of Maternal \& Neonatal Mortality (The three delays)}
- There are three distinct levels of delay which contribute to maternal morbidity and mortality: (Thadaseus and Maine, 1994):
1. Delay in deciding to seek appropriate care. This could be due to: socio-cultural barriers, Failure to recognize danger signs, failure to perceive severity of illness, and cost considerations
2. Delay in reaching an appropriate health care facility. This is due to: long distance to a facility, poor condition of roads, lack of transportation and cost considerations
3. Delay in receiving adequate emergency care at the facility. This may be due to: Shortage of staff, supplies and basic equipment; unskilled personnel, user fees among others.

Timeliness of interventions is imperative if adverse maternal and newborn outcomes are to be averted.

\section*{Status of Interventions to Reduce Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in Kenya}
- Approximately 9 out of 10 (92\%) of all pregnant women in Kenya attend antenatal care at least once from a health care provider and 56\% make four or more ANC visits.
- However, only about $44 \%$ of all deliveries are attended to by a skilled health provider.
- In fact since 1990, delivery by skilled attendants has progressively declined in Kenya.
- Majority of births are therefore occurring at home with no skilled care (KDHS, 2008/9).

\section*{Status of Interventions to Reduce Maternal Morbidity and Mortality in Kenya..}
- Among women who deliver outside the health facility, a vast majority (6 out of 10) do not receive postnatal care.
- Only 42 percent attend postnatal care within two days of delivery, (KDHS 2008/9).
- This is despite the fact that majority of maternal deaths occur during the postpartum period.

\section*{The Kenya Maternal and Newborn Health (MNH) Pillars}
1. Family planning and pre-pregnancy care- To ensure that individuals and couples have the information and services to plan the timing, number and spacing of pregnancies.
2. Focused Antenatal Care - To prevent complications where possible and ensure that complications of pregnancy are detected early and treated appropriately.
3. Essential Obstetric Care - To ensure that essential care for the high-risk pregnancies and complications is made available to all women who need it.
4. Essential Newborn Care - To ensure that essential care is given to newborns from the time they are born up to 28 days in order to prevent complications that may arise after birth.
5. Targeted Postpartum Care- To prevent any complication occurring after childbirth and ensure that both mother and baby are healthy and there is no transmission of infection from mother to child.
6. Post Abortion Care - to provide clinical treatment to all women and girls seeking care, for complications of incomplete abortion and miscarriage as well as counselling and contraceptives.
(Note that HIV PMTCT services are now integrated into ALL the pillars of 08/28/2MNH and clean and safe delivery is part of Essential Obstetric Care)

\section*{Skilled Attendance}
- Evidence has shown that there are 2 key interventions that improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality, namely:
* Skilled attendance at delivery (skills, numbers, enabling environment) and
* availability of Emergency Obstetric Care.
- The term "skilled attendant" refers exclusively to people with midwifery skills (e.g. doctors, midwives, nurses, clinical officers) who have been trained to proficiency in the skills necessary to manage normal deliveries and diagnose or refer obstetric complications.

\section*{Enabling Environment}
- To ensure effective and efficient service delivery, the skilled attendant requires an enabling environment.
- There is need for appropriate infrastructure as well as ensuring that the continuum of care is connected by an effective referral system, and supported by adequate supplies, equipment, drugs, good management and supportive supervision.

\section*{Referral Systems}
- A key aspect in ensuring a good maternal health service is a functional referral system.
- Access to a telephone and/or vehicle, with emergency funds or fuel to transfer urgent cases day or night is extremely important.
- Good record keeping and use of detailed referral letters will assist in reducing delay in the care for women with obstetric emergencies and severely ill newborns.
- The referring unit should be aware of the capacity of the referral point to manage the client being referred.

\section*{Community Action, Partnerships}
- Involving community members (particularly women and their families, health care providers, and local leaders) in efforts to improve maternal health helps to ensure programme success;
- Community education about obstetric complications and when and where to seek medical care is important to ensure birth planning/ use of birth preparedness cards, early recognition of complications and prompt care-taking behaviour

\section*{Male involvement and participation}
- it is evident that for successful programme implementation, male participation in MNH results in good outcomes for both mother and baby.
- Male involvement and participation is critical in addressing the first and second delay.
- In the Kenyan context, men have the resources and are the main decision makers in the families and communities on issues relating to MNH .

\section*{Equity for All}
- Rights based perspective helps legitimise prioritisation of women's health.
- It focuses attention on social, economic and geographic inequities.
- Strong political support and national ownership are essential to create enabling policies to attract resources for maternal and newborn health and to ensure those resources reach groups with the highest maternal mortality and morbidity.

\section*{Reproductive Rights}
- Health care providers should appreciate that most maternal and neonatal deaths are avoidable, and therefore maternal and newborn health must be given its due prominence.
- Safe Motherhood is a basic human right as women are entitled to enjoy a safe pregnancy and childbirth.

\section*{Emergency Obstetric Care}
- Emergency Obstetric Care refers to a set of minimal health care elements, which should be availed to all women during pregnancy and delivery.
- It includes both life saving and emergency measures e.g. Caesarean section, manual removal of placenta, etc, as well as non-emergency measures (e.g. use of the partograph to monitor labour, active management of the third stage of labour, etc.).
- Emergency Obstetric Care functions are generally categorized as Basic Emergency Obstetric Care (BEmOC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric care (CEmOC).

\section*{Basic Emergency Obstetric Care includes:}
1. Administration of IV antibiotics.
2. Administration of magnesium sulphate.
3. Administration of parental oxytocics.
4. Performing manual removal of the placenta.
5. Performing removal of retained products.
6. Performing assisted vaginal delivery (e.g. by vacuum extraction).
7. Performing newborn resuscitation

\section*{Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care}
- includes all the seven above, PLUS:
8. Performing surgery (Caesarean section), including provision of emergency obstetric anaesthesia.
9. Administration of blood transfusion.

\section*{CLIENT RIGHTS}
1. Right to Information
- All members of the community have a right to information on the benefits of reproductive health including Maternal and Newborn health for themselves and their families. They also have a right to information on how to access the services.
2. Right to Access
- All members of the community have a right to receive services from reproductive health / MNH programs, regardless of their socioeconomic status, political affiliations, religious beliefs, ethnic origin, marital status or geographical location. Access includes freedom from barriers such as policies, standards and practices, which are not scientifically justifiable.
3. Right of choice
- Individuals and couples have the right to decide freely where to obtain RH /MNH services.
4. Right to safety

7. Right to Dignity
- Reproductive Health /MNH clients have a right to be treated with courtesy, consideration, and attentiveness and with full respect of their dignity regardless of their level of education, social status or any other characteristics, which would single them out or make them vulnerable to abuse.
8. Right to Comfort
- Clients have a right to comfort when receiving services. This can be ensured by providing quality services in hygienically safe and conveniently located service delivery sites.
9. Right to Continuity of Care
- Clients have a right to receive services and reliable supply of RH /MNH commodities and drugs for as long as they need them.

\section*{THE SAFE MOTHERHOOD INITIATIVE}
- The Global Safe Motherhood Initiative launched in Nairobi in 1987 aimed at reducing the burden of maternal deaths and ill health in developing countries.
- The Safe Motherhood Initiative differed from other health initiatives in that it focused on the well being of women as an end in itself.
- In the SMI, the prevention of the death of a pregnant woman is considered to be the key objective, not because death adversely affects children and other family members but because women are intrinsically valuable (Thaddeus and Maine 1994).
- It underscored the fact that Safe motherhood is a basic human right

\end{tabular}

\section*{International Conference for Population and Development (ICPD)}
- The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo recommended to the international community a set of important population and development objectives.
- The Programme of Action was striking for the attention it devoted to the issue of women's health.
- It also included goals with regard to education, especially for girls, and for the further reduction of infant, child and maternal mortality levels.
- For Kenya, the ICPD recommendations were then translated into the National Reproductive Health Strategy (NRHS 1997 2010) and implementation plan whose goal was to reduce maternal, perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
- Another event that followed the ICPD was the Millennium Declaration in 2000 and the development of goals (MDGs) with indicators.

\section*{National Reproductive Health Policy 2007}
- The goal of the RH policy is to enhance the Reproductive Health status of all Kenyans through:
- Increased equitable access to RH services
- Improved quality, efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery at all levels
- Improved responsiveness to clients needs
- The main objective for Safe Motherhood in this RH Policy is to reduce maternal, perinatal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in Kenya

National Reproductive Health Strategy (NRHS): 2009-2015
- This is a revision of the NRHS 19972010 and includes issues and challenges that had not been incorporated in the original strategy.
- The revision was also necessary in order to align it to the National RH Policy 2007.

\section*{The National Health Sector Strategic Plan (NHSSP II)-2005-2010}
- The aim of NHSSP II is to reverse the decline in the health status of Kenyans through an efficient, high quality health care system that is accessible, equitable and affordable for every Kenyan household.
- A major feature of the NHSSP is the introduction of the Kenya Essential Package for Health (KEPH), which focuses on the health needs of individuals through the six stages of the human life cycle.
- The strategic plan emphasizes strong community involvement in health care through the community Strategy

\section*{The KEPH Life-Cycle Cohorts}
- They are delineated in the NHSSP II as follows
- Cohort 1:-Pregnancy, delivery and the newborn child (up to 2 weeks of age)
- Cohort 2:- Early childhood (3 weeks to 5 years)
- Cohort 3:- Late childhood (6-12 years)
- Cohort 4:- Adolescence (13-24 years)
- Cohort 5:- Adulthood (25-59 years)
- Cohort 6:- Elderly (60 years and over)

\section*{Levels of Care in KEPH}
- The KEPH approach is not only limited to a definition of the target groups in terms of life-cycle cohorts.
- It also defines where the health services will be delivered.
- Under KEPH, promotive, preventive and curative services are provided at six levels of care:
- Level 6 : tertiary hospitals
- Level 5: secondary hospitals
- Level 4: primary hospitals
- Level 3: health centres, maternity, nursing homes
- Level 2: dispensaries / clinics
- Level 1: villages/household/families/individuals

\section*{NB}
- As a result of the implementation of the constitution of Kenya 2010, health functions have been devolved to the county.
- In the structure, County Health Services are organized around three levels of care:
- Community,
- Primary care, and

08/28/02/Referral services.

\section*{Annual Operational Plans (AOPs)}
- The Annual Operational Plans (AOPs) translate Kenya Essential Package for Health and the National Health Sector Strategic Plan II 2005-2010 into 'actionable' operational plans.
- AOPs also improve the planning process within the Ministry in particular highlighting the need for
- Improved coordination and decision-making
- Elimination of duplication of activities and
- More efficient use of available resources

\section*{The Community Strategy}
- The community-based approach, is the mechanism through which households and communities take an active role in health and health-related development issues.
- Initiatives outlined in the approach target the major priority health and related problems affecting all cohorts of life at the community and household levels level 1 of the KEPH-defined service delivery.

\section*{Vision 2030}
- Kenya Vision 2030 is the country's new development blueprint covering the period 2008 to 2030.
- The vision is based on three "pillars" namely;
- the economic pillar,
- the social pillar and
- the political pillar.
- Health is part of the social pillar.
- To improve the overall livelihoods of Kenyans, the country aims to provide an efficient and high quality health care system with the best standards.
- This is in order to reduce health inequalities and improve indicators in key areas where Kenya is lagging, especially in lowering infant and maternal mortality.

\section*{Vision 2030}
- Specific strategies include:
- provision of a robust health infrastructure network;
- improving the quality of health service delivery to the highest standards and promotion of partnerships with the private sector.
- In addition the Government has put in place health financing mechanisms to make quality MNH services affordable and accessible to all especially the poor and vulnerable women.
- These include the provision of free MNH /FP services at the lower levels, National Health Insurance Fund (NSSF), Health Sector Support Fund (HSSF), Hospital Management Support Fund (HMSF), FIF, Voucher system /Output Based Aid (OBA).
- The government is also encouraging initiatives that promote community based health financing.

\section*{ASSIGNMENT:READ OTHER POLICIES}
1. The Kenya Constitution (2010) calls for the highest attainable standard for health including reproductive health for all Kenyans
2. The Kenya Health Policy (2014-30) commits to strengthening the health care system and service delivery.
3. Kenya Health Sector Strategic and Investment Plan (2014-18) (MOH 2014A, B, MOH 2012).
4. Free Maternity Care
5. Elimination of User Fee for Public Primary Health Care Services,
6. Beyond Zero campaign.
7. Kenya RMNCAH investment framework

\section*{Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)}
$\square$ MDGs were set by all Government leaders at the UN Millennium Summit, September 2000)
- All UN organisations decided to be guided by MDGs in their future action: unity of purpose, coherent action, synergies and strategic approaches by the UN system as a whole (guided by CEB)
Leaders pledged to strive, individually and collectively, towards these goals through international, regional and national action, concerted by the UN.

\section*{Why the MDGs ?}

The 1990s was a decade of faltering progress on:
- Under-5 mortality rate
- Maternal mortality rate
- Child malnutrition
- Water and sanitation
- Income poverty
- Primary education

MDGs were meant to accelerate progress

\section*{Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)}
- Goal 1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
- Goal 2. Achieve universal primary education
- Goal 3. Promote gender equality and empower women
- Goal 4. Reduce child mortality
- Goal 5. Improve maternal health
- Goal 6. Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases
- Goal 7. Ensure environmental sustainability
- Goal 8. Develop a Global Partnership for Development

\section*{MDGS related to RH}
*Goal 3 Promote gender equality \& empower women
* Goal 4 Reduce child mortality by 2015 the no at 1990
* Goal 5 Improve maternal health

\section*{MDGs Related to RH 2008/09}
- MDG5 was to improve maternal health with a target of reducing MMR by 75\% between 1990 and 2015.
- For this to be attained there is need for a $5.5 \%$ decline in MMR annually from 1990.
- However, globally the reported annual percentage decline in MMR between 1990 and 2008 was only $2.3 \%$.
- Among countries with an MMR $\geq 100$ in 1990, it is evident that 30 countries have made insufficient or no progress.
- This list includes 23 countries from sub- Saharan Africa (WHO...Trends in Maternal mortality 1990-2008).
- Sadly Kenya is among these countries with an MMR of 488 per 100,000 live births, with some regions reporting MMRs of over 1000 per 100000 live births. (KDHS 2008/09)

\section*{MDGs Related to RH}
- To accelerate progress towards MDG 5, the UN Secretary-General in 2010launched the Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health which elements include:
- Country-led health plans,
- a comprehensive, integrated package of essential interventions and services,
- Health systems strengthening,
- Health workforce capacity building, and
- coordinated research and innovation.

\section*{MDGs Related to RH}
- Kenya developed the national RH training plan whose goal is to ensure that health personnel have the knowledge, technical skills and positive attitude, to handle reproductive health issues within a comprehensive and integrated system.

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 infant mortality rate}
- The KDHS 2014 shows a decrease in the infant mortality rate from 52 to 39 per 1,000 live births, and a decrease in the under-five mortality rate from 74 to 52 per 1,000 live births between 2008 and 2014.
- These declines have been driven mainly by:
- Enhanced use of mosquito nets,
- Increases in antenatal care,
- skilled attendance at childbirth,
- Postnatal care,
- Contraceptive use,
- exclusive breastfeeding practices and
- a decrease in unmet family planning (FP) needs,
- as well as overall improvements in other social indicators such as education and access to water

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 neonatal mortality rate}
- The NMR declined from 31 per 1,000 births to 22 per 1,000 live births between 20082014.
- However, during the past decade, the NMR exhibited the slowest decline.
- Further reductions in infant and child mortality require steeper decline in the NMR, which is closely linked to improvements in maternal health services including intrapartum care.

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 maternal health}
- The MMR of 362 per 100,000 live births estimated by KDHS in 2014 is still high
- Coverage/utilization indicators also show some improvements but much more needs to be done to address inequities and to reach Universal Health Care(UHC).
- The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR, any method) among married women has increased to 58\% in 2014 from 46\% in 2008/9 with a decline in unmet need for FP.
- Nearly two thirds (61\%) of births took place in a health facility and 62\% of pregnant women were delivered by a skilled attendant.
- Postnatal care (PNC) increased from $42 \%$ in 2009 to $51 \%$ in 2014
- The total fertility rate has declined from 4.6 in 2008/9 to 3.9 in 2014; however, there has been no change in teen pregnancy with one in five ( $18 \%$ ) adolescents in the 15-19 years age group having started child bearing due to early marriage, high unmet need for contraception and poor access to FP services.

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014}
- Nutritional status of children under-five has improved with a decline in stunting from 35\% in 2008/9 to 26\% in 2014.
- However, one out of every four children still remains shorter for their age, a factor that adversely affects their future health, well-being and economic productivity.
- Nearly half (48\%) of households have access to an insecticide treated net;
- $53 \%$ of women and $46 \%$ of men were tested for HIV in the past 12 months and received the test results.
- Overall immunization coverage for basic vaccines increased from 65.3 percent 2008/9 to 71.3 percent in 2014 and coverage for measles, pentavalent and pneumococcal vaccine remained high.
- Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among children under 6 months has nearly doubled from 32 percent to 61 percent

\section*{Progress of MDGs related to RH 2014 summary key points}
- Child mortality has declined by over $20 \%$ since 2008 and the country achieved a total fertility rate (TFR) of less than four.
- Stunting, which remained stubbornly high over the past two decades, has started to decline.
- Six out of ten pregnant women now receive skilled care at childbirth and over half get postnatal care.
- However, despite this progress, Kenya could not achieve maternal and child health Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)

\section*{Six Elements of the SDGs}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b10189afdc32462f0be2g-66.jpg?height=1376&width=1946&top_left_y=369&top_left_x=306)

\section*{What is new and different about the 17 SDGs?}
1. these Goals apply to every nation ... and every sector. Cities, businesses, schools, organizations, all are challenged to act. This is called Universality
2. the Goals are all inter-connected, in a system. We cannot aim to achieve just one Goal. We must achieve them all. This is called Integration
3. achieving these Goals involves making very big, fundamental changes in how we live on Earth. This is called Transformation

\section*{SDGs}
$\square$ The vision is for the goals to promote sustainable development and poverty eradication.
$\square$ The first 16 goals address priority areas that:
$\checkmark$ Increase the ambition/ improving and sustaining current achievements on existing MDG goals (poverty, health education, gender) with added dimensions on
$\checkmark$ Economic sustainability (inclusive growth, jobs, infrastructure, industrialization)
$\checkmark$ Environmental sustainability (climate change, oceans and land based ecosystems, sustainable consumption and production)
$\checkmark$ All held together by the glue of 'peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development' (governance agenda, rule of law, violence).
$\square$ The $17^{\text {th }}$ goal covers means of implementation (finance, otrade, technology, capacity building, partnerships, and

\section*{The SDGs versus MDGs}

Key Strengths of the proposed SDGs include:-
$\square$ The notion of leaving no one behind - with many targets aspiring zero/fully coverage (raising the ambition of the MDGs)

Stand alone goal of Inequality (within and between countries)
$\checkmark$ Stand alone goal on gender inequality, including ending of all forms of violence, discrimination, child marriages, and female genital mutilations

\section*{The SDGs versus MDGs}
- Environmental issues are strongly represented - fulfilling a long sought marriage between development and environment (climate change, marine and land base ecosystems, and sustainable consumption and production)
- Governance - for the first time - incorporating a goal and targets on governance and peaceful societies (legal identity, tackling corruption and bribery etc)
- Participatory/Inclusiveness Process in formulation of the SDGs: The participation and buy in of a wide range of stakeholders including member states and non governmental organizations
- The broad nature of the SDG is also a reflection of the nature of challenges facing the world today

\section*{From the MDGs to the SDGs}
- Formulating the SDGs: Member state driven process - shared seats representing 70 member states from five UN groups
- Proposals for the SDGs: universal -all countries, all people, including those excluded remaining after MDGs
- Expand MDG agenda: poverty, food, land, jobs, youth, health, population dynamics, water, sanitation, energy, growth, trade, vulnerable countries, cities, transport, SCP, forests, oceans, biodiversity, finance, technology

\section*{From the MDGs to the SDGs}
- SDGs: provide concrete and simple form to post 2015 development agenda
- SDGs: concentrate, galvanize action
- SDGs: provide for a new commitment period coming decades
- SDGs: new global partnerships and voluntary commitments, innovative finance
- SDGs: broader people and planet goals than MDGs, bolder targets, more national differentiation
- SDGs/P2015: draw on inputs of all stakeholders

\section*{KENYA SDG Targets for RH}

\section*{Kenya RMNCAH investment framework (January 2016)}
- The Kenya RMNCAH investment framework sets ambitious targets to increase:
1. skilled deliveries to $87 \%$,
2. $4+$ ANC visits to $69 \%$,
3. full immunization to $76 \%$,
4. contraceptive use by currently married women in reproductive age to $73 \%$, and
5. pregnant women tested for HIV who received results and post-test counseling to 75\% by 2020 from the baselines of the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey 2014 with enhanced focus on quality of services.
- It also aims to reduce stunting to $19 \%$, teenage pregnancy to $11 \%$, and contribute to decrease in neonatal mortality to $18 \%$.
- The absolute number of deaths of children under-five years is projected to reduce from 77,761 to 48,590 and maternal from 5,453 to 3,276 between 2014/15 and 2019/20.
- Finally, the framework aims to ensure that at least three out of four births will be registered, thereby providing more robust denominators to effectively plan and monitor RMNCAH service delivery.

\section*{How Kenya aim to monitor \& achieve SDGs for RH}

Kenya RMNCAH investment framework
- Progress on improvements in quality, productivity and efficiency will be tracked through strengthened routine data, independent surveys, and implementation research of innovations.
- Impact and outcome level indicators in reducing neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality rates, and maternal mortality ratio (MMR) will be tracked through population based surveys such as the KDHS.

\section*{How Kenya aim to monitor \& achieve SDGs for RH}

\section*{Kenya RMNCAH investment framework}
- The proposed Maternal Death Surveillance and Response (MDSR) helps to identify and register maternal deaths, and support appropriate actions to be implemented to prevent them.
- Active citizens' participation and feedback, independent verification and progress reviews will be used to track achievements of the investments made in RMNCAH.
- Strengthening Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) will be an essential intervention to inform better planning and enhance accountability to results.
- It is estimated that implementation of the framework will require an increase in current annual per capita public expenditures on RMNCAH from Kenyan Shillings (KSH) 1,033 (US\$10.87) in 2015/16 to KSH 1,306 (US\$ 13.75) by 2019/20. An additional KSH 59 billion (US\$ 617 million) will be required to 08/2address the financing gap.

\section*{DEVOLUTION in achieving SDGs related to RH}
- Kenya has introduced an ambitious devolution initiative, which could help to address the major demand and supply side challenges.
- National RMNCAH serve as a guide for the development and implementation of county RMNCAH implementation plans, which will be an integral part of County Integrated Development Plans and aligned with the County Health Strategic and Investment Plans.

\section*{Areas to improve on}
- Devolution has the potential to address inequities and to enhance accountability.
- Increased government spending is necessary to scale-up interventions but ensuring effective coverage with an equity focus is critical to improve health outcomes.
- Effective partnerships are critical for success as fragmented financing and governance cause high transaction costs, hindering effective harmonization at the country level.
- Integration can optimize the efficient use of resources and reduce duplication and wastage.
- Incentives are effective in changing and influencing behavior of providers and users to improve health outcomes.
- Political commitment has been key to improved RMNCAH outcomes in all countries that have made progress on MDGs 4 and 5

\section*{INNOVATION AND RESEARCH}
- The following research questions have been identified by MOH:
- What are the factors that contribute to poor health seeking behaviors for RMNCAH services?
- What are the most cost effective models that can promote male involvement?
- What are the factors contributing to non-adherence to standard operating procedures and guidelines by health care providers in both private and public sectors?
- what is the impact of comprehensive RMNCAH training on the competency and skills of providers?
- Does task sharing work; if not, what are key barriers?
- What is the impact of current RMNCAH behavior change communication interventions?
- How effective are the different service delivery models, social media and mobile technologies in delivering adolescent sexual and reproductive health?
- What is the impact of maternal shelters?
- What are the mechanisms to get real time feedback from adolescents on health services (satisfaction with services)?
