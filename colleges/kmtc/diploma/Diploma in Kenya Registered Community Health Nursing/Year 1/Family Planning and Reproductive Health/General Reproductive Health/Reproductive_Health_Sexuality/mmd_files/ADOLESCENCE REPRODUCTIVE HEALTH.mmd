\section*{ADOLESCENTS AND YOUTH SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH 06 HRS}

\section*{UNIT CODE: RHN 103}

\section*{Broad Objective}
- By the end of the unit the leaner will acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes in order to provide quality reproductive health services to adolescents and youth.

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
${ }^{-}$Participate in the provision of sexual and reproductive health services to the adolescent/youth.
- Integrate sexual health to holistic care

\section*{Content}
- Adolescents and youth sexual reproductive health: Definitions of terms, human sexuality, sexual orientation, identity, body mapping, human sexual response cycles, myths and misconceptions related to human sexuality. Integration of sexual health into holistic care, attitude change towards sexuality and HIV/AIDS. Adolescent/Youth Sexual and Reproductive health care services, models of youth friendly health services.

\section*{Introduction}
- Although adolescents and the youth form the majority of our population, their issues have, for a long time, been ignored. Yet young people have special needs and requirements.
- At the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, it was concluded that adolescents are a particularly vulnerable group due to the fact that they are known to have:
- Inadequate level of knowledge about human sexuality
- Inadequate or poor information on quality reproductive health services
- High risk sexual behaviors
- Discriminatory social practices
${ }^{-}$In response to these insights, the GoK decided to address adolescent and youth issues by developing new strategic approaches to communication programmes to enhance positive behavior development and adoption by young people.

\section*{Defining Adolescence}
- Adolescence is defined as the transition period between childhood and adulthood. It is a period of rapid growth and maturation as the person reaches puberty.
- The most colourful years of life are the teenage years.
- This is a period when the youth want to be appreciated for who they are and seek affection and attention.
- The onset of adolescence varies from one individual to the other, and between the two sexes.
- In girls, it may begin as early as 9 years while in boys it may begin at 12 years.
- The two sexes share an approximate range marking adolescence from 13-1 8 years.
- The youth age extends up to 21 years. However, according to the laws of Kenya, a person is considered to be an adult and answerable for their own actions from the age of 18.

\section*{Physical Characteristics of Adolescence}
- Adolescence is marked by the development of secondary characteristics under the influence of the gonadotrophic hormone from the anterior pituitary gland

\section*{Girls}
- Breasts increase in size and are spherical in shape due to enlarged glandular tissue
- Typical female shape and contour of the body develop, that is broad hips and narrow chest and shoulders
- Hair develops in the armpits and pubic region
- Internal organs of reproduction, that is, vagina, uterus, ovaries mature and menstruation (menarche) begins
- Face may become smooth or facial pimples (acne) may develop

\section*{Boys}
- In boys, under the influence of androgens, secondary characteristics appear from age 12 14 years.
- Enlarged testis and penis
- Development of armpit,chest, pubic and facial hairs
- First ejaculation (spermache) and nocturnal emissions (wet dreams) occur
- Gain in muscular strength and weight
- Voice changes with the voice becoming deeper
- Skin problems such as acne develop and the face looks rough
- Body shape takes on typical adult characteristics, for example, broad shoulders
- Rapid growth in height depending on genetics

\section*{Sociological, Psychological and Emotional Characteristics of Adolescents}
- While the aforementioned physiological changes are taking place and can be observed, great emotional and psychological changes are taking place that may not be as noticeable

\section*{Emotional and Psychological Changes Resulting From Adolescence}
- Changing relationships with parents, which may involve the adolescent pulling away and becoming more independent
- Changing relationships with friends.
- Adolescents often imitate the values and behaviors of friends rather than those of parents and other adults.
- Peers are an important influence but they care more about what their friends think of them
- The relationship with the opposite sex increases as they learn how to cope with romantic and sexual feelings
- Personal feelings are also affected and there is a need to accept themselves as an independent individual
- Values and behaviors are affected.
- Adolescents may attempt to behave more as adults, resolving problems in a responsible manner and making decisions bearing in mind the possible consequences
- Increased interest in everyday recreational activities
- Increase in mood swings as they seek attention and want to belong and be appreciated

With this understanding, there is a need to provide adolescents and young people with guidance and counseling, especially on reproductive health issues

\section*{Key Areas in Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health}
- Young people have special needs in all circumstances and each age group within this population (9-24 years) has different problems and requirements. As a health worker, you need to address the reproductive health needs of adolescents/youths diligently in order to assist them to make informed choices.
- The Government of Kenya is particularly interested in the health of its young people for a number of reasons.
- They constitute a significant proportion of the population and the fertility attributed to them (20\% of pregnant women are adolescents, aged 15-19 years) has a substantial impact on population growth.

\section*{Statistics Supporting a Need for Youth Reproductive Health Services}
- 20\% of Kenyan adolescents become sexually active as early as 9-14 years
- By 20 years of age $80 \%$ have experienced sexual intercourse
- HIV prevalence among adolescents of 15-19 years stands at $22.3 \%$ for females and $4.2 \%$ for males
- 10,000 schoolgirls drop out of school every year due to pregnancy, which you will agree is quite alarming, as the rate of illiteracy and poverty keeps rising

\section*{The most common reproductive health problems among this age group}
- Early child bearing (70\% prevalence rates), which is usually due to girl child discrimination in educational opportunities. Girls, therefore, opt to marry early instead of staying at home
${ }^{-}$STIs/HIV/AIDS (45\% prevalence rates), as a result of idleness among the youth due to lack of recreational facilities compounded by curiosity and peer pressure. This leads them into unsafe sexual practices and, in some cases, prostitution to earn a living
- Unsafe abortion due to unplanned and unwanted pregnancy
${ }^{-}$It has also been observed that most adolescents have inadequate information about their sexuality, which also compounds the risks of early childbearing, unsafe abortion, STIs/HIV/AIDS and subsequent risks of infertility and cancer

\section*{Reproductive Health Needs Amongst Adolescents}
${ }^{-}$Information on sexuality and reproductive health
- Access to family planning services and provision of effective methods
- Prenatal and post abortion care, irrespective of the age or marital status
- Safe delivery, preferably in a hospital with facilities for all eventualities
- Treatment of unsafe abortions, which should be discouraged, but in the event of any occurrence, post abortion care should be given to save lives
- Diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases
- Protection from sexual abuse. Cases of sexual offenders should be reported to the authorities so that appropriate action can be taken
- Culturally appropriate guidance and counseling and or mental health services
- Education in negotiating skills to help them make informed choices and accept the consequences of their actions
adolescent/youth enjoy good reproductive health, there is also a need to do the following:
${ }^{-}$Develop a comprehensive reproductive health package to address youth/adolescent issues through the provision of counselling and user friendly clinics
- Promote responsible and healthy RH and sexual behavior of the youth through counseling and guidance
- Sensitize leaders, programme managers, service providers, teachers, the community, adolescents and youths themselves, on the reproductive health needs and rights of adolescents and youths
- The primary principle in working effectively with young people is to promote their participation.
- As a group, young people often have a 'culture' of their own, with particular norms and values.
${ }^{-}$They may not respond to services designed for adults.
- They are at a stage in life where they need to develop a sense of control over their bodies and their health.
- At the same time, since they are young and relatively inexperienced, they need guidance that is both sensitive and reassuring.
- The best way to encourage young people to participate is to develop a partnership between them and health care providers with proper regard for parental guidance and responsibilities.
- Once the youths know their rights and have appropriate information, they will be able to make informed choices.
- Consequently, their reproductive health will improve tremendously.
${ }^{-}$It is important to remember that young people are flexible, resourceful and energetic.
- They can help each other through peer counseling and peer education.
- You should, therefore, try to tap these strengths in order to be able to provide them with the necessary support

\section*{Principles for Working Effectively With Young People You must understand the cultural senstivities surrounding the provision of information and services to young people. Create awareness to communities on the need to be realistic and to give appropriate counseling.}
- You should identify and encourage peer leadership and communication. As you recall, at this age peers are very important and they are perceived as trustworthy sources of information. Therefore, make use of them.
${ }^{-}$It is essential to have links between health and community services in order to make sure that young people get the appropriate treatment for problems which might be revealed through one service but require additional assistance from another service (for example, sexual violence or unsafe abortion).
${ }^{-}$Young people need privacy. The problems that bring them to you make them feel ashamed, embarrassed or confused. It is, therefore, important for you to create the most private space and environment possible to talk to young people
- Confidentiality must be guaranteed. You need to maintain confidentiality in all your dealings with young people and be honest with them about their health problems.
- In most cultures, the gender of the service provider is important. A young person should be referred to a provider of the same sex.

\section*{Life Planning Skills}
${ }^{-}$Life planning skills refer to the information that you impart to young people to help them cope with the life challenges they meet as they grow up.
- Life planning skills are very handy when counselling adolescents who are facing a dilemma and trying to make an informed choice or decision
${ }^{-}$At this stage of their lives they need good information about sexuality and reproduction
${ }^{-}$Young people also need to develop certain skills to be able to make informed, responsible decisions about their sexual behavior.
- They need to learn how to resist pressure, be assertive, negotiate, and resolve conflict.
- peer counseling and peer education can be very effective in strengthening these skills and attitudes.

\section*{Life planning skills are divided into two components.}
- Values and values verification, which depends on the personality of the individual
- Decision making abilities, which depend on communication skills, for example: assertiveness and negotiation skills

\section*{Values and Values Verification}
${ }^{-}$By introducing the concept of values, you help young people to identify values learned from families and communities.
- This helps them to explain and stand up for the values and behaviors that dictate their actions.
- Values have different meanings to different people, as they are beliefs, ideas or principles that determine who you are and how you behave.
- For example, a person who values their family cares about their spouse, children and home life. A person who values education will study hard and pass examinations. Thus values dictate the behavior of individuals. The individual learns to make decisions consistent with personal values. Values are held dear and encourage self esteem in the individual.
- Unfortunately some communities value practices such as wife inheritance, wife beating, female circumcision, and early girl child marriage.
- All of these may pose significant danger to the community in relation to reproductive health.
- As a healthcare provider, it is important that you discourage harmful values and advocate values that enhance good and sound health in the community.

\section*{some of the more common harmful practices that you need to discourage within the communities you work with}

\section*{- Wife Inheritance}

This practice risks the spread of STIs/HIV/AIDS and all their consequences. It is also one of the main causes of disharmony in the family unit.

\section*{Wife Beating}
- A number of women have been maimed. Often they indicate that they feel stigmatized and are thus unable to seek medical assistance/attention.
- Some have even suffered miscarriages and premature deliveries due to violence and sexual abuse.

\section*{Female Genital Mutilation}
- This brings about the risk of infection and bleeding following the operation. In the long term, it also leads to prolonged second stage of labour due to scarring of genitalia. Female genital mutilation can also result in complications of lacerations and injury to pelvic floor and high perinatal morbidity and mortality

\section*{Early Girl Child Marriage}
${ }^{-}$In many communities, girls are married long before they are mature enough to be parents.
- Early pregnancy presents with complications of prolonged or obstructed labour, which may result in the rupture of the uterus, as the pelvis and reproductive organs are immature.
- Early marriage also means high school dropout rates.
- This, in turn increases illiteracy and its consequences such as inability of girls, or
- women, to negotiate their rights due to lack of information about their health needs.
- Having covered some of the negative practices associated with reproductive health and youth, here are some of the good values you should attempt to reinforce within the communities you work with.

\section*{Education of the Girl Child}
- A good education will enable girls to be knowledgeable and to understand reproductive and child health issues.
- This will inevitably contribute to a better quality of life in the community.
- With good education, girls and women can be empowered economically and be productive to the nation.

\section*{Abstinence}
${ }^{-}$Both girls and boys should be encouraged to remain virgins and abstain from premarital sex until they get married.
- This will help in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is a national disaster as the majority of the youths are infected/affected.
- It will also reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancy and the accompanying health consequences.
- You have now covered some of the practices valued by communities in some detail.
- However will be useful for you to gain an understanding of where values come from and how there are some factors that may influence our behaviour and make us act in a manner that is inconsistent with our values.
${ }^{-}$By understanding these factors you can help young people to examine their values and encourage them to avoid being influenced to abandon their good values.

\section*{Origin of Values}
- Parents and family members, who help to instill values in the child, which will eventually become a part of an individual
- Community, which reinforces values and can discipline in case of deviations
${ }^{-}$Religious leaders, who reinforce individual beliefs about good and evil
- Teachers in school, where education helps the adolescent to start reasoning and checking their values more clearly.
- The adolescent will identify mentors and try to copy them
- Friends, who greatly influence the initial values.
- Some succumb to negative peer pressure but this depends on the personality of the individual

\section*{Factors that can cause people to deviate from their values \\ People often want to experiment or try somebody else's values in order to validate them and decide whether to adopt them or not \\ - Peer pressure may force the individual to do things not in keeping with their values hence they become deviant}
- Opportunity for personal gain
- Opportunity to make someone else angry as well as rebel to get attention

\section*{Decision Making}
${ }^{-}$Decision making is the art of making a choice out of several options.
- Making a decision exposes the individual to a lot of challenges as they weigh the consequences based on the choices available.
- Making a decision equips the young person with life planning skills.
- Presented below are some of the skills that an individual needs in order to make sound decisions:
- Communication, which is the art of equipped with accurate information about themselves, they will be able to account for decisions they make.
- They must have good communication skills.
${ }^{-}$Assertiveness, which means being confident and able to make a stand on their words, actions or beliefs.
- This includes the ability to say NO to drugs or sexual advances, because illicit drugs or premarital sex are against their moral and/or religious beliefs

\section*{*Assertiveness}

\section*{The skill of assertiveness is based}
on five rights. These are the rights to
- Expression using the verbal, non-verbal and body expressions
- Set one's priorities by putting first things first.
- Accept that one's needs are just as important as the other person's and put your own needs across without fear of intimidation
- Refuse requests without feeling guilty as one defends one's values.
${ }^{-}$Young people should be taught that they have the right to say no
${ }^{\bullet}$ Judge one's behaviour and take responsibility for the consequences
- Negotiation skills
- Young people need accurate information regarding reproductive health, especially related to HIV/AIDS and substance abuse.
- Once they know the facts and the outcomes of their behavior, they will be able to communicate effectively, make informed choices and defend them against their peers.
- They must know the options available based on the consequences.
- Negotiation and assertiveness skills play an important role in communication as the youth make decisions, which affect their reproductive health.
${ }^{-}$The last and most important step of decision making is seeking help.
- Our youths need to feel free and look for information and assistance when not sure of the decision to be made.
- They should know where to go for assistance when they need help.
- This could be to their parents, Teachers, religious leaders or health professionals.
- These life planning skills are important to the youths.
- So learn them well to enable you to impart them to the young people.
- Young people can make poor life decisions for a variety of reasons and these decisions have their own inherent dangers.

\section*{Drug Abuse}
- Drugs are mostly taken to elevate the mood and often the individual feels 'high'. In the long run drugs impair the person's ability to make sound decisions and established values may be ignored.
- Drugs are mostly taken to elevate the mood and often the individual feels 'high'. In the long run drugs impair the person's ability to make sound decisions and established values may be ignored.

\section*{Unprotected Sex}
- Unprotected sex is often a result of the individual succumbing to peer pressure.
- Occasionally, decisions are made under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
- This adds to the risk of spreading STIs/HIV/AIDS, unwanted pregnancy, school dropout and poverty.

\section*{Crime}
${ }^{-}$Lawlessness and crime, such as stealing or robbery with violence, is commonly found among people with low negotiation and assertive skills.
- In order to enhance the health and well being of adolescents and youths, remedial activities need to be undertaken.

\section*{Activities to Improve Adolescent/YouthHealth}
- There are various interventions your community and the Government can undertake to improve the health of young people, thus helping them to develop confidence and become productive citizens.

\section*{Community and Government Interventions to Improve the Health of Young People}
- Advocating the recognition of socioeconomic and reproductive health needs and rights of adolescents and the youth
- Establishing an understanding with youth advisory councils at all levels to coordinate and advise on youth and adolescent health
${ }^{-}$Developing specific messages for different target groups (parents, religious and other leaders, youths and adolescents)
${ }^{-}$Implementing youth friendly and accessible RH services to enable the youth to seek services and receive counseling without barriers.
- Health providers should create a conducive environment when counseling and avoid biases that discourage youths from coming to the facility
${ }^{-}$Educating youths on their rights in order to help them attain the highest degree of health and self esteem.
- They should be sensitized to advocate against marriage at an early age, female circumcision, child abuse and so on.
- They should also advocate for the respect of good cultural values, access to RH services and the need for informed choice and privacy
- Conducting basic/applied research on youth and adolescent issues on regular basis and implementing the findings
${ }^{-}$As a health care provider you should advocate active involvement of adolescents/youth in projects aimed at promoting responsible sexuality, preventing unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and spread of STIs/HIV/AIDS.
- The advocacy should focus on several issues.
- Most importantly, there should be attempts to integrate gender issues into youth programmes so that they reinforce appropriate values.
- Additionally, you should incorporate Information, Education and Communication (IEC) in the reproductive health programs.

\section*{Gender Issues and Reproductive Health Rights}

\section*{Introduction}
${ }^{-}$It has been established that human sexuality, reproduction and gender issues are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive life.
- You will also cover how gender issues affect access to and enjoyment of good reproductive health in our communities and what you can do to improve reproductive health rights.

\section*{Definition of Terms}

Gender What is meant by 'gender', does it simply mean male or female or does it describe more than just biological characteristics?
As a term, it has been misinterpreted to mean male or female only.
Biologically, people are born either male or female but learn to be a man or a woman. However, when you talk about gender, this refers to the economic, social or cultural attributes associated with being a female or a male.

\section*{Gender Inequalities and Discrimination}
- Gender inequality and discrimination refers to unequal access to power, resources and opportunities in society.
Gender inequality and discrimination harms the health of young girls and women, directly and indirectly, throughout their life cycle.
- The neglect of their health needs through, for example, overworking and poor eating habits, makes them vulnerable to chronic ill health, which prevents many women from fully taking part in society.
- Unequal power relations between men and women often limit women's control over sexual activity and their ability to protect themselves against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.
- The subordinate status of women goes far back. The place of women in society has never been equal to that of men.
${ }^{-}$In the Christian Bible, it is said that the Jewish community in which Jesus was born and later ministered had very little regard for women compared to their male counterparts.
- A woman could be divorced at her husband's request without objections.
${ }^{-}$In African society, socio cultural factors tied with traditional beliefs and practices play a great role in determining the place of women in almost all spheres of their lives.
- This influence begins with the socialization of young children both within and outside the home.
- At childhood, both boys and girls are introduced to societal beliefs, practices and values as they apply to each gender.
- Boys are supposed to become heads and protectors of the family.
- The girls become wives and mothers, dependent on their husbands.
- These gender inequalities between sexes lead to women's subordinate positions within the family.
- Before you continue, reflect briefly on the type of gender inequalities you have observed in your community.

\section*{Examples of Gender Inequalities}

Inequalities in education
- Inequalities in the labour force
- Access to medical care
- Law of succession
- Cultural practices (such as female genital mutilation, polygamy and wife inheritance)

\section*{Preference for the Male Child}
- Since time immemorial, the boy child has always been preferred over the girl child in the African culture.
- It is perceived that the boy has more economic value than the girl.
- The boy is viewed as an asset that can contribute wages through his labour and provide for the care of parents in old age.
- Customarily, inheritance and lineage is passed through sons. In many communities, girls and women cannot inherit anything even from the husband and in some societies only boys participate in religious ceremonies.
- Girls, on the other hand, are seen as a liability.
${ }^{-}$Parents see no need in investing in them, as they will leave the homestead to get married and provide hard labour benefits to the husbands' side.
${ }^{-}$This poses a great risk to the girl child and her reproductive health right from conception.
- For example, today with modern technology where sex can be predetermined, it has been noted that out of 8,000 pregnancies terminated annually, only one foetus is a male. In countries where abortion is illegal, infanticide is on the increase, and where girls are born they are often severely neglected.

\section*{Education}
${ }^{-}$Parents prefer to educate sons. Why? Women are considered to be a liability. Remember the saying about watering a plant in the neighbour's garden? Some people view educating girls as a waste of money as they will get married and leave the homestead. Others believe that women cannot excel, and in any case, men are the breadwinners in the family.

\section*{Food}
- Traditional practices, which dictate the kinds of foods that can or cannot be eaten by girls, may lead to malnutrition and stunted growth with several consequences, including the possibility of girls developing a small pelvis.
- This has serious repercussions for a woman's reproductive health and may lead to anaemia, and obstetric complications during childbirth.

\section*{Access to Medical Care}
- The female child, when sick is often denied prompt medical attention. In some countries girls are breastfed for a shorter period hence denying them the necessary nutrients from breast milk.
- Sometimes the mother is forced to stop lactation early to get pregnant, because the family is trying for a son. This leads to chronic ill health with serious complications, which result in increased morbidity and mortality
- All these factors make it difficult for the girl child to stand out and excel

\section*{Denial of Other Basic Rights}
- Own land or to inherit property
- Obtain access to credit
- Earn income and promotion in their work
- Have access to services that meet their sexual and reproductive health needs
- Girls are often subjected to various other discriminatory practices, which, directly or indirectly, deny them their rights. These can include Early Marriages, Female Genital Mutilation, Polygamy and Wife Inheritance.

\section*{Early Marriages}
- Girls in some communities are forced to marry early so that the father can acquire bride wealth.
- Research has shown that early marriage exposes the girl child to early sexual activity, which in turn predisposes her to cancer of the cervix, obstetric complications and ill health.

\section*{Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)}
- This is also known as female circumcision. It is practiced in several countries in Africa and the Middle East. It is estimated that about 130 million girls are currently living with the effects of FGM. A further two million girls are at a risk of the practice. Societies that practice FGM believe that it is an initiation into adulthood and prevents the woman from becoming promiscuous

\section*{The Four Types of Female Genital Mutilation}
- Circumcision, which involves cutting of the prepuce or hood of the clitoris
- Excision, which involves the cutting of the clitoris and all or part of the labia minora
${ }^{-}$Infibulation, which involves the cutting of the clitoris, labia minora, and part of labia majora. The two sides of vulva are then pinned together with silk, catgut sutures, or with thorns, thus obliterating the vaginal introitus except for a small opening, preserved by inserting a piece of wood or reed for passage of urine or menstrual blood. The girl's legs are bound together from hip to ankle and she is kept immobile for 40 days to permit the formation of scar tissue
${ }^{-}$Intermediate, which involves the removal of the clitoris and some or all parts of the labia minora
- All of these operations present serious consequences to the reproductive health for girls and women

\section*{The Potential Health Consequences of FGM}
- Medical complications such as haemorrhage, pain, pelvic infection, and painful intercourse
- Complications of childbirth such as obstructed labour due to scarring of tissues. In some communities the husband must give consent before an episiotomy can be performed
- The procedure also denies the woman enjoyment of sexual life as the clitoris plays a role in reaching orgasm
- FGM also predisposes girls to early marriage since after the initiation they are considered mature and can get married. Early marriage, as you said earlier, has negative consequences on their RH as it exposes them to early pregnancy. If contraception is not used, the girl may have many deliveries, which predisposes her to various risks, including cancer of the cervix

\section*{Wife Inheritance}
- This is a cultural practice whereby a woman whose husband has died is inherited by a brother or relative of the late husband. The aim of this practice is to maintain the family lineage.
- In the past this custom was beneficial to some extent, as it provided stability and security to the woman and her children. However, today, it has been abused. Most men look for widows from rich homes so that they can exploit their wealth.
${ }^{-}$Also, this practice has led to the death of whole families because it facilitates the spread of HIV/AIDs

\section*{Polygamy}
- Polygamy is also a very common practice in some parts of Africa whereby men are allowed to marry more than one wife.
- Polygamy creates conflicts in the family and enhances the spread of STD's/HIV/AIDS

\section*{Gender Violence}
- Gender based violence is recognized today as a major issue on the international human rights agenda. As you well know, in some communities, the right of a husband to beat or physically intimidate his wife is a deeply held conviction. Indeed, there are women who often view a degree of physical abuse is justified under certain conditions
${ }^{-}$The dictionary definition of violence is: 'using or tending to use aggressive force'.
${ }^{-}$Another important word for you to know is 'abuse
${ }^{-}$Abuse may be defined as: 'a systematic pattern of behaviour in a relationship that is used to gain and/or maintain control and power over another
- Abuse ranges from emotional abuse such as hurting another person's feelings; psychological violence such as threats to do bodily harm,physical abuse such as hitting to cause pain orinjury, and sexual abuse which includes rape,defilement and incest.
