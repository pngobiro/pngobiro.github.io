                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Definitions</h3>
                        <p>Sexual assault is defined as any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act using coercion, physical force, or threats of harm by any person regardless of the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim and in any setting. This also includes unwanted sexual advances or comments where coercion, physical force, or threats of harm are involved.</p>
                        <p>Forms of sexual violence include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Sexual abuse or harassment:</strong> Unwanted advances where threats, intimidation, or force are applied.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rape:</strong> Partial or complete insertion of the penis or other objects into the vagina or anus of the victim through threats, intimidation, or fear of bodily harm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Defilement:</strong> Sex with a girl or boy less than 16 years of age, regardless of consent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sodomy:</strong> Anal sex between men, regardless of consent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bestiality:</strong> Sex with animals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Approach to Management</h3>
                        <p>Examinations of survivors of sexual assault should be conducted by an experienced clinician in a way that minimizes further trauma. The management approach involves several key steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>History, Physical Examination, and Lab Evaluations:</strong> A thorough history of the event and the survivor's medical background is taken. A physical exam is conducted to identify and treat injuries. Laboratory tests are performed to screen for STIs, HIV, and pregnancy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Findings are documented carefully for medical and legal purposes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medical Management:</strong> This includes pregnancy prevention (emergency contraception), HIV prevention (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis - PEP), management of physical injuries, prophylaxis for STIs, and prevention of Hepatitis B.</li>
                            <li><strong>Counseling:</strong> Trauma/crisis counseling, HIV pre- and post-test counseling, and PEP adherence counseling are crucial components of care.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Empiric Prophylactic Antimicrobial Treatment</h3>
                        <p>Because compliance with follow-up visits is often poor among survivors of sexual assault, routine presumptive (prophylactic) treatment is recommended.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Circumcision is the surgical removal of the foreskin, the fold of skin that covers the head of the penis. It is widely practised for religious, traditional, and medical reasons. Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials has demonstrated that male circumcision reduces a man's risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately 60%.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Benefits of Male Circumcision</h3>
                        <p>Although the strength of the evidence varies, the benefits of circumcision include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is easier to keep the penis clean.</li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of urinary tract infections in childhood.</li>
                            <li>Circumcision prevents inflammation of the glans (balanitis) and the foreskin (posthitis).</li>
                            <li>Circumcision prevents phimosis (inability to retract the foreskin) and paraphimosis (swelling of the retracted foreskin).</li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of some sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially ulcerative diseases like chancroid and syphilis.</li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of penile cancer.</li>
                            <li>There is a reduced risk of cancer of the cervix in female sex partners.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Risks of Male Circumcision</h3>
                        <p>As with any surgical procedure, there are risks associated with circumcision. These complications are rare when the procedure is performed by well-trained, experienced health care personnel.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain</li>
                            <li>Bleeding</li>
                            <li>Haematoma (formation of a blood clot under the skin)</li>
                            <li>Infection at the site of the circumcision</li>
                            <li>Irritation of the glans</li>
                            <li>Meatitis (inflammation of the opening of the urethra)</li>
                            <li>Injury to the penis</li>
                            <li>Adverse reaction to the anaesthetic used during the circumcision</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span> Important Note</h4>
                            <p>Male circumcision only reduces the risk of acquiring HIV; it does not provide complete protection. It is crucial to continue using other risk-reduction strategies like consistent and correct condom use and reducing the number of sexual partners.</p>
