\section*{External Genitalia}
-Scrotum
-Penis

\section*{Scrotum}
- Consists of skin and subcutaneous tissue
- A vertical scrotal septum, of subcutaneous tissue in the center divides it into two parts, each containing one testis
- Smooth muscle fibers, called the dartos muscle, in the subcutaneous tissue contract to give the scrotum its wrinkled appearance. When these fibers are relaxed, the scrotum is smooth
- The cremaster muscle, consists of skeletal muscle fibers and controls the position of the scrotum and testes. When it is cold or a man is sexually aroused, this muscle contracts to pull the testes closer to the body for warmth

\section*{Scrotum}
- Skin
- Dartos muscle (smooth)
- Septum
- Cremaster muscle (skeletal)

\section*{Penis I}
- Male copulatory organ, by conveying the urethra provides common outlet for urine and semen
- Is a cylindrical pendant organ located anterior to the scrotum and functions to transfer sperm to the vagina
- Consists of three columns of erectile tissue that are wrapped in connective tissue and covered with skin
- The two dorsal columns are the corpora cavernosa
- The single, midline ventral column surrounds the urethra and is called the corpus spongiosum

\section*{Penis II}
- Has three parts:
- A root, body (shaft), and glans penis
- The root of the penis attaches it to the pubic arch
-The body is the visible, pendant portion
-The corpus spongiosum expands at the distal end to form the glans penis
-The urethra, which extends throughout the length of the corpus spongiosum, opens through the external urethral orifice at the tip of the glans penis
- A loose fold of skin, called the prepuce, or foreskin, covers the glans penis

\section*{Penis III}

\section*{Arterial supply: branches of internal pudendal artery}
- Venous and lymphatic supply:
- blood from the carvenous spaces is drained by venous plexus that join the deep dorsal vein of the penis
- Blood from superficial coverings of the penis drain into the superficial dorsal vein
- Erectile tissue supplied by helicine arteries
- Nervous supply
- Derived from S2-S4 spinal cord segment and ganglia
- Sensory and sympathetic: Dorsal nerve of penis and terminal branch of pudendal nerve
- Parasympathetic (innervate the helicine arteries of erectile tissue): Cavernous nerves
- Illioinguinal nerve supplies skin at the root of the penis

\section*{Testes}
-Two testes located in the scrotum
- Sperms can not develop at normal body temperature
- Testes hanging in the scrotum-the temperature is - $2^{\circ}$ C
- Each testis:
- Is an oval structure about $5 \mathrm{~cm} \times 3 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Is covered by tunica albuginea
- Septa with about 250 lobules each
- Each lobule contains 1 to 4 -seminiferous tubules that converge to form a single straight tubule, which leads into the rete testis into the epididymis
- Interstitial cells (cells of Leydig), which produce male sex hormones, are located between the seminiferous tubules within a lobule.
- Short efferent ducts exit the testes to enter the epididymis

\section*{Duct System}
- Sperm cells pass through a series of ducts to reach the outside of the body. After they leave the testes, the sperm passes through the:
- Epididymis
- Ductus deferens
- Ejaculatory duct
- Urethra
- Seminiferous tubules merge into larger set of tubules called rete testis
- Rete testis ultimately drains into larger tubules called efferent ducts, which in turn drain into the epididymis
- Epididymis has three parts: head, body and tail
- Tail of epididymis dilates into ductus deferens
- A long tube (about 6 meters) located along the superior and posterior margins of the testes.
- Sperm that leave the testes are immature and incapable of fertilizing ova. They complete their maturation process and become fertile as they move through the epididymis. Mature sperm are stored in the lower portion, or tail, of the epididymis
- It takes 20 days for sperms to pass through the epydidymis during which the sperm gains its motility
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-023.jpg?height=1446&width=2462&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=77)

The testis, epididymis, and ductus deferens, lateral aspect. The tunica albuginea has been extensively removed to expose the lobular structure of the testis created by the septa. The
epididymis has been pulled away from the testis and its duct has been dissected to show its convoluted course (length $=5-6 \mathrm{~m}$ ).

\section*{Ductus Deferens (vas deferens)}
- A fibromuscular tube that is continuous with the epididymis
- Enters the abdomino-pelvic cavity through the inguinal canal and passes along the lateral pelvic wall, behind bladder \& toward the prostate gland
- As each duct passes behind (dorsal to) bladder, it has appended to it a gland called the seminal vesicle
- Just before it reaches the prostate gland, each ductus deferens enlarges to form an ampulla
- The ampulla is the position of sperm storage prior to ejaculation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-029.jpg?height=1583&width=2121&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=348)

\section*{Ejaculatory Duct}
- Each ductus deferens, at the ampulla, joins the duct from the adjacent seminal vesicle (one of the accessory glands) to form a short ejaculatory duct
- Each ejaculatory duct passes through the prostate gland and empties into the urethra
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-031.jpg?height=1742&width=2238&top_left_y=161&top_left_x=214)

\section*{Urethra}
- Transports semen from the ejaculatory duct to the outside of the body
- Subdivided into:
- Prostatic urethra that extends through the prostate gland
- Membranous urethra that travels through the urogenital diaphragm
- Penile urethra that ends through the penis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-033.jpg?height=1583&width=2121&top_left_y=288&top_left_x=348)

\section*{Accessory glands}
- The vagina has a highly acidic environment to prevent bacterial growth
- Sperm cannot survive in this type of environment, so an alkaline secretion called seminal fluid is needed to lessen the acidity of the vagina and bring pH values closer to neutral
- As the sperm travel through the reproductive tract (a process that can take several days), they are nourished by nutrients within the seminal fluid
- The components of seminal fluid are produced by accessory glands:
- Seminal vesicle
- Prostate gland
- Bulbourethral glands

\section*{Seminal Fluid or Semen}
- A slightly alkaline mixture of sperm cells and secretions from the accessory glands
- Secretions from the seminal vesicles make up about 60 percent of the volume of the semen, with most of the remainder coming from the prostate gland. The sperm and secretions from the bulbourethral gland contribute only a small volume
- The volume of semen in a single ejaculation may vary from 1.5 to 6.0 ml . There are between 50 to 150 million sperm per milliliter of semen. Sperm counts below 10 to 20 million per milliliter usually present fertility problems

\section*{Seminal Vesicles}
- The paired seminal vesicles are located on the posterior surface of the urinary bladder adjacent to the ampulla of the ductus deferens
- Each seminal vesicle is an elongated, pouch-like hollow organ approximately 5-8 centimeters long
- It is the proximal portion of each seminal vesicle that merges with a ductus deferens to form the ejaculatory duct
- The seminal vesicles secrete a viscous, whitish-yellow alkaline fluid containing both fructose and prostaglandins
The fructose is a sugar that nourishes the sperm as they travel through the female reproductive tract, while the prostaglandins promote the widening and slight dilation of the external os of the cervix

\section*{Prostate}
- A compact encapsulated organ that weighs about 20 grams and is shaped like a walnut (shape of human brain), measuring approximately 2 cm by 3 cm by 4 cm
- Located immediately inferior to the bladder
- Secretes a slightly milky fluid that is weakly acidic and rich in citric acid, seminal plasmin, and prostatespecific antigen (PSA):
- Citric acid is a nutrient for sperm health
- Seminal plasmin is an antibiotic that combats urinary tract infections
- PSA acts as an enzyme to help liquefy semen following ejaculation

\section*{Bulbourethral Glands (Cowper's)}
- Paired, pea-shaped bulbourethral glands (or Cowper's glands) are located within the urogenital diaphragm on each side of the membranous urethra
Each gland has a short duct that projects into the base of the penis and enters the spongy urethra
- Their secretory product is a clear, viscous mucin that forms mucus when mixed with water
As a component of the seminal fluid, this mucin protects the urethra by neutralizing the acidity of the urine residue in the urethra, helps to neutralize the acidity of the vagina, and provides some lubrication for the tip of the penis during intercourse.

\section*{FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM}
- Broadly divided into external genitalia and internal genitalia
- External genitalia
- Include the mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, vestibule, the perineum
- Internal genitalia
- Include the ovaries(sex gonads), fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina

-The vulva includes the outwardly visible structures:
- Mons pubis
- Labia majora
- Labia minora
- Clitoris
- Urethral opening

External genitalia of adult female (parous)

\section*{Mons Pubis}
- The triangular mound of fatty tissue that covers the pubic bone
- It protects the pubic symphysis
- During adolescence sex hormones trigger the growth of pubic hair on the mons pubis
- Hair varies in coarseness curliness, amount, color and thickness

\section*{Labia Majora}
- Referred to as the outer lips
- Protect the introitus and urethral openings
- Are covered with squamous epithelium and contain sweat glands and sebaceous glands, hair follicles, inner surface are hairless
- Beneath the skin is dense connective tissue and adipose tissue - with a rich venous plexus
-The round ligament terminate at its anterior third
- Become flaccid with age and after childbirth

\section*{LABIA MINORA}
- Referred to as the "inner lips"
- Hairless skin folds. Made up of erectile muscle fibres, connective tissue, sebaceous glands, numerous vessels and nerve endings
- Each of which splits anteriorly to run over, and under, the glans of the clitoris. The more anterior folds unite to form the hood-shaped prepuce of the clitoris, whereas the posterior folds insert into the underside of the glans as the frenulum.
- They are more sensitive and responsive to touch than the labia majora

\section*{Clitoris}
- Erectile organ composed of nerves, blood vessels, and erectile tissue
- Consists of a glans, a body and two crura
- Located under the prepuce
- It is made up of a shaft and a glans
- Becomes engorged with blood during sexual stimulation
- Key to sexual pleasure for most women
- Urethral opening is located directly below clitoris

\section*{Vaginal opening (Introitus)}
- Opening may be covered by a thin sheath called the hymen
- Using the presence of an intact hymen for determining virginity is erroneous
- Some women are born without hymens
- The hymen can be perforated by many different events

\section*{Various Types of Hymens}

\section*{Parous introitus (after childbirth)}

\section*{Vestibule}
- Triangular space bound by
- Anteriorly: clitoris
- Posteriorly: fourchette
- Laterally: labia minus
-There are six openings into the vestibule
- Urethral opening
- Vaginal orifice and hymen
- Openings of Bartholins glands(2)
- Openings of paraurethral(Skene) glands(2)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-055.jpg?height=1703&width=2505&top_left_y=309&top_left_x=59)

\section*{Bartholin's glands}
- Pea-sized, yellowish in colour, about 0.5 cm , each with a narrow duct 2.5 cm long opening into the vestibule outside the hymen.
-The duct is lined by columnar epithelium but near its opening by stratified squamous epithelium
- During sexual excitement, they secrete abundant alkaline mucus which helps with lubrication.

Blood supply to the vulva
- Chief- Pudendal artery

\section*{Lymphatic drainage of the vulva}
- Lymphatic vessels of the vulva drain primarily into the superficial inguinal lymph nodes. These nodes are located within a triangle formed by the inguinal ligament, the medial border of the sartorius muscle, and the lateral border of the adductor longus muscle
- In general, lymphatic drainage travels in a stepwise fashion from the superficial to the deep inguinal nodes and then to pelvic lymph node(iliac nodes and obturator nodes)
- Vulvar lymphatics decussate in the mons pubis and the posterior fourchette. Lymphatics do not cross the labiocrural folds and generally do not cross the midline unless originating at the clitoris or at the perineal body.
- As a result, metastasis of vulvar tumors to contralateral nodes is rare in the absence of ipsilateral groin metastasis. Ipsilatera/tumors can be defined as lesions that are further than 1 cm from the midline.

\section*{INTERNAL GENITALIA}

The internal genitalia consists of the:
- Vagina
- Cervix
- Uterus
- Fallopian Tubes
- Ovaries

\section*{Vagina}

The vagina forms the inferior-most region of the female reproductive tract that connects the uterus with the outside of the body anteroventrally
- Functions:-
- functions as the birth canal
- copulatory organ of the female
- Serves as the passageway for menstruation, \& uterine secretions

\section*{Vagina-structure}
-The vagina is a thick-walled, fibromuscular tube, with an anterior, a posterior, and two lateral walls
- The cervix projects into the anterior vaginal wall, making it shorter than the posterior wall by about 3 cm .
- The posterior vaginal wall is about 7 to 9 cm in length in the adult female, although there is great variability in this dimension.

\section*{Vagina- structure 2}
- The spaces between the cervix and vagina are known as the anterior, posterior, and lateral vaginal fornices
-The vagina's relatively thin, distensible wall consists of four layers: an inner mucosa, a sub mucosa, muscularis, and an outer adventitia The mucosa is of the nonkeratinized stratified squamous type and lies on a loose areolar vascular submucosa.

\section*{Vagina}
- The vagina's relations to other parts of the body can be understood by dividing it into thirds.
- Lower third, the vagina is fused anteriorly with the urethra, posteriorly with the perineal body, and laterally to each levator ani
- Middle third; vesical neck and trigone anteriorly, the rectum posteriorly, and the levators laterally

\section*{Vagina}
- Upper third, the anterior vagina is adjacent to the bladder and ureters, posterior to the cul-de-sac, and lateral to the cardinal ligaments.

\section*{Vagina-blood supply}
- Blood supply:
- vaginal artery and branches from the uterine, middle rectal, and internal pudendal arteries.
- Innervation:
- the upper vagina: uterovaginal plexus
- the distal vagina: pudendal nerve

\section*{Uterus}
-The uterus is a fibromuscular organ usually divided into:
- a lower cervix
- an upper corpus or uterine body
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_28_b030efab7cf02a07dff5g-073.jpg?height=1703&width=2446&top_left_y=172&top_left_x=210)

\section*{Cervix}
- The portion of cervix exposed to the vagina is the exocervix or portio vaginalis. It has a convex round surface with a circular or slitlike opening (the external os) into the endocervical canal
- The endocervical canal is about 2 to 3 cm in length and opens proximally into the endometrial cavity at the internal os
- The cervical mucosa contains:
- Stratified squamous epithelium characteristic of the exocervix,
- Mucus-secreting columnar epithelium, characteristic of the endocervix

\section*{Cervix}
- Intersection between the two epithelia is the squamocolumnar junction
- Is geographically variable and dependent on hormonal stimulation
- It is this dynamic interface, the transformation zone, that is most vulnerable to the development of squamous neoplasia
- In early childhood, during pregnancy, or with oral contraceptive use:
- columnar epithelium may extend from the endocervical canal onto the exocervix, a condition known as eversion or ectopy
- After menopause, the transformation zone:
- usually recedes entirely into the endocervical canal

\section*{Corpus (Body of Uterus)}

The uterus is pear shaped
- Varies in size and shape, depending on:-
- Hormonal levels
-Previous parturition
-Presence of pathology (eg fibroids, adenomyosis)
- In the adult the uterus is about 8 cm long, 5 cm wide, walls 1.25 cm thick, and weighs $50-80$ grams
- At birth, the cervix and corpus are about equal in size(ratio 1:1), in adult women, the corpus has grown to 2 to 3 times the size of the cervix, post menopausal women the corpus: cervix ratio is $1: 1$

\section*{Corpus (Body of Uterus)}
-The uterine corpus is divided into 3 parts: Isthmus, cornu and fundus
- The uterus is made up of three layers the: endometrium, myometrium and perimetrium (serosa)

\section*{Supports of the uterus}
- Transverse cervical ligaments (cardinal ligaments)
- Uterosacral ligaments
- Pubocervical ligaments
- The round ligaments
- Pelvic diaphragm(Levator ani)
- Urogenital diaphragm( made of a pair of deep transvesus perinei and the sphincter urethrea muscles)
- Perineal body

\section*{Ligaments}
4 pairs of ligaments
- Round ligament
- Uterosacral ligament
- Cardinal ligament
- Broad ligament
1. Round ligament - attaches anterior-inferiorly to uterotubal junctions, pass in the broad ligaments, end in labia majora. They help to keep uterus in the position of anteversion.

2. Broad ligament - arise from the side of the uterus to the lateral pelvic wall, provide minimal support.

Between two leaves of ligam there lies
- round ligaments
- fallopian tubes
- ovarian ligament
- Mesosalpinx
- infundibulum ligament
- ovarian vessels and nerves the infundibulopelvic lig.,
3. Cardinal ligaments - extend from cervix and lateral parts vaginal fornix to lateral walls pelvis.

Blood supply of the uterus
- Uterine artery- arises from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries
-The ovarian arteries- arises from the abdominal aorta

\section*{Blood supply of the uterus}
- The uterine artery travels through the cardinal ligament and passes over the ureter ( NB the ureter is located approximately 1.5 cm lateral to the cervix.)
- It then joins the uterus near the level of the internal cervical os and gives off branches that run superiorly towards the uterine corpus and inferiorly towards the cervix.
- The uterine corpus branches anastomose with vessels that derive from the ovarian arteries, thus providing collateral blood flow.

The uterine artery also sends a branch to the cervicovaginal junction at the lateral aspect of the

Lymphatic drainage of the uterus
- Fundus and upper part of body- aortic nodes, superficial inguinal nodes along the round ligament
- Lower part of the body-external iliac nodes
- Cervix- external iliac nodes, internal iliac nodes, sacral nodes

\section*{Nerve supply of the uterus}
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves through the inferior hypogastric and ovarian plexuses
- Sympathetic from T12, L1 segment of spinal cord
- Parasympathetic nerves- S2, S3, S4

\section*{Uterus- Functions}
- Site for implantation
- Supports, protects, and nourishes the developing embryo/fetus
- Forms a vascular connection with the mother's uterine wall that later develops into the placenta
- Ejects the fetus at birth after maternal oxytocin levels increase to initiate the uterine contractions of labor
- Site for menstruation if an oocyte is not fertilized or after a baby is expelled, the muscular wall of the uterus contracts and sheds its inner lining as menstruation

\section*{Uterus-relations}
- Anterior

\section*{Adnexa}

The fallopian tubes and ovaries collectively are referred to as the adnexa

\section*{Oviducts (Fallopian Tubes)}
- Paired hollow structures representing the proximal unfused ends of the müllerian duct
- Length: 7 to 12 cm
- Function: ovum pickup, provision of physical environment for conception, and transport and nourishment of the fertilized ovum
- The tubal mucosa is ciliated columnar epithelium
- Made up of an inner circular and outer longitudinal smooth muscle layer
- Blood suppply: uterine and ovarian arteries
- Innervation: uterovaginal plexus and the ovarian plexus

\section*{Oviducts (Fallopian Tubes)}
- Divided into 4 parts:
- Interstitial: narrowest portion of the tube, lies within the uterine wall and forms the tubal ostia at the endometrial cavity
- Isthmus: narrow segment closest to the uterine wall
- Ampulla: larger diameter segment lateral to the isthmus
- Fimbria (infundibulum): funnel-shaped abdominal ostia of the tubes, opening into the peritoneal cavity; this opening is fringed with numerous fingerlike projections that provide a wide surface for ovum pickup

\section*{Ovaries}
- Are paired gonadal structures suspended between the pelvic wall and the uterus by the infundibulopelvic ligament laterally and the uteroovarian ligament medially
- Inferiorly, the hilar surface of each ovary is attached to the broad ligament
- The normal ovary is about $5 \times 3 \times 3 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Each ovary consists of an outer cortex, the central medulla and the rete ovarii (the hilum)
- The hilum is the point of attachment of the vary to the mesovarium, it contains nerves, blood vessels and hilus cells.
- The hilus cells are very similar to the testosterone producing Lydig cells of the testes

\section*{Ovarian cortex}
-The outermost portion of the cortex is called the tunica albuginea, topped on its surface by a single layer of cuboidal epithelium, referred to as the ovarian surface epithelium or ovarian mesothelium.
-The cortex is composed of a specialized stroma and follicles in various stages of development or attrition
-The oocytes, enclosed in complexes called follicles, are in the inner part of the cortex, embedded in stromal tissue.
- The stromal tissue is composed of connective tissue and interstitial cells which are derived from mesenchymal cells.
- The medulla occupies a small portion is composed primarily of fibromuscular tissue and blood vessels

\section*{Ovaries}
-The female gonads or sex glands
- The physiologic role of the ovary is periodic release of gametes(eggs, oocytes) and the production of the steroid hormones estradiol and progesterone
- Both activities are integrated in the continuous repetitive process of follicle maturation, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation and regression
- A woman is born with approximately 400,000 immature eggs called follicles
- During a lifetime a woman release @ 400 to 500 fully matured eggs for fertilization
- The follicles in the ovaries produce the female sex hormones, progesterone and estrogen
- These hormones prepare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg

\section*{Structure of Ovary}
- Covered with germinal epithelium
- Tunica Albuginea
- Cortex (outer layer)
- Medulla (inner core)

\end{tabular}

\section*{Perineum}
- Diamond-shaped area between the thighs that is circumscribed anteriorly by the pubic symphysis, laterally by the ischial tuberosities, and posteriorly by the coccyx
- 2 distinct triangle bases are formed by an imaginary horizontal line extending between the ischial tuberosities of the coccyx
- Anterior triangle, called the urogenital triangle, contains:
- urethral and vaginal orifices in females
- base of the penis and the scrotum in males
- Posterior triangle, called the anal triangle, is the location of the anus in both sexes

\section*{Mammary glands}
- Are present in both males and females but normally function only in women
- They are important to mammalian reproduction, although not actually a part of the reproductive system
- Consist of small sacs of epithelial tissue that secrete milk
- Milk drains into a series of ducts opening at the nipple
- In nonlactating female mammal, the mammary glands are composed primarily of fatty (adipose) tissue
- In males, the low level of estrogen prevents the development of both the secretory apparatus and the fat deposits, so male breasts remain small, and nipples are not connected to ducts
