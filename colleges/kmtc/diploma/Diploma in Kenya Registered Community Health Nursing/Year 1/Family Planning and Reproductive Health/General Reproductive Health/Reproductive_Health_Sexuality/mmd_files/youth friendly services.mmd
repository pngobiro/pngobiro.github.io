\section*{SECTION 2}

PROMOTION OF ADOLESCENT AND YOUTH SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

\section*{Objectives}
1. Role of the health service provider in creating awareness on the available SRH services.
2. Scope of youth friendly services.
3. Characteristics of youth friendly services.
4. Categories of Life Skills Training for the Adolescents
5. Barriers to the utilisation of existing RH services by adolescents/youth
6. Role of networking and collaboration in the promotion of SRH

\section*{Role of the health service provider in creating awareness on the available SRH services}
- The service provider has a major role in creating awareness to dispel fears, misconceptions and rumors about adolescent and SRH Issues.
- This will make the young people utilize the services available.
- This can be achieved through:
1. Counseling,
2. Education,
3. Provision of quality SRH Services,
4. Referral to Youth Friendly services for support.
- The counseling process involving the approaches of GATHER and REDI and by use of verbal and non verbal techniques; i.e. CLEAR ROLES.
2. Education is by giving relevant health education on SRH Issues, using appropriate Information, Education and Communication (IEC), aims at Behavior Change Communication (BBC) and providing Behavior Change Information (BCI). Micro teaching and utilization of Mass Media is also effective as well as facilitation of formation of youth groups and clubs in community, churches and schools.
3. Provision of quality SRH Services without bias to the individuals so long as you have given effective counseling and have made informed choices.
4. Referral can be done to youth-friendly clubs and other support organizations within their reach if you are not able to provide the services.
- The Scope of Youth Friendly Services (YFS)
- According to Musandu, et al (2006); the health facilities are underutilized due to health providers' attitude and non confidentiality to SRH Issues.
- Those with more education and those who have received continuing education on Adolescent sexuality and health embrace the adolescent youth-friendly attitudes.
- WHO \& MOH, (2005), defines Youth Friendly Services as services that are "accessible, acceptable, affordable and appropriate" for the adolescents and youths.
- The scope of YFS focuses on the;
- 1. Pillars of Safe motherhood and
- 2. Sexual reproductive health information or guidance and counselling

\section*{Safe motherhood}
he Safe motherhood focuses on reduction of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality rate by provision of:
Family Planning and preconception care: should be provided after counselling, using the Medical Eligibility Criteria for both regular and emergency contraceptives so that we reduce dangers related to pregnancy and childbirth
Focused Antenatal Care: Aims at giving 4 comprehensive pre natal visits to prevent complications, identify early and manage them appropriately. Give health education to improve the health of mother through good nutrition and emphasise on individualised birth plan and danger signs of pregnancy, labour and delivery as well as post natally.
Clean and Safe Delivery: Ensure birth attendants are knowledgeable and skilled (professionals), equipments to perform delivery and post partum care for mother and baby provided. Due to being tender in age they tend to have labour and delivery complications which need to be monitored well through partogram in a well equipped health facility ${ }_{2028}$
- Safe motherhood cont..
- Targeted Post partum care - Is very critical to help the adolescent adjust to parenthood. Schedule of post natal checks should be within the 1 st 48 hours, within the $1-2$ weeks, at 6 weeks and $4-6$ months. This enables the young mother adjust well or else home visits can be done more frequently if need arises.
- Maternal nutrition is an important area as we all know that a number of adolescents may have inadequate diet which impairs healthy development. This has serious effects on the growing adolescent resulting on stunted growth and poor performance. They must be encouraged to eat well in all forms of food groups available due to nutritional requirements for growth.
- Post abortion care entails giving adequate care to those affected but aims at prevention by providing health information on dangers of early/pre marital sex and how to prevent unwanted pregnancy
- Neonatal care- Most adolescents have complications related to pregnancy and child birth, they have higher incidences of low birth weight. Due to this the children need to be followed up at the CWC for monitoring and immunization and to provide health information on parenting.

\section*{2. Sexual Reproductive Health Information/Guidance and Counselling;}
- Young people should be given adequate information on sexuality, expectations and how to defend their rights.
- IEC material should be available on site and take away on critical issues related to SRH as:
- i. Life skills training to empower them to be in charge of their health
- ii. Counselling services on substance and drug abuse, STIs/HIV, FP etc.
- iii. School health talks to address critical issues as sexuality and sex education
- iv. Post rape care is deemed important as many children are usually helpless and the perpetrators are never charged for their actions due to fear and ignorance and socio-cultural issues.
- v. Referral for treatment and management in situations where the individual needs more care as necessary.

\section*{Life Skills}
- Life Skills are psychological competencies or abilities that enable an individual to cope effectively with daily life challenges.

- The competencies should be practiced, mastered and perfected to achieve the skills.
- These life skills are grouped into the following three categories;

\section*{The Barriers to the Utilization of Existing RH Services by Adolescents/Youth}

\section*{1. Staff barriers}

- Collaboration is when two or more organizations support each other to achieve certain set goals.
- However they have to be conversant with what each group does to avoid duplication of services to enable them effectively and efficiently utilize the funds.
- Networking and collaboration can be effectively used to pull resources together for a particular service with the concept of team spirit.
- As they pull resources together, particular goals like sharing materials in the form of videos, IEC and posters are achieved.
- The health professional should also ensure a functioning referral system so that the Adolescents are able to get services as appropriate. They should be well informed about the services available at all levels of the YFS so that they utilise
