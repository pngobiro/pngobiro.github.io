\section*{Definition of antenatal care}
- Antenatal care (ANC) is health care given to a pregnant woman from conception to the onset of labour.
- The midwife should provide a woman centered care approach by sharing information with the woman to help her make informed choices about her care.
Aim of antenatal care
- To achieve a good outcome for the mother and baby and prevent any complications that may occur in pregnancy, labour, delivery and the post partum period

Antenatal care is the care you give to a pregnant woman to ensure that she reaches the end of her pregnancy both physically and psychologically healthy and that she delivers a healthy baby.
- Good quality antenatal care always includes:
- Diagnosing the pregnancy before 24 weeks
- Regular blood pressure checks, testing for oedema, and urine examination
- Regular abdominal examination
- The recognition of high risk cases and their referral for special care
- Immunisation against tetanus to both the mother and unborn baby
- Treating of minor complications

\section*{The approach}
- The risk approach to antenatal care has not resulted in significant improvement in maternal survival.
- Life threatening complications of pregnancy are difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Health care providers must, therefore, consider the possibility of complications in every pregnancy and prepare clients accordingly.
- While risk assessment can help direct counselling and treatment for individuals, it is important to understand that most women who experience complications have no 'risk factors' at all.

In order for you to provide good quality antenatal care, you must achieve the following aims: Make the mother aware of the benefits offered by your clinic both during pregnancy, at the time of delivery, and afterwards.
$\checkmark$ Advise the mother on how to look after herself and her baby. You should also advise on a balanced diet, and activities likely to improve and maintain her health and that of her baby.
$\checkmark$ Prepare her psychologically and physically for delivery. Do this by allaying her fears and counselling on harmful beliefs and practices.
$\checkmark$ Give prophylactic treatment against anaemia and vaccination against neonatal tetanus.
$\checkmark$ Identify those 'at risk', that is, women who might have problems during pregnancy or labour, and correct the abnormalities or refer to hospital for management of the pregnancy or delivery.
$\checkmark$ Help a mother to make an Individual Birth Plan (IBP).
$\checkmark$ Help the mother prepare for, and learn how to take good care of the child physically, psychologically and socially.

\section*{FANC: Focused antenatal care}
- Women can benefit from just a few antenatal visits, as long as those visits are thorough.
- Focused or targeted ANC refers to a minimum number of four comprehensive personalised antenatal visits, each of which has specific items of client assessment, education and care to ensure prevention or early detection and prompt management of complications.
- The focus is on birth preparedness and on individuals in readiness to handle complications.
- Always view each visit as if it were the only visit the woman may make. Many women cannot come for 4 visits
- Antenatal care should be simpler, safer, friendly and more accessible.
- Women are more likely to seek and return for services if they feel cared for and respected by their providers.
- This personalized approach requires health care providers to use excellent interpersonal skills since listening to client's concerns is just as important as giving advice.
- It respects clients' right to dignity, privacy, confidentiality, full and accurate information.

The aims of focused antenatal care are:
1. Early detection and treatment of problems
2. Prevention of complications using safe, simple and cost-effective interventions
3. Birth preparedness and complication readiness
4. Health promotion using health messages and counseling
5. Provision of care by a skilled attendant

\section*{Schedule of Visits}
- It is recommended that the pregnant woman should attend a minimum of four comprehensive personalized antenatal visits spread out during the entire pregnancy during which specific focused activities are carried out to guide the woman along the path of survival, as follows;
- First visit less than 16 weeks
- Second visit 16-28 weeks
- Third visit 28-32 weeks
- Fourth visit 32-40 weeks

Depending on individual need, some women will require additional visits.

\section*{The first visit}

The first antenatal visit should take place as early as possible, preferably in the first trimester. It is an opportunity to collect baseline data about the mother, for example, weight, blood pressure and so on. This baseline data is important because it forms a basis for comparison during later visits.
Also, during the first visit, any other abnormalities can be detected and treated before they have a detrimental effect.

The activities of the first visit include:
- Registration
- Height and weight measurement
- History taking
- Physical examination
- Laboratory examination
- Management of complaints
- Immunization
- Health Education
a) Obtain information on:

Personal history
- Name
- Age (date of birth)
- Physical address and telephone number
- Marital status
- Educational level: primary, secondary, university
- Economic resources: employed? Type of work, position of patient and husband/guardian
- Tobacco use (smoking or chewing habit) or use of other harmful substances?

History of present pregnancy
- Date of last menstrual period (LMP); certainty of dates (by regularity, accuracy of recall and other relevant information including contraceptive history).
- Determine the expected date of delivery(EDD) based on LMP and all other relevant information.
- Use 280-day rule (LMP + 280 days). Some women will refer to the date of the first missed period when asked about LMP, which may lead to miscalculation of term by four weeks
- You may also calculate and record the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) by adding seven days to the first day of the last normal menstrual period and subtracting three months from that month. For example, if her last period started on 18th June, 18 plus 7 gives you 25 . Then June minus three months, (6-3) will give March. So the EDD is March 25th of the following year.
- Quickening if applicable
- Any unexpected event (pain, vaginal bleeding, other: specify)
- Malaria attacks
- Habits: smoking/chewing tobacco, alcohol, drugs (frequency and quantity)

\section*{Obstetric history}
- Number of previous pregnancies (Gravida and Parity)
- Date (month, year) and outcome of each event (live birth, stillbirth, neonatal death, abortion, ectopic, hydatidiform mole)
- Specify (validate) preterm births
- Specify type and gestation of any abortion, and management if possible (MVA, D\&C)
- Birth weight of previous pregnancies (if known)
- Sex of the baby / babies
- Puerperium (eventful or uneventful)
- Periods of exclusive breast-feeding: when? For how long?

Special maternal complications and events in previous pregnancies;
Specify which pregnancy, validate by records (if possible):
$\checkmark$ Recurrent early abortion
$\checkmark$ Induced abortion and any associated complications
$\checkmark$ Thrombosis, Embolus
$\checkmark$ Hypertension, Pre-eclampsia Or Eclampsia
$\checkmark$ Placental Abruption
$\checkmark$ Placenta Praevia
$\checkmark$ Breech Or Transverse Presentation
$\checkmark$ Obstructed Labour, including Dystocia
$\checkmark$ Third-degree tears
$\checkmark$ Third Stage excessive bleeding
$\checkmark$ Puerperal Sepsis
$\checkmark$ Gestational Diabetes.

Obstetrical operations:
- Caesarean section (indication, if known)
- Forceps or vacuum extraction
- Manual removal of the placenta
- Destructive procedures (craniotomy, decapitation)

Special perinatal (foetal, newborn)
complications and events in previous
- Pregnancies; specify which pregnancy, validate by records (if possible):
$\checkmark$ twins or higher order multiples
$\checkmark$ low birth weight: $<2500 \mathrm{~g}$
$\checkmark$ intrauterine growth restriction (if validated)
$\checkmark$ Rhesus-antibody affection (hydrops)
$\checkmark$ malformed or chromosomally abnormal child
$\checkmark$ macrosomic ( $>4500 \mathrm{~g}$ ) newborn
$\checkmark$ resuscitation or other treatment of newborn
$\checkmark$ perinatal, neonatal or infant death (also: later death)

\section*{Medical history}
- Specific diseases and conditions:
$\checkmark$ o tuberculosis, heart disease, chronic renal disease, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus
$\checkmark$ o RTIs
$\checkmark$ o HIV status, if known
$\checkmark$ o other specific conditions depending on prevalence in the region, e.g. hepatitis, malaria, sickle cell trait

$\checkmark$ o blood transfusions
$\checkmark$ o Rhesus D negative antibodies
$\checkmark$ o current use of medicines: specify
$\checkmark$ o Period of infertility: when? duration, cause(s)
- Any other diseases, past or chronic; allergy

\section*{b) Perform physical examination}
- A thorough examination is made at the first visit. This is divided into a general examination and an obstetric examination. The general examination should include:
- General appearance, namely the nutritional status, whether weak or sick looking. Note the gait and if she walks with a limp.
- Height, noting that any woman below 150 cms in height is likely to have cephalopelvic disproportion.
- Weight, that is, a pregnant woman on average gains 2 kg every month.
- The total weight gain by the end of pregnancy is about $10-20 \mathrm{~kg}$. Excessive weight gain indicates accumulation of fluid in the tissues (oedema).
- Lack of increase in weight or loss may mean malnutrition.
- Obesity may lead to an increased risk of gestational diabetes.
- Blood pressure, which is taken in order to ascertain the normal and provide a baseline for comparison. A pressure of $140 / 90 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{Hg}$ at booking is indicative of hypertension and could cause damage to the placenta.
- pulse, temperature
- Signs of anaemia in conjunctiva, hands and tongue pale complexion, fingernails, conjunctiva, oral mucosa, tip of tongue and shortness of breath
- Check for oedema of face, hands and ankles
- Observe type of breathing and chest generally for abnormalities
- FGM status: - If type III discuss the possibility of deinfibulation (opening up either antenatal or during labour)
Varicosities, warts, discharge

\section*{Breast Examination}
- Palpate gently with the flat of the hand to feel for any lumps.
- Check if the nipple is protractile.
- Educate the woman on how to examine the breasts by herself

Obstetric Examination (Abdominal) An obstetric examination aims at:
1. Observing for signs of pregnancy
2. Assessing foetal size and growth
3. Assessing foetal health
4. Diagnosing the location of foetal parts
5. Detecting any deviation from normal
- The client is asked to empty her bladder and then to lie on her back on a couch with the arms by her sides.
- Inspect the abdomen for the shape, size, scars and foetal movements. Any abnormality detected is referred for further investigations.
- Estimate the height of the fundus and compare it with the weeks of amenorrhoea. This helps you to assess foetal growth and detect any deviations from the normal.

- Check for varicosities at the back of the leg. Ask the woman to remove any tight clothing at the leg. At this time it is also important to check for phlebitis by looking for any reddened areas.
- Palpate the sides of the abdomen to locate the foetal back in order to determine the position.
- You do this by facing the patient and then supporting the uterus with your right hand.
- Keep pushing the foetus with your left hand towards the right. Reverse the order to feel the left side of the uterus.
- Palpate the lower pole of the uterus, just above the pelvic brim.
- Ask the mother to bend her knees slightly in order to relax the abdominal muscles and ask her to breath steadily with her mouth open.
- Facing the foot of the bed, mark the brim of the pelvis with your hands and cup what presents between them. If the head is presenting, a smooth surface will be felt.
- If you do not find the head in the pelvic brim or at the fundus, suspect a transverse lie. This will be significant only after the 36th week of gestation.
- The foetal heart sounds are listened to last, so
as to assess the foetal wellbeing. The Pinard's foetal stethoscope is commonly used to hear the foetal heart.
- As you perform the physical examination, talk to the mother and check her facial reaction as you palpate the abdomen. When you complete the procedure reassure the mother.

\section*{Findings of Abdominal Examinations}

All these are recorded upon completion of the exercise and they include:
- Gestational age, which is estimated as per the size of the fundus.- fundal height
- Lie, which refers to the relationship between the long axis of the foetus and that of the mother and can either be longitudinal, transverse or oblique.
- Attitude, which refers to the relationship of the foetal head and limbs to its trunk. It is most commonly flexion.
- Presentation, which means the foetal part that is lying at the pelvic brim or in the lower pole of the uterus and can either be vertex, breach, face, shoulder or brow. The most common is the vertex. Note that vertex/brow/face all refer to head presentation.
- Denominator is the name given to the presenting part for example, occiput for vertex, sacrum for breech and mentum for face.
- Position, which refers to the relationship between the denominator of the presentation and the landmarks of the pelvic brim.

f) Advice, questions and answers, and scheduling the next appointment
- Repeat all the advice given at the first and second visit
- Give advice on measures to be taken in case of the initiation of labour or leakage of amniotic fluid.
- In case of suspected twins and/or malpresentation, advice mother to deliver at facility that can provide Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care
- Reconfirm in writing on whom to call and where to go in case of emergency or any other need
- Plans to ensure transport is available in case of need during labour
- Questions \& answers: time for free communication
- Provide recommendations on lactation, contraception and the importance of the postpartum visits.
- Schedule appointment: if not delivered by end of week 41 (state date and write it in the ANC card), go to hospital for check-up.
g) Maintain complete records
- Complete clinic record. Give the ANC card to the patient and advise her to bring it with her to all appointments she may have with any health services.
NB; Late enrolment and missed visits
- It is very likely that a good number of women will not initiate ANC early enough in pregnancy to follow the focused four antenatal visits.
- These women, particularly those starting after 32 weeks of gestation, should have in their first visit all activities recommended for the previous visits, as well as those which correspond to the present visit.
- It is expected, therefore, that a late first visit will take more time than a regular first visit

\section*{National guidelines for IPT}
- Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) is an effective approach to preventing malaria in pregnant women by giving antimalarial drugs in treatment doses at defined intervals after quickening to clear a presumed burden of parasites
- The Ministry of Health Guidelines on Malaria directs us to give SP to pregnant women in endemic malaria areas, at least twice during each pregnancy, even if she has no physical signs and her haemoglobin is within normal range.
- Administer IPT with each scheduled visit after quickening (16 weeks) to ensure women receive at least 2 doses at an interval of at least 4 weeks.
- IPT should be given under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) in the ANC clinic and can be given on an empty stomach
