                        <p>The first antenatal visit should take place as early as possible, preferably in the first trimester. It is an opportunity to collect baseline data about the mother, for example, weight, blood pressure and so on. This baseline data is important because it forms a basis for comparison during later visits.

                            <li>You may also calculate and record the Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) by adding seven days to the first day of the last normal menstrual period and subtracting three months from that month. For example, if her last period started on 18th June, 18 plus 7 gives you 25. Then June minus three months, (6-3) will give March. So the EDD is March 25th of the following year.</li>

                            <li>Check for varicosities at the back of the leg. Ask the woman to remove any tight clothing at the leg. At this time it is also important to check for phlebitis by looking for any reddened areas.</li>
                            <li>Palpate the sides of the abdomen to locate the foetal back in order to determine the position.

                            <li>Palpate the lower pole of the uterus, just above the pelvic brim. Ask the mother to bend her knees slightly in order to relax the abdominal muscles and ask her to breath steadily with her mouth open.</li>
                            <li>Facing the foot of the bed, mark the brim of the pelvis with your hands and cup what presents between them. If the head is presenting, a smooth surface will be felt.</li>
                            <li>If you do not find the head in the pelvic brim or at the fundus, suspect a transverse lie. This will be significant only after the 36th week of gestation.</li>
                            <li>The foetal heart sounds are listened to last, so as to assess the foetal wellbeing. The Pinard's foetal stethoscope is commonly used to hear the foetal heart.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As you perform the physical examination, talk to the mother and check her facial reaction as you palpate the abdomen. When you complete the procedure reassure the mother.</p>

                        <p>All these are recorded upon completion of the exercise and they include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Gestational age:</strong> which is estimated as per the size of the fundus - fundal height.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lie:</strong> which refers to the relationship between the long axis of the foetus and that of the mother and can either be longitudinal, transverse or oblique.</li>
                            <li><strong>Attitude:</strong> which refers to the relationship of the foetal head and limbs to its trunk. It is most commonly flexion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> which means the foetal part that is lying at the pelvic brim or in the lower pole of the uterus and can either be vertex, breach, face, shoulder or brow. The most common is the vertex. Note that vertex/brow/face all refer to head presentation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Denominator:</strong> is the name given to the presenting part for example, occiput for vertex, sacrum for breech and mentum for face.</li>
                            <li><strong>Position:</strong> which refers to the relationship between the denominator of the presentation and the landmarks of the pelvic brim.</li>
                        </ul>
