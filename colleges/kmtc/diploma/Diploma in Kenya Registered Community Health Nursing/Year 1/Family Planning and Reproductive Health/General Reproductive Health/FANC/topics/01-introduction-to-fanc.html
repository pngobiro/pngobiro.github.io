                        <p><strong>Antenatal care (ANC)</strong> is health care given to a pregnant woman from conception to the onset of labour.</p>
                        <p>The midwife should provide a woman centered care approach by sharing information with the woman to help her make informed choices about her care.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aim of antenatal care</h3>
                        <p>To achieve a good outcome for the mother and baby and prevent any complications that may occur in pregnancy, labour, delivery and the post partum period.</p>
                        <p>Antenatal care is the care you give to a pregnant woman to ensure that she reaches the end of her pregnancy both physically and psychologically healthy and that she delivers a healthy baby.</p>
                        
                        <p>Good quality antenatal care always includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diagnosing the pregnancy before 24 weeks</li>
                            <li>Regular blood pressure checks, testing for oedema, and urine examination</li>
                            <li>Regular abdominal examination</li>
                            <li>The recognition of high risk cases and their referral for special care</li>
                            <li>Immunisation against tetanus to both the mother and unborn baby</li>
                            <li>Treating of minor complications</li>

                        <p>Life threatening complications of pregnancy are difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Health care providers must, therefore, consider the possibility of complications in every pregnancy and prepare clients accordingly.</p>
                        <p>While risk assessment can help direct counselling and treatment for individuals, it is important to understand that most women who experience complications have no 'risk factors' at all.</p>
