                    <p>The WHO's expert Working Groups periodically review the latest scientific information on the safety of contraceptive methods and make recommendations on criteria for their use in different situations. In 2009, WHO published a new set of recommendations which have been incorporated in the present guidelines. The WHO groups medical conditions into these four categories:</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Conditions for which there is no restriction on the use of the contraceptive method.</li>
                        <li>Conditions for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks. In most situations, the method can be used freely, but careful follow-up might be required.</li>
                        <li>Conditions for which the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method. In this case, use of the method is not usually recommended unless other more appropriate alternative methods are not available or acceptable.</li>
                        <li>Conditions that present an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used, (i.e., the method should not be used).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>NB: The above four categories should be interpreted as follows:</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CATEGORY I:</h3>
                    <p>Men or women with no surgical or medical condition(s) which would make the method ineffective or worsen the condition. No contraindication</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CATEGORY II:</h3>
                    <p>Men & women with surgical & medical conditions which cannot be worsened by method used or make the method ineffective but the benefits generally outweigh the risks e.g. HTN, mild toxic goitre, mild varicose veins. No contraindication but observe</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CATEGORY III:</h3>
                    <p>Men & women with medical & surgical conditions which can or may be worsened by method used or make method ineffective where the risks outweigh the benefits e.g. DM, TB, epilepsy, cardiac disease. Give proper DR. follow up=relative contraindication</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">CATEGORY IV:</h3>
                    <p>Men & women with medical & surgical conditions worsened by method used or make the method ineffective. Do not give! E.g. in pregnancy, severe liver disease, undiagnosed vaginal bleedings, reproductive health cancers=absolute contraindication</p>

                    <p>All FP providers should maintain proper records on each client and the distribution of contraceptives. Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector also should follow the Ministry of Health's record-keeping and service provision guidelines.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">SUPERVISION</h3>
                    <p>Supervision is an essential component of programme monitoring and evaluation; it ensures that guidelines are being followed and clients' needs are being met. Facilitative (supportive) supervision should be encouraged, and the supervisor should be seen as a team member who motivates staff and guarantees the rights of providers and clients. Supervision activities should extend to private-sector facilities.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Logistics</h3>
                    <p>Service providers are expected to have a consistent supply of methods available in order to offer a choice to clients. The Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) is responsible for the procurement, storage, and distribution of contraceptive commodities through warehouses that are located at the district level.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">DEFINITION:</h3>
                    <p>It is a person-to-person interaction in which the counsellor provides adequate information to enable the client to make an informed choice about the course of action that is best for him or her.</p>
                    <p>Counseling is the act of working with a patient to help them clarify personal goals and find ways of overcoming their problems with the aim of assisting the individual to change behaviours that are interfering with attainment of basic needs.</p>
                    <p>In FP, counselling is viewed as the art whereby the service provider guides/assists a patient to make an informed choice in matters regarding their RH needs, taking into account all the surrounding circumstances and the patient's personal needs at the time.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">ESSENTIALS OF GOOD COUNSELLING</h3>
                    <p>A good counsellor is trained to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand and respect the client's rights.</li>
                        <li>Earn the client's trust.</li>
                        <li>Understand the benefits and limitations of all contraceptive methods.</li>
                        <li>Understand the cultural and emotional factors that affect a client's (or a couple's) decision to use a particular contraceptive method.</li>
                        <li>Encourage the client to ask questions.</li>
                        <li>Use a nonjudgmental approach, which shows respect and consideration to the client.</li>
                        <li>Present information in an unbiased, client-sensitive manner</li>
                        <li>Actively listen to the client's concerns.</li>
                        <li>Understand the effect of nonverbal communication.</li>
                        <li>Recognise when she or he cannot sufficiently help a client and refer the client to someone who can.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For counselling to be effective, observe the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The right to make an informed decision</li>
                        <li>Process should be confidential</li>
                        <li>Process must be truthful</li>
                        <li>Freedom of expression</li>
                        <li>Genuine communication without emotional involvement</li>
                        <li>Auditory and visual privacy</li>
                        <li>Receptive atmosphere</li>
                        <li>Recognize limitations and refer when necessary</li>

                    <h3 class="subsection-heading">Benefits of counseling</h3>
                    <p>Counseling is a vital part of RH care. It helps patients to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arrive at an informed choice of RH options</li>

                    <p>There are six steps used in counseling a family planning patient.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Greet, welcome and make the client feel comfortable. Establish a good rapport.</li>
                        <li>Ask the patient about themselves and any FP experiences. Get all the information about the patient</li>

                        <li>Help the patient make informed choices through history taking, general examination and finding out the real needs. Avoid biases.</li>
                        <li>Explain in detail the method of choice and give detailed instructions on how to use the method.</li>
                        <li>Return visits explained and discussion encouraged</li>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>The service provider should review all the available contraceptive methods that the patient may choose from. The counsellor should be aware of the following factors about each patient that may be important, depending on the method to be used:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The reproductive goal of the woman or couple (spacing or timing of births)</li>
                        <li>Personal factors including the time, travel costs, pain or discomfort likely to be experienced</li>
                        <li>Accessibility and availability of other products that are necessary to use the method</li>
                        <li>The need for protection against STIs and HIV/AIDS</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are three phases of counseling in FP:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>INITIAL COUNSELLING</strong>
                            <p>Initial counseling is carried out at reception, where you have to describe all the methods available and help the patient to choose the method appropriate for themselves.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>METHOD SPECIFIC COUNSELLING</strong>
                            <p>Method specific counseling is carried out prior to and immediately following service provision. Here, you need to give instructions to the patient on how to use the method chosen. You should also discuss possible common side effects specific to the method and explain what should be done if that happens.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>FOLLOW UP COUNSELING</strong>
                            <p>Follow up counseling occurs during the return visit. Ask the patient about method use, satisfaction and any problems that may have occurred.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Within the context of HIV/AIDS, FP counseling should address the following concerns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Whether the chosen FP method protects against STIs, including HIV</li>
                        <li>Safety of the FP method when used by a person living with HIV/AIDS.</li>
                        <li>Interactions between contraceptive methods and some drugs used in treatment for HIV/AIDS, including ARVs, and anti-TB drugs</li>
                        <li>Knowledge and guidance on dual protection practices, with emphasis on the consistent and correct use of condoms or abstinence as the most effective means of protection. In this regard, appropriate counseling messages depend on the HIV status of the client or couple</li>
                    </ul>

                </h2>
                <div class="content-card">
                    <p>You can only be reasonably sure a patient is not pregnant when she has no clinical features of pregnancy and exhibits the following characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Has had no intercourse since her last menses</li>
                        <li>Is within seven days after the start of her menses (days one to seven)</li>
                        <li>Is within four weeks postpartum (for non-breast feeding women)</li>
                        <li>Is within seven days post abortion</li>
                        <li>Is exclusively breast feeding less than six months post partum and has had no menstrual bleeding</li>
                        <li>Has been correctly and consistently using another reliable contraceptive method</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Pregnancy testing is not essential except in the following cases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The woman answered "no" to all questions on the pregnancy checklist.</li>
                        <li>It is difficult to confirm pregnancy (i.e., it is six weeks or less from the LMP).</li>
                        <li>The results of the pelvic examination are equivocal (e.g., the client is overweight, making it difficult to size the uterus).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In these situations, a sensitive urine pregnancy test or ultrasound scan might be helpful if it is readily available and affordable. If pregnancy testing is not available, counsel the client to use barrier methods or abstain from intercourse until her menses occurs or pregnancy is confirmed.</p>
                    <p>Specific examinations and tests that the provider might perform include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Breast examination</li>
                        <li>Pelvic and genital examination</li>
                        <li>Cervical cancer screening</li>
                        <li>Routine laboratory tests</li>
                        <li>Haemoglobin test</li>
                        <li>STI risk assessment: medical history and physical examination</li>
                        <li>STI/HIV screening: laboratory tests</li>
                        <li>Blood pressure screening</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Pelvic examination is seldom necessary except to rule out pregnancy of more than six weeks, measured from the Last Menstrual Period (LMP).</p>

                        <p>No contraceptive method with the exception of condoms (and the diaphragm to a lesser degree), provides protection against Genital Tract Infections (GTIs) and other STIs such as Hepatitis B or HIV/AIDS. During the counseling sessions, explain to all patients the risks of GTI and STI transmission.</p>
