                            with the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) for all FP methods reaching 46% in 2008. Use of
                            modern contraceptives among married women rose from 32% to 39% between 2003 and 2008. At

                        <p>Medical benefits differ depending on the target population. Some of the benefits of family
                            planning for women are;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Their health is better as they are protected against unwanted pregnancy, hence death
                                related to high risk pregnancy and abortion is reduced.</li>
                            <li>Some methods, such as the hormonal method, have additional (non-contraceptive) benefits,
                                including the reduction of anaemia and cancer of the genital tract.</li>
                            <li>Barrier methods minimize the transmission of STIs and HIV/AIDS if used properly.</li>
                            <li>Mothers become healthier as they avoid the extremes of maternal age and carry their
                                pregnancies within the optimal child bearing age bracket of 19 to 35 years, before and
                                after which the mothers are at high risk of developing complications related to
                                pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>There is a decrease in the risks of abortion as the baby is welcome and the mother well
                                prepared physically and psychologically for the pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>There are reduced fertility and mortality rates.</li>
                            <li>There are improved health facilities and death related to pregnancy and childbirth is
                                reduced.</li>

                        <p>There are also medical advantages to the children;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Children are healthier, since the optimum spacing between births is 27 to 38 months,
                                giving the mother the time to nurse and care for the infant.</li>
                            <li>The death related to infections and malnutrition to the under fives is reduced.</li>

                            <li>There is an improved relationship with the spouse and family due to less stress and
                                better social life.</li>
                            <li>Socially healthy families are productive and economically more stable as they
                                participate in community development and nation building.</li>
