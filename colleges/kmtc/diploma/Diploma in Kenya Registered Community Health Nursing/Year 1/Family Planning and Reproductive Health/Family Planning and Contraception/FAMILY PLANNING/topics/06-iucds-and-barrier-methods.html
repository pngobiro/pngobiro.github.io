                        <p>The IUCD is a flexible device that is inserted into the uterine cavity by a trained service
                            provider. It is a safe and highly effective, long-acting contraceptive method.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of IUCDs</h3>
                        <p>There are two broad categories of intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs): the
                            copper-based and the hormone-releasing devices.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MOA:</h3>
                        <p>These are plastic or medicated plastic objects designed in different shapes and forms which,
                            when inserted into the uterine cavity, prevent pregnancy.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>S</strong>permatozoa immobility as the movement is hindered.</li>
                            <li><strong>O</strong>vum motility increased in the fallopian tube so it reaches the uterus
                                prematurely.</li>
                            <li><strong>P</strong>rostaglandin produced in the uterine cavity aids in expulsion of the
                                zygote.</li>
                            <li><strong>I</strong>mplantation interfered with, as the IUCD occupies the space.</li>
                            <li><strong>E</strong>ndometrium: there is inflammatory process that is hostile for
                                implantation.</li>

                            <li>She may have increased cramps and bleeding for the first three months. Advise her to use
                                analgesics if pain is severe but reassure her that she will adjust with time. Ask her to
                                come to the clinic if pain and bleeding are excessive.</li>
                            <li>During menses, check pads before throwing them away to confirm the device has not been
                                expelled.</li>
                            <li>Check on IUCD threads once every month after menses while bathing.</li>
                            <li>The IUCD failure rate is 1%.</li>
                            <li>The first review will be at six months, then yearly when general physical examination
                                and Pap smear are done.</li>

                            <li>Any unusual bleeding or bad vaginal discharge could be indications of an infection.</li>
                            <li>A missed period or other signs of pregnancy and missing IUCD strings should also be

                            <li>Swab the os with antiseptic using the sponge forceps x three</li>
                            <li>Apply tenaculum at 10 to 2 o'clock to position the uterus</li>
                            <li>Sound the uterus gently to get the measurements of uterine size</li>
                            <li>Load the IUCD while inside the pack and measure per uterine sound results, unpack then,
                                without contamination, insert in situ gently as patient pants</li>
                            <li>Release wings by withdrawing the barrel, remove piston, position IUCD by pushing barrel
                                up again (CUT 380A)</li>
                            <li>Withdraw barrel and shorten thread</li>

                        <p>The mother should be prepared physically and psychologically and placed in dorsal position.
                            The procedure should then be conducted as follows:</p>

                            and textures. condoms help prevent both pregnancy and some STIs, including HIV/AIDS. Condom
                            types in the market include plain, flavoured, coloured, and spermicide-added condoms.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Condom must be inserted before sexual intercourse (although they can be inserted in
                                advance-as much as eight hours).</li>
                            <li>Female condoms are expensive.</li>
                            <li>A condom can be used only once-it cannot be reused</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Women Who Can Use the Female Condom</h4>
                        <p>All women of reproductive age of any parity, including nulliparous women, can use a female
                            condom. The female condom is appropriate in many circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Women who need to rule out possible pregnancy before proceeding with another method.
                            </li>
                            <li>Women who need a back-up method.</li>
                            <li>Women who need temporary methods of contraception.</li>

                                prevention, but are at a risk of acquiring an STI or HIV/AIDS (e.g., a woman who has
                                more than one partner, or a woman whose partner has more than one partner).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Women Who Should Not Use a Condom</h4>
                        <p>A woman who has one or more conditions that make pregnancy dangerous and needs a more
                            effective method of protection against pregnancy may want to consider other, less
                            client-dependant, methods of contraception</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">DIAPHRAGM</h3>
                        <p>This is a dome shaped rubber device with a flexible rim inserted into the vagina prior to
                            sexual intercourse to prevent conception by forming a barrier. It has to be removed six to
                            eight hours after intercourse. Diaphragms are of different sizes so as to fit well the
                            individual patient.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PRECAUTIONS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Efficacy is improved if used with spermicides</li>
                            <li>The patient should ensure that it fits well</li>
                            <li>There is a failure rate of 2-15%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CONTRAINDICATIONS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allergy to rubber</li>
                            <li>uterine prolapse</li>
                            <li>recurrent cystitis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>instruct the patient to remove the device six hours post intercourse and to ensure that it is
                            washed and kept dry.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">VAGINAL SPONGE</h3>
                        <p>This is a synthetic sponge impregnated with spermicides, which is inserted high into the
                            vagina. It is effective for up to 24 hours. People who have a vaginal infection or allergies
                            should not use it. The device remains in situ for six hours after intercourse, after which
                            it is removed and discarded. The main disadvantage of the vaginal sponge is that it is very
                            expensive.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SPERMICIDES</h3>
                        <p>These are usually supplied in the form of gels, aerosols, pessaries or foaming tablets, which
                            are inserted high into the vagina</p>
                        <p>Spermicides work in the following ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They kill spermatozoa and some organisms such as gonococcal bacteria and treponema
                                pallidum</li>
                            <li>They are usually applied on condoms and the diaphragm</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>They have a failure rate of 14-25%</p>
