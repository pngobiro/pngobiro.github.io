                        <p>Hormonal contraceptives are among the most widely used FP methods worldwide. In Kenya, nearly
                            75 percent of all women using modern contraceptives choose hormonal methods, with 32 percent
                            and 61 percent choosing the Pill and injectable contraceptives, respectively. They contain
                            synthetic hormones (a combination of oestrogen & progesterone or progesterone alone). Work
                            primarily by preventing ovulation and making the cervical mucous too thick for sperm
                            penetration.</p>
                        <p>The following hormonal methods are commonly available in Kenya:</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs) are made up of a combination of synthetic oestrogen and
                            progesterone hormones.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TYPES OF COCs</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Monophasic:</strong> which include microgynon, neogynon, eugynon and nordette,
                                contain equal strength of oestrogen and progestin</li>
                            <li><strong>Biphasic:</strong> contain two (diff dose combinations of oestrogen & progestin
                                eg in a cycle of 21 active pills, 10 pills may contain one combination while 11 contain
                                another eg biphasil, ovarion, normorvlar</li>
                            <li><strong>Triphasics:</strong> The active pills contain three different dose combinations
                                of oestrogen and progestin. Out of a cycle of 21 active pills, six might contain one
                                combination, five pills contain another combination, while 10 pills contain other
                                combinations of the same two hormones. Examples include Logynon and Trinordial.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MOA OF COCs</h3>
                        <p>COCs act in the following manner:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slow down the motility of the fallopian tubes thus delaying implantation</li>
                            <li>Delay or inhibit ovulation as the Follicle Stimulation Hormone (FSH) production is
                                suppressed, which inhibits maturation of ovarian follicles</li>
                            <li>Mucus is too thick to be penetrated by the sperm</li>
                            <li>Endometrium is not well prepared for fertilised ovum due to low oestrogen levels</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS OF COCS</h3>
                        <p>As a method of contraception, COCs have many benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>COCs are highly effective and are effective immediately when started within the first
                                five days of the menstrual cycle</li>
                            <li>COCs are safe for the majority of women.</li>
                            <li>COCs are easy to use.</li>
                            <li>COCs can be provided by trained non-clinical service providers.</li>
                            <li>A pelvic exam is not required to initiate use of COCs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">NON-CONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH BENEFITS</h3>
                        <p>COCs offer several non-contraceptive benefits, too:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduction of menstrual flow (lighter, shorter periods)</li>
                            <li>Decrease in dysmenorrhoea (painful periods)</li>
                            <li>Reduction of symptoms of endometriosis</li>
                            <li>Improvement and prevention of anaemia</li>
                            <li>Protection against ovarian and endometrial cancer</li>
                            <li>Possible protection from symptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease</li>
                            <li>Treatment for acne and hirsutism</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LIMITATIONS OF COCS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The effect is lowered by other drugs, such as anti-tuberculosis and anti-epileptic drugs
                            </li>
                            <li>There can be serious side effects though these are rare (for example, stroke, myocardial
                                infarction, venous thrombosis and adenomas)</li>
                            <li>They offer no protection against STIs</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>POPs are pills that contain low doses of synthetic progestin. They do not suppress production
                            of breast milk.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MOA</h3>
                        <p>POPs prevent pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus, which prevents the passage of sperm,
                            and suppressing ovulation in about 50 percent of cycles.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of POPs</h3>
                        <p>The brands commonly available in the public sector and the local market include Microlut,
                            Micronor, Microval, Ovrette, Norgeston, and Noriday.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS OF POPS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are highly effective & safe (POPs have no known health risks).</li>
                            <li>Women return to fertility immediately upon discontinuation.</li>
                            <li>A pelvic exam is not required to initiate use.</li>
                            <li>They can be given to a woman at any time to start later. If pregnancy cannot be ruled
                                out, a provider can give her pills to take later, when her monthly bleeding begins.</li>
                            <li>Taking POPs does not affect milk production or breastfeeding.</li>
                            <li>It is safe for breastfeeding women and their babies.</li>
                            <li>POPs add to the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. Together, they provide effective
                                pregnancy protection. Typically, pills lengthen the time during which breastfeeding
                                women have no monthly bleeding.</li>
                            <li>Taking POPs does not increase blood clotting.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">NON-CONTRACEPTIVE BENEFITS</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not affect breast feeding</li>
                            <li>Lighter, shorter periods</li>
                            <li>Decrease in breast tenderness</li>

                            <li>They require strict daily pill-taking, preferably at the same time each day.</li>
                            <li>They do not protect against STIs, including hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, at-risk
                                individuals should use a barrier method to ensure protection against STIs and HIV/AIDS.
                            </li>
                            <li>They may lower effectiveness when certain drugs are taken concurrently (e.g., certain

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Description</h3>
                        <p>Emergency contraception (EC) refers to the use of certain contraceptive methods by women to
                            prevent pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse. Hormonal ECPs must be taken within
                            <strong>120 hours (5days)</strong> of intercourse, however, the sooner they are taken, the
                            more effective they are. ECPs provide a second chance for preventing pregnancy after
                            unprotected sex, either accidental, coerced sex or rape. Depending on the regimen used and
                            number of hours passed since unprotected intercourse, ECPs seem to prevent between 75-95
                            percent of pregnancies that would otherwise have occurred. The average chance of pregnancy
                            resulting from one act of unprotected intercourse in the second or third week of the
                            menstrual cycle is estimated at 8 percent; after emergency oral contraception, it is 1-2
                            percent.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>NOTE:</h4>
                            <p>The E-pill should not be used on a regular basis (from month to month) because it is less
                                effective than other methods. ECPs do not work once a woman is pregnant-women and girls
                                who are already pregnant should not take ECPs!</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MOA</h3>
                        <p>ECPs work in various ways to prevent pregnancy, largely depending on the time in a woman's
                            cycle when she has sexual intercourse. ECPs do not cause abortion because they work before
                            implantation. Thus ECPs prevent pregnancy by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preventing or delaying ovulation</li>
                            <li>Inhibiting or slowing down transportation of the egg and sperm through the fallopian
                                tubes, which prevents fertilization and implantation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The success of EC depends on the awareness and knowledge of its availability and efficacy
                            prior to an unprotected, unplanned act. The method is only effective if potential users are
                            aware of the method by prior information and counseling.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of ECPs and Dosage</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Combined Oral Contraceptives (Yuzpe Method)</h4>
                        <p>These contain the hormones oestrogen and progestin, and they prevent about 75 percent of
                            expected pregnancies. Two standard dosage options are available:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>50 mcg oestrogen pills (e.g., Eugynon): Two tablets to be taken as soon as possible
                                after unprotected intercourse, but within 120 hours. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A
                                total of four pills are required.</li>
                            <li>30 mcg oestrogen pills (e.g., Microgynon): Four tablets to be taken as soon as possible
                                after unprotected intercourse, but within 120 hours. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A
                                total of eight pills are required.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Progestin-only Oral Contraceptives</h4>
                        <p>These dedicated ECPs contain the same progestin hormone (levonorgestrel) as some other
                            progestin-only pills, although in higher doses. They are more effective than the combined
                            pills, preventing up to 95 percent of expected pregnancies. Examples of brands of dedicated
                            ECPs that are available in Kenya are Postinor 2, Pregnon, Smart lady, ECee2, and Truston2.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>THE STANDARD DOSAGE IS AS FOLLOWS:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One 750 mcg levonorgestrel pill to be taken as soon as possible after unprotected
                                intercourse, but within 120 hours. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A total of two
                                pills are required; or</li>
                            <li>Two 750 mcg levonorgestrel pills to be taken as a single dose as soon as possible after
                                unprotected intercourse, but within 120 hours. This regimen is to be preferred because
                                it easier to comply with the one-dose regimen compared to the two-dose regimen</li>
                            <li>Regular progestin-only pill (POP) may be used: 20 tablets taken within 120 hours after
                                unprotected intercourse. Repeat the same dose in 12 hours. A total of
                                <strong>40</strong> pills are required.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Advantages and Benefits of ECPs</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is safe, effective, and easy to use.</li>
                            <li>No medical examination or pregnancy tests are necessary or required.</li>
                            <li>It can be used at any time during the menstrual cycle.</li>
                            <li>ECPs are available in government, private, and NGO health facilities; and over the
                                counter at pharmacies.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Limitations and Side Effects of ECPs</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ECPs are only effective if used within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse.</li>
                            <li>They are not to be used as a regular method.</li>
                            <li>ECPs do not protect against STIs, HIV, or AIDS.</li>
                            <li>They can cause nausea (more common for the COC regimen).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">INDICATIONS FOR USE OF ECPS</h3>
                        <p>Any woman can use ECPs, however emergency oral contraception should not be used in place of
                            regular FP methods. Therefore, it should be used only in emergency situations such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sex took place without contraception, and the woman wants to avoid pregnancy.</li>
                            <li>A woman has run out of oral contraceptives, has missed two or more POPs, or is more than
                                four weeks late for her DMPA injection, and has had unprotected intercourse.</li>
                            <li>A woman has had coerced sexual intercourse, such as rape.</li>
                            <li>A condom has broken.</li>
                            <li>An IUCD has come out of place.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Women who can use ECPs with some precautions (category 2)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Women with a history of severe cardiovascular complications (e.g. CVA or other
                                thromboembolic conditions)</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Method Prescription and Use</h3>
                        <p>EC pills should be started as soon as possible, but within 120 hours of unprotected sex. The
                            sooner ECPs are used after unprotected intercourse, the more effective they are in
                            preventing pregnancy.</p>

                            <li><strong>Can ECPs protect me for the rest of the cycle?</strong>
                                <p>It will not, and any further unprotected acts put the woman at risk. Women should use
                                    a regular method of FP or condoms for further protection.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>When can I resume or start a regular FP method after taking EC?</strong>
                                <p>A woman can resume or start method, such as pills or condoms, immediately. She has to
                                    wait until her next period to begin using injections, IUCDs, and implants.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Can I use ECPs every time I have unprotected sex?</strong>
                                <p>Women and girls should not use ECPs as a regular method. ECPs should be used only in
                                    emergency situations. ECPs are less effective than many regular FP methods.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>What if I had sex multiple times before taking ECPs?</strong>
                                <p>A woman can still use ECPs if the last time she had sex was within five days. If a
                                    woman is already pregnant from an earlier act of unprotected sex, the ECPs will not
                                    have any effect.</p>
