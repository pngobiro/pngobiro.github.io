                        <p>This is the consecutive cyclic occurrence of a series of physiological changes directly
                            related to the development, regression and shedding of the endometrium under various
                            hormonal changes.</p>
                        <p>If ovulation takes place and the egg isn't fertilized, the lining of the uterus sheds through
                            the vagina. This is a menstrual period. The menstrual cycle consists of three phases.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. THE MENSTRUAL PHASE</h3>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Generally dwells for an average of 3-5days though 2-7days is also considered normal.
                            </li>
                            <li>The average blood loss ranges between 50-150mls.</li>
                            <li>It should not be in clots, or capable of clotting, because of presence of plasmin
                                enzymes from the endometrium.</li>
                            <li>The loss consists of endometrial shed, blood from torn capillaries and the dead
                                unfertilized ovum/oocytes.</li>
                            <li>Physiologically, it is the last phase.</li>
                            <li>Follicle stimulating hormone release inhibitor (FSHRI) from hypothalamus is responsible
                                for this phase.</li>
                            <li>It influences the anterior pituitary gland (adenohypophysis) to stop secreting
                                Luteinizing hormone.</li>

                            <li>This phase follows menstruation and occurs simultaneously with the follicular phase of
                                the ovarian cycle.</li>
                            <li>Last for about 10 days from the end of menses until ovulation occurs.</li>
                            <li>The phase is highly influenced by oestradiol and other oestrogens.</li>
                            <li>This hormone is secreted by the graafian follicle under the stimulation of follicle
                                stimulating.</li>

                            <li><strong>FUNCTIONAL LAYER</strong>

                                    <li>Lies on top of the basal layer and it is approximately 2.5 mm thick.</li>
                                    <li>It is highly influenced by ovarian hormones.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li>It is the uppermost layer.</li>
                                    <li>Covers the functional layer and dips down to line the tubular glands in the
                                        previous layer.</li>
                                </ul>

                        </ol>
                        <p>In the ovary the dominant follicle ruptures releasing the ovum, and process is collectively
                            referred to as OVULATION. This marks the end of the phase.</p>

                            <p>As the endometrium regrows, the graafian follicle is steadily maturing. Some women
                                experience a sharp abdominal pain on the side of the specific ovary and the pain is
                                known as Mittelschmerz. It results from irritation of the peritoneal cavity by the small
                                amount of blood loss which collects there. The empty shell following ovulation is
                                referred to as corpus luteum (yellow body).</p>

                            <li>The luteinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary gland, influences the corpus luteum
                                to secrete progesterone and oestrogen hormones.</li>
                            <li>The functional layer, increases in thickness to about 3.5 mm .</li>
                            <li>It becomes spongy in appearance since the glands are more tortuous.</li>
                            <li>Blood supply is increased and nutritive secretions e.g. glycogen, are available.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Two Day Method (TDM)</h4>
                        <p>It is a simple symptom-based method by which women check for the presence or absence of
                            cervical secretions as the sign of fertility. If cervical secretions are seen, then the
                            woman is in her fertile phase and should abstain from unprotected sex.</p>
                        <p>TDM is 96% effective when used correctly and 86% effective with typical use. When doing TDM
                            counseling, women are not taught to distinguish normal cervical secretions from abnormal
                            secretions on purpose. However users of this method are advised to consult a health
                            professional in case they notice secretions for more than 14 days.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Billings Ovulation Method (BOM)</h4>
                        <p>In this method, the days of infertility, possible fertility, and maximum fertility of the
                            menstrual cycle are defined by observation of changes in the cervical mucus. The client
                            should be taught to apply the method rules appropriately.</p>
                        <p>To use this method correctly the woman should:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Avoid sex on days of monthly bleeding</li>
                            <li>Avoid sex as soon as she notices any secretions</li>
                            <li>Recognize evidence of ovulation (Peak day), when the mucus is very clear, stretchy
                                (spinnberkeit's sign) and slippery</li>
                            <li>Continue to avoid sex for 3 more days after peak day</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The couple can resume sex on the 4th day after.</p>

                            <li>Accept that BOM can be used even in the absence of ovulation</li>
                            <li>Users should observe strictly and chart the cervical mucus</li>
                            <li>Should understand the difference between fertility and cervical mucus</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Basal Body Temperature (BBT)</h4>
                        <p>In this method, the woman is instructed to take her temperature either orally, rectally, or
                            vaginally for five minutes each morning before getting out of bed and before eating
                            anything. The temp is taken at complete bed rest at the same time with the same thermometer
                            by the same route for the entire cycle.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Steps in BBT</h4>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Replace in it's container and safe near your reach.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The woman must be taught how to read a thermometer, how to enter her daily temperature on a
                            special chart, and how to observe a rise in her temperature (0.2°C-0.5°C) which occurs
                            during ovulation.</p>
                        <p><strong>NB:</strong> The woman temp rises by 0.2°C to 0.5°C around the time of ovulation. The
                            couple avoids sex from the first day of monthly bleeding until three days after the woman's
                            temp has rising above her regular temperature.</p>

                        <p>The woman identifies the fertile time by observing the characteristics of the cervical mucus.
