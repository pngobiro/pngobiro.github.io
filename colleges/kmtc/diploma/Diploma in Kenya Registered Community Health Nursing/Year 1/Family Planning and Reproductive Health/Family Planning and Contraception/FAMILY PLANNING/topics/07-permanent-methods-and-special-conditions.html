                            are intended to provide permanent contraception. Special care must be taken to assure that
                            every client who chooses this method does so voluntarily and is fully informed about the
                            permanence of this method and the availability of alternative, long-acting, highly effective

                            <p>Sterilisation does not protect against STIs, including hepatitis B and HIV/AIDS. If the
                                client is at risk of contracting one of these, the correct use of condoms is recommended

                            <li><strong>Accept (Category A):</strong> There is no medical reason to deny sterilization
                                to a person with this condition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Caution (Category C):</strong> The procedure is normally conducted in a routine
                                setting, but with extra preparation and precautions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Delay (Category D):</strong> The procedure is delayed until the condition is
                                evaluated and corrected if need be. Alternative temporary methods of contraception
                                should be provided.</li>
                            <li><strong>Special (Category S):</strong> The procedure should be undertaken in a setting
                                with an experienced surgeon and staff, equipment needed to provide general anaesthesia,
                                and other back-up medical support. For these conditions, the provider must be able to
                                decide on the most appropriate procedure and anaesthesia regimen. Alternative temporary
                                methods of contraception should be provided if referral is required or there is
                                otherwise any delay.</li>

                        <p>A Bilateral Tubal Ligation (BTL) is a minor surgical procedure that involves blocking the
                            fallopian tubes to prevent the ovum from being fertilized. It can be done by cutting,
                            burning or removing sections of the fallopian tubes or by placing clips on each tube. In
                            Kenya, nearly 14% of users of modern methods of contraception rely on female sterilization.

                        <p>TL is a highly effective, immediate, and safe form of contraception that offers the following
                            benefits:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>TL does not change sexual function and does not interfere with intercourse.</li>
                            <li>TL is permanent.</li>
                            <li>TL has few known side effects</li>
                            <li>TL does not affect breastfeeding.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Other Benefits</h4>
                        <p>Women who have TLs have a decreased risk of getting ovarian cancer and have a possible
                            decreased risk of PID.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LIMITATIONS & SIDE EFFECTS OF BTL</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The procedure is generally irreversible and expensive. The success of reversal surgery
                                cannot be guaranteed.</li>
                            <li>There are risks and side effects associated with anaesthesia</li>
                            <li>Risks related to surgical procedure such as bleeding, haematoma or infection</li>
                            <li>The method does not protect against STIs, HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B.</li>
                            <li>In rare cases when pregnancy occurs, it is more likely to be ectopic</li>
                            <li>Only a trained provider can perform the procedure</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">WOMEN WHO SHOULD NOT USE TL</h3>
                        <p>Providers should not perform TL on certain women:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Women who are uncertain of their desire for future fertility</li>
                            <li>Women who cannot withstand surgery</li>
                            <li>Women or girls who do not give voluntary informed consent</li>

                        <p>Vasectomy, or male sterilization, is the surgical process of cutting and tying the vas
                            deferens in order to prevent spermatozoa from mixing with semen. Consequently, when
                            ejaculation occurs, the semen will not have any sperms. The operation is performed under a
                            local anaesthetic, and it is one of the most effective methods of contraception-it has a
                            reported failure rate of about 0.1 percent. The option of a vasectomy would be a good

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Correcting myths and misconceptions about vasectomy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vasectomy is not synonymous with castration, and it does not affect a man's sexual
                                ability or desire.</li>
                            <li>A vasectomy does not become effective immediately. The client should be instructed to
                                use condoms or another FP method for three months after the operation to be completely
                                safe.</li>
                            <li>Reversal surgery cannot be assured. Thorough and careful counselling is needed before
                                making a decision in order to avoid future regret. The procedure must be considered
                                permanent</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of Vasectomy</h3>
                        <p>There are scalpel and non-scalpel vasectomy techniques. A vasectomy is recommended when the
                            family has reached the desired family size, the wife has contra indicated to surgical
                            procedure and male participation is promoted.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CONTRAINDICATIONS:</h3>
                        <p>the procedure is contra indicated in the following circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A large hydrocele</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The procedure is highly effective and safe.</li>
                            <li>There is no change in sexual function-the procedure does not interfere with sexual
                                intercourse.</li>
                            <li>It is permanent.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Limitations and Risks</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The procedure is virtually irreversible (i.e., success of reversal surgery cannot be
                                guaranteed).</li>
                            <li>There are minimal risks and side effects of local anaesthesia.</li>
                            <li>There are risks associated with surgical procedures.</li>
                            <li>A vasectomy does not protect against STIs, including HIV/AIDS.</li>
                            <li>Only a trained provider can offer a vasectomy.</li>
                            <li>There is a delay in effectiveness after the procedure has been performed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Client instructions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Advise the patient to rest for two days and avoid heavy lifting for five to seven days.
                            </li>
                            <li>A scrotal support should be used.</li>
                            <li>The vasectomy is not effective immediately. The semen has sperms for three to four
                                months, therefore requiring ten to fifteen ejaculations to be free from semen. The
                                barrier method can be used for protection meanwhile.</li>
                            <li>Vasectomy has a failure rate of 0.3%</li>
