* Barrier methods minimize the transmission of STIs and HIV/AIDS if used properly.
$\Leftrightarrow$ Mothers become healthier as they avoid the extremes of maternal age and carry their pregnancies within the child bearing bracket of 19-35yrs before and after which the mothers are at high risks of developing complication related to pregnancy.
$\star$ It decreases the risks of abortions as the baby and the mother will be prepared physical and psychological for the pregnancy.
* It reduces mortality rate.

\section*{To children:-}

i. Counseling is an important condition for initiation and continuation of family planning method.
- In counseling it involves the method, side effects, mode of action, advantages and disadvantages.
ii. Service providers must keep in mind that only condoms provide protection of STI and HIV/AIDS.

\section*{Movement of supplies and information through the distribution system}
- Supplies move from the medical supply coordinating unit in Nairobi which is the central stores
- It moves directly to the county stores from Nairobi stores
- From county stores to service delivery points

\section*{Information flow}
- Information is needed back to the HQ for planning purposes
- The information is two-way-traffic
- Information must be accurate
- Must be legible
- Must be timely

\section*{System for distribution of contraceptives}

Push system - quantity of contraceptives to be distributed is determine by a higher level personnel
Pull system - when a service delivery point places the order for contraceptives and they get the supplies

\section*{When to use a push system}
- When the information about the consumption of contraceptive is available and reliable
- If managers are able to process information
- When there is a greater demand than the supplies and therefore the supplies are to be rationed
- When the staff at the service delivery point lack management skills to make logistic decision

\section*{When to use pull system}
- When data processing at the central level is limited
- When the stuff at the service delivery point have management skills to make logistic decision
- When there is good supervision

NB it is the duty of the manager at the service provider to determine the minimum and maximum stock to avoid over loading

\section*{How to access for the quantity of contraceptives at hand}

Done by counting/ conducting a physical inventory (counting all the contraceptives by name/ brand)

\section*{Purpose of physical inventory}
- To identify differences between the actual supplies and what is recorded in the pin card
- To detect any supplies that are about to expire or expired and count them by brand
- To determine the stock you have in hand before placing an order

\section*{When to conduct a physical inventory}
- Before writing a quarterly report (after 3 months)
- When you receive new contraceptives
- Arrange the contraceptives in FEFO system (First Expiry First Out)
- Separate the expired but do not destroy them
- We need to know how to calculate for the Average Monthly Consumption Rate.

\section*{How to calculate the AMCR}

Take the 1st 3 months of contraceptives by brand and divide by 3
Before placing an order, determine the minimum quantity level and maximum at your service provider

Maximum quantity level The amount of contraceptive by brand which the service delivery stock should not go beyond
Minimum quantity level The amount of contraceptive by brand which the service delivery stock should not go below

\section*{How to calculate maximum stock}

Know the maximum months of supply - the months of months a service provider can stock the contraceptive (6 months)
Max = Average monthly contraceptive x 6 months

Min = Average monthly contraceptive $\times 3$ months
