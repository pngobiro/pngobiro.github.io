It encompasses the healthcare dimensions of family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience in most cases and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in other cases.

                         <p>Maternal and child health (MCH) care is the health service provided to mothers (women in their child bearing age) and children. The targets for MCH are all women in their reproductive age groups, i.e., 15-49 years of age, children, school age population and adolescents. Throughout the world, especially in the developing countries, there is an increasing concern and interest in maternal and child health care.</p>
                         <p>This commitment towards MCH care gains further strength after the World Summit for Children, 1991, which gave serious consideration and outlined major areas to be addressed in the provision of Maternal and Child Health Care services.</p>

                         </ol>
                         <p>We will now look at nutrients that are important for the optimal health of both the mother and the baby (during and after pregnancy), and whose stores should be boosted before conception.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) Folic acid</h4>
                         <p>It is recommended that women of reproductive age obtain 400 micrograms ( 0.4 milligrams) of folate or folic acid daily. Folic acid works closely with vitamin B12 and is required for the enzymes that produce DNA for replicating and growing cells, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, blood, and growing fetus.</p>
                         <p>It is known to help reduce the risk of birth defects of the brain and spinal cord (neural tube defects). The most common neural tube defect being spina bifida (where the vertebrae do not fuse together properly, leaving the spinal cord exposed), which could result in varying degrees of paralysis, incontinence, and mental retardation.</p>
                         <p>In addition, it helps reduce the likelihood of recurrent miscarriage, preterm delivery and low birth weight babies.</p>
                         <p>Folic acid is most beneficial in the first month after conception, as this is when most neural tube defects occur. It is important to remember that many women usually do not realize they are pregnant in the first month.</p>
                         <p>Moreover, many pregnancies are unplanned. Folic acid intake should therefore begin prior to conception and continue through pregnancy. Better still, all women should take multivitamins, where folic acid is included.</p>
                         <p>Foods rich in folic acid include legumes, peas, grain products and cereals, nuts, fruits and dark green leafy vegetables. Even if a woman's diet is composed of plenty of foods with folate, only about 50 per cent of this is available to the body, while the vitamin form is 100 per cent available. Cooking also sometimes reduces the nutrient density in food. Some drugs (e.g aspirin and oral contraceptives) interfere with the absorption and metabolism of folate. Supplementation is thus important. A prenatal supplement however, does not replace a healthy diet.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Consequences of maternal folic acid deficiency</h4>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text">Impaired cell division</span></li>

                         </ul>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">j) Iron</h4>
                         <p>Iron intake is also vital for pregnancy. Before becoming pregnant, a woman will benefit from boosting her iron stores. Many women have low iron stores because of the monthly menstruation and diets low in iron.</p>
                         <p>Building iron stores helps prepare a woman's body for the needs of the foetus during pregnancy. Non-vegetarian women who are not pregnant need 18 mg of iron a day. Vegetarians need even more, about 30 mg per day.</p>
                         <p>Good quality sources of iron that can be incorporate into the diet include meats, poultry, fish, leafy Greens and iron enriched grains and products such as cereals and rice. Iron in plant foods is not usually well absorbed, so women should add a source of vitamin C such as oranges or an animal protein, to enhance the absorption of the iron in plants.</p>
                         <p>Iron supplementation can help prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia, and boost the iron stores of a woman who is planning to get pregnant. Iron deficiency is the number one nutrient deficiency among women and should therefore be taken seriously.</p>

                         <p>Iodine is a nutrient required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones which are required for the regulation of cell metabolism throughout life. The thyroid hormones ensure normal growth, especially of the brain, which occurs from foetal life to the end of the third year after birth. Promotion of iodized salt for use by the entire family and encouraging consumption of foods rich in iodine (fish and seafood) is important.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">l) Calcium</h4>
                         <p>Between 1000 mg to 1200 mg of calcium should be obtained by a woman every day before conceiving. This may be accomplished by eating three or more servings of calcium rich foods per day including dairy products and dark leafy vegetables.</p>
                         <p>Like iron, many women fall short on this nutrient. If there is inadequate calcium in pregnancy, the foetus may draw calcium from the mother's bones, which can put her at risk for osteoporosis later in life. If a woman is not taking in enough calcium in the diet, she should take a supplement.</p>
