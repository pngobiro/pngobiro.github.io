                         <p>Infant mortality reflects the general health status of the population to a considerable degree because so many of the environmental factors affecting the health of pregnant women and the new-borns also affect the rest of the population.</p>
                         <p>The first year particularly the first six months is the most critical period of development in a child's life. Although the rapid growth that occurs at prenatal and during infancy slows in childhood and later picks up in adolescence, developmental changes are rapid.</p>
                         <p>Nutrition plays a key role in the process of growth and development. The full potential of heredity will be realized only through good nutrition and health, along with a nurturing and supportive environment.</p>

                         <p>The assessment of growth and development is very helpful in finding out the state of health and nutrition of a child.</p>
                         <p>Abnormal growth or growth failure is a symptom of disease. Hence, measurement of growth is an essential component of the physical examination.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.4.1 Physical Development</h4>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">During Infancy (0-2yrs)</h5>
                         <p>This describes both physical and psychomotor development, at this stage physical development is rapid, generally neonate is 18-20 inches long & 3 kgs in weight in one year time the baby is about 3 times that, at birth brain is <span class="math-inline">$1 / 4$</span> of its final weight.</p>
                         <p>At birth upper part of the body is well developed while lower part fully develops after birth at accelerated rate. During first two months a baby shows postural changes, sits at 7 months, creeps at 10 months, stands at 13 months & walks at 15 months. Teeth appear at 6 months.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Early childhood (2-7 years)</h5>
                         <p>Rate of growth is slow in comparison to infancy stage, there is increase in weight of 3-5 pounds/year, at 6 years head is 90% adult size and child is 109-114 cm tall weighing at 16-20 kgs, at this stage hands and feet grow bigger in conjunction with muscles, fine motor and gross motor skills are fully developed for the child can write, draw, run, jump, dance etc. at this stage children acquire gender identity with environment being the major factor.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Late childhood (6-12 years)</h5>
                         <p>Arms & legs grow faster than trunk making child appear tall and thin, milk teeth are lost and permanent teeth start appearing, sense organs, muscles and brains are more or less mature, at 12 child is almost 140 cm in height with boys being taller than girls, sex differences start appearing, and there is increase in speed, strength and coordination needed for motor skills this increases precision in athletic ability, climbing etc.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Adolescence stage (12-21 years)</h5>
                         <p>At early stages most children experience growth spurt, a rapid increase in weight and height, it usually lasts 2 years where boys gain 8-9 inches in height and girls 6-7 inches in height, by age of 17 (girls) and 18 (boys) most have reached 98% final height. Sex differences become apparent at this stage, sex glands start secreting resulting in appearance of primary and secondary sex characteristics, hormonal changes increase sexual drive, and capacity to develop heterosexual relationships and true intimacy increases at later stages.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.4.2 Mental development</h4>
                         <p>It refers to the ability of observing, perceiving, remembering, imagining, thinking, solving problems and growth of IQ as well as language.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Infancy (sensory motor stage)</h5>
                         <p>At this stage infant is able to react to external stimuli like sound, light and temperature. Perpetual skills develop in first year, at this stage child can imitate, discriminate and recognize to certain extend, this stage is also known as sensory motor stage for infant seeks physical satisfaction based upon immediate sensory experience.</p>
                         <p>By 1 year child has vocabulary of one or two words and can respond to simple questions and requests, and gradually acquires sense of form, shape, size and color thus they are able to recognize known and unknown persons. At this stage learning is through imitation, manipulation and play, they are unable to distinguish facts from fiction, they are also highly inquisitive and can ask embarrassing questions.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Early childhood (preoperational stage)</h5>
                         <p>This is stage at there is increased contact with environment through exploration, child develops general intelligence, perception, memory, learning, problem solving and language, they often ask why? of everything. Child has little understanding of operations, particularly in understanding reversibility of operations for example if water from broad glass is poured into narrow glass a child will assume there is more water in narrow glass than broad glass.</p>

                         <p>Mental development is rapid at this stage. Child becomes more inquisitive which indicates his thinking capacity. Thinking and imagination takes active form in this stage. child is able to establish cause and effect relationship. Child develops better concepts of length, distance, time, area and volume, this is because abilities of understanding, reasoning, memory, attention, and discrimination develop to a great extent, thus child is interested in performing creative and productive work.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Adolescence (stage of formal operations)</h5>
                         <p>At this stage adolescence attains intellectual and emotional maturity, this is due to interaction between maturation, experience, education and training. Memory and imagination increase to considerable extent, they are also able to concentrate on activity for longer period of time and are also able to make decisions for at this stage they are able to think beyond their own immediate world. They use logic to approach their problems and solve them, they also take interest in scientific pursuits by the end of this stage they have complete mental preparation for fullyfledged adult life.</p>

                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Infancy</h5>
                         <p>Immediately after birth neonates are able to display distinct emotions, they are diffuse and gross thus they cannot show specific emotions like anger, fear and love but by the end of this stage emotions are marked. After few weeks baby is able to smile and gurgle to give expression of pleasure and contentment. By three months general excitement is differentiated into distress. Jealousy starts at 18 months, between 18-24 months joy further differentiates from elation to joy and affection.by three years child can express fear, distress, anger, joy and affection.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Early childhood stage</h5>
                         <p>As children grow emotion expressions get refined, becoming more definite and intense (love, fear and dislikes), previously violent reactions are now in subdued form, at first fear is general rather than specific but as they grow older fear responses become specific, they also show jealousy towards others who have things they do not possess.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Later childhood</h5>
                         <p>Emotional behaviour at this stage is guided by rational expressions, they experience intense emotional feelings of love, hate and fear which lasts for long period of time, but they are able to control their emotions, emotions of wonder dominate children and if something goes against their emotions they show anger.</p>
                         <p>At 10 they become obedient and friendly, fear is less common and when angry they don't kick things but instead express anger by sarcasm, sneers, abuses and belittling remarks. joy, pleasure, love, curiosity, grief and affection appear at this stage.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Adolescence</h5>
                         <p>This stage is marked with heightened emotionality due to change of roles in home school and society and also unfavourable relations at home. This is because parents and teachers do not prepare them for adolescence. When they become adolescence society expects them to behave like adults yet they are not yet physically or intellectually mature. Due to increased sex drive and attraction to opposite sex and their lack of knowledge on how to behave or make friendship with opposite sex results in increased emotional tensions. They are always in conflict with adults who fail to understand them. Vocational and school failures also cause emotional disturbances.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.5.1 Weight</h4>
                         <p>For measuring the weight, a beam balance or spring balance is used. Before weighing a child, check the weighing scale to ensure it is working properly. You can do this by weighing a known weight and noting whether the scale has obtained the same weight.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.5.2 Measuring the Head Circumference</h4>
                         <p>The head circumference is measured by encircling the head with a stretchable tape measure, or a piece of string in the absence of a tape measure. This is passed over the most prominent part of the occiput posteriorly and just above the supraorbital ridges anteriorly to obtain the greatest distance around the head. The piece of string used in the absence of a tape measure is then measured with a ruler to obtain the head circumference.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.5.3 Measuring the mid upper arm circumference (MUAC)</h4>
                         <p>The mid upper arm circumference is measured using a tape or string in the absence of a tape. The tape or string is placed around the upper arm, midway between the olecranon and acromion processes. Care is taken not to pull the tape or string too tightly. The measurement is read. The string used in the absence of a tape measures is then measured with a ruler to obtain the mid upper arm circumference.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.5.4 Length</h4>
                         <p>The length of a child is measured in the first 3 years and the height is measured after 3 years of age. The length is measured using a horizontal measuring board put on the ground or on a table. The child is laid on his back with the head against the fixed head board.</p>
                         <p>A helper holds the child's head so that the eye angle- external ear canal line is vertical and also keeps the body straight. With one hand of the health worker, the child's knees are pressed down to straighten the child's legs fully while, with the other hand, the sliding foot board is placed to touch the child's heels firmly. With the foot board in place, the child's length is read on the metre scale.</p>
                         <p>To measure the height, a bare foot child stands with the feet together. The heels, the buttocks and the occiput lightly touch the measuring device. The head is aligned so that that the external eye angle- external ear canal plane is horizontal.</p>
                         <p>The child is told to stand tall and is gently stretched upward by pressure on the mastoid processes with the shoulders relaxed. The sliding head piece is lowered to rest firmly on the head. The height is read and recorded.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.5.5. Average growth measurements of normal children.</h4>
                         <p>An average term newborn weighs 3.5 kg (range <span class="math-inline">$2.5 \mathrm{~kg}-4.6 \mathrm{~kg}$</span>). The birth weight must be plotted in the first box of the growth chart and recorded in the appropriate space on the growth chart. The birth month should be written in the first box of the growth chart. Within the first <span class="math-inline">$3-4$</span> days, a term newborn loses <span class="math-inline">$5-10 \%$</span> of the birth weight. This weight loss is usually regained in 2 weeks by term babies and longer by premature babies. An average term baby doubles the birth weight in 4-6 months, triples it by one year and quadruples it by two years of age.</p>

                         <p>To monitor growth, you must use the growth chart on the back of the child health card. You need to study a blank growth chart to be thoroughly familiar with its contents.
(To start with, note: the top line represents the average growth line of healthy boys and the bottom line is the 3rd percentile for girls (the lower limit of normal weight-for-age of healthy girls).</p>
                         <p>To determine an individual child's growth pattern, weight measurements from birth are plotted on the growth chart of the child health card.</p>

                         <p>A constantly upward curve parallel to the printed lines shows good growth. You should inform the mother or caretaker that the child is growing well and praise her for her good efforts. By looking at the direction of the child's growth curve, the health worker and the mother can see at a glance whether the child is gaining weight appropriately or not. Let us briefly look at how to interpret a child's growth curve or pattern.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Interpretation of the growth curve</h4>
                         <p>It is important to know how to interpret the individual child's Growth Curve or pattern on the Child Health Card. Interpretation simply means determining whether the child is growing appropriately or not. The interpretation is done by watching the direction of the child's growth pattern. The direction of the growth curve indicates how the child is growing.</p>
                         <p>The weight growth pattern of the larger term infants will be above the pattern of the average term infant. On the other hand, the weight growth pattern of the smaller term infants will be below the pattern of the average term infant. A small baby whose growth pattern is below the bottom line in the growth chart is healthy if that child's growth pattern is parallel to the bottom percentile line. As long as the baby is gaining weight, however, at an acceptable rate, the mother should not worry</p>
                         <p>A horizontal (flat) growth curve means DANGER! It means the child is not growing and is a sign of disease, especially malnutrition. A child who is malnourished cannot grow properly, cannot resist diseases, and is in danger of getting killer diseases. You should take a thorough history from the mother to establish the cause of growth failure and then advise the mother. You should also encourage the mother to give the child food containing enough calories, protein, vitamins and minerals.</p>
                         <p>A curve deviating downwards, indicates a VERY DANGEROUS situation. The child is losing weight. The child needs extra care immediately. The baby may be suffering from malnutrition, tuberculosis, AIDS or other medical conditions. The mother is advised to take the baby to hospital for investigations and treatment.</p>
                         <p>Any infant who does not gain weight for one month or a child who does not gain weight for two months should receive urgent attention. Such an infant or child is becoming malnourished.</p>
                         <p>You should record important events that affect the child's growth above the curve in the Growth Chart. Such events include diseases, weaning, introduction of solids and stopping of breastfeeding.</p>

                         <p>At the bottom of the Growth Chart there is a box that lists some of the factors that may make a child particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. A tick or mark should be made next to any of the reasons that apply. This will then remind you to be particularly alert to any signs of growth faltering and may suggest the reasons for poor growth.</p>
                         <p>You can then plan how best to help this particular child. Note that regular weighing of infants (monthly) and young children (at least once every two months) will help you to detect growth failure and prevent malnutrition.</p>
                         <p>Such growth monitoring should be continued up to the age of 5 years as a component of well child care. Encourage parents to have their children weighed and avoid keeping them waiting for too long. You must always report the findings to the mother or caretaker and inform her how the child is growing.</p>
                         <p>Do you have a child who is under five years of age? Do you weigh him regularly? You should encourage parents to monitor their children's growth and development in the first 5 years. But first and foremost, you should serve as a good example.</p>

                         <p>The head circumference grows most rapidly in the first year: 2 cm monthly in the first 3 months, 3 cm during the next 3 months, and 3 cm in the last 6 months. This means that the average head circumference is 44 cm at 6 months and 47 cm at 12 months of age. Thus, the head circumference grows by 12 Cm during the first year.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Mid Upper Arm Circumference Growth Pattern:</h5>
                         <p>The measurements of mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) are used for determining whether the child is well nourished or malnourished.</p>
                         <p>The mid upper arm circumference increases fairly rapidly to about 16 cm by the age of one year. In the period 1 to 5 years, the mid upper arm circumference increases by only 1 cm . So, irrespective of age, the mid upper arm circumference of well-nourished children ranges 16-17 cm in the period 1-5 years. Conversely, if the mid upper arm circumference of a child of 1 to 5 years of age is less than 16 cm , that child has malnutrition and corrective intervention should be carried out.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Length/ Height Growth Pattern</h5>
                         <p>An average term baby is 50 cm long. The length increases by <span class="math-inline">$50 \%$</span> in the first year. In the second year, the average height growth is about 12 cm . The birth length doubles by 4 years of age. After the second year of age, the annual height growth averages <span class="math-inline">$5-6 \mathrm{~cm}$</span> until the beginning of the adolescent growth spurt. Height growth stops at about the age of 18 years in girls and at the age of about 20 years in boys.</p>
                         <p>After plotting the child's height or length on a height chart, you should determine whether the growth pattern is normal. A normal growth pattern is parallel to the printed percentile lines. There are also weight for height charts and tables. Weight for height below the fifth percentile is a good indicator of acute under nutrition. Another way you can measure growth is eruption of teeth but remember that this is not very reliable as it varies from child to child. All the same, let us briefly discuss too eruption as an indicator of measuring growth.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Tooth Eruption as an Element of Growth:</h5>
                         <p>Tooth eruption is an important part of growth. In general, teething in infants usually starts at about 6 months of age, but some start later than 6 months. A new tooth appears approximately every month so that by <span class="math-inline">$2-2 \frac{1}{2}$</span> years of age the baby will have 20 primary teeth. This makes the number of teeth roughly equal to age in months minus 6 .</p>
                         <p>A parent should only start to worry about tooth eruption if a child has not yet started teething by 13 months. This is because at this age the child should be eating solid foods. Breast milk alone is not enough after the age of 6 months.</p>
                         <p>Teething may cause excessive salivation, irritability, disturbed sleep and some pain. Sometimes it also causes diarrhoea.</p>
                         <p>At the age of about 6 years, the shedding of the primary teeth starts and continues through to the age of 12 years. Eruption of permanent teeth starts at about 6 years of age.</p>
                         <p>So far we have discussed growth and how to measure and monitor the growth of children. Next let us discuss development.</p>

                     </h3>
                     <div class="content-card">
                         <p>At the beginning of this unit, we defined development as the progressive acquisition of various skills (abilities) such as head support, speaking, learning, expressing the feelings and relating with other people. We also said that each child follows a unique path in growth and development that is laid down from the beginning of life by what he has inherited from both parents.</p>
                         <p>If a child is genetically determined to be clever, then development will be more rapid. Unfortunately, many things may change the genetically determined path of growth and development. These things include, for example, infections, lack of care, psychological trauma, bad education, and malnutrition, to mention just a few.</p>
                         <p>The normal well-fed infant who is protected from infections develops quickly, particularly during the first 3 months. This is shown in Table 5.3. It is very important to know the age ranges when most children acquire certain skills. The various skills the baby and a young child learn are called milestones.</p>
                         <p>In monitoring development, we notice at what age the child achieves various milestones, such as smiling at the mother, sitting without support, grasping objects with his/her hands, standing, walking and talking. You should record at what age the child has achieved the various milestones.</p>
                         <p>Still, it is important to remember that every child develops at his/her own rate or pace. Some walk early, others late. The individual child's development rate often differs widely from the average but it is still be quite normal. The individual child's development is normal if the rate of development is constant and the developmental pattern is within the normal range.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.9.1 Factors that promote development</h4>
                         <p>The factors that promote/influencing development include good nutrition, emotional support, play and language training. We shall discuss each of them in detail, starting with good nutrition.</p>
                         <ol class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">1.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Good nutrition:</strong> Good nutrition is essential for normal growth and development. Unlike most other organs in the body, the brain is not fully developed at birth. Good nutrition in the first 6 months of life is extremely important.</span></li>
                         </ol>
                         <p>Malnutrition in this period may inhibit the growth of the brain. As a result of impaired brain growth, the child may suffer for the rest of life if the child does not get enough good food. A malnourished child is often tired, apathetic and not interested in learning new things that will promote normal development.</p>
                         <ol class="enhanced-list" start="2">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">2.</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Emotional Support:</strong> The first 5 years of life are critical for the foundation of the skills which are developed in the following periods of the child's life. A newborn starts with no knowledge and learns a great deal during his/her first year of life. It is very important to realize that a child is a growing and developing human being right from birth. He ought to be treated very carefully, with love and respect, so that he can develop normally. He needs full emotional support. There are eight basic needs for a healthy emotional development of a child.</span></li>
                         </ol>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">These are:</h5>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Love</strong> A child needs to feel loved continuously. A child who does not feel loved will not develop properly, and will not learn as quickly as other children. Instead, he becomes sad and lonely and no longer interested in what goes on around him.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Security</strong> A child needs to feel safe. He can only feel safe if his parents show that they love him and take good care of him. He must know that his parents will look after him and help him, that they will feed him when he is hungry, play with him, and keep him happy and comfortable. The love and security a child gets from the mother and family helps him to develop a sense of trust in people, initially the family members and later people outside the family.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Acceptance as an individual:</strong> A child enjoys being accepted as an individual. A child needs to know that his mother and family love him for what he is. They should not compare him with other children and tell him that he is slow to do this or that, or that he is not as good as some other child. They should show him that they respect him as an individual with his own likes and dislikes, and that they realize he is unique, as all children are unique.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Self respect (self-esteem).</strong> Children need to feel that they are of great value, they are able to do things by themselves, they can achieve success, and that their success will be recognized. Anything suggesting that a child is inferior is very disturbing to the child.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Achievements</strong> The child feels the need to achieve. The parents should not do anything that the children can do for themselves.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Recognition</strong> A child enjoys recognition by his or her parents. A child needs to know that his parents are happy and pleased when he has learned to do something new. Parents should help a child to do things and encourage him to make achievements. They should also teach the child because they love him and show that they are proud of him. This helps the young child to feel secure and to learn more easily.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Independence:</strong> A child needs to learn how to make decisions. As the child grows he needs to be allowed to decide more and more things for himself and learn how to be independent. The parents must not unnecessarily limit the child's independence and exploration by overprotection and over anxiety.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Authority:</strong> A child needs his parents' authority mixed with affection. The parents train the child to learn to obey the rules of the home, the neighbourhood, the school and the society. The rules indicate what the child may do and what he may not do. What a child may do is approved and encouraged with rewards. What the child may not do is clearly and firmly disproved and discouraged. The discouragement is achieved by permitting consequences of undesired behaviour. The child thus learns to accept the restrictions that are there in life.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Play:</strong> Play is an essential factor the development of a child. Play is an irreplaceable source of information, stimulation for the brain, stimulation for the muscles and a lot of fun. All these are necessary for physical, mental and social development. All normal children like to play. If a young child does not play, he may be ill. Encourage playing, even if it may be noisy sometimes. Expensive toys are not necessary for play. Young children will improvise toys from common objects such as paper (but not plastic bags), sticks and stones. The parents should make sure the child does not injure him/ herself with any of the toys. For example, parents should ensure that a toy is not too small, as a child can easily choke on small objects. To help a child play and learn properly, he needs to have:</span></li>

Blocks of wood can be used for stacking, a ball for throwing, containers of water or sand for filling and pouring.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Encouragement and interest from the adults. It is fun to play together.</span></li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>There are different kinds of play, and each type helps a child to develop properly.</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Physical play:</strong> This exercises the body's large muscles and keeps the child healthy and strong. Physical plays include: running, jumping, climbing, and swimming.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Manipulative play:</strong> This is a kind of play in which the child uses the hands and the eyes. It teaches such things as the size, consistency, texture, shape and colour of objects. Things for manipulative play include: sand, earth, clay and water. Children enjoy playing with all these things.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Creative play:</strong> Painting, paper cutting, sewing, using crayons, threading beads and shells, clay modelling, and building with bricks or blocks of wood are all activities that help children to use their hands and eyes together to make things which were not there before.</span></li>
                             <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Imitative play</strong> helps the child to acquire the skills of being a person. Through imitating the sound, the child acquires speech. Imitating everything, the child acquires many skills: dressing, feeding, washing etc.</span></li>

Children can even pretend that they are animals. This sort of play is important because it allows young children can get rid of a lot of feelings of anger, anxiety and fear.</span></li>
                         </ul>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Language Training</h4>
                         <p>Another factor that promotes development is language training. Children should be offered opportunities to meet, use, and play with words in conversation and in reading books. Using an adult language, the adults should talk and sing with small children and infants, encourage them to talk about what they are thinking, not laugh when children are talking, read to the children, tell stories, and listen as attentively to the children as they listen to the other adults.</p>
                         <p>Try to understand how they are thinking and be happy that they want to involve you in their world.</p>
                         <p>You now know what growth and development are and the factors that promote them. In the following section we shall discuss the importance of antenatal care, perinatal care and postnatal care and the effects of not having these services.</p>
