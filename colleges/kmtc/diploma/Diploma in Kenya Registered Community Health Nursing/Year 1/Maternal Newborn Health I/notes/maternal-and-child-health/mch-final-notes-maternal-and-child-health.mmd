\section*{MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH}

\section*{UNIT 1: INTRODUCTION TO MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION Unit Objectives}

By the end of the unit the learner will be able to;
- Define terms used in maternal and child nutrition
- Understand introduction to maternal and child nutrition

\subsection*{1.1 Definition of Terms}

Conception - Fertilization of an ovum by a sperm
Zygote - a fertilized ovum undergoes cell division and it also becomes implanted in the uterus Embryo - the number of cells doubles within 24 hours. The embryo size differs very little for eight weeks, it is only 3 cm . long. The embryo has a complete central nervous system, a beating heart, a digestive system, well identified fingers and toes and the beginnings of facial features Foetus - by 7 months each organ grows to maturity and the weight increases to 3500 grams Gestation - this is the period from conception to birth (38-42 weeks), pregnancy is divided into three trimesters

Placenta - this is the organ that develops in the uterus in early pregnancy. Maternal and fatal blood circulates closely to allow for exchange of materials. Nutrients and oxygen are delivered to the foetus and carbon dioxide and other waste materials are taken to the mother Amniotic sac - this is the bag of water in the uterus where the foetus floats

Umbilical cord - is the rope-like structure through which the fetus veins and arteries reach the placenta. It is also the route for nourishment and oxygen and waste disposal

Maternal and child health care: is the health service provided to mothers (women in their childbearing age) and children. The targets for MCH are all women in their reproductive age groups i.e. 15-49 years of age, children, school age population and adolescents

Maternal health: This refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. It encompasses the healthcare dimensions of family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care in order to ensure a positive and fulfilling experience in most cases
and reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in other cases. While motherhood is often a positive and fulfilling experience, for too many women it is associated with suffering, ill-health and even death

Maternal mortality or maternal death: Is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes (WHO 2011)

Maternal morbidity: is defined as chronic and persistent ill-health occurring as a consequences of complications of pregnancy and childbirth (ogunjuyighe and liasu, n.d)

Postnatal care: is healthcare provided following childbirth to both the mother and the infant. Skilled Birth Attendance is the process by which a woman is provided with adequate care during labour, delivery and early postpartum period (Graham et al, n.d)

Skilled Birth Attendant(SBA): is an accredited health professional-such as midwife, doctor or nurse who has been educated and trained to proficiency in the skills needed to manage normal(uncomplicated)pregnancies, childbirth and the immediate postnatal period, and the identification, management and referral of complications in women and new-borns (WHO,2004)

Child spacing: The practice of maintaining an interval between pregnancies
Child: A young human from stage of birth to puberty
Maternal and child health (MCH) care is the health service provided to mothers (women in their child bearing age) and children. The targets for MCH are all women in their reproductive age groups, i.e., 15-49 years of age, children, school age population and adolescents. Throughout the world, especially in the developing countries, there is an increasing concern and interest in maternal and child health care.

This commitment towards MCH care gains further strength after the World Summit for Children, 1991, which gave serious consideration and outlined major areas to be addressed in the provision of Maternal and Child Health Care services.

\subsection*{1.2 Justifications for the provision of MCH Care}
- Mothers and children make up over $2 / 3$ of the whole population in developing world. Studies indicated that; women in reproductive age (15-49), constitute 21\%, in which pregnant
women constituted of $4.5 \%$, and children under five (5), were, $18 \%$, and infants: $4 \%$. This may form a working estimate that is very important in developing countries for project planning and implementation
- Maternal mortality is an adverse outcome of many pregnancies.

Miscarriage, induced abortion, and other factors, are causes for over 40 percent of the pregnancies in developing countries to result in complications, illnesses, or permanent disability for the mother or child. About 80 percent of maternal deaths in are directed obstetric deaths. They result "from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour, and puerperium), from intervention, omissions, incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above.
- Most pregnant women in the developing world receive insufficient or no prenatal care and deliver without help from appropriately trained health care providers. More than 7 million new-born deaths are believed to result from maternal health problems and their mismanagement.
- Poorly timed unwanted pregnancies carry high risks of morbidity and mortality, as well as social and economic costs, particularly to the adolescent and many unwanted pregnancies end in unsafe abortion.
- Poor maternal health hurts women's productivity, their families' welfare, and socio-economic development.
- Large number of women suffers severe chronic illnesses that can be exacerbated by pregnancy and the mother's weakened immune system and levels of these illnesses are extremely high.
- Infectious diseases like malaria are more prevalent in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women (most common in the first pregnancy). In addition, an increasing number of pregnant women are testing positive for the human immunodeficiency virus. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 3 million women are estimated to be infected with the AIDS virus and a woman with HIV has a 25 to 40 percent chance of passing the infection on to her foetus in the womb or at birth.
- Many women suffer pregnancy-related disabilities like uterine prolapse long after delivery due to early marriage and childbearing and high fertility.
- Nutritional problems are severe among pregnant mothers and 60 to 70 percent of pregnant women in developing countries are estimated to be anaemic. Women with poor nutritional status are more likely to deliver a low-birth -weight infant.
- Majority of perinatal deaths are associated with maternal complications, poor management techniques during labour and delivery, and maternal health and nutritional status before and during pregnancy.
- The large majority of pregnancies that end in a maternal death also result in foetal or perinatal death. Among infants who survive the death of the mother, fewer than 10 percent live beyond their first birthday.
- Ante partum haemorrhage, eclampsia, and other complications are associated with large number of perinatal deaths each year in developing countries plus considerable suffering and poor growth and development for those infants who survive.
- Development impairments among children due to poor management during labour and delivery.
- Low birth weight babies. Because many women are fed less, marry early, carry a heavy workload, and spend a considerable portion of their lifespan in pregnancy and lactation, they are exposed to persistent low nutritional status and high-energy expenditure. This predisposes mothers to bear low-birth-weight infants.
- Women often lack access to relevant information, trained providers and supplies, emergency transport, and other essential services.
- Cultural attitudes and practices impede women's use of services that are available.
- Children whose earliest years are faced by hunger or disease or whose minds are not stimulated by appropriate interaction with adults and their environment will experience grave and negative consequence throughout their lives-and so does society as they would be less contributory member.
- Given the magnitude of these problems and the interventions available, much has not been done. Most of these problems are silent. They remain, to a large extent, uncounted and unreported.

\subsection*{1.3 Prenatal care}

Prenatal care refers to the medical and healthcare services provided to pregnant individuals to ensure the health and well-being of both the expectant mother and her developing fetus during pregnancy.

\subsection*{1.3.1 Importance of prenatal care}
- To achieve a good outcome for the mother and baby and prevent any complications that may occur in pregnancy, labour, delivery and the post-partum period
- Early detection and treatment of problems
- Prevention of complications using safe, simple and cost-effective interventions
- Birth preparedness and complication readiness
- Health promotion using health messages and counseling
- Provision of care by a skilled attendant Aspects of pre- natal care
- Promotion of healthy behaviors including:
- Male involvement
- Early antenatal attendance
- Individual Birth Plan
- Skilled Birth Attendance
- Nutritional care
- Early postpartum and newborn care
- Immunization
- Early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding
- Malaria prevention
- PMTCT
- FP services
- Hygiene
- Birth and death notification
- Mother \& Child Health Booklet

\subsection*{1.4 Preconception}

Preconception refers to the period before attempting to conceive a child when individuals or couples take steps to ensure a healthy pregnancy.

It involves maintaining good health, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, taking folic acid, family planning, addressing genetic risks, quitting harmful habits, managing chronic conditions, screening for infectious diseases, prioritizing mental health, and undergoing medical check-ups.

This proactive approach helps optimize fertility, identify potential issues, and create a healthy foundation for pregnancy and parenthood.

\subsection*{1.4.1 Specific Nutrient Needs}

We will start with nutrients that increase the chances of conceiving by boosting fertility.
a) Fibre: Intake of both soluble and insoluble fibre from oats, cereal bran, lentils, pulses, prunes, fruits and vegetables is important. Fibre is important for blood sugar regulation and hormonal balance.
b) Magnesium: This is required for hormonal balance and resistance to stress. Foods rich in magnesium include - Kales (Sukuma Wiki), broccoli, spinach, okra, peas, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, almonds, and lentils
c) Selenium: This is required for good ovarian health, sperm health and detoxification. Foods rich in selenium include - onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, kidney beans, lentils, shrimp, prawns, lobster, crab, sardines, mackerel, broccoli, kidney, brown rice, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and cashew nuts
d) Zinc: This is required for good sperm quality and quantity, hormonal balance and immunity. It plays a role in the production of semen and testosterone in men, and in the ovulation and fertility in women. The recommended dietary allowance of zinc is about 15 mg a day. Foods rich in Zinc include - peas, tofu, chickpeas, prawns, squid, chicken,
turkey, lean red meat, white fish, oats, brown rice, cashew nuts, pumpkin seeds, crab, lobster and sardines.
e) Vitamin B6: This is important for hormonal balance and fertility. Foods rich in Vitamin B6 include - cabbage, bananas, groundnuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds, green vegetables, pulses, eggs and tofu.
f) Vitamin E: This is essential for hormonal balance and fertility. Foods that provide vitamin E include - most nuts, blackberries and sunflower oil
g) Fats: The omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids found in nuts, seeds and oily fish are important for hormonal balance and healthy sperm cells. Omega 3 fats are very important for brain development in the third trimester and early infancy when women are breastfeeding their babies.
h) Protein: This is important for hormone production and proper cell production and growth. Intake of high quality protein from chicken, fish and vegetable sources like lentils, pulses, nuts and seeds is recommended.

We will now look at nutrients that are important for the optimal health of both the mother and the baby (during and after pregnancy), and whose stores should be boosted before conception.

\section*{i) Folic acid}

It is recommended that women of reproductive age obtain 400 micrograms ( 0.4 milligrams) of folate or folic acid daily. Folic acid works closely with vitamin B12 and is required for the enzymes that produce DNA for replicating and growing cells, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, blood, and growing fetus.

It is known to help reduce the risk of birth defects of the brain and spinal cord (neural tube defects). The most common neural tube defect being spina bifida (where the vertebrae do not fuse together properly, leaving the spinal cord exposed), which could result in varying degrees of paralysis, incontinence, and mental retardation.

In addition, it helps reduce the likelihood of recurrent miscarriage, preterm delivery and low birth weight babies.

Folic acid is most beneficial in the first month after conception, as this is when most neural tube defects occur. It is important to remember that many women usually do not realize they are pregnant in the first month.

Moreover, many pregnancies are unplanned. Folic acid intake should therefore begin prior to conception and continue through pregnancy. Better still, all women should take multivitamins, where folic acid is included.

Foods rich in folic acid include legumes, peas, grain products and cereals, nuts, fruits and dark green leafy vegetables. Even if a woman's diet is composed of plenty of foods with folate, only about 50 per cent of this is available to the body, while the vitamin form is 100 per cent available. Cooking also sometimes reduces the nutrient density in food. Some drugs (e.g aspirin and oral contraceptives) interfere with the absorption and metabolism of folate. Supplementation is thus important. A prenatal supplement however, does not replace a healthy diet.

\section*{Consequences of maternal folic acid deficiency}
- Impaired cell division
- Megaloblastic anaemia resulting from abnormal cell replication due to impaired DNA synthesis
- Babies with neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida
- Low birth weight babies
j) Iron

Iron intake is also vital for pregnancy. Before becoming pregnant, a woman will benefit from boosting her iron stores. Many women have low iron stores because of the monthly menstruation and diets low in iron.

Building iron stores helps prepare a woman's body for the needs of the foetus during pregnancy. Non-vegetarian women who are not pregnant need 18 mg of iron a day. Vegetarians need even more, about 30 mg per day.

Good quality sources of iron that can be incorporate into the diet include meats, poultry, fish, leafy Greens and iron enriched grains and products such as cereals and rice. Iron in plant foods is not usually well absorbed, so women should add a source of vitamin C such as oranges or an animal protein, to enhance the absorption of the iron in plants.

Iron supplementation can help prevent and treat iron deficiency anemia, and boost the iron stores of a woman who is planning to get pregnant. Iron deficiency is the number one nutrient deficiency among women and should therefore be taken seriously.

\section*{Causes of iron deficiency}
- Low dietary iron intake
- Low bioavailability of dietary iron (e.g when the diet has high content of non-heme iron from vegetable sources or when the diet has high content of iron inhibitors such as tannins, fiber, and calcium) which decrease the bioavailability of dietary iron. Iron absorption enhancers include heme iron sources from animal protein and vitamin C .

\section*{Consequences of iron deficiency}
- Anaemia (low blood haemoglobin concentration)
- Maternal deaths (anaemic women are more likely to die from blood loss during deliverypostpartum haemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal death in developing countries)
- Reduced transfer of iron to the foetus, increasing the infant's risk of iron depletion and anaemia in early infancy
- Low birth weight
- Neonatal mortality
- Reduced physical capacity (the blood needs iron to carry oxygen to the brain and muscles, and the muscles need iron for normal functioning)
- Reduced productivity
- Reduced learning capacity (anaemic children score lower on intellectual tests than nonanaemic children)

\section*{Other common non-dietary causes of anaemia}
- Parasites like hookworms can cause blood loss and increase iron loss.
- Malaria destroys red blood cells and can lead to severe anaemia

\section*{k) Iodine}

Iodine is a nutrient required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones which are required for the regulation of cell metabolism throughout life. The thyroid hormones ensure normal growth, especially of the brain, which occurs from foetal life to the end of the third year after birth. Promotion of iodized salt for use by the entire family and encouraging consumption of foods rich in iodine (fish and seafood) is important.

\section*{Causes of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD)}
- Iodine-deficient soil resulting in low levels of iodine in locally grown foods and water supply.
- Low dietary iodine intake
- Intake of goiterogenic compounds in the diet (compounds that interfere with the utilisation of the iodine taken in the diet). These include food with sulphur and thiocyanate compounds such as cassavas, cabbage
- Selenium deficiency- remember that selenium plays a role in thyroid hormone metabolism

\section*{Consequence of iodine deficiency in pre-pregnancy period}

Page 10 of 87
- Impaired thyroid function resulting from severe iodine deficiency
- Goiter / enlargement of the thyroid
- Endemic cretinism (extreme form of brain damage and physical impairment)

\section*{l) Calcium}

Between 1000 mg to 1200 mg of calcium should be obtained by a woman every day before conceiving. This may be accomplished by eating three or more servings of calcium rich foods per day including dairy products and dark leafy vegetables.

Like iron, many women fall short on this nutrient. If there is inadequate calcium in pregnancy, the foetus may draw calcium from the mother's bones, which can put her at risk for osteoporosis later in life. If a woman is not taking in enough calcium in the diet, she should take a supplement.

\section*{Study questions:}
1. Discuss the importance of prenatal care
2. Explain five nutrients that affect fertility
3. Explain the consequences of the following deficiencies in preconception
- Iron
- Folic
- Iodine

\section*{TOPIC 2: PREGNANCY AND POSTNATAL CARE}

Pregnancy care, also known as prenatal care, involves the medical and healthcare services provided to expectant mothers during pregnancy to monitor the health of both the mother and developing fetus. It includes regular check-ups, diagnostic tests, nutritional guidance, and education on pregnancy-related topics.

Postnatal care, on the other hand, focuses on the well-being of both the mother and newborn after childbirth. It includes medical check-ups for the mother, newborn care, breastfeeding support, emotional well-being, and guidance on postpartum recovery and parenting. Both prenatal and postnatal care are essential for ensuring a safe and healthy pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenting experience.

\subsection*{2.1 Nutrition requirements during pregnancy}

A good nutritional status maintained before and throughout pregnancy decreases the risk of birth defects, suboptimal foetal growth and development as well as chronic health problems later in life. Nutrient requirements during pregnancy are not static.

They vary during the course of the pregnancy depending on a mother's pre-conception nutrition, body size and composition, physical activity level, stage of pregnancy and health status. A well-balanced diet consisting of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals should be consumed.

\subsection*{2.1.1 Energy, proteins and fats}

Women should consume a minimum of $175 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of carbohydrates in order to meet the foetal brain needs for glucose. In the first 28 days of pregnancy when there is extensive development of major organs e.g. the nervous system, the mother should consume sufficient carbohydrates. Basic foods such as vegetables, fruits and whole grain products contain fibre and phytochemicals which protect the body against rancidity and constipation.
```
A pregnant woman needs extra 300calories above the RDA for a normal woman. Energy is
needed to spare proteins for its body building role. They need 60g/dl of protein for building body
tissues.
```

Vegetarian women who omit all animal sources of proteins should consume enough legumes
complementing with cereals in order to achieve all the essential amino acids into their bodies. The ingested protein is vital in tissue repair and foetal development. it is approximated that 925 g of proteins causes accumulation in the tissues. 440g are taken up by the foetus, 216 g used to increase maternal blood volume and extracellular fluid, 116 g is used by the uterus and 100 g taken by the placenta.

Proteins are vital for the synthesis of important organs that support foetal development e.g. the placenta. A mother should eat meat, dried beans, eggs, chicken and milk products in order to get enough proteins.

Pregnant women require $33 \%$ of the total calories from fat. For instance, in the $1^{\text {st }}$ trimester, foods rich in essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) are needed. Docosahexanoic acid(DHA) and eicosapentanoic acid(EPA) sourced in flaxseed, cooking oil, walnut, soybean, canola oil and green leafy vegetables are important for foetal development i.e. In the formation of the central nervous system.

Fats also facilitate the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Women who consume adequate amounts of EFAs have healthy children whose nervous system and alphactory systems are well developed.

Furthermore, sufficient intake of EPA and DHA tends to prolong gestation period by averagely 4 days hence decreasing risks of preterm delivery. Most importantly, fat intake should be observed throughout the gestational period since the development of vital foetal organs, nervous system inclusive proceeds postpartum. Other dietary sources include fish and fish oils.

\subsection*{2.1.2 Vitamins}

Folate and vitamin B12 are needed in large amounts during pregnancy. They are important in rapid cell differentiation. Pregnant mothers should consume 600ug/day of folate for increase in red blood cells and prevention of neural tube defects in the foetus.

The $1^{\text {st }}$ trimester is a critical period whereby there is formation and closure of the neural tube which develops, forming the brain and spinal cord. In the $1^{\text {st }} 2$ weeks, a woman may not realise that she is pregnant but there is need for folate for the formation and closure of the neural tube by week 6.

Unless the mother consumes sufficient folate, anencephaly and spina bifida will occur. In case of
anencephaly, the infant dies shortly after birth.
Supplementation of $400 \mathrm{ug} / \mathrm{d}$ folate is recommended as well as intake of folate-rich foods such as cereals, bagel, rice, liver, lentils, chickpeas, asparagus, spinach, avocado, oranges etc. For pregnant mothers, they require vitamin B12 to aid folate in making new cells. Vegans require supplementation since vitamin B12 is found only in animal sources.

Vitamin A should be obtained from dietary sources such as carrots, green leafy vegetables and deep-yellow fruits. Supplementation is prohibited due to the teratogenic effects to the foetus. Therefore, they should consume vitamin A not exceeding 5000ug/d in order to avoid retinoic acid syndrome to the foetus.

Vitamin D supports foetal development, the addition of calcium to bone, tooth and enamel formation. Lack of vitamin D during pregnancy compromises foetal as well as childhood bone development. The infant may also suffer from hypocalcemia. Vitamin D also supports the immune system of the body. Preeclampsia, maternal infection, preterm babies and miscarriages are consequences of maternal vitamin D deficiency.

Obese women are at increased risk of vitamin D due to low release levels from their fat deposits. Vegan women are also at greater risk if their dietary intake and exposure to sunlight is not put in check. The RDA for vitamin D for pregnant women is thus 0.055 mg from fortified foods or from sun exposure.

\subsection*{2.1.3 Minerals}

Calcium is vital for fetal development throughout the gestational period. It is important in bone mineralization in both the mother and the foetus. Calcium works with magnesium and phosphorous to build bones.
Intestinal absorption of calcium doubles in pregnancy so mothers should consume calcium-rich foods. Calcium added to a mother's bones prior to conception is depleted to build foetal bones. In the final weeks of pregnancy, $300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day is transferred to the foetus thus the need for increased maternal calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis and teeth dentures.

Meanwhile pregnant mothers need $600 \mathrm{mg} /$ day of calcium, $30 \mathrm{mg} /$ day iron and $15 \mathrm{mg} /$ day zinc. There is need to increase maternal daily intake of milk, cheese, yoghurt and other calcium-rich foods.

Magnesium is needed for bone and tissue growth. The foetus draws iron from maternal stores to create its own in order to sustain it throughout the $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ trimesters. The RDA is $320 \mathrm{mg} /$ day Maternal losses of iron are inevitable especially during delivery to caesarean section this derails the mothers iron status. All pregnant mothers should be subjected to $30 \mathrm{mg} /$ day of iron supplementation in the $2^{\text {nd }}$ and $3^{\text {rd }}$ trimester. Iron needs increase in pregnancy about 1 g increase per day. 300 mg is used by the foetus and the placenta, 250 g is lost at delivery and 450 mg is used to increase red blood cells' mass.

Iron intake will reduce the risk of iron-deficiency anaemia, a common problem in pregnant women. Total needs for iron during pregnancy is $5.5 \mathrm{mg} /$ day but in order to achieve this, about $27 \mathrm{mg} /$ day should be consumed in order to cater for the $20 \%$ that will not be absorbed. In order to maximise iron absorption, pregnant mothers should eat foods rich in vitamin c. Fluoride can also be consumed in form of supplements for mothers who are deficient so as to boost bone mineralisation.

Iodine is important in the formation and function of the thyroid glands. These glands secrete hormones which are important in various psychological activities in the body. Foetal brain developments and energy productions are rather important functions of iodine.
This is vital in the $1^{\text {st }}$ trimester especially and is also needed throughout the pregnancy. Iodine deficiency that affects children leads to hypothyroidism, cretinism and goitre. A pregnant woman should consume iodised-tabled salt, shellfish, seaweed and some type of tea that is iodideconstituent.

They should consume $0.22 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ but should not exceed $1.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$.
Sodium found abundantly in common salt as sodium chloride, maintains the body's water balance. During pregnancy, maternal plasma volume increases. Pregnant mothers should ingest food enriched with sodium chloride in limited amounts to avoid risks of oedema and preeclampsia.

\section*{2.. 2 Pregnancy and weight gain}

Pregnancy weight gain recommendations are based on a woman's pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), a measure of body weight relative to height. These guidelines, provided by
organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), vary according to the BMI category.

For women who are underweight, with a BMI less than 18.5, the recommended total weight gain during pregnancy is typically between 28-40 pounds (about 12.5-18 kilograms). Weight gain in this category tends to be slow in the first trimester, with most of it occurring during the second and third trimesters.

Women in the normal weight range, with a BMI of 18.5-24.9, are advised to gain around 25-35 pounds (about 11.5-16 kilograms) during pregnancy. Weight gain for this group is usually spread relatively evenly across the three trimesters. Overweight women, with a BMI between 25-29.9, are recommended to gain 15-25 pounds (about 7-11.5 kilograms). Weight gain may be slower in the first trimester, with more gradual increases as the pregnancy progresses.

Women with obesity, having a BMI greater than 30 , should aim to gain 11-20 pounds (about 5-9 kilograms) during pregnancy. Weight gain for this group may be slower overall, but it's important for them to discuss weight management with their healthcare provider to minimize risks associated with obesity during pregnancy.

While these are general guidelines, individual variations are common, and pregnant individuals should work closely with their healthcare providers, such as obstetricians or midwives, to receive personalized guidance. Weight gain should be gradual and appropriately distributed throughout the trimesters to support the growing fetus while minimizing the risk of complications, such as gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. Monitoring and discussing weight gain throughout pregnancy with a healthcare provider is essential to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the baby.

\subsection*{2.3 Complications during pregnancy}

Complications during pregnancy can vary in severity and may pose risks to both the mother and the developing fetus. Here are major pregnancy complications:
1. Gestational Diabetes: Gestational diabetes occurs when a woman develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. It can increase the risk of complications for both the
mother and the baby. If not well-managed, it can lead to larger birth weight, preterm birth, and the need for a cesarean section.
2. Preeclampsia: Preeclampsia is a condition characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs like the liver and kidneys. It typically occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy and can be life-threatening if left untreated. It poses risks such as reduced blood flow to the placenta, which may result in low birth weight or preterm birth.
3. Preterm Labor: Preterm labor is when contractions start before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Babies born prematurely may face health issues due to underdeveloped organs. Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality.
4. Placental Abruption: Placental abruption is the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. It can lead to heavy bleeding and deprive the fetus of oxygen and nutrients. Severe cases may necessitate emergency delivery.
5. Ectopic Pregnancy: An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, typically in a fallopian tube. This condition can cause severe pain and internal bleeding and often requires surgical intervention.
6. Miscarriage: Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks gestation. It can happen for various reasons, including genetic abnormalities or issues with the uterus. While miscarriages are relatively common, they can be emotionally distressing for expectant parents.
7. Multiple Gestation (Twins, Triplets, etc.): Carrying multiple fetuses increases the risk of complications. Premature birth, low birth weight, and complications such as twin-totwin transfusion syndrome may arise. Close monitoring and medical care are essential in multiple pregnancies.
8. Gestational Hypertension: This condition involves high blood pressure that develops during pregnancy but does not meet the criteria for preeclampsia. If left uncontrolled, it can lead to more severe hypertension and preeclampsia.
9. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR): IUGR refers to a condition in which the fetus does not reach its expected growth potential in the womb. This may result from various factors, such as placental problems, maternal health issues, or genetic factors. Babies with IUGR may be born with a low birth weight and face health challenges.
10. Hyperemesis Gravidarum: Severe morning sickness, known as hyperemesis gravidarum, can lead to dehydration and malnutrition if not properly managed. It may require hospitalization for intravenous fluids and medication to alleviate nausea and vomiting.

These complications emphasize the importance of prenatal care and monitoring during pregnancy to detect and manage any potential issues early. Timely intervention and treatment can often help reduce the risks associated with these complications and improve the outcomes for both the mother and the baby. Pregnant individuals should maintain open communication with their healthcare providers to address any concerns and receive appropriate care.

\subsection*{2.4 Aspects of postnatal care}
1. Physical Recovery: Postnatal care involves monitoring the mother's episiotomy or cesarean incision, providing pain management options, and offering guidance on resuming activities, including exercise. For mothers who had a cesarean section, ensuring that the incision heals properly is of utmost importance to prevent complications.
2. Breastfeeding Support: Lactation support includes assistance with proper latch techniques, addressing issues such as sore nipples or engorgement, and guidance on maintaining an adequate milk supply. Support may include in-person consultations, telephone hotlines, and peer support groups for breastfeeding mothers.
3. Nutrition and Hydration: A well-balanced diet postpartum is essential, especially for mothers who are breastfeeding. Adequate hydration is equally important, as breastfeeding can be dehydrating. Healthcare providers may recommend continuing prenatal vitamins to meet the nutritional demands of recovery and breastfeeding.
4. Uterine Contractions and Bleeding: Healthcare providers assess uterine contractions to ensure the uterus is returning to its pre-pregnancy size, a process known as uterine involution. They also monitor postpartum bleeding, or lochia, which should change from bright red to pink and then gradually to a yellow or white discharge over several weeks.
5. Emotional Well-being: Postpartum emotional well-being is vital. Healthcare providers routinely check in on the mother's mental health and offer support for any emotional challenges, such as postpartum depression or anxiety. They encourage open communication and may refer mothers to mental health professionals when needed.
6. Contraception and Family Planning: Discussions about contraception take into account the mother's preferences, lifestyle, and medical history. These discussions occur during postnatal care to help the mother make informed decisions about family planning.
7. Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation: Pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, are recommended to strengthen the pelvic muscles. Physical therapists may also provide specialized postnatal pelvic floor therapy to address concerns like urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.
8. Newborn Care: Postnatal care for the newborn includes regular pediatric check-ups, which assess growth, development, and general health. It also involves educating parents on infant care, such as feeding, diapering, and safe sleep practices, to promote the wellbeing of the baby.
9. Postpartum Check-ups: Postnatal care includes follow-up appointments with healthcare providers. These appointments assess the mother's physical recovery, address any emotional concerns, and monitor the baby's progress. It allows for early detection and management of postpartum complications.
10. Support and Education: Healthcare providers offer information and resources on infant care, including feeding choices (breastfeeding or formula feeding), safe sleep practices to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and recognizing signs of
common infant ailments. Support groups and counseling services may be available to help new mothers navigate the challenges of postpartum life and motherhood.

\subsection*{3.1. Introduction}

Infant mortality reflects the general health status of the population to a considerable degree because so many of the environmental factors affecting the health of pregnant women and the new-borns also affect the rest of the population.

The first year particularly the first six months is the most critical period of development in a child's life. Although the rapid growth that occurs at prenatal and during infancy slows in childhood and later picks up in adolescence, developmental changes are rapid.

Nutrition plays a key role in the process of growth and development. The full potential of heredity will be realized only through good nutrition and health, along with a nurturing and supportive environment.

The mental and physical productive potential of each adult can only be realized if this stage of child growth is well monitored.

\subsection*{3.2 What is meant by growth and development?}

Growth is the increase in weight and height with age, or size that comes about as a result of the multiplication of cells and their differentiation for many different functions in the body. Growth is a continuous but not a uniform process from conception to full maturity. The potential for optimal development of the body from one stage of growth to another is dependent among other things on the nutrition and health status of the child which requires the understanding of their overall development.

Development is the process of maturation, progress, or advancement, often involving qualitative improvement in capabilities, skills, or aspects of well-being.

\subsection*{3.3. Factors affecting the rate of growth and development}
a) Genetic factors: This relates inborn capacity to grow, as a result of hereditary traits inherited from parents. However certain circumstances e.g. radiation and drugs may alter gene structure and interfere with normal development of fetal tissues. Genetic disorders e.g. PKU (phenylketonuria) affect growth (brain development). Acquired defects;- when normal genes are made defective by factors like deficiencies, infections and toxicity of certain drugs
b) Environmental Factors: Adequate nutrition and good health are key optimal growth and development in children. During pregnancy several factors affect growth and development of fetus by progression of hyperplasia (increase in number of cells e.g. in case of cancer) and hypertrophy (increase in size of cells) this increases energy requirements of the mother thus affecting growth and development of fetus.

Examples;
- Rubella, pre-eclampsia and insufficient dietary intake leads to impaired fetal growth and may lead to congenital malformations
- Renal disorders, hypertension \& infections can lead to still births
- Pregnancy diabetes can lead to preterm births, too big or congenital malformations
- Blood incompatibility-rhesus factor, if rhesus negative woman conceives with rhesus positive man then there is potential risk to babies health, antibodies of the mother will attack rhesus factor in neonatal blood as a foreign substance during delivery first child are normally safe, treatment women are given injection of positive rhesus immunoglobulin during pregnancy.
c) Psychosocial factors- Relates to parental child care practices coupled with interactions with surroundings.
d) Nutrition- Diet of foetus is not necessarily related to mother's food intake, although congenital malformation is associated deficiencies in folic acid, it is normally rich in carbohydrates and poor in lipids, other factors besides maternal nutrition also affect development of the foetus and they include;
- Interference with transfer of nutrients between mother and foetus e.g. placental malformation
- Reduction of utero placental flow due to maternal eclampsia or liver damage
- Inability of foetus to absorb nutrients
- Failure of pituitary gland to synthesize hormones adequately
e) Radiation - Most malformations occurs between second and seventh week of gestation, since this is the critical period of organ development, CNS which is highly susceptible to radiation continues to develop even after delivery, and is likely to develop defects ie hydrocephaly (large head) common companion of spina-bifida and microcephaly (small head) occurs mostly to mothers irradiated after fifth month.
f) Endocrine glands - Pituitary gland produces growth hormones. Thyroid gland produces hormone thyroxine which is responsible growth and development in first year. Malfunction of the gland results in cretinism.
g) Maternal age - Very young mothers and parents nearing 40s are likely to have bad pregnancy outcomes especially congenital abnormalities due to inability to synthesize chemical substances required for healthy offspring, down-syndrome, hydrocephalus \& anencephalous are associated with increased age; maternal age is also associated with abortions, stillbirths and premature deliveries.
h) Diseases - Diseases increase nutrient requirement and affect food digestion, absorption and metabolism of nutrients. Example Chronic diseases like TB hinder growth of child at any stage, diarrhoea and meningitis slows down child development,
i) Social economic factors - This influences access to good health services, water and sanitation, food and proper maternal care.
j) Psychological factors - Emotions affect appetite which in-turn affects growth and development, for example separation of baby from the mother and in cases where mother neglects the child will affects the dietary intake of a child.
k) Age-There is rapid growth and development in first six months which slows down after two years and increases at adolescence

\subsection*{3.4 Aspects of growth and development}

There are four major aspects of human growth and development.
1. Physical development during infancy
2. Mental development
3. Emotional development
4. Social development

\section*{Importance of assessing growth and development}

The assessment of growth and development is very helpful in finding out the state of health and nutrition of a child.
Abnormal growth or growth failure is a symptom of disease. Hence, measurement of growth is an essential component of the physical examination.

\subsection*{3.4.1 Physical Development}

\section*{During Infancy (0-2yrs)}

This describes both physical and psychomotor development, at this stage physical development is rapid, generally neonate is $18-20$ inches long \& 3 kgs in weight in one year time the baby is about 3 times that, at birth brain is $1 / 4$ of its final weight.
At birth upper part of the body is well developed while lower part fully develops after birth at accelerated rate. During first two months a baby shows postural changes, sits at 7 months, creeps at 10 months, stands at 13 months \& walks at 15 months. Teeth appear at 6 months.

\section*{Early childhood (2-7 years)}

Rate of growth is slow in comparison to infancy stage, there is increase in weight of 3-5 pounds/year, at 6 years head is $90 \%$ adult size and child is $109-114 \mathrm{~cm}$ tall weighing at $16-20$ kgs, at this stage hands and feet grow bigger in conjunction with muscles, fine motor and gross
motor skills are fully developed for the child can write, draw, run, jump, dance etc. at this stage children acquire gender identity with environment being the major factor.

\section*{Late childhood (6-12 years)}

Arms \& legs grow faster than trunk making child appear tall and thin, milk teeth are lost and permanent teeth start appearing, sense organs, muscles and brains are more or less mature, at 12 child is almost 140 cm in height with boys being taller than girls, sex differences start appearing, and there is increase in speed, strength and coordination needed for motor skills this increases precision in athletic ability, climbing etc.

\section*{Adolescence stage (12-21 years)}

At early stages most children experience growth spurt, a rapid increase in weight and height, it usually lasts 2 years where boys gain 8-9 inches in height and girls 6-7 inches in height, by age of 17 (girls) and 18 (boys) most have reached $98 \%$ final height. Sex differences become apparent at this stage, sex glands start secreting resulting in appearance of primary and secondary sex characteristics, hormonal changes increase sexual drive, and capacity to develop heterosexual relationships and true intimacy increases at later stages.

\subsection*{3.4.2 Mental development}

It refers to the ability of observing, perceiving, remembering, imagining, thinking, solving problems and growth of IQ as well as language.

\section*{Infancy (sensory motor stage)}

At this stage infant is able to react to external stimuli like sound, light and temperature. Perpetual skills develop in first year, at this stage child can imitate, discriminate and recognize to certain extend, this stage is also known as sensory motor stage for infant seeks physical satisfaction based upon immediate sensory experience.
By 1 year child has vocabulary of one or two words and can respond to simple questions and requests, and gradually acquires sense of form, shape, size and color thus they are able to recognize known and unknown persons. At this stage learning is through imitation, manipulation and play, they are unable to distinguish facts from fiction, they are also highly inquisitive and can ask embarrassing questions.

\section*{Early childhood (preoperational stage)}

This is stage at there is increased contact with environment through exploration, child develops general intelligence, perception, memory, learning, problem solving and language, they often ask why? of everything. Child has little understanding of operations, particularly in understanding reversibility of operations for example if water from broad glass is poured into narrow glass a child will assume there is more water in narrow glass than broad glass.

It is also marked with
a. Ego-centricism i.e. fails to understand another's point of view e.g. I am I and you are you and how can you be I and I, be you?
b. Animism child regards everything to be alive unless it is broken or damaged, up to six years they regard everything that moves to be alive.

\section*{Later childhood (stage of concrete operations)}

Mental development is rapid at this stage. Child becomes more inquisitive which indicates his thinking capacity. Thinking and imagination takes active form in this stage. child is able to establish cause and effect relationship. Child develops better concepts of length, distance, time, area and volume, this is because abilities of understanding, reasoning, memory, attention, and discrimination develop to a great extent, thus child is interested in performing creative and productive work.

\section*{Adolescence (stage of formal operations)}

At this stage adolescence attains intellectual and emotional maturity, this is due to interaction between maturation, experience, education and training. Memory and imagination increase to considerable extent, they are also able to concentrate on activity for longer period of time and are also able to make decisions for at this stage they are able to think beyond their own immediate world. They use logic to approach their problems and solve them, they also take interest in scientific pursuits by the end of this stage they have complete mental preparation for fullyfledged adult life.

\subsection*{3.4.3 Emotional Development}

\section*{Infancy}

Immediately after birth neonates are able to display distinct emotions, they are diffuse and gross thus they cannot show specific emotions like anger, fear and love but by the end of this stage
emotions are marked. After few weeks baby is able to smile and gurgle to give expression of pleasure and contentment. By three months general excitement is differentiated into distress. Jealousy starts at 18 months, between 18-24 months joy further differentiates from elation to joy and affection.by three years child can express fear, distress, anger, joy and affection.

\section*{Early childhood stage}

As children grow emotion expressions get refined, becoming more definite and intense (love, fear and dislikes), previously violent reactions are now in subdued form, at first fear is general rather than specific but as they grow older fear responses become specific, they also show jealousy towards others who have things they do not possess.

\section*{Later childhood}

Emotional behaviour at this stage is guided by rational expressions, they experience intense emotional feelings of love, hate and fear which lasts for long period of time, but they are able to control their emotions, emotions of wonder dominate children and if something goes against their emotions they show anger.
At 10 they become obedient and friendly, fear is less common and when angry they don't kick things but instead express anger by sarcasm, sneers, abuses and belittling remarks. joy, pleasure, love, curiosity, grief and affection appear at this stage.

\section*{Adolescence}

This stage is marked with heightened emotionality due to change of roles in home school and society and also unfavourable relations at home. This is because parents and teachers do not prepare them for adolescence. When they become adolescence society expects them to behave like adults yet they are not yet physically or intellectually mature. Due to increased sex drive and attraction to opposite sex and their lack of knowledge on how to behave or make friendship with opposite sex results in increased emotional tensions. They are always in conflict with adults who fail to understand them. Vocational and school failures also cause emotional disturbances.

\subsection*{3.4.4 Social development}

\section*{Infancy}

Newborns are neither social or unsocial, as they develop some social behaviour which makes them acceptable as a social being, in first few months child begins to make active and social contacts with persons in their social environment i.e. mother, father, grandmother and others who take care of them, the presence of this individuals stimulate satisfaction. They are also able to differentiate between mother and other people, social responses are laughing and smiling and during last half of first year they show negative response to strangers. By;
- 18 months they are able to respond to other infants and also becomes more and more interested in playmates
- two years can obey certain commands and call attention of other persons to objects they are interested in

During this period child displays tendency towards negativism by responding to requests with NO

\section*{Early childhood}

At this stage they have one or two friends, with whom they identify with and play with for short periods. They select playmates who are age mates from same neighborhood for friendly companionship. At this stage they often quarrel and fight, they also show sympathy by helping others.

They also need recognition and praise, approval from parents and if they get ignored they become naughty for attention. Nursery school experiences have been known to contribute in acquisition of acceptable social habits.

\section*{Late childhood}

At this stage children enter school and want to have many friends, they are interested in playing activities which involve groups of own age and sex. Peer approval is linked with strong desire for friendship which leads to cooperative behavior. Quarrels are common among friends at this stage; the groups formed are often short lived. Qualities like taking up responsibility, selfcontrol, self-reliance, obedience, discipline etc.

\section*{Adolescence}

They have strong devotion and loyalty to their groups this groups peer groups are highly influential to them and their decisions they acquire many habits, attitudes, ideals and social skills.

During early part of this stage closest friend is of same sex, but later part they seek friendships from opposite sex. Identification of with peer groups, hero worship, growth of patriotic spirit, development of a sense of sacrifice and leadership are some of the most important features of social development of adolescent.

\subsection*{3.5.0 Measuring Growth}

How do we measure growth?
There are various measurements that are used to measure growth. These are:
- Weight,
- Height,
- Head circumference
- Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)
- The eruption of teeth.

To be useful, these measurements must be taken accurately using reliable equipment and correct measuring techniques.

\subsection*{3.5.1 Weight}

For measuring the weight, a beam balance or spring balance is used. Before weighing a child, check the weighing scale to ensure it is working properly. You can do this by weighing a known weight and noting whether the scale has obtained the same weight.

\section*{Then proceed as follows:}
- Hung the scale securely with the dial of the scale at your eye level for correct reading. If you use the Salter scale, hang the weighing pants on the hook of the scale. See figure 5.1.
- Adjust the pointer of the scale to zero (" 0 ") by turning the knob on the top of the scale to account for the extra weight of the weighing pants;
- Ask the parent to remove any heavy clothes and shoes including the nappies and to dress the child in the weighing pants. .
- Once the child wears the weighing pants, ask her to lift the baby and fasten the loop of the pants to the hook of the weighing scale. Ask the mother to let go of the child but to continue standing nearby and talk to keep talking to the baby.
- The child's feet should be off the ground.
- If the child is upset, ask the mother to calm him or her. When the child stops moving, note the weight quickly, reading to the nearest 10 gm in infants and 100 gm in children.

\subsection*{3.5.2 Measuring the Head Circumference}

The head circumference is measured by encircling the head with a stretchable tape measure, or a piece of string in the absence of a tape measure. This is passed over the most prominent part of the occiput posteriorly and just above the supraorbital ridges anteriorly to obtain the greatest distance around the head. The piece of string used in the absence of a tape measure is then measured with a ruler to obtain the head circumference.

\subsection*{3.5.3 Measuring the mid upper arm circumference (MUAC)}

The mid upper arm circumference is measured using a tape or string in the absence of a tape. The tape or string is placed around the upper arm, midway between the olecranon and acromion processes. Care is taken not to pull the tape or string too tightly. The measurement is read. The string used in the absence of a tape measures is then measured with a ruler to obtain the mid upper arm circumference.

\subsection*{3.5.4 Length}

The length of a child is measured in the first 3 years and the height is measured after 3 years of age. The length is measured using a horizontal measuring board put on the ground or on a table. The child is laid on his back with the head against the fixed head board.

A helper holds the child's head so that the eye angle- external ear canal line is vertical and also keeps the body straight. With one hand of the health worker, the child's knees are pressed down to straighten the child's legs fully while, with the other hand, the sliding foot board is placed to touch the child's heels firmly. With the foot board in place, the child's length is read on the metre scale.

To measure the height, a bare foot child stands with the feet together. The heels, the buttocks and the occiput lightly touch the measuring device. The head is aligned so that that the external eye angle- external ear canal plane is horizontal.

The child is told to stand tall and is gently stretched upward by pressure on the mastoid processes with the shoulders relaxed. The sliding head piece is lowered to rest firmly on the head. The height is read and recorded.

\subsection*{3.5.5. Average growth measurements of normal children.}

An average term newborn weighs 3.5 kg (range $2.5 \mathrm{~kg}-4.6 \mathrm{~kg}$ ). The birth weight must be plotted in the first box of the growth chart and recorded in the appropriate space on the growth chart. The birth month should be written in the first box of the growth chart. Within the first $3-4$ days, a term newborn loses $5-10 \%$ of the birth weight. This weight loss is usually regained in 2 weeks by term babies and longer by premature babies. An average term baby doubles the birth weight in 4-6 months, triples it by one year and quadruples it by two years of age.

\subsection*{3.6 Growth Monitoring}

It is the process of maintaining regular close observation of a child's growth. It starts with measurements of weight daily, weekly, monthly, bimonthly etc. The successive weights are plotted on the growth chart of the child health card.

To monitor growth, you must use the growth chart on the back of the child health card. You need to study a blank growth chart to be thoroughly familiar with its contents.
(To start with, note: the top line represents the average growth line of healthy boys and the bottom line is the 3rd percentile for girls (the lower limit of normal weight-for-age of healthy girls).

To determine an individual child's growth pattern, weight measurements from birth are plotted on the growth chart of the child health card.

The plotting produces a line or graph. This line constitutes that individual child's growth pattern or curve.

\subsection*{3.7 Road to Health Chart}

A constantly upward curve parallel to the printed lines shows good growth. You should inform the mother or caretaker that the child is growing well and praise her for her good efforts. By looking at the direction of the child's growth curve, the health worker and the mother can see at a glance whether the child is gaining weight appropriately or not. Let us briefly look at how to interpret a child's growth curve or pattern.

Interpretation of the growth curve It is important to know how to interpret the individual child's Growth Curve or pattern on the Child Health Card. Interpretation simply means determining whether the child is growing appropriately or not. The interpretation is done by watching the direction of the child's growth pattern. The direction of the growth curve indicates how the child is growing.

The weight growth pattern of the larger term infants will be above the pattern of the average term infant. On the other hand, the weight growth pattern of the smaller term infants will be below the pattern of the average term infant. A small baby whose growth pattern is below the bottom line in the growth chart is healthy if that child's growth pattern is parallel to the bottom percentile line. As long as the baby is gaining weight, however, at an acceptable rate, the mother should not worry

A horizontal (flat) growth curve means DANGER! It means the child is not growing and is a sign of disease, especially malnutrition. A child who is malnourished cannot grow properly, cannot resist diseases, and is in danger of getting killer diseases. You should take a thorough history from the mother to establish the cause of growth failure and then advise the mother. You should also encourage the mother to give the child food containing enough calories, protein, vitamins and minerals.

A curve deviating downwards, indicates a VERY DANGEROUS situation. The child is losing weight. The child needs extra care immediately. The baby may be suffering from malnutrition, tuberculosis, AIDS or other medical conditions. The mother is advised to take the baby to hospital for investigations and treatment.

Any infant who does not gain weight for one month or a child who does not gain weight for two months should receive urgent attention. Such an infant or child is becoming malnourished.

You should record important events that affect the child's growth above the curve in the Growth Chart. Such events include diseases, weaning, introduction of solids and stopping of breastfeeding.

\subsection*{3.8 Importance of Growth Monitoring}

Health workers and parents should monitor the growth of children for the following reasons
- For early detection of abnormal growth and development
- To facilitate the early treatment or correction of any conditions that may be causing abnormal growth and development.
- To provide an opportunity for giving health education and advice for the prevention of malnutrition.

\subsection*{3.8.1 Reasons for special care}

At the bottom of the Growth Chart there is a box that lists some of the factors that may make a child particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. A tick or mark should be made next to any of the reasons that apply. This will then remind you to be particularly alert to any signs of growth faltering and may suggest the reasons for poor growth.

You can then plan how best to help this particular child. Note that regular weighing of infants (monthly) and young children (at least once every two months) will help you to detect growth failure and prevent malnutrition.

Such growth monitoring should be continued up to the age of 5 years as a component of well child care. Encourage parents to have their children weighed and avoid keeping them waiting for too long. You must always report the findings to the mother or caretaker and inform her how the child is growing.

Do you have a child who is under five years of age? Do you weigh him regularly? You should encourage parents to monitor their children's growth and development in the first 5 years. But first and foremost, you should serve as a good example.

\section*{Head Circumference Growth Pattern.}

The head circumference measurements are used for estimating the growth of the brain. At birth, the head circumference of a term baby averages 34 cm .

The head circumference grows most rapidly in the first year: 2 cm monthly in the first 3 months, 3 cm during the next 3 months, and 3 cm in the last 6 months. This means that the average head circumference is 44 cm at 6 months and 47 cm at 12 months of age. Thus, the head circumference grows by 12 Cm during the first year.

\section*{Mid Upper Arm Circumference Growth Pattern:}

The measurements of mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) are used for determining whether the child is well nourished or malnourished.

The mid upper arm circumference increases fairly rapidly to about 16 cm by the age of one year. In the period 1 to 5 years, the mid upper arm circumference increases by only 1 cm . So, irrespective of age, the mid upper arm circumference of well-nourished children ranges 16-17 cm in the period 1-5 years. Conversely, if the mid upper arm circumference of a child of 1 to 5 years of age is less than 16 cm , that child has malnutrition and corrective intervention should be carried out.

\section*{Length/ Height Growth Pattern}

An average term baby is 50 cm long. The length increases by $50 \%$ in the first year. In the second year, the average height growth is about 12 cm . The birth length doubles by 4 years of age. After the second year of age, the annual height growth averages $5-6 \mathrm{~cm}$ until the beginning of the adolescent growth spurt. Height growth stops at about the age of 18 years in girls and at the age of about 20 years in boys.

After plotting the child's height or length on a height chart, you should determine whether the growth pattern is normal. A normal growth pattern is parallel to the printed percentile lines. There are also weight for height charts and tables. Weight for height below the fifth percentile is a good indicator of acute under nutrition. Another way you can measure growth is eruption of teeth but remember that this is not very reliable as it varies from child to child. All the same, let us briefly discuss too eruption as an indicator of measuring growth.

\section*{Tooth Eruption as an Element of Growth:}

Tooth eruption is an important part of growth. In general, teething in infants usually starts at about 6 months of age, but some start later than 6 months. A new tooth appears approximately
every month so that by $2-2 \frac{1}{2}$ years of age the baby will have 20 primary teeth. This makes the number of teeth roughly equal to age in months minus 6 .

A parent should only start to worry about tooth eruption if a child has not yet started teething by 13 months. This is because at this age the child should be eating solid foods. Breast milk alone is not enough after the age of 6 months.

\section*{Teething may cause excessive salivation, irritability, disturbed sleep and some pain. Sometimes it also causes diarrhoea.}

At the age of about 6 years, the shedding of the primary teeth starts and continues through to the age of 12 years. Eruption of permanent teeth starts at about 6 years of age.
So far we have discussed growth and how to measure and monitor the growth of children. Next let us discuss development.

\subsection*{3.9 Development}

At the beginning of this unit, we defined development as the progressive acquisition of various skills (abilities) such as head support, speaking, learning, expressing the feelings and relating with other people. We also said that each child follows a unique path in growth and development that is laid down from the beginning of life by what he has inherited from both parents.
If a child is genetically determined to be clever, then development will be more rapid. Unfortunately, many things may change the genetically determined path of growth and development. These things include, for example, infections, lack of care, psychological trauma, bad education, and malnutrition, to mention just a few.
The normal well-fed infant who is protected from infections develops quickly, particularly during the first 3 months. This is shown in Table 5.3. It is very important to know the age ranges when most children acquire certain skills. The various skills the baby and a young child learn are called milestones.

In monitoring development, we notice at what age the child achieves various milestones, such as smiling at the mother, sitting without support, grasping objects with his/her hands, standing, walking and talking. You should record at what age the child has achieved the various milestones.

Still, it is important to remember that every child develops at his/her own rate or pace. Some walk early, others late. The individual child's development rate often differs widely from the average but it is still be quite normal. The individual child's development is normal if the rate of development is constant and the developmental pattern is within the normal range.

\subsection*{3.9.1 Factors that promote development}

The factors that promote/influencing development include good nutrition, emotional support, play and language training. We shall discuss each of them in detail, starting with good nutrition.
1. Good nutrition: Good nutrition is essential for normal growth and development. Unlike most other organs in the body, the brain is not fully developed at birth. Good nutrition in the first 6 months of life is extremely important.

Malnutrition in this period may inhibit the growth of the brain. As a result of impaired brain growth, the child may suffer for the rest of life if the child does not get enough good food. A malnourished child is often tired, apathetic and not interested in learning new things that will promote normal development.
2. Emotional Support: The first 5 years of life are critical for the foundation of the skills which are developed in the following periods of the child's life. A newborn starts with no knowledge and learns a great deal during his/her first year of life. It is very important to realize that a child is a growing and developing human being right from birth. He ought to be treated very carefully, with love and respect, so that he can develop normally. He needs full emotional support. There are eight basic needs for a healthy emotional development of a child.

\section*{These are:}

Love A child needs to feel loved continuously. A child who does not feel loved will not develop properly, and will not learn as quickly as other children. Instead, he becomes sad and lonely and no longer interested in what goes on around him.

Security A child needs to feel safe. He can only feel safe if his parents show that they love him and take good care of him. He must know that his parents will look after him and help him, that they will feed him when he is hungry, play with him, and keep him happy and comfortable. The
love and security a child gets from the mother and family helps him to develop a sense of trust in people, initially the family members and later people outside the family.

Acceptance as an individual: A child enjoys being accepted as an individual. A child needs to know that his mother and family love him for what he is. They should not compare him with other children and tell him that he is slow to do this or that, or that he is not as good as some other child. They should show him that they respect him as an individual with his own likes and dislikes, and that they realize he is unique, as all children are unique.
Self respect (self-esteem). Children need to feel that they are of great value, they are able to do things by themselves, they can achieve success, and that their success will be recognized. Anything suggesting that a child is inferior is very disturbing to the child.

Achievements The child feels the need to achieve. The parents should not do anything that the children can do for themselves.

Recognition A child enjoys recognition by his or her parents. A child needs to know that his parents are happy and pleased when he has learned to do something new. Parents should help a child to do things and encourage him to make achievements. They should also teach the child because they love him and show that they are proud of him. This helps the young child to feel secure and to learn more easily.

Independence: A child needs to learn how to make decisions. As the child grows he needs to be allowed to decide more and more things for himself and learn how to be independent. The parents must not unnecessarily limit the child's independence and exploration by overprotection and over anxiety.

Authority: A child needs his parents' authority mixed with affection. The parents train the child to learn to obey the rules of the home, the neighbourhood, the school and the society. The rules indicate what the child may do and what he may not do. What a child may do is approved and encouraged with rewards. What the child may not do is clearly and firmly disproved and discouraged. The discouragement is achieved by permitting consequences of undesired behaviour. The child thus learns to accept the restrictions that are there in life.

Play: Play is an essential factor the development of a child. Play is an irreplaceable source of information, stimulation for the brain, stimulation for the muscles and a lot of fun. All these are
necessary for physical, mental and social development. All normal children like to play. If a young child does not play, he may be ill. Encourage playing, even if it may be noisy sometimes. Expensive toys are not necessary for play. Young children will improvise toys from common objects such as paper (but not plastic bags), sticks and stones. The parents should make sure the child does not injure him/ herself with any of the toys. For example, parents should ensure that a toy is not too small, as a child can easily choke on small objects. To help a child play and learn properly, he needs to have:
- Plenty of room so that he can move about and discover things for him/ herself.
- Independence. He should be encouraged to do things he wants or enjoys.
- Several different kinds of toys so he can practise different skills. Blocks of wood can be used for stacking, a ball for throwing, containers of water or sand for filling and pouring.
- Encouragement and interest from the adults. It is fun to play together.

There are different kinds of play, and each type helps a child to develop properly.
Physical play: This exercises the body's large muscles and keeps the child healthy and strong.
Physical plays include: running, jumping, climbing, and swimming.
Manipulative play: This is a kind of play in which the child uses the hands and the eyes. It teaches such things as the size, consistency, texture, shape and colour of objects. Things for manipulative play include: sand, earth, clay and water. Children enjoy playing with all these things.
Creative play: Painting, paper cutting, sewing, using crayons, threading beads and shells, clay modelling, and building with bricks or blocks of wood are all activities that help children to use their hands and eyes together to make things which were not there before.
Imitative play helps the child to acquire the skills of being a person. Through imitating the sound, the child acquires speech. Imitating everything, the child acquires many skills: dressing, feeding, washing etc.
Imaginative play: The child can dress up and pretend to be an adult whom he knows, or pretend to be a driver driving a car. . Children can even pretend that they are animals. This sort of play is important because it allows young children can get rid of a lot of feelings of anger, anxiety and fear.

\section*{3. Language Training}

Another factor that promotes development is language training. Children should be offered opportunities to meet, use, and play with words in conversation and in reading books. Using an adult language, the adults should talk and sing with small children and infants, encourage them to talk about what they are thinking, not laugh when children are talking, read to the children, tell stories, and listen as attentively to the children as they listen to the other adults.

Try to understand how they are thinking and be happy that they want to involve you in their world.

You now know what growth and development are and the factors that promote them. In the following section we shall discuss the importance of antenatal care, perinatal care and postnatal care and the effects of not having these services.

\section*{Topic 4: THE NEW BORN BABY}

\section*{Unit Objectives}
1. Introduction and definition of terms
2. Discuss the characteristics of a healthy baby
3. Explain common problems of a new born baby
4. Outline care of a new born baby
5. Breastfeeding the new born baby

\subsection*{4.0 Introduction}

The new born or neonatal period is the period from birth to 28 days, while the perinatal period starts some time before labour and ends at day 7 post-delivery.

The neonatal period deals with infants who are live born and the perinatal period includes still births. A normal new born is a baby born at 37 completed weeks or thereafter, has birth weight of 2500 gm or more and has no complications. All health care levels including the community should be able to look after a normal neonate.

\subsection*{4.10 Characteristics of a healthy baby}
- A good appetite when breast feeding
- Normal bowel movements, with normal colour and consistency
- Very little crying
- Mental alertness, brightness
- Cheerfulness and contented disposition
- Firm elastic flesh with springy muscles
- Perfect sound continuous sleep, with eyes and mouth closed
- Constant growth in height and intelligence with an increase in head circumference from healthy growth

\subsection*{4.1.1. Head \& Hair}
- The baby‘s head should be $1 / 4$ of the baby‘s total size
- It may look out shape because of moulding of the skull bones during labour and birth but will revert to round and smooth in the next few weeks.
- The baby may be born with a full head of hair or none at all
- It is common for babies to loose most of their first hair by 1 year of age Vision
- The baby`s eye colour depends on skin tone
- By 6 months to 1 year, the baby`s eye colour will be permanent Eyes
- When the new born cries, you may not see tears. Tear ducts may not function for the first few weeks after birth
- Tetracycline eye ointment is instilled in baby's eyes soon after delivery
- A new-born's eye muscles are weak at birth over the few weeks, eye muscle strengthens and improves and the baby can have better focus on objects Heaving
- Babies can heat loud and soft noises at birth
- Loud noises may startle, while soft noises may help calm the baby
- The baby quickly learns the difference in voice sounds
- The baby will turn its head to a familiar voice especially the mother's or the father's voice

\subsection*{4.1.2 Taste \& Smell}
- New borns can taste and smell at birth

\subsection*{4.1.3 Skin}
* At birth, the baby's skin has a thick cheese like covering. this is called venix caseosa. Venix helps protect the baby's skin while in the uterus
* The baby's body may be covered with fine soft hair (especially covering the face), this is called lanugo and it will go away within a few weeks after birth
* A baby's skin is very sensitive to temperature changes. If the baby becomes too cold, the skin may appear blotchy (irregular patches) with slightly bluish hands and feet.
* If overheated, a rash may develop Chest \& Breathing
* Babies take little breaths and use stomach muscles to help breathe
* The rate is 30 to 60 breaths a minute
* The breasts of boys and girl babies may look enlarged after birth because of hormones that cross the placenta during the last 2 weeks before birth which cause the breasts to enlarge, but this will go away in about 2 weeks

\section*{Abdomen}
* It may be round and stick out slightly
* The stamp of the umbilical cord is clamped and will dry and fall off in 1 to 2 weeks
* There's need for check-up if there's redness around the umbilical cord or pus or drainage or a fouls smell Arms \& Legs
* After birth, the baby's arms \& legs may look bent and are held close to the body
* Most new born babie's hands are in tight fists.
* Legs may appear bowed
* The arms and legs may appear too short for the body because of their bent appearance
* By 3 to 4 months, the arms and legs stretch out Reflexes
* The baby is born with many reflexes for survival and safety
* The reflexes are important to help the health care provider determine if the baby has a healthy nervous system.

\subsection*{4.1.4 Survival reflexes}
- Sucking
- Swallowing
- Rooting

\subsection*{4.1.5 Safety Reflexes}
- Gag reflex (to prevent chocking)
- Cough (to get rid of mucus)
- Tonic neck reflex (forcibly turning the head of a normal new born elicits extension of the limbs on the side to which the head is turned)
- Moro reflex (when baby thrusts out both hands when startled)
- Grasp reflex (very strong at birth) Behaviour
- The new born baby will probably spend a lot of time sleeping or eating, sometimes may be very alert and gaze at you or be very quiet and drowsy right after birth
- Crying is a response to unpleasant stimulation, the baby needs to be calmed and held (soothed)

Common problems of a new born baby within the first 24 hours and after 24 hours The most common causes of death in the new born are birth asphyxia, infections and problems related to low birth weight. These problems are largely preventable through good care.

\section*{Common problems of a new born baby}

Newborns may experience various common issues as they adjust to life outside the womb. It's important to note that if you have concerns about your newborn's health, you should consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.
1. Jaundice: Many newborns develop jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes due to an excess of bilirubin. This is often temporary and typically resolves on its own, but severe cases may require medical attention.
2. Feeding Issues: Newborns may struggle with breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. Common issues include latch problems, difficulty swallowing, or issues with sucking. Consultation with a lactation consultant or pediatrician can help address these concerns.
3. Colic: Some babies experience colic, which is characterized by excessive, inconsolable crying, often in the evening. The cause of colic is not well understood, but it typically improves on its own after a few months.
4. Diaper Rash: Due to sensitive skin and frequent diaper changes, newborns may develop diaper rash. Regular diaper changes, gentle cleaning, and the use of diaper rash creams can help prevent and alleviate this issue.
5. Sleeping Difficulties: Newborns often have irregular sleep patterns, and getting them to sleep through the night can be a challenge. Establishing a consistent bedtime routine and creating a calm sleep environment can help improve sleep.
6. Congestion: Babies are obligate nose breathers, and congestion can make breathing difficult. Using a bulb syringe or a nasal aspirator can help clear nasal passages. Ensure the baby sleeps in a slightly elevated position to ease breathing.
7. Skin Issues: Newborn skin is delicate, and issues such as dryness, peeling, or baby acne are common. Using gentle, fragrance-free baby products and avoiding overdressing can help maintain healthy skin.
8. Umbilical Cord Issues: The umbilical cord stump can take some time to fall off. Keep the area clean and dry, and avoid covering it with tight diapers. If there are signs of infection, consult a healthcare professional.
9. Spitting Up: Many infants experience gastroesophageal reflux (spitting up) due to an immature digestive system. If it's excessive or associated with discomfort, consult with a healthcare provider.
10. Infections: Newborns are more susceptible to infections. Monitor for signs of illness such as fever, lethargy, poor feeding, or unusual fussiness. Seek medical attention if you have concerns.

\subsection*{4.2.6. Infection control in a newborn unit}

Methods to prevent infection
$\checkmark$ Have a separate room specifically for newborn babies in a low traffic area with restricted access
$\checkmark$ Avoid overcrowding and understaffing
$\checkmark$ Do not place two or more babies in the same cot or incubator or under the same radiant warmer or phototherapy unit
$\checkmark$ People as sources of infection
$\checkmark$ Do not allow personnel with skin infections or lesions to come into direct contact with babies
$\checkmark$ Individuals handling the baby should wash their hands with soap and water
$\checkmark$ Hand washing
$\checkmark$ Wash hands with soap and water, but if hands are visibly clean, disinfect them using an alcoholbased hand rub;
$\checkmark$ before and after caring for a baby and before any procedure
$\checkmark$ after removing gloves
$\checkmark$ after handling soiled instruments or other items
$\checkmark$ Instruct the mother and family members to wash their hands before and after handling the baby
$\checkmark$ Regular and thorough cleaning will decrease microorganisms on surfaces and help prevent infection
$\checkmark$ Every newborn special care unit should have a housekeeping schedule:
$\checkmark$ Post the cleaning schedule in a visible area
$\checkmark$ Educate staff regarding cleaning, and delegate responsibility

\subsection*{4.3.0 Care of a new born baby}

To ensure new born survival and reduce neonatal morbidity, the following principles of new born care need to be observed:
a. Clean atraumatic delivery
b. Prevention of infection
c. Provision of warmth
d. Cord care
e. Infant Feeding
- Early initiation of feeds
- Exclusive breastfeeding unless otherwise indicated
- Alternative Feeding Methods
f. Comprehensive first and subsequent examination

i. Provision of warmth Purpose: To prevent hypothermia.

\subsection*{4.3.1 a.At birth and within the first hour(s)}
$\checkmark$ Warm the delivery room: for the birth of the baby the room temperature should be $25-28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, There should be no draught
$\checkmark$ Dry baby: immediately after birth, place the baby on the mother's abdomen or on a warm, clean and dry surface. Dry the whole body and hair thoroughly, with a dry cloth.
$\checkmark$ Skin-to-skin contact: Leave the baby on the mother's abdomen (before cord cut) or chest (after cord cut) after birth for at least 2 hours. Cover mother and baby with warm cloth and put a hat on the baby's head
$\checkmark$ If the mother cannot keep the baby skin-to-skin because of complications, wrap the baby in a clean, dry, warm cloth and place in a cot. Cover with a blanket. Use a radiant warmer if room not warm or baby small Subsequently (first day)
$\checkmark$ Explain to the mother that keeping baby warm is important for the baby to remain healthy Dress the baby or wrap in soft dry clean cloth or blanket. Cover the head with a cap
$\checkmark$ Ensure the baby is dressed or wrapped and covered with a blanket
$\checkmark$ Encourage the mother to sleep in same bed with the baby (bedding in)
$\checkmark$ If bedding-in is not possible, keep the baby within easy reach of the mother (rooming-in) If the mother and baby must be separated, ensure baby is dressed or wrapped and covered with a blanket
$\checkmark$ Monitor warmth every 4 hours by touching the baby`s feet: if feet are cold use skin-to-skin contact, add extra blanket and reassess.( see section on re-warming of the newborn)
$\checkmark$ Keep the room for the mother and baby warm. If the room is not warm enough, always cover the baby with a blanket and/or use skin-to-skin contact

\section*{At home}
$\checkmark$ Explain to the mother that babies need one more layer of clothes than other children or adults
$\checkmark$ Keep the room or part of the room warm, especially in a cold climate
$\checkmark$ At night, let the baby sleep with the mother or within easy reach to facilitate breastfeeding
$\checkmark$ Don'ts
$\checkmark$ Do not put the baby on any cold or wet surface
$\checkmark$ Do not bath the baby at birth. Wait at least 24 hours before bathing
$\checkmark$ Do not swaddle (wrap too tightly). Swaddling makes them cold
$\checkmark$ Do not leave the baby in direct sun light

\section*{Re-warming the baby skin-to-skin}
$\checkmark$ Before re-warming, remove the baby's cold clothing
$\checkmark$ Place the newborn skin-to-skin on the mother's chest dressed in a pre-warmed shirt open at the front, a nappy (diaper), hat and socks
$\checkmark$ Cover the infant on the mother's chest with his / her clothes and an additional (prewarmed) blanket
$\checkmark$ Check the temperature every hour until normal
$\checkmark$ Keep the baby with the mother until the baby's body temperature is in the normal range
$\checkmark$ If the baby is small, encourage the mother to keep the baby in skin-to-skin contact for as long as possible, day and night
$\checkmark$ Be sure the temperature of the room where the re-warming takes place is at least $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
$\checkmark$ If the baby's temperature is not $36.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or more after 2 hours of re-warming, reassess the baby
$\checkmark$ If referral is needed, keep the baby in skin-to-skin position / contact with the mother or other person accompanying the baby

\section*{ii. Cord Care}
$\checkmark$ Wash hands before and after cord care
$\checkmark$ Put nothing on the stump
$\checkmark$ Fold nappy (diaper) below stump
$\checkmark$ Keep cord stump loosely covered with clean clothes
$\checkmark$ DO NOT bandage the stump or abdomen
$\checkmark$ If stump is soiled, wash it with clean water and soap. Dry it thoroughly with clean cloth
$\checkmark$ Avoid touching the stump unnecessarily
$\checkmark$ Explain the above to the mother and that she should seek medical care if the umbilicus is red or draining pus or blood

\section*{iii. Infant Feeding}

Early initiation of feeds
$\checkmark$ All neonates should have feeds initiated as early as possible within the first hour of birth
If mother cannot breastfeed at all, use commercial formula
$\checkmark$ Alternative feeding methods
$\checkmark$ If mother cannot breastfeed at all, use commercial infant formula
$\checkmark$ Quantity to feed by cup
$\checkmark$ Start with $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight per day for day 1 . Increase total volume by $10-20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$ per day, until baby takes $150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day
$\checkmark$ Divide total into 8 feeds
$\checkmark$ Check the baby's 24 hour intake. Amount of individual feeds may vary
$\checkmark$ Continue until baby takes the required quantity
$\checkmark$ Wash the cup with water and soap after each feed

\section*{iv. First and subsequent examination of the newborn}
- Examine the baby from head to toe at birth, before discharge and when necessary
- Examine the baby in a warm environment
- Allow the mother to be present during the examination
- If the baby has not been weighed yet, weigh the baby, take length and record the weight and length
- While talking to the mother and before undressing the baby, observe the baby for:
* Color
- Respiratory rate
* Posture
\$ Movement
- Reaction to stimuli
\$ Obvious abnormalities
- As you proceed with the examination, explain the findings to the mother in simple terms and point out abnormalities
- Wait until the entire examination is complete before beginning specific management of the baby's problems, treating the problems designated as priorities first

Classification according to total score and action
$\checkmark$ Apgar 7-10 = normal: dry the baby and give mother to initiate breastfeeding
$\checkmark$ Apgar 4-6 = moderate asphyxia: dry the baby and give oxygen; mostly will not need active resuscitation. Keep baby warm.
$\checkmark$ Apgar 0-3 = severe asphyxia: Require active resuscitation

\subsection*{4.70 Immunization}
- Give BCG 0.05 ml and oral polio 2 drops at birth or before discharge
- Immunize all babies irrespective of their weight or gestational age
- Immunize at the usual age (chronological age and not corrected age),and do not reduce vaccine dose
- Immunize even if:- - Has been hospitalized for a prolonged period of time. If the baby is still in the hospital at 60 days of age, complete a first course of immunization
* Has a clinically stable neurologic condition (e.g. brain injury)
* Was born to a mother who is HIV positive
* Is receiving treatment with antibiotics
- Has jaundice
- Ensure all babies delivered at home are taken to the health facility for BCG and OPV zero
- Give vitamin A 200,000 units to all mothers
- All mothers who deliver at home to get Vitamin A 200,000 during the first clinic visit
- For babies on replacement feeding give vitamin A 50,000 units at birth
- On discharge the mother to get a birth notification

\section*{Continuing health education and promotion for the care giver}

Counsel the caregiver on continuing care of the baby:
- Optimum infant feeding
- Initiate breastfeeding within one hour after delivery
- Encourage exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months (or replacement feeding where indicated)

Page 51 of 87
- Show the mother how to position the baby for proper attachment to the breast
- Wash hands after changing the baby and before feeding Start complementary feeding after 6 months

\section*{Breastfeeding of the new born baby}

\section*{Care of the Breast}

As long as the nipples are clean breast milk is always free from germs there is no need to clean breast every time the baby feeds. A daily bath is enough

\section*{Breastfeeding the Newborn}

Ensure mother is in a comfortable position then;
Show her how to help her baby to attach. She should:
* Touch her baby‘s lips with her nipple
* Wait until her baby`s mouth is opened wide
* Move her baby onto her breast, aiming the infant's lower lip well below the nipple Look for signs of good attachment:
* More of areola visible above the baby's mouth
- Mouth wide open
- Lower lip turned outwards
* Baby's chin touching breast

Look for signs of effective suckling (that is, slow, deep sucks, sometimes pausing)
If the attachment or suckling is not good, try again, then reassess

In case of breast engorgement, express a small amount of breast milk before you start breastfeeding to soften the areola area so that it is easier for the baby to attach

\section*{Management of Breast problems:}

\section*{Prevention}
- Proper attachment and positioning of the baby during breastfeeding
- Frequent emptying of the breasts
- Not giving pre-lacteal feeds e.g. glucose, water or other types of milk
- Educate women on how to breastfeed during antenatal clinic, and how to manage simple breast problems

\section*{Sore or cracked nipples}

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Mother reports pain on breastfeeding
- Cracks may be seen on nipples

\section*{Management}
- Counsel on personal hygiene and how to keep the nipples clean
- Express the milk from the affected breast to prevent engorgement
- Show mother how to position and attach baby
- Apply milk on the cracks and encourage exposure to air or sunshine if possible
- Continue breastfeeding both breasts
- Check for oral thrush in baby

\section*{Breast Engorgement}

Breast engorgement occurs when there is congestion as well as over accumulation of milk

Diagnosis The breasts feel hard with distended vessels. They are also warm and tender. The areola may look oedematous

Management 1. Mother is breastfeeding:
- If the baby is not able to suckle encourage the woman to express the milk
- Encourage the woman to breastfeed more frequently, using both breasts at each feeding
- Show the woman how to hold and attach baby to breast
- Relief measures before breastfeeding may include:
* Applying warm/ cold compresses to the breasts just before breastfeeding, or encourage the woman to take warm shower
* Massage the woman's neck and back
* Have the woman express some milk manually prior to breastfeeding and wet the nipple area with breast milk to help the baby latch properly and easily

Relief measures after feeding may include:
- Good support to the breast with a binder or brassier but avoid tight ones
- Apply cold/warm compresses to the breast between feeding to reduce swelling and pain
- Give analgesics e.g. Paracetamol 500 mg orally as needed
- Follow up 3 days after initiating management to ensure response
- Mother is not breastfeeding:
- Support breasts with binder or brassiere to reduce swelling and pain
- Apply cold/warm compresses to the breasts to reduce swelling and pain
- Express enough milk to relieve pain but avoid complete emptying as this will reduce milk production. Let her gradually reduce volume expressed
- Give analgesic e.g. paracetamol 500 mg orally when needed
- Review /Follow up 3 days after initiating treatment to ensure response
- Advise to seek care if breasts become painful, swollen and red, or if she feels ill or her temperature is $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{Mastitis}

Mastitis is defined as inflammation of the breast.

\section*{Management:}
- Treat with antibiotics e.g. Cloxacillin 500 mg every six hours for 5 -10 days Or Erythromycin 500 mg every six hours for $5-10$ days
- Analgesics e.g. Paracetamol 500 mg orally as needed
- Encourage the woman to:
* Continue breastfeeding on the unaffected side
* Support breast with brassiere
* Apply cold/ warm compresses to the breast between feeds to reduce swelling and pain
* Express the milk from affected side several times a day and discard
- Follow up three days later to ensure response.

\section*{Breast Abscess}

A breast abscess is a localized collection of pus in the breast.

\section*{Management}
- Treat with antibiotics as in mastitis
- Drain the abscess - general anaesthesia e.g. Ketamine is usually required; you may also use Local anaesthetic spray
- Make the incision radially extending from near the alveolar margin towards the periphery of the breast to avoid injury to the milk ducts
- Wear sterile gloves and use a finger or tissue forceps to break up the pockets of pus
- After draining the pus loosely pack the cavity with gauze
- Remove the gauze pack after 24 hours and replace it with a small gauze pack
- If there is still pus in the cavity place a small gauze pack in the cavity and bring the edge out through the wound as a wick to facilitate drainage of any remaining pus
- Encourage the woman to:
* Continue breastfeeding from the unaffected breast o Support breast with a binder or brassiere
* Apply cold/warm compresses to the breast between feeds to reduce swelling and pain o Give analgesics e.g. Paracetamol 500 mg orally 8 hrly for 7 days
* Follow up 3 days after initiating management to ensure response
* Educate the mothers on the importance of emptying the breasts

\section*{COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING}

\section*{Unit Objectives}
1. Introduction and definition of terms
2. Identify food selection for complementary feedings
3. Describe the stages of complementary feeding
4. Discuss the effect of early complementary feeding
5. Explain complication of late complementary feeding
6. Demonstrate preparation of complimentary feed

\section*{Food selection for complementary feeding}

Complementary foods should meet the basic criteria of: Frequency, Amount, Texture
(thickness), Variety, Adequacy, Active feeding, Hygiene (Abbreviated as FATVAH)
Key Messages and recommendations
- Key messages for improving feeding of 6 to 24 months should focus on improving dietary intake of 6 food groups including from the following:
- Protein including animal-source foods such as meat, chicken, eggs, fish or milk protein including plant-source legumes, seeds and pulses such as beans, peas, lentils, green grams and sesame seeds.
- Locally available cereals such as maize/millet and sorghum, and roots and tubers such as potatoes, cassava, and sweet potatoes
- Vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables such as mango, pawpaw, carrots, pumpkin and, Other fruits and vegetables such as banana, pineapple, watermelon, cabbage and avocado
- Oils or fats to increase the energy density of foods
- Counsel and encourage the mothers to:
- Introduce complementary feeds at six months and continue breastfeeding for 2 years or longer
- Starting other foods in addition to breast milk at six completed months helps a child grow strong and healthy
- After the age of six months, breast milk and other forms of milk alone are not adequate to meet the baby's nutritional requirements.
- Complementary foods should be introduced gradually in addition to breast- milk or other forms of milk
- Breastfeeding should continue to be an important component of the diet, providing up to half or more of the nutritional requirements between the age of 6-12 months, and up to $1 / 3$ between the ages of 12-24 months
- Give variety of complementary feeds - 2 to 3 different family foods: staple, legumes, vegetables/fruits, and animal foods at each serving i.e.
- Animal-source foods: flesh foods such as chicken, fish, liver, and eggs and milk and milk products
- Staples: grains such as maize, wheat, rice millet and sorghum and roots and tubers such as sweet potatoes, potatoes
- Legumes such as beans, lentils, peas, groundnuts and seeds such as sesame o Vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables such as mango, papaya, passion fruit, oranges, dark-green leaves, carrots, yellow sweet potato and pumpkin, and other fruits and vegetables such as banana, pineapple, watermelon, tomatoes, avocado, eggplant and cabbage
- Add a small amount of fat or oil to give extra energy (additional oil will not be required if fried foods are given, or if baby seems healthy/ fat)
- Encourage mothers to prepare foods with more energy and nutrient rich by;
- Use less water to make a thicker porridge. (not to make the Food thin and runny)
- Toast cereal grains before grinding them into flour. Toasted flour does not thicken so much, so more flour is needed to make porridge hence more calories.
- Take out a mixture of the solid pieces in the soup or stew such as beans, vegetables, meat and the staple. Mash this to a thick puree and feed to the child instead of the liquid part of the soup.
- Replace some (or all) of the cooking water with fresh or soured milk, coconut milk, or cream. o Add a spoonful of milk powder after cooking.
- Mix pre-cooked legume with the staple flour before cooking to increase protein content.
- Stir in a paste made from nuts or seeds such as groundnut paste (peanut butter) or sesame seed paste.
- Add a spoonful of margarine, ghee or oil.
- Fat is a concentrated source of energy and substantially increases energy content of food without increasing the bulk.
- Advise mothers to avoid milling multi-mix flours e.g. 2 legumes and 4 cereals.
- These are not recommended as they have anti-nutrients that bind calcium leading to rickets o Encourage the mothers to gradually increase the frequency, amount, texture (thickness/consistency), and give variety of foods.

\section*{Effects of early complementary feeding}
- Adding foods too soon may:
- Take the place of breast milk
- Result in a low nutrient diet
- Increase risk of illness
* Less protective factors

Page 59 of 87
- Other foods not as clean
- Difficult to digest foods
- Increase mother's risk of pregnancy
- Complications of late complementary feeding
- Adding foods too late may:
- Result in child not receiving required nutrients
- Slow child's growth and development
- Risk causing deficiencies and malnutrition

\section*{UNIT 10: IMMUNIZATION}

\section*{Unit Objectives}
- Introduction and definition of terms
- Explain types of immunity and immunizable diseases
- Describe immunization schedules and complications associated with immunization
- Discuss storage of vaccines

An antigen or immunogen
- The principle part of any vaccine and has evolved over several years from killed or denatured whole bacterium or viruses, to parts of the disease causing agent such as the capsule or genetically engineered components that mimic the disease causing agent Diluents Includes water, aqueous buffer (such as buffered saline), alcohols and polyols (e.g. glycerol).
- Vaccines marketed as suspensions or solutions already have the diluent constituted into the vaccine.
- Some diluents are provided separately from the lyophilized (freeze dried) vaccine for reconstitution at the time of use.

\section*{Preservatives}
- Chemical additives to vaccines to ensure that it remains microbiologically stable.
- That is, preservatives prevent the growth of microorganism and fungi during the long time of storage as well as during its use (especially with multi-dose vials).
- Common preservatives include formaldehyde, phenol, organic mercury (thiomersal).

\section*{Stabilizers}
- are chemical substances added to vaccines in micro-quantities to maintain vaccine integrity under varying external conditions of temperature and light, and also to sustain physical properties such as solubility Adjuvants
- are substances that are added to some vaccines to increase the body's immune response to the immunogen
- Examples are aluminum hydroxide gel, emulsigen, aluminium phosphate, calcium phosphate etc. Preservatives
- Not all vaccines contain preservatives.
- Freeze dried measles and BCG vaccines do not need preservatives because, if handled correctly, they are not in a liquid state long enough to become contaminated and overgrown with organisms such as staphylococcus.
- Equally important, a preservative in a live-attenuated vaccine would kill or damage the immunogen and make the vaccine useless.
- However preservatives are critical to reduce contamination of multi-dose vials of liquid preparations whose rubber stoppers are pricked with needles severally during their use.

\section*{Introduction}
- The Government of Kenya is a signatory to the Alma Ata World Health Assembly declaration in 1978 that formed the basis for the launching of Expanded Programmes on Immunization in many parts of the world.
- The Ministry of Health is still committed to the goals outlined in the Alma Ata declaration and continues to sponsor vaccination against the initial six diseases of childhood prescribed at that time. These are: o Tuberculosis - BCG vaccine o Polio - Oral Polio Vaccine
- Diphtheria - Diphtheria toxoid vaccine
- Whooping cough - Whole cell Pertussis vaccine
- Tetanus - Tetanus toxoid vaccine
- Measles - Measles vaccine
- The Ministry of Health established The Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunization (KEPI) in 1980 with the main aim of providing immunization against the six killer diseases of childhood
- The immunization is provided to all children in the country before their first birthday, and tetanus toxoid vaccination to all pregnant women
- KEPI was part of the global Expanded Programmes on Immunization (EPIs), whose main goal was to control killer vaccine- preventable diseases of childhood
- Prior to 1980 vaccination services had been provided on an ad-hoc basis mainly through primary schools and the larger health institutions and facilities
- Since 2001, the Ministry of Health has endorsed the introduction of new vaccines namely; o Yellow fever in 2 counties of the country o Hepatitis B vaccine o Haemophilus Influenza type B vaccine
- In 2011: o Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
- Planned in 2013 o Rotavirus vaccine and measles second dose

\section*{Types of immunity}

\section*{What is immunity?}

Immunity is the ability of the body to protect against all types of foreign bodies like bacteria, virus, toxic substances, etc. which enter the body Immunity is also called disease resistance The lack of immunity is known as susceptibility

\section*{Innate/ Natural/ Non-specific Immunity}
- Innate immunity is inherited by the organism from the parents and protects it from birth throughout life
- As its name nonspecific suggests that it lacks specific responses to specific invaders
- Innate immunity or nonspecific immunity is well done by providing different barriers to the entry of the foreign agents into our body
- Innate immunity consists of four types of barriers- physical, physiological, cellular and cytokine barriers

\section*{Acquired/adaptive/ specific immunity}
- The immunity that an individual acquires after the birth is called acquired or adaptive or specific immunity
- It is specific and mediated by antibodies or lymphocytes or both which make the antigen harmless
- It not only relieves the victim of the infectious disease but also prevents its further attack in future
- The memory cells formed by B cells and T cells are the basis of acquired immunity
- Thus acquired immunity consists of specialized B and T lymphocytes and Antibodies

Types of acquired Immunity
a) Active Immunity:
- In this immunity a person's own cells produce antibodies in response to infection or vaccination.
- It is slow and takes time in the formation of antibodies.
- It is long lasting and is harmless.
- Active immunity may be natural or artificial.
- A person who has recovered from an attack of small pox or measles or mumps develops natural active immunity.
- Artificial active immunity is the resistance induced by vaccines. Examples of vaccines are as follows:
- Bacterial vaccines e.g. o Live- BCG vaccine for tuberculosis o Killed vaccines- TAB vaccine for enteric fever.
- Viral vaccines e.g.

Live - Sabin vaccine for poliomyelitis o MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella o Killed vaccines- Salk vaccine for poliomyelitis

Toxoids for Diphtheria and Tetanus.
b) Passive Immunity:
- When ready-made antibodies are directly injected into a person to protect the body against foreign agents, it is called passive immunity.
- It provides immediate relief.
- It is not long lasting.
- Passive immunity may be natural or artificial
c) Natural passive immunity is the resistance passively transferred from the mother to the foetus through placenta.
- IgG antibodies can cross placental barrier to reach the foetus.
- After birth, immunoglobulin's are passed to the new-born through the breast milk. Human colostrum (mother's first milk) is rich in IgA antibodies.
- Mother's milk contains antibodies which protect the infant properly by the age of three months.
d) Artificial passive immunity is the resistance passively transferred to a recipient by administration of antibodies
- This is done by administration of hyper-immune sera of man or animals
- Serum contains antibodies
- For example, anti-tetanus serum (ATS) is prepared in horses by active immunisation of horses with tetanus toxoid, bleeding them and separating the serum for passive immunisation against tetanus

\section*{Immunizable diseases}
i. Measles
- Measles can be defined as an acute and highly infectious illness transmitted through the respiratory droplets or contact with nasal and throat secretions of the infected person.
- The first sign of infection is usually high fever which begins approximately 10 to 12 days after exposure and lasts one to seven days.
- During the initial stage, the patient may develop coryza (runny nose), cough, red and watery eyes and small white spots inside the cheeks known as Koplik spots.
- After 4-7 days, a rash develops, usually on the face and upper neck
- Over a period of about three days, the rash proceeds downward, eventually reaching the hands and feet.
- The rash lasts for five to six days, and then fades.
- The rash occurs, on average, on day 14 after exposure to the virus, with a range of seven to 18 days Measles Treatment
- Measles is a viral infection hence has no specific treatment is available, management is purely supportive especially to prevent complications. Measles Vitamin A supplementation during measles outbreaks
- Measles infection and outbreaks are used as an opportunity to administer supplementary doses of vitamin A Measles Prevention
- Vaccination with measles vaccine is the only preventive method
- The measles vaccine is a live hyper-attenuated preparation derived from the Edmonston strain of the measles virus cultured on human diploid cells.
- Measles vaccine is available in a monovalent formulation or in combination with mumps and rubella vaccine formulation (MMR).
- The monovalent preparation is administered at 9 months of age in the Kenya routine immunization schedule for infants primarily because measles occurs frequently in infants less than one year

\section*{Tuberculosis}
- Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculi whose spread is airborne or by droplet transmission
- It usually attacks the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body including the bones, joints, skin and brain
- Tuberculosis is easily spread through the air when infectious people cough, sneeze, talk or spit, they expel the bacteria
- Just a small amount is enough for transmission
- Nearly all TB infections are latent, with carriers showing no symptoms and they are not infectious
- However, one in 10 will become sick with active TB in his or her lifetime due primarily to a weakened immune system Treatment
- TB is treatable using various regimens of anti-TB drugs as per current guidelines from the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme

Page 67 of 87
- However the greatest challenge to the control of tuberculosis is the emergence of multidrug resistance types. Prevention
- The only available vaccine against tuberculosis has been available for over 40 years.
- The BCG vaccine has variable efficacy or protection against tuberculosis (TB) ranging from $6080 \%$ for a period ranging from 10-15 years. Available vaccine preparations: Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated bacterial vaccine named after the original two researchers
- The current preparation is prepared from an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis
- BCG is prepared in multi-dose lyophilized (freeze dried) containing 20 doses per vial, and also as a liquid formulation of single doses Schedules
- At birth and up to 59 months of age Dose
- 0.05 ml for infants' less than one year old, and 0.1 ml for children above 1 year. MOH position on BCG re-vaccination: Infants who do not develop a scar more than 6 weeks after vaccination should be re-vaccinated once with a similar dose of BCG vaccine unless advised otherwise by a specialist.
- If the infant does not develop a scar after the second dose - do not repeat again.

\section*{ii. Tetanus}
- Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is caused by a bacillus Clostridium tetani that is present in the soil, in animal and human feces.
- After entering the body through a wound, the bacterium produces a neuro-toxin that causes spasms of all skeletal muscles making breathing and feeding difficult or impossible.
- Tetanus disease results in death if specialized care is not available.
- Neonatal tetanus affects newborn babies and results from contamination with tetanus spores that occurs when babies are delivered in unclean conditions.
- The incubation period is 3-28 days.
- Tetanus is the only vaccine-preventable disease that is not spread from person to person.

\section*{Prevention}
- Vaccination with five appropriately spaced doses of adsorbed tetanus toxoid is known to provide immunity against tetanus for up to 20 years for all recipients. This is also known as the 5-T.T. schedule.
- Survivors of tetanus disease do not develop reliable immunity to subsequent attacks and must still be vaccinated against the disease before discharge from hospital.
- Newborns can be protected from neonatal tetanus during the first 6 weeks of life through vaccination of pregnant women using the 5-T.T. schedule.
- However additional preventive measures such as clean delivery and clean cord care practices have to be observed.
- At the age of 6 weeks the infant should receive tetanus toxoid vaccination in combination vaccines as per the EPI schedule so as to stimulate its own antibody formation.

\section*{5- T.T. Schedule for pregnancy}

\section*{5- T.T. Schedule for occupational prophylaxis}

Whooping cough Definition
- Pertusis is a life threatening disease of childhood caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis.
- Pertussis, also called whooping cough, is a highly contagious, acute bacterial disease affecting the respiratory tract.
- Pertussis presents as protracted fits of coughing lasting at least two weeks.

\section*{Prevention}
- Prevention of pertusis is through routine vaccination of all infants less than 1 year of age with three doses of DPT-HepB-Hib vaccine, which contains preferably inactivated (killed) wholecell pertussis.
- The vaccine is administered in three doses at intervals of 4 weeks in a combination preparation with diphtheria, tetanus toxoid, hepatitis B and Haemophyllus influenza type b. (Penta valent)
- The infant schedule for pertussis containing vaccine is at 6,10 \& 14 weeks of age.

\section*{Diphtheria}
- Diphtheria is a life threatening bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, transmitted from person to person through close physical and respiratory contact.
- It is an illness characterized by laryngitis, pharyngitis or tonsillitis and a pathognomonic adherent membrane of the tonsils and pharynx.
- The only known host is man.
- Although the causative organism is corynebacterium diphtheriae the disease is actually results from the toxin produced by this organism.

\section*{Prevention}
- Primary prevention of disease is by ensuring high population immunity through immunization. Vaccination Schedule
- Diphtheria toxoid containing vaccine is administered in three doses at intervals of 4 weeks in a combination preparation with pertussis, tetanus toxoid, hepatitis B and Haemophyllus influenza type b.
- The infant schedule for diphtheria toxoid containing vaccine is at $6,10 \& 14$ weeks of age.

\section*{Polio}
- Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus.
- It invades the nervous system, and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
- The virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine.
- Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs.
- One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis (usually in the legs).
- Among those paralysed, $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.

\section*{Prevention}
- Vaccination is the only proven method Available vaccine preparation
- Live attenuated and killed polio virus vaccines Schedule for trivalent OPV
- In Kenya infants receive 4 doses of trivalent OPV before one year of age:
- 1st dose is given immediately at birth or within two weeks of birth. This is known as the "birth dose" or "Zero dose"
- The other 3 doses should be given at 6,10 \& 14 weeks of age
- Route of administration and Dosage: 2 drops administered orally constitute one dose.
- Booster doses: no routine booster doses are given above 14 weeks of age, however supplementary doses are given during mass vaccination campaigns using an appropriate mono or bivalent poliovirus vaccines

\section*{Hepatitis Hepatitis A}
- Hepatitis A is an acute, usually self-limiting disease of the liver caused by Hepatitis A virus (HAV).
- Hepatitis A disease is primarily a disease of children and is transmitted from person to person through the faecal-oral route directly or indirectly.
- The virus is highly stable to physical and chemical agents and retains its infectivity for prolonged periods in the environment, water and food.
- Hepatitis A infection presents variably from a total absence of symptoms to a fulminant disease (severe impairment of hepatic functions in the absence of preexisting liver disease) and occasionally death.

\section*{Treatment}
- No specific antiviral therapy is currently available and management remains largely supportive with use of vitamins and reduction on stress to the liver function.
- Prevention
- Several inactivated or live attenuated vaccines against hepatitis A have been developed, but only four inactivated hepatitis A vaccines are currently available internationally.
- All four vaccines are similar in terms of efficacy and side-effect profile.
- The vaccines are given parenteral, in two-dose regimens, 6-18 months apart.

\section*{Hepatitis C}
- Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV).
- HCV infection sometimes results in an acute symtomatic illness.
- It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
- HCV is transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected person.
- Treatment: HCV infection is curable using increasingly effective antivirals.
- Hepatitis C vaccine: Despite ongoing research, there is currently no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C virus infection.

\section*{Kenyan Immunization schedule}

\section*{Complications associated with immunization}
- Adverse events following immunizations (AEFIs)
- Definition: This is a reaction that occurs in a client/patient following vaccination that is considered to be related to the vaccine until proved otherwise.
- AEFI occur even in the most careful circumstances but only rarely is there a direct causal relationship between the vaccine and the adverse event.
- AEFIs may be localized to the injection site or generalized to the whole body.
- AEFIs may be classified as mild, moderate or severe.
- AEFIs may manifest immediately after vaccination or any time within 48 hours after vaccination.
- Some AEFIs are recognized inherent side effects of vaccines e.g. OPV and vaccine induced paralytic polio. Steps to take when an AEFI occurs
- The following AEFI should be detected and reported by health workers:
- Injection site abscesses
- BCG lymphadenitis (Enlargement in the lymph nodes, usually due to infection)
- Deaths that are thought by health worker or the public to be related to immunization
- Cases requiring admission that are thought by health worker or public to be related to immunization
- Other unusual or severe medical incidents that are thought by health workers or the public to be related to vaccination
- Storage of vaccines
- Maintenance of the Cold Chain
- The cold-chain must be maintained at all times along the supply/chain to ensure vaccine potency at the time of administration to a client.
- Cold-chain efficacy will be gauged as follows:
- Assessment of the integrity of the Vaccine Vial Monitors (VVMs) on each vaccine vial.
- Through temperature recordings of the vaccine refrigerator at least twice a day
- Verification of thermometer readings of the vaccine refrigerator
- Provision and availability of alternative energy sources for the vaccine refrigerator (i.e. extra full gas cylinder or stand-by generator) Storage and transportation of vaccines \& diluents
- At all stages of vaccine transportation a cold chain monitor must always accompany all vaccines whether in cold boxes, vaccine carriers or portable fridges and the temperature reading must be maintained between $+2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $+8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at all times using conditioned ice packs. However, at facility level, all diluents must be stored in the vaccine refrigerator and in the same tray as their respective vaccines.
- This is to ensure that diluents are at the same temperature as their respective vaccines at the time of reconstitution.
- This also ensures that the vaccine potency is not compromised.
- Diluents supplied with vaccines are specific for the vaccine, since they contain certain chemicals to stabilize the vaccine or potentiate the immune response or protect the reconstituted vaccine from bacterial contamination.
- It is essential that diluents are stored, distributed and used correctly.
- Incorrect handling of diluents may cause adverse events following vaccination.
- Nothing else should be stored in vaccine cold chain equipment except vaccines, and diluents.
- However there is special authorization for storage of key pharmaceuticals such as insulin and syntocinon in disadvantaged level 2 \& 3 health facilities -but these items must be clearly separated from the vaccines and be clearly labeled.
- NB: Laboratory reagents must never be stored in the vaccine refrigerators.
- All vaccine refrigerators and freezers, should have an emergency plan pasted/displayed on the doors indicating the actions that should be taken in case of failure/breakdown.
- This should include the telephone numbers of the supervisors and the local refrigeration technician.

\section*{UNIT 11: CHILD SPACING AND FAMILY PLANNING}

\section*{Unit Objectives}
- Introduction and definition of terms
- Discuss Key concepts
- Outline importance of child spacing and family planning
- Describe methods of family planning

\section*{Child spacing}
- Refers to the time between the birth of one child and the birth of the next one Family planning
- Is the practice of controlling the number of children in a family and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of artificial contraception or voluntary sterilization
- Family Planning is when a couple decides on how many children to have and when to have their children
- Family Planning prevents too many, too early, too late or too frequent births
- Mothers and babies are healthier when risky pregnancies are avoided
- Smaller families mean more money and food for each child
- Parents have more time to work and to be with family
- Delaying child bearing helps young people stay in school
- Prevents abortion from unplanned pregnancies

\section*{Health Effects of different birth intervals}
- When considering the health of a mother and her children, one of the most important factors is the length of time between births
- This time between births is called birth interval
- A short birth interval (around 1 year), means a mother is nearly always pregnant and will give birth to many children and hence is at a higher risk for poor health and nutrition status A longer birth interval of 2-3 years is better
- Importance of child spacing to the community
- Provides safe environment (reduced crime, reduced spread of diseases, adequate employment etc.) Conservation of resources e.g. forest and sanitary surrounding
- Advancing community development, education, health technology, and security
- Adequate health facilities and water supply
- Importance of child spacing to the child/ children
- Spacing helps the children to have a chance to develop to their full physical and mental potential
- The child is well nourished from conception to birth and continuation to early childhood, which enhances proper growth and development
- The child is given adequate care, love and emotional support, which are important aspects of development
- Spacing allows for breastfeeding to continue to 2 years of age or even longer and this improves the child's health
- Spacing prevents malnutrition for the older children because food is sufficient for them to grow
- It prevents overcrowding in the family, which prevents spreading of infections and home accidents
- It reduces infant mortality
- Importance of child spacing to the mother
- It helps the mother to be both physically and mentally prepared, which helps her to provide the children with a good start in life
- Spacing allows the mother to get nourished, because pregnancy uses a considerable amount of minerals and other nutrients reserved in the mother's body
- Family planning reduces the need for unsafe abortion, especially if the pregnancy was unplanned
- Spacing allows easier parenting for the mother, thus permits enough and sufficient time for bonding
- Spacing reduces maternal mortality
- It enhances the mother`s health status

\section*{Importance of child spacing to the father}
- It makes it easy for the father to provide and care for the family
- It makes it easy to fulfill the basic needs of the family i.e. food, shelter and clothing
- Spacing helps the father to be able to educate his children without much struggle

\section*{Methods of family planning}

Short Acting Methods i. Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills
- E.g. Microgynon or Femiplan What it is
- Has two hormones (oestrogen and progestin) in it
- Prevents release of egg (ovum), and blocks sperm from meeting egg Who can use
- Women of child bearing age Who cannot use
- Women who are pregnant
- Breastfeeding mothers with babies less than six months old How to use
- Take one pill every day at the same time
- When you finish a pack of 21 pills, rest for seven days and start a new pack on the eighth day.
- If using 28-pill pack start a new pack the next day If you miss a pill
- If you miss 3 pills or more in a week 3, SKIP the remaining pills and start a new pack; use condom or abstain for the next 7 days if missed any of the last 7 pills (iron pills in a 28- pill pack), discard the missed pills and continue taking What to expect
- Change in bleeding patterns (irregular, light, or absence of periods)
- Some women have stomach upset or mild headaches that go away after the first three months
- Some women may experience nausea (ask them to take pill with food)
- Does not disrupt existing pregnancy
- Use condoms for protection against STI‘s including HIV.

\section*{Advantages of the pill}
- Safe
- Effective when a pill is taken every day
- Less monthly bleeding and cramps
- Can be stopped any time if the woman desires pregnancy
- Can be provided by trained non-technical staff e.g. Community
- Health Workers/Community Based Distributors (CHV/CBDs)

\section*{iii. Mini pill (e.g. Microlut) What it is}
- Safe and most effective when used while breastfeeding less than 6 months after delivery
- A pill with progestin hormone in it
- Blocks sperms from reaching the egg (ovum) suppresses ovulation Who can use
- Women of child bearing age
- Women who are breastfeeding and baby is less than six months
- Women who can follow a daily routine of pill taking Who cannot use
- Women who are breastfeeding infants more than six months of age
- Women with breast lumps or breast cancer
- Women with yellow discoloration of eyes
- Women with blood clots in their legs or lungs
- Women taking drugs for TB, epilepsy, or HIV How to use
- If breastfeeding, can start 4 weeks after childbirth
- Take one pill at the same time every day
- When you finish a pack of pills, start a new pack the next day Late taking pill, for women who are breastfeeding:
- Take a pill as soon as you remember, and continue taking pills
- Late taking pill, for women who are not breastfeeding:
- If you take a pill more than three hours late, use condoms for the next 2 days and keep taking pills What to expect, if not breastfeeding
- Changes in monthly bleeding including irregular bleeding, spotting, heavier bleeding or no monthly bleeding, are common, safe and not life threatening
- Nausea and dizziness Note:
- These effects are temporary and will disappear with time. If it bothers you or persists refer to the nearest health facility
- Does not affect breast milk production
- Use condoms for protection against STIs including HIV/AIDS
- Emergency contraceptive pill
- e.g. E pill What it is
- Pills used to prevent pregnancy within 120 hours after unprotected sex.
- The earlier they are taken the better How it works
- Works primarily by preventing or delaying the release of eggs from the ovaries so no egg can be fertilized It can be taken in the following situations:
- If the condom breaks
- If one misses to get her pills
- If one has unprotected sex and does not want pregnancy Advantages:
- Safe
- Effective and easy to use
- No medical exam
- No Pregnancy tests necessary
- Note:
- Does not disrupt existing pregnancy and should not be used as a regular method

\section*{iv. Injectable contraceptive What it is}
- Injections given every 1 month, 2 months or 3 months
- Injectable contraceptive given every 3 months. Works primarily by preventing eggs from leaving the ovaries Who can use
- Women of reproductive age who desire highly effective and long term protection against pregnancy
- Breastfeeding mothers 4 weeks after delivery
- Women who cannot use contraceptives that contain estrogen
- HIV positive women
- Women who have miscarried or had still birth Who cannot use
- Women who are pregnant or suspected to be pregnant
- Women with breastfeeding babies less than 4 weeks after delivery
- Women with abnormal vaginal bleeding How to use
- Get one injection every thirteen weeks (three months)
- Start anytime you are sure that the client is not pregnant. For women who are breastfeeding wait until four weeks postpartum
- If starting after the first seven days of a menstrual cycle, don't have sex for seven days or use a condom If late for an injection
- Can still get an injection up to 4 weeks late
- If later, use condoms and return for an injection as soon as possible.

What to expect
- Irregular bleeding at first, then spotting or no monthly bleeding is common and safe
- Possible slight weight change
- After stopping injections, it can take several months to become pregnant
- Note:
- These effects are common and safe. However, visit your nearest
- health facility if they persist and bother you
- Does not cause infertility
- Use condoms if you need protection from STIs or HIV
- Very effective when injections are given on time and are safe
- Use can be kept private

\section*{v. Male Condom What it is}
- A thin rubber covering that fits over the erect penis and keeps sperms out of the vagina Who can use condoms
- Men who wish to participate actively in Family Planning
- Couples needing a backup method (e.g. for missed pills)
- Couples who do not have sex frequently and do not need continual protection
- Couples who want protection from STIs including HIV Who should not use condoms
- Couples who cannot use condoms consistently and correctly
- Those allergic to rubber (does not apply to female condoms which are made of plastic)
- Note:
- Can be used with other Family Planning methods to prevent sexually-transmitted infections including HIV
- Partners must agree to use
- Does not have any side effects

\section*{vi. Female Condom}
- Plastic covering inserted into the vagina before sex and keeps sperms out of the vagina Who can use and who cannot use (refer to male condom) How to use
- Insert new female condom into vagina before every sex act
- Dispose of properly in pit latrine or burn
- Make sure penis enters inside the condom ring and stays in during sex
- Note:
- Can be used with other Family Planning methods to prevent sexually-transmitted infections including HIV
- Important to use correctly every time you have sex
- Partners must agree to use
- Emergency contraceptive pills can be used if condom slips or is not used correctly

\section*{vii. Lactation Amenorrhea Method/ Breast feeding method}
- Temporary method based on the absence of eggs as a result of exclusive breastfeeding How it Works
- LAM provides natural protection against pregnancy when all of these conditions are met:
- A mother is fully breastfeeding
- The baby is less than six months old
- The mother has not resumed her monthly period (i.e. the bleeding is absent) How to Use
- Baby breastfeeds on demand both day and night, and giving no other food or liquids
- When the baby begins to have food or drink other than breast milk, LAM is less effective and one can get pregnant even before the first monthly period after delivery Note:
- Have another method ready to start at 6 months or before, if monthly bleeding returns or breastfeeding decreases
- Use condoms if you need protection from STIs including HIV

\section*{viii. Standard Days Method}
- A simple fertility awareness-based method that relies on a "standard rule" or a fixed "window" of fertility that makes it easy for women to know when they are likely to become pregnant
- Note:
- Works best for women with regular menstrual cycles that are between 26 and 32 days long.
- Women with cycles outside this range should use a different method of Family Planning
- Partners/couples must avoid sex or use condoms for up to 19 days in a row, every month hence need for cooperation
- No side-effects
- Can be used by couples with religious or cultural restrictions on other methods
- Use condoms for protection against STIs including HIV

\section*{Long Acting and Permanent Methods (LAPM)}

\section*{i. Implant}
- Small rods placed inside the upper arm
- Used by a woman
- Effective for between 3 to 5 years
- Can be removed any time a woman wants to get pregnant
- One of the most effective methods
- Do not protect against STIs
- Provided at the health facility by a trained health provider

\section*{ii. Intrauterine Device (IUD)}
- A small, flexible -Tll shaped plastic wrapped in copper wire that is put in the womb
- Used by a woman
- Effective for between 10-12 years
- One of the most effective methods
- Can be removed any time a woman wants to get pregnant
- Do not protect against STIs
- Provided at the health facility by a trained health provider

\section*{iii. 3 Female Sterilization}
- A simple operation that makes sure a woman will not have more children
- One of the most effective methods
- Do not protect against STIs
- Provided at the health facility by a trained health provider
- iv. Male Sterilization
- A simple operation that makes sure a man will not have more children
- One of the most effective methods have to use a backup method for 3 months before it becomes effective
- Provided at the health facility by a trained health provider
- Do not protect against STIs
- Not castration

\section*{Summary}
- Counseling is an important prerequisite for the initiation and continuation of a Family Planning methods
- Service providers must keep in mind that it is only condoms (male and female) that are known to provide protection against both STIs (including HIV), and pregnancy
- Contraceptives should be provided to clients in accordance with the approved methodspecific guidelines and job-aids, by providers who have been trained in provision of that method
- All clients who choose a Family Planning method must be informed of the appropriate follow up requirements and be encouraged to return to the service provider should they have any concerns
