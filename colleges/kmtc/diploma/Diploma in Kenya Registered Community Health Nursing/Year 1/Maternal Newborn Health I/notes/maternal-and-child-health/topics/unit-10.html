                         <p>- Common preservatives include formaldehyde, phenol, organic mercury (thiomersal).</p>

                         <p>- Freeze dried measles and BCG vaccines do not need preservatives because, if handled correctly, they are not in a liquid state long enough to become contaminated and overgrown with organisms such as staphylococcus.</p>
                         <p>- Equally important, a preservative in a live-attenuated vaccine would kill or damage the immunogen and make the vaccine useless.</p>
                         <p>- However preservatives are critical to reduce contamination of multi-dose vials of liquid preparations whose rubber stoppers are pricked with needles severally during their use.</p>
