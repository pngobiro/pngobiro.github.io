                     </h3>
                     <div class="content-card">
                         <p>A good nutritional status maintained before and throughout pregnancy decreases the risk of birth defects, suboptimal foetal growth and development as well as chronic health problems later in life. Nutrient requirements during pregnancy are not static.</p>
                         <p>They vary during the course of the pregnancy depending on a mother's pre-conception nutrition, body size and composition, physical activity level, stage of pregnancy and health status. A well-balanced diet consisting of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals should be consumed.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.1.1 Energy, proteins and fats</h4>
                         <p>Women should consume a minimum of <span class="math-inline">$175 \mathrm{~g} /$</span> day of carbohydrates in order to meet the foetal brain needs for glucose. In the first 28 days of pregnancy when there is extensive development of major organs e.g. the nervous system, the mother should consume sufficient carbohydrates. Basic foods such as vegetables, fruits and whole grain products contain fibre and phytochemicals which protect the body against rancidity and constipation.</p>
                         <p>
                            A pregnant woman needs extra 300calories above the RDA for a normal woman. Energy is
                            needed to spare proteins for its body building role. They need 60g/dl of protein for building body
                            tissues.
                         </p>
                         <p>Vegetarian women who omit all animal sources of proteins should consume enough legumes complementing with cereals in order to achieve all the essential amino acids into their bodies. The ingested protein is vital in tissue repair and foetal development. it is approximated that 925 g of proteins causes accumulation in the tissues. 440g are taken up by the foetus, 216 g used to increase maternal blood volume and extracellular fluid, 116 g is used by the uterus and 100 g taken by the placenta.</p>
                         <p>Proteins are vital for the synthesis of important organs that support foetal development e.g. the placenta. A mother should eat meat, dried beans, eggs, chicken and milk products in order to get enough proteins.</p>
                         <p>Pregnant women require <span class="math-inline">$33 \%$</span> of the total calories from fat. For instance, in the <span class="math-inline">$1^{\text {st }}$</span> trimester, foods rich in essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6) are needed. Docosahexanoic acid(DHA) and eicosapentanoic acid(EPA) sourced in flaxseed, cooking oil, walnut, soybean, canola oil and green leafy vegetables are important for foetal development i.e. In the formation of the central nervous system.</p>
                         <p>Fats also facilitate the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Women who consume adequate amounts of EFAs have healthy children whose nervous system and alphactory systems are well developed.</p>
                         <p>Furthermore, sufficient intake of EPA and DHA tends to prolong gestation period by averagely 4 days hence decreasing risks of preterm delivery. Most importantly, fat intake should be observed throughout the gestational period since the development of vital foetal organs, nervous system inclusive proceeds postpartum. Other dietary sources include fish and fish oils.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.1.2 Vitamins</h4>
                         <p>Folate and vitamin B12 are needed in large amounts during pregnancy. They are important in rapid cell differentiation. Pregnant mothers should consume 600ug/day of folate for increase in red blood cells and prevention of neural tube defects in the foetus.</p>
                         <p>The <span class="math-inline">$1^{\text {st }}$</span> trimester is a critical period whereby there is formation and closure of the neural tube which develops, forming the brain and spinal cord. In the <span class="math-inline">$1^{\text {st }} 2$</span> weeks, a woman may not realise that she is pregnant but there is need for folate for the formation and closure of the neural tube by week 6.</p>
                         <p>Unless the mother consumes sufficient folate, anencephaly and spina bifida will occur. In case of anencephaly, the infant dies shortly after birth.</p>
                         <p>Supplementation of <span class="math-inline">$400 \mathrm{ug} / \mathrm{d}$</span> folate is recommended as well as intake of folate-rich foods such as cereals, bagel, rice, liver, lentils, chickpeas, asparagus, spinach, avocado, oranges etc. For pregnant mothers, they require vitamin B12 to aid folate in making new cells. Vegans require supplementation since vitamin B12 is found only in animal sources.</p>
                         <p>Vitamin A should be obtained from dietary sources such as carrots, green leafy vegetables and deep-yellow fruits. Supplementation is prohibited due to the teratogenic effects to the foetus. Therefore, they should consume vitamin A not exceeding 5000ug/d in order to avoid retinoic acid syndrome to the foetus.</p>
                         <p>Vitamin D supports foetal development, the addition of calcium to bone, tooth and enamel formation. Lack of vitamin D during pregnancy compromises foetal as well as childhood bone development. The infant may also suffer from hypocalcemia. Vitamin D also supports the immune system of the body. Preeclampsia, maternal infection, preterm babies and miscarriages are consequences of maternal vitamin D deficiency.</p>
                         <p>Obese women are at increased risk of vitamin D due to low release levels from their fat deposits. Vegan women are also at greater risk if their dietary intake and exposure to sunlight is not put in check. The RDA for vitamin D for pregnant women is thus 0.055 mg from fortified foods or from sun exposure.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.1.3 Minerals</h4>
                         <p>Calcium is vital for fetal development throughout the gestational period. It is important in bone mineralization in both the mother and the foetus. Calcium works with magnesium and phosphorous to build bones.</p>
                         <p>Intestinal absorption of calcium doubles in pregnancy so mothers should consume calcium-rich foods. Calcium added to a mother's bones prior to conception is depleted to build foetal bones. In the final weeks of pregnancy, 300 mg/day is transferred to the foetus thus the need for increased maternal calcium intake to prevent osteoporosis and teeth dentures.</p>
                         <p>Meanwhile pregnant mothers need 600 mg/day of calcium, 30 mg/day iron and 15 mg/day zinc. There is need to increase maternal daily intake of milk, cheese, yoghurt and other calcium-rich foods.</p>
                         <p>Magnesium is needed for bone and tissue growth. The foetus draws iron from maternal stores to create its own in order to sustain it throughout the <span class="math-inline">$1^{\text {st }}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$2^{\text {nd }}$</span> trimesters. The RDA is 320 mg/day Maternal losses of iron are inevitable especially during delivery to caesarean section this derails the mothers iron status. All pregnant mothers should be subjected to 30 mg/day of iron supplementation in the <span class="math-inline">$2^{\text {nd }}$</span> and <span class="math-inline">$3^{\text {rd }}$</span> trimester. Iron needs increase in pregnancy about 1 g increase per day. 300 mg is used by the foetus and the placenta, 250 g is lost at delivery and 450 mg is used to increase red blood cells' mass.</p>
                         <p>Iron intake will reduce the risk of iron-deficiency anaemia, a common problem in pregnant women. Total needs for iron during pregnancy is 5.5 mg/day but in order to achieve this, about 27 mg/day should be consumed in order to cater for the 20% that will not be absorbed. In order to maximise iron absorption, pregnant mothers should eat foods rich in vitamin c. Fluoride can also be consumed in form of supplements for mothers who are deficient so as to boost bone mineralisation.</p>
                         <p>Iodine is important in the formation and function of the thyroid glands. These glands secrete hormones which are important in various psychological activities in the body. Foetal brain developments and energy productions are rather important functions of iodine.</p>
                         <p>This is vital in the <span class="math-inline">$1^{\text {st }}$</span> trimester especially and is also needed throughout the pregnancy. Iodine deficiency that affects children leads to hypothyroidism, cretinism and goitre. A pregnant woman should consume iodised-tabled salt, shellfish, seaweed and some type of tea that is iodideconstituent.</p>
                         <p>They should consume 0.22 mg/d but should not exceed 1.1 mg/d.</p>
                         <p>Sodium found abundantly in common salt as sodium chloride, maintains the body's water balance. During pregnancy, maternal plasma volume increases. Pregnant mothers should ingest food enriched with sodium chloride in limited amounts to avoid risks of oedema and preeclampsia.</p>

                    </h3>
                     <div class="content-card">
                         <p>Pregnancy weight gain recommendations are based on a woman's pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), a measure of body weight relative to height. These guidelines, provided by organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM), vary according to the BMI category.</p>
                         <p>For women who are underweight, with a BMI less than 18.5, the recommended total weight gain during pregnancy is typically between 28-40 pounds (about 12.5-18 kilograms). Weight gain in this category tends to be slow in the first trimester, with most of it occurring during the second and third trimesters.</p>
                         <p>Women in the normal weight range, with a BMI of 18.5-24.9, are advised to gain around 25-35 pounds (about 11.5-16 kilograms) during pregnancy. Weight gain for this group is usually spread relatively evenly across the three trimesters. Overweight women, with a BMI between 25-29.9, are recommended to gain 15-25 pounds (about 7-11.5 kilograms). Weight gain may be slower in the first trimester, with more gradual increases as the pregnancy progresses.</p>
                         <p>Women with obesity, having a BMI greater than 30 , should aim to gain 11-20 pounds (about 5-9 kilograms) during pregnancy. Weight gain for this group may be slower overall, but it's important for them to discuss weight management with their healthcare provider to minimize risks associated with obesity during pregnancy.</p>
                         <p>While these are general guidelines, individual variations are common, and pregnant individuals should work closely with their healthcare providers, such as obstetricians or midwives, to receive personalized guidance. Weight gain should be gradual and appropriately distributed throughout the trimesters to support the growing fetus while minimizing the risk of complications, such as gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. Monitoring and discussing weight gain throughout pregnancy with a healthcare provider is essential to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the baby.</p>
