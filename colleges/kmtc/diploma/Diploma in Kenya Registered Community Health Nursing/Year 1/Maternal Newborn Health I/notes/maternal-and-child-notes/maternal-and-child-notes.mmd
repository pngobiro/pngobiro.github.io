\section*{Definition of terms}

Conception-fertilizationn of an ovum by a sperm
Zygote-a fertilized ovum undergoes call division and becomes implanted into the uterus
Embryo-is 8-27 weeks old. Number of cells doubles within 24 hours, has a complete central nervous system beating heart, digestive system, well identified finger and toes and beginning of facial features Fetus-is 7 months old embryo
Gestation-period from conception to birth ( $38-42 \mathrm{wks}$ ) with three trimesters
Placenta -organs that develops in the uterus in early pregnancy where maternal and fetal blood circulates closely to allow for exchange of materials (nutrients, oxygen, wastes and carbon dioxide)
Amniotic sac- bag of water in the uterus where the fetus floats
Umbilical cord- rope like structure through which the fetus veins and arteries reach the placenta. Is a route of nourishment and oxygen and waste disposal

\section*{PRENATAL CARE}

Also called antenatal care and is the regular medical and nursing care recommende for women during pregnancy or even before pregnancy
Is also the health care provided to women during pregnancy (screening tests and counseling)
Miscarriage is a spontaneous loss of a fetus before the $20^{\text {th }}$ week of pregnancy while ectopic pregnancy is apregnancy that occurs outside the womb (uterus) it is a life threatening condition to the mother abd the baby cannot survive
Neonatal period- $1^{\text {st }}-14^{\text {th }}$ days of a child life
Still birth is ababy born showing no signs of life and weighs over 1 kg or is 22 weeks of gestation
The aims /purpose of prenatal care
- Ensure that the mother reaches the end of the pregnancy healthy and physically and psychologically
- Ensure a mother delivers a healthy baby
- Prevent or treat pregnancy related complications

\section*{Importance of prenatal care}
1. The mother is taught how to look after herself and the baby (diet)
2. Mother is psychologically and physically prepared for delivery
3. Mother is treated against anemia and malaria and vaccinated against neonatal tetanus
4. Undercurrent illness are treated and those who need specialized care are referred
5. Pregnancy related abnormalities
6. Are corrected or referred to higher hospitals
7. Maternal difficulties like diabetes insufficient weight gain and high blood pressure are detected and corrected/treated/managed
8. Fetal heart beat of the fetus is checked
9. Position of the uterus and fetus is checked and any other abnormality like multiple fetuses

\section*{Aspects of prenatal care}

Aspects or activities in the antenatal clinic are usually divided into
- Activities on the first visit
- Activities on the subsequent visits
$1^{\text {st }}$ visits
$\checkmark$ Mother is registered and given an antenatal card
$\checkmark$ Weight and height, MUAC measurement are taken and recorded on the card
$\checkmark$ Full history of the mother and family is taken and at risk factors identified like age, occupation, level of education, history of former and current pregnancy (last periods), general medical history the pregnancy like TB and HIV/AIDS
$\checkmark$ Physical examination is done which include swelling of hands and feet
$\checkmark$ Blood pressure measurements
$\checkmark$ Urine test to measure sugar and protein levels which can indicate diabetes and pre-eclampsia
$\checkmark$ Fetal heart rate measurements
$\checkmark$ Prenatal screening tests i.e. blood test to check for anemia and HIV/AIDS status
$\checkmark$ Immunization against neonatal tetanus
$\checkmark$ Health education during and after pregnancy
Subsequent visits
$\checkmark$ Weight measurements
$\checkmark$ Examination on blood pressure, anemia and edema
$\checkmark$ Fetal heart rate monitoring
$\checkmark$ Fetal malformation, intrauterine growth retardation are monitored using ultra sound
$\checkmark$ Checking the amniotic fluid and umbilical card problem
$\checkmark$ Any other pregnancy related pregnancy
Problems during pregnancy
1. Constipation-caused by hormonal changes and is characterized by not passing stool as often as normal or strain in passing stool as stool are unusually hard, lumpy, large or small
-eat high fibre foods
-exercise regularly
-drink plenty of water
2. Cramps-sudden sharp pain in the calf muscles or feet commonly at night (cause is unknown) -have regular and gentle exercise particularly ankle and legs
3. Faintness-feeling of faint and is caused by hormonal changes occurring because of pregnancy the brain may not be getting enough oxygen
-try to get up slowly after sitting or lying down
-if standing, find a seat to sit
4. Incontinence-unable to prevent sudden spurt of urine or small leak when you cough, laugh, sneeze or get up from a sitting position because of pelvic muscles which relax slightly to prepare for baby's delivery
-do regular exercise
5. Skin and hair changes-due to hormonal changes causing a skin to darken a little or lighten in patches or allover or dark line down the middle of the stomach
6. Backache-due the weight on the uppet part of the body causing strain on the lower back. -wear comfortable shoes and have correct posture when sitting or walking
7. Anemia-due to increased iron needs by the growing fetus and the mother
8. Insomnia- difficulty in sleeping
9. Edema due the higher level of estrogen with encourage water retention
10. Heartburns- due to pressure of the growing fetus resulting to hydrochloric acid being pushed to the esophageal area
11. Pica-abnormal craving for non-food substances like clay
12. Nausea-(morning sickness)-due to hormonal changes taking place early in pregnancy
13. Gestational diabetes-

\section*{Potential hazards of pregnancy}
- Mothers age
- Alcohol abuse
- Chronic diseases requiring special diet
- Drug addition
- More the $20 \%$ overweight/more than $10 \%$ underweight
- Poverty
- Close and many pregnancies

\section*{THE NEW BORN BABY}

\section*{Characteristics}
- A normal full-term baby is one which is delivered after a period of 9 monthsor 38-42 weeks after conception
- At birth the baby weighs 3.5 kgs
- The baby cries loudly as soon as it is delivered
- Breathing take place immediately
- The baby is pink in color
- The baby is able to move both arms and legs
- The body may be covered with a yellow sticky substance called vernix which protects the skin while in the womb
- During the $1^{\text {st }}$ days of life a normal baby loses weight but should regain the birth weight by $7^{\text {th }}-14^{\text {th }}$ day

Care of a new born baby
- The mouth should be gently cleaned with a swap to remove any mucus which could be aspirated and prevent breathing

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Before cutting the umbilical cord the baby is held horizontally below the level of the mother for 1 minute ensuring that breathing has started satisfactory. This also ensures that the baby has gotten extra blood from the placenta. The cord is the cut and tied
- Eyes are gently wiped with a swap
- The baby is handed to the mother and permitted to suck the breast
- The baby is then place on a cot near the mother and is kept warm
- The bay is later in the due time given general examination which includes
-weight measurement which is plotted on the weight record chart
-examined for obvious congenital malformation eg cleft palate
-BCG-vaccination against tuberculosis is given

\section*{Common problems of a new born baby}

\section*{Problems immediately after birth}
- The baby fails to breath- if the baby does not breathe within 3 seconds the cord is cut immediately, mucus sucked from the nose, mouth and throat using an extractor, then tap the soles of the feet and breathing should begin immediately. If the breathing does not start within 1-2minute mouth to mouth breathing is done or oxygen is given to the baby
$\square$ Cyanosis-blue baby and may be due to disease of the heart or brain damage and the baby should be given expert attention
$\square$ Fits -is a convulsion in the new born and is mainly due to brain damage or low blood sugar
$\square$ Constipation-baby unable to empty their bowels within 24 hours after birth, seek medical attention
$\square$ Vomiting -occur as result of swallowing stool, mucus or blood during delivery causing irritation of the stomach. Can also result from congenital abnormality of the oesophagus, intestinal obstruction or overfeeding

\section*{Problems after 24 hour}
$\square$ Infections-e.g. skin infections, respiratory infections, diarrhea,tetanus and thrush
$\square$ Hemorrhage-bleeding may occur from the umbilicus or intestines between $2^{\text {nd }}-8^{\text {th }}$ daywhich could be caused by inability of the baby's blood unable to clot
$\square$ Jaundice-may be because of spread of general infections, or due to abnormality of the bile ducts in the liver or liver infection and the baby should be given medical attention
$\square$ Vomiting that is persistent, contains bile or is accompanied by constipation should be given medical attention
$\square$ Birth injury-occasionally the baby may be injured in different ways during birth $g$ fracture or nerve injury

\section*{Feeding the new born baby}

A normal full term baby breastfeeding should be initiated immediately after birth and continued exclusively for 6 months then complemented with other food after 6 months but breastfeeding should be continued up to 2 years and beyond.

\section*{Nutritional contents of breastmilk}
1. Carbohydrates in the form of lactose which is easy to digest
2. Fats which contain the essential fatty-acid linoleic acid
3. Protein alpha-lactalbumin which is easy to digest
4. All the vitamins except vitamin A
5. Mineral like calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc and little iron which is highly absorbable

\section*{Benefits of breast milk to the child}
- contains immunoglobulin A, lysozymes and lactoferrin which protect the baby against infections
- contains lactobacillus bifid us bacteria which is friendly and prevents development of harmful bacteria in the intestines of the infant
- protects the new born against allergy development during the vulnerable first few weeks of life
- the act of sucking favors a baby's normal tooth and jaw alignment
- breastfed babies are less likely to be obese because they are less likely to be overfed
- it is clean and at the right temperature
- it is convenient as the baby can breastfed on demand ,no preparations are needed
- bonds the child to the mother

\section*{Benefits of breastfeeding to the mother}
- it is cheaper than buying breast milk substitutes and fuel for cooking/preparing
- it is safe and easy to fed the child as it does not require preparing utensils
- breast feeding mothers have longer periods of infertility after birth
- breast feeding immediately after delivery encourages the contraction of the womb and helps the mother regain her figure quickly
- always available
- promotes bonding between the mother and the child

\section*{PREMATURITY}

According to WHO, premature baby is one who is born before 37 weeks of gestation counting from the first day of the last menstrual cycle. Premature birth carries greater risks when it occurs earlier before 37 weeks. Pre-term birth is a major determinant of neonatal mortality and morbidity and has long adverse effects consequences on health

Children born pre term have higher rates of cerebral palsy, sensory deficits, learning disabilities and respiratory illness

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

\section*{Causes of preterm delivery}

\section*{Premature rupture of membranes}

\section*{Preterm labor (no known cause)}

Bleeding during pregnancy (antepartum hemorrhage)

\section*{Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy}

\section*{Weak cervix (incompetent cervix)}

\section*{Other}

\section*{Characteristics of pre-term babies}
- low body fat that makes the infant to appear very thin
- shin traits-thin skin due to limited body fat where ribs can easily be seen
- hair-the very pre mature babies have no hair while the near full term babies have fuzz hair over the body
- sealed eyes especially if born prior to the $26^{\text {th }}$ week when the eyes normally open
- the infant has minimized movements and weak cries
- incomplete development of organs especially the lungs
- the infant are underweight and have difficulty in breathing

\section*{Care/ management of a premature child}

After the baby is born wrap it in a warm towel
Gently wipe out the mouth and gently aspirate with a rubber catheter to ensure air passage are clear (can administer oxygen if available)

To avoid infection to the baby nurses should wear masks and use aseptic or antiseptic during any conduct
Take temperature records every 4 hours

Keep the atmosphere moist to minimize evaporation from the shin and lungs of the baby

After the baby recovers from shock give a gentle cleaning after which to cover the whole body of the child except the face

\section*{Feeding a premature child}

Proper nutrition in infancy is essential for
- normal growth
- resistance to infection
- long term health
- optimal neurologic and cognitive development

Providing adequate nutrition to preterm infant is challenging because of problems unique to them i.e
- immature bowel function
- inability to suck and swallow
- illness that may interfere with adequate enteral feeding
- medical intervention that preclude feeding (umbilical cord catheter)

Methods of feeding
-when the infant have not yet developed sucking and swallowing they must be fed by oragastric tubes i.e. tubes fitted to reach the stomach
-if sucking and swallowing are possible use a breck-feeder i.e. a small bottle with a rubber nozzle
-if sucking is not possible use a cup and a spoon and progress slowly to breastfeeding
-the type of feed is breast milk and infant formula for preterm baby
-initiation of feeding, the volume and the rate of feeding depends on birth weight, gestational age and how the infant has tolerated feeds to date

\section*{Complication of premature birth}

Immature lungs-most babies have mature lungs by 36 weeks. Problems threat occur with immature lungs include respiratory distress syndrome

Pneumonia-

Absence of breathing a condition called apnea
Infections-premature babies may not be ready to light infection for their own and so they have to be put in an incubator to provide protection against potential infections

Jaundice-yellowish skin color due to build up of substances in the blood called bilirum

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)

Immature gastrointestinal and digestive system which is unable to absorb nutrients encouraging intravenous feeding

Intraventricular hemorrhage - before 34 weeks babies'have increased risk of bleeding in the brain due to immature blood veins

The babies have high risk of anemia due to low concentrations of red blood cells
Inability to maintain body heat due to little body fat and immature skin

\section*{LACTATION AND INFANT FORMULAS}

Infant formulas are made to imitate the breast milk but international standards have been set for nutrient of infant formulas, however other is high risks of contamination in infant formula for children in developing countries

Sometimes infant formula is over diluted to save money of due ignorance by the caregiver
Cow's milk is preferred to breast milk substitute for most mothers because it is easily available at an affordable price

Problems associated with infant formula and cow's milk include diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration which in turn lead to failure to absorb nutrients

\section*{Types of infant formulas}
1. Commercial formulas-are formulas closely proximate to human milk and are made from cow's milk. They are available in powder forms, liquid and ready to feedtypes/form.
-powder forms are more economical but require mixing and careful measuring
-liquid concentrated require proper dilution before use (ratio1:1)
-ready to feed are easiest to use and the most expensive
2. Soybean based formulas-infants who show signs of allergy to cows milk, when parents are strict vegetarian, soybean based formulas are used, they are fortified with vitamins and minerals.
3. Special formulas- are formulas which are necessary for infants with digestive disturbances, allergy or inborn errors of metabolism.

\section*{Preparation of infant formulas}
- Use a concentrated infant formula containing vitamins and irons
- Use bottles, caps, nipples cups and spoons that have been washed in clean water and dish washing soap/detergent, use a bottle brush, place the in boiling water for 3 minutes to ensure sterility
Squeeze water through the nipple holes to be sure they are open, rinse them well so that soap is gone and let them stand in a rack to dry
- Clean the top of the infant formula can with a soap and water and rinse
- Open the formula can with aclean opener and pour out unnecessary amount, cover the can with fresh foil or plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator/ cool place
- Pour the formula directly into the feeding bottle, use the marking on the bottle to measure one and half as much as the formula concentration as the total amount of formula you want in the bottle
- Add an equal amount of fresh water directly from the tap, put the nipple and cap

\section*{Bottle feeding}

Bottle feeding can be used as a substitute for breast feeding when it is absolutely necessary
Reasons for bottle feeding
- Mother is taking medication that contraindicate breast feeding
- Mother has a medical problem
- A mother chooses not to breastfed
- Mother is working

NB -Feeding time enhances mother-child relationship, a mother's touch for the baby is important in establishing a firm bond and so if a mother chooses to bottle fed, and the baby should be placed in the mother's arms
-bottle feeding also allows the father or sibling to feed the baby

\section*{Problems associated with bottle feeding}
1. Nursing bottle syndrome-is a condition in which the two front top teeth are severely decayed or completely eroded away in the older infant or child. It is caused by continuously suckling on a bottle that contains anything except plain water. Sleeping with a bottle is particularly harmful because of decreased salivary production which contains lysozymes that help clean the teeth and kill bacteria. The carbohydrate in milk also encourages the growth of bacteria
2. Milk anemia-this condition is caused when milk (not iron fortified) is consumed in large amounts that replaces the intakes of foods high in iron
3. Use of inappropriate liquids-the only appropriate liquids for regular use in a bottle are expressed breast milk, formula or water
4. Micro-wave heating- the excess stream that results when bottle are heated in a micro wave oven can cause bottles to explode in the infants face. 'Hot spots' can cause the infants mouth to be severely burned if there is contact. The safest way to heat a bottle is to allow very warm water from a faucet to flow over it until the chill is gone or stand it in a container with hot water.
5. Diarrhea and other digestive disturbances due to unhygienic cleaning of the bottles

\section*{Comparison of cow's milk and breast milk}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Breast milk & Cows milk \\
\hline -contain the whey type of proteins which is highly soluble and forms a soft curd which is easily digested and absorbed by the infant & -has 3 time more protein, high contents of casein (type of protein)a tough curd in the infants stomach \\
\hline -fat is easily digested and absorbed with lipase enzyme & -Fat is not easily digested and absorbed \\
\hline -Has less calcium but is easily digested and absorbed & -Has more calcium but is not easily absorbed \\
\hline -low concentrations of iron but which is easily absorbable & -High concentrations but not easily absorbed \\
\hline -low amounts but sufficient amounts of sodium, potassium, phosphorus and chloride & -High amounts of sodium, potassium, phosphorus and chloride \\
\hline -adequate amount but only in the first 6 months, no or low concentrations of vitamin D & High amounts but easily digested and absorbed, no or low concentrations of vitamin D \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{NUTRITION DURING LACTATION}

The process of milk production (lactation)
Human milk is secreted by the mammary glands which are located within the fatty tissue of the breast
The hormone oxytoxin is produced in response to the birth of a new baby and is both stimulates uterine contractions and begins the lactation process

The natural way of providing young infants with nutrients is by breastfeeding
Exclusive breast feeding is recommended up to 6months of age with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to 2 years of age or beyond

\section*{Breast milk has three different and distinct stages}
-colostrums- is the first stage of breast milk that occurs during pregnancy and lasts for several days after the birth of the baby, it is creamy in color, high in protein, has fat soluble vitamins, minerals and
immunoglobulin's (antibodies that pass immunity for the baby). It is replaced after 2-4 days by transitional milk
-Transitional milk-occurs after colostrums and lasts for approximately 2 weeks. Is high in fats (lactose), water soluble vitamins and has more calories than colostrums
-mature milk-final milk, $90 \%$ is water necessary for maintaining hydration of the infant. The other $10 \%$ is composed of carbohydrates, proteins and fats necessary for both growth and energy.

Factors influencing breast milk volume
- Age of the baby/stage of lactation eg are overflows in the $1^{\text {st }}-4$ months
- Infants demand
- Frequency of breastfeeding
- Granular capacity

\section*{Causes of low breast milk supply}
a) Not getting enough suckling stimulation (sleepy baby)
b) Separation from the child or breast feeding under a schedule
c) Limited amount of time for the baby at the breast (<20-45 minutes) thus less stimulation of the breast
d) Mother is ill or under a lot of stress breast milk is affected by the hormonal disorders and imbalances
e) Using infant formulas
f) Infected nipple (sore/ pain) inhibit let down reflex
g) Previous breast surgery hence damaged milk ducts
h) Taking the birth control pills

\section*{Increasing breast milk supply}
a) Mother takes care of herself i.e. eat well and drink enough fluids
b) Breastfed frequently for as long as the baby will breastfed
c) Use proper breastfeeding techniques
d) Avoid feeding bottles

\section*{Important nutrients for a breastfeeding mother}
- Calcium
- Iron
- Folic acid
- Vitamin A and c
- Proteins
- Limited caffeine
- Avoid unprescribed supplements

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
- Drink plenty of fluids
- Avoid alcohol

\section*{Contraception during breastfeeding}

The best birth control methods during breastfeeding are
-barrier methods
-surgical and sterilization
-natural methods

The pills or hormonal poses a theoretical risk to the infant or affect breastfeeding. If hormonal methods are to be used then the mini-pill is preferred (progesterone-only pill)

\section*{Keeping breast in good shape}
1. Be vigilant about your diet avoid alcohol, increase consumption of fiber as they help in digestion, increase protein intake for muscles and collagen the supporting structures for breast, eat fish oils, consume fruits and vegetables daily, tale supplements of vitamin E,C, A and selenium are good sources of antioxidants against cancer.
2. Wear a well constructive supportive bra, a good supportive bra every day especially during athletic activities, while breastfeeding and during menopausal years
3. Establish a good exercise program- a good exercise that incorporates weights to strengthen the muscles underlying the breast tissue.
4. Maintain a healthy body weight for excess fats in the breast stretches the skin
5. Massage the breast-massage the breast with a good moisturizing cream each night to keep the skin supple and soft. This will prevent wrinkles from developing due to dry skin and keep the breast feeling younger

\section*{Breastfeeding and temporary separation of a mother and child}

There are times when breastfeeding should be stopped temporarily and so the mother should express or pump her milk as often as the baby would be nursing to maintain her milk supply

\section*{Breastfeeding for working mothers}

The mothers should be encouraged to breastfed
-where legal provisions exist e.g. breastfeeding breaks the mother should make use of them
-mother should breastfed as often as possible during the night by sleeping with the baby
-breast feeding the child just before leaving and just after returning from work and if possible during a lunch break
-mothers should manually express or use breast pump to express milk to avoid breast engorgement -avoid dribbling by use of absorbent pads while at work
-prepare infant formula by a caregiver who observes hygiene but should not be given near the time the mother returns from work

\section*{Problems associated with breastfeeding}
1. Sore nipples -air and sunlight will help heal the nipples. Nurse the less sore breast first, when the milk lets down switch to the sore one and position the baby to minimize pain
2. Engorgement- makes the breast so full and hard that the baby cannot get his mouth around the nipple and the mother is uncomfortable. Generally massage the breast to help let down reflex get started or pump out some of the milk and allow the baby to nurse
3. An undrained sinus- makes the breast hard and uncomfortable lump in the breast- massage the lump while the baby is nursing, to move the milk towards the nipple where it will join the main supply
4. Supplemental water- feeding the baby with sweetened water will interfere with breastfeeding
5. Mastitis-is an infection of the breast-continue breastfeeding to drain off the milk. the infant helps relieve pressure in the infected area
6. Stress or worry- a mother should be encouraged to be staple psychologically in order for the hormones to produce enough milk
7. Weaning-as the infant consumes solid foods, formula ,breast milk consumption will decrease and this reduce production in turn

\section*{COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING}

\section*{Definitions}

Complementary feeding-according to WHO is the transition of an infant from exclusive breastfeeding to family foods (solids and semi-solids) and cover the period from 6-24 months and beyond

Weaning is not a word to replace complementary feeding and it means cessation of an infant from breastfeeding to family foods (solids or semi-solids)

\section*{Characteristics of complementary foods}
1. timely -that is all infants should start to receive foods in addition to breastmilk from 6 months onwards

Downloaded by Patrick Ngobiro (pngobiro@gmail.com)
2. adequate in quality and quantity-complementary foods should be given in sufficient amounts and nutritious combination (balanced diet)
3. consistency and texture-i.e. semisolids and pureed foods should be provided until the chewing ability is developed in children
4. responsive feeding - feed the infant directly, offer favorite foods and encourage the child to eat
5. mea frequency and energy-i.e the child grows older, the amount and frequency of food offered increases depending on the energy density of the food
6. Hygiene in meal preparation and storage-i.e. certain measures should be done to prevent gastro-intestinal illness associated with unhygienic practices during food preparation, storage and feeding.
7. Use of fortified food-unfortified complementary foods from plant source are insufficient in the key nutrients like iron, zinc and calcium which are recommended for the ages 6-24 months

\section*{Indicators of readiness of a baby to be complemented}
- The infant weight has doubled
- The infant is six months old
- The child can sit up and reach for food while their mother are eating
- Likes to put things into the mouth to feel and taste them
- The child seem really hungry (crying) even though is breastfeeding

\section*{Selection of complementary foods}
-avoid selection of foods with low energy (soups, oatmeal and overdiluted milk/ porriedge)
-from 8 months vary and balance the meal to contain staple, protein, vitamin and fats
NB -Infant in the later adult tend to prefer the foods the way they were initially introduced thus infants should be introduced to different types of foods with low sugar and salt contents

\section*{How to introduce complementary foods}
- Introduce new foods gradually, one at a time every 3-7 days
- When infants reject new foods it should not be intreoeted as permanent aversion to that food, on average infants need to be exposed to e new food 8-10 times until they accept it well
- Improper food consistency compromise nutrient intakes, at 6 months give pureed, mashed , semi-solid foods, by 8 months can introduce finger foods and by 12 months and beyond a child is introduced to family foods that are crushed, shredded, chopped or cut into small pieces
- Restrict sharp foods with hard consistency like carrots, nuts, grapes to avoid choking in the infants
- Complementary foods should be given using a spoon or glass, baby bottles are sources are sources of contamination and interfere with oral structure
- Complementary foods should be offered before or after breastfeeding
- Mothers and caregivers should practice responsive feeding i.e. feed the child directly, offering favorite foods, encouraging the child to eat when they lose interest or have depressed appetite, giving the child different food combinations, tastes, textures and methods of encouragements like talking to the child during feeding giving the child food slowly and patiently and minimizing distraction during meals and not forcing the child to eat.

\section*{Consideration when introducing complementary foods}
a. Age of the child
b. Type of the food
c. When to breastfed and give foods
d. Consistency of the complementary foods
e. Avoid strong seasoning
f. Prepare easy to digest foods
g. Observe hygiene in food preparations

\section*{Risks of too early complementary feeding before 6 months}
a) The digestive system is not fully developed to handle the foods so the baby is likely to get constipation
b) Decrease the intensity and frequency of suckling and as result breast milk production is reduced
c) Introduction of cereals can interfere with absorption of breastmilk iron which is normally in low concentrations
d) Because the baby may suckle less te mother is more likely to become fertile again and conceive
e) A child may develop diarrhea due to unhygienic environments and preparation metods
f) Child may get long term risks like obesity and food allergy

\section*{Risks of late complementary feeding}
a) Baby might stop gaining weight at a healthy rate and may become underweight
b) It becomes difficulty to persuade the baby to start eating solids or other foods at later age

\section*{IMMUNIZATION}

Immunizations are administrations of substances which protect a person from becoming infected by particular pathogens (bacteria, viruses, etc).
Some immunizations are effective only if given at certain ages, or are not considered to be needed in people at other ages.

\section*{Types of Immunity}

There are two main types of immunity:
1. Innate or Inborn or Natural immunity. It is present from the birth and is inherited from the mother to offspring through the placenta. It is not acquired from the previous attack of disease e.g. innate immunity against distemper (a fatal disease of dogs) and cholera.
2. Acquired or Adaptive immunity. It is not present from the birth but is acquired during one's own life. It is developed by the organism in response to a disease caused by the infection of microbes or vaccine. In this, the protective lymphocytes of body produce antibodies which not only inactivate the antigens and relieve from an infectious disease but also provide immunity against further attack. It is so as some antibody producing cells persist as "memory cells" for long period and produce antibodies immediately after second infection to counter it. The acquired immunity so developed may be temporary (e.g., influenza) or permanent (e.g., measles, mumps, polio, smallpox) for life long.

\section*{Acquired immunity is of two types:}
(a) Active or Natural immunity. It is a long lasting immunity developed by antibodies produced by an individual's own cells. It is developed in three ways :
->By having the disease e.g., chickenpox, mumps, measles etc.
-> By having a subclinical infection e.g. live 'Sabin' vaccine (against polio).
-> By having killed micro-organisms or detoxified toxins e.g., killed 'Salk' vaccine (against polio), tetanus toxoid (against tetanus).
(b) Passive or Artificial immunity. In this, the ready-made antibodies (gamma-globulins) obtained from human or animal serum, who already had recovered from an infectious disease, is injected into the human body to develop immunity. It is used against the measles, infectious hepatitis, mumps, diphtheria, tetanus

\section*{immunizable diseases}
1. Tuberculosis
2. Diptheria
3. Pertussis
4. Measles
5. Poliomyelitis
6. Tetanus
7. Hepatitis B
8. pneumonia

Fully Immunized Child (FIC)- less than 12 months old child with complete immunizations of DPT, OPV, BCG, Anti Hepatitis, Anti measles, pneumococcal

\section*{Cold Chain}

Cold Chain is a system used to maintain potency of a vaccine from that of manufacture to the time it is given to child or pregnant woman.

Most sensitive to heat: Freezer (-15 to -25 degrees C)
- OPV
- Measles

Sensitive to heat and freezing(body of ref. +2 to +8 degrees Celcius)
- BCG
- DPT
- Hepa B
- TT

\section*{REACTIONS AND COMPLICATIONS OF IMMUNIZATIONS}
- Mild fever
- Irritability
- Localized tenderness and swelling at site of injection
- Unrelieved crying
- High-pitched cry
- Marked increase in sleeping time
- Persistent high fever (104 degrees Fahrenheit or greater)
- Seizure or convulsion
- Fever up to 103 degrees about 7-10 days after vaccine administration
- Mild measles rash (reaction to measles vaccine)

Treatment depends on the type of symptom observed following immunization. Fever is normally treated with acetaminophen and cool sponge baths. Children with seizures must be seen by a health care provider promptly.

Very few children who receive standard childhood vaccines develop significant problems following immunization. For children who develop problems, standard fever care and a call to the health care provider for reassurance often suffice.

NB

Abscess (pus) at site of immunization is a possible complication of vaccination. Other complications are the same as symptoms
