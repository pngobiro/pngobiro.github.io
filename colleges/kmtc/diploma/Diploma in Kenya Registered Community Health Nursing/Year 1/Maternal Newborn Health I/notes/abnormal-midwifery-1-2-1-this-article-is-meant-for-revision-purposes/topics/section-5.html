                        <p>Anaesthesia means absence of sensation and freedom from pain. General anaesthesia is the induction of unconsciousness, which may also involve the giving of some analgesia.</p>
                        <p>Regional anaesthesia is when a group of nerves is made free of sensation. Local anaesthesia is when a specific area of the body is anaesthetised e.g. the perineal area when repairing an episiotomy perineal or vaginal tear.</p>
                        <p>Each of these three categories of anaesthesia will be covered in this topic.</p>

                             <p>General anaesthesia for a pregnant woman in her second and third trimesters, or for a mother who has just delivered, is dangerous due to the effect of progesterone.</p>

                           <p>It is essential that only trained anaesthesia personnel administer general anaesthesia to patients. Moreover, it is essential to place an endotracheal tube in all pregnant patients undergoing general anaesthesia, since the risk of aspiration pneumonitis, secondary to the inhalation of gastric content, is a significant one.</p>
                           <p>Until the baby is born, the mother should receive 100% oxygen and a low concentration of an inhalation agent such as isoflurane 0.5%. After delivery anaesthesia can be deepened by supplementing the anaesthetic with higher concentrations of potent volatile inhalation agents. Factors connected with anaesthesia have been a significant cause of maternal deaths until very recently. It is essential for the midwife to be aware of the risks associated with anaesthesia and why they occur, so as to give intelligent help to assist the operating team and the patient.</p>

                               <p>Some of the problems include; Mendelson's syndrome, failed intubation, aortalcaval occlusion and maternal awareness.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mendelson's Syndrome</h4>
                              <p>It is believed that in pregnancy and especially in advanced labour there is a delay in gastric emptying time, due to the effect of progesterone on the gastro-intestinal tract.</p>
                              <p>Narcotic analgesics like pethidine that are given in labour, cause significant delay in gastric emptying. The static stomach content raises the pH . Fasting also gives similar reactions. The pressure from the gravid uterus results in the reflux of the contents in the stomach when the mother is in recumbent position. When she is under general anaesthetic unnoticed regurgitation may occur. In cases where the acid stomach contents are aspirated into the lungs, a condition known as Mendelson's Syndrome result. The alveoli are damaged which causes the impairment of gaseous exchange. It is impossible to oxygenate the mother and in severe cases death may ensue.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention of Mendelson's Syndrome</h5>
                              <p>The main method of prevention is the administration of antacid therapy while in labour to high risk patients.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Rapid Sequence Induction</h5>
                              <p>Rapid sequence induction is used for unprepared patients. Prepared obstetric patients are also liable to have acid contents in the stomach and the same technique is used. The method always includes endo-tracheal intubation with the use of cricoid pressure, which protects the lungs even when silent regurgitation occurs.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Cricoid Pressure</h5>
                              <p>The cricoid cartilage is pressurised to close the oesophagus, preventing acid reflux. This pressure is essential in preventing the death of the mother. Proper application of cricoid pressure is essential. When intubation fails and the anaesthetist is able to maintain a clear airway, a facemask should be used while the assistant maintains cricoid pressure. Another option is spinal anaesthesia, after waking the mother.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Failed Intubation</h4>
                              <p>This usually occurs in pregnant women with laryngeal oedema due to pregnancy and induced hypertension. The anaesthetist has difficulties visualising the vocal cords and introducing the tracheal tube. Other factors include poor opening of the mouth and a stiff or fat neck.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention</h5>
                              <p>Use a pre-oxygenation technique, which involves giving facemask oxygen for four minutes uninterrupted. This will prevent cyanosis significantly when attempting to intubate.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Aortocaval occlusion</h4>
                              <p>You will now look at aortocaval occlusion and its prevention. The cause of aortocaval occlusion is the weight of the gravid uterus, which partially blocks the inferior vena cava. The venous return is then reduced, which in turn leads to a fall of cardiac output. This occurs when a pregnant woman lies supine in late pregnancy for a long period in labour. If an emergency caesarean section is being performed due to foetal distress, aortocaval occlusion increases the foetal distress and causes further foetal hypoxia.</p>
                               <p>Do you know how this might be prevented?</p>
                               <p>This condition can be prevented by encouraging the mother in labour to remain in an upright position for as long as possible. During labour, when the woman needs to lie flat, the midwife should ensure she is tilted to the left, either with a small rubber wedge under the mattress or a folded blanket under the left buttock at an angle of $15^{\circ}$. Modern delivery beds, chairs and operation tables have this facility incorporated.</p>

                        <p>The operational region is made free from pain by infiltrating an anaesthetic drug into the nerves supplying the region. This can be achieved in several ways i.e. epidural block, spinal anaesthesia, pudendal block and para cervical block.</p>

                         <!-- START: section-5-epidural-block -->

                             <h3 id="section-5-epidural-block-heading" class="subsection-heading">Epidural Block</h3>
                              <p>Epidural analgesia is described as lumbar or caudal, depending on the site used when approaching the epidural space. This is achieved by infiltrating anaesthetic into the epidural space so that it surrounds the fibres of the specific spinal nerves and anaesthetises them, thereby achieving a selective block. This can be done in two ways:</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Lumbar Epidural Block</h4>
                              <p>This is the most common approach and there are three different techniques which may be used. The anaesthetic is introduced between lumbar vertebrae two and three, or three and four.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">First technique</h5>
                              <p>A single shot epidural refers to the process whereby local anaesthesia is introduced using a Touhy needle, but no catheter is inserted for topping up purposes.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Second technique</h5>
                              <p>Intermittent technique is when a polyethylene or nylon catheter is inserted into the epidural space so that further doses of local anaesthetic may be given when required.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Third technique</h5>
                              <p>The continuous technique is where anaesthetic solution is infused via epidural catheter using an intravenous infusion line attached to an electronic drip counter.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Caudal Epidural Block</h4>
                              <p>This is an uncommon technique. The epidural needle is introduced between the sacral vertebra and cocyxiatus through the sacral hiatus.</p>

                        <p>There are several complications, which may arise from the use of anaesthetics. You will now study each of these in turn.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Complications of Regional Anaesthesia</h4>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Hypotension</h5>
                         <p>This occurs as a result of the effect of vasodilatation of the blood vessels. Rapid intravenous infusion can prevent the condition. This is commonly known as a preload and commonly consists of between 500 ml and 1000 ml of Hartman's solution. A functional intravenous infusion is essential before epidural analgesia is commenced in order to prevent hypotension.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Dural Tap</h5>
                         <p>This is the accidental puncture of the durameter. This is recognised when a few drops of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) seep through the Tuohy needle. In order to prevent this condition, the anaesthetist normally re-sites the epidural catheter in an adjacent space. The obstetrician is informed and a forceps delivery will be planned in order to prevent the woman from pushing and possibly forcing more CSF through the dural puncture.</p>
                         <p>A reduction of CSF volume usually results in severe headache, which resolves spontaneously within a week. Another measure to minimise leakage of CSF is to leave the epidural catheter in position and infuse normal saline with the help of an infusion pump. This is normally continued for 24 hours while the woman is lying flat.</p>
                         <p>For quick relief of the headache, the anaesthetist may decide to perform a 'blood patch', that is under strict asepsis taking between $10 \mathrm{ml}-20 \mathrm{ml}$ of venous blood from the woman's antecubital vein and introducing it into the epidural space via the intervertebral space nearest the dural puncture. This results in immediate cure of the headache. The woman is left to rest for an hour or two to avoid disturbing the clot, which has sealed the dural puncture. It carries risks of infection but the success rate is 90% on the first occasion and 98% if the procedure is repeated.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Total Spinal Block</h5>
                         <p>This is a rare complication. It occurs when by mistake there is a dural puncture that fails to be recognised and the anaesthetist injects the local anaesthetic solution. This results in rapid motor and sensory block with a drastic fall of blood pressure. The mother collapses and cardiac arrest may follow. If this happens, immediate resuscitation is essential and ventilator support is required.</p>
                         <p>Occasionally, this effect is seen following a later top up and not during the initial stages of epidural analgesics. The reason for this is unclear but, in some cases, the epidural catheter is thought to have migrated. The midwife who tops up an epidural must be aware of these possible complications and their immediate treatment.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Bloody Tap</h5>
                         <p>This happens when the anaesthetist punctures one of the epidural veins. Blood is seen in the catheter. In this case the epidural catheter is re-sited in order to prevent intravenous injection of local anaesthetic solution. If local anaesthetic is injected in the vein, toxicity will result and the woman will complain of tingling or numbness of the mouth and tongue, and dizziness. Her speech may be slurred and she may finally have convulsions.</p>
                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Patchy Block</h5>
                         <p>This is when an epidural block is sometimes more effective on one side of the body or is completely unilateral for no obvious reason. If this occurs the anaesthetist should be informed to adjust the epidural catheter.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Disadvantages of Local Anaesthesia</h4>
                         <p>There are several disadvantages of local anaesthetics. These include:</p>

                         </ul>
                         <p>The epidural block may also contribute to the following symptoms in the postnatal period:</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Drugs Used in Epidural Analgesia</h4>
                         <p>There are several drugs used in epidural analgesia. These are:</p>

                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Bupivacaine</h5>
                         <p>This is administered in strengths of 0.25% and 0.5% and these concentrations are modified as required by diluting with normal saline. It is effective within 10-20 minutes of administration and lasts for about two hours during labour. The total dose given is not excessive unless labour is prolonged and toxicity is not common.</p>

                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Ropivacain (Naropin)</h5>
                         <p>This analgesic is good in low concentration with minimal and non-progressive motor block. Its long acting action makes it suitable for use in labour.</p>

                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Opiates</h5>
                         <p>Drugs in this group include:</p>
                         <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Diamorphine</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Morphine</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Pethidine</span>
                            </li>
                         </ul>
                         <p>These are good post operative analgesics and neither cause hypotension, nor cause motor or sympathetic block. They are not as effective as might be expected in relieving labour pains but are commonly used in our hospitals following caesarean sections due to the pleasant feeling of wellbeing they induce. There is some risk of respiratory depression, although this risk is minimal.</p>

                         <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Lignocaine</h5>
                         <p>This is usually administered in the strength of 0.5-1% and is one of the more effective local anaesthetics available for epidural administration. The short acting span makes it unsuitable for use through out labour since a large dose may be needed and toxicity is therefore a risk. If the woman is very distressed it may be used for the initial dose and Bupivacaine can be used thereafter.</p>

                        <p>A spinal block is performed in a manner similar to an epidural block but in this case a local anaesthestic solution is injected into the sub-arachnoid space, i.e. in to the cerebrospinal fluid.The woman will have total motor control and sensory block over and below the anaesthetised areas.</p>

                              <p>There are two types of inhalation anaesthesia. These are called:</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tritene</h4>
                              <p>This has a composition of upto 0.5% of tritene in air. It is blue in colour and a volatile agent. One of the main side effects of this drug is that it accumulates in the maternal blood stream causing sleep but also, at times, disorientation. When this happens you must stop the inhalation. It also accumulates in the foetus, causing drowsiness at birth. It should not be administered for more than four hours. Once the drug is stopped the effect is short lived.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Entonox</h4>
                              <p>This drug is composed of 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen. When used in high concentration it is suitable for anaesthesia.</p>
                              <p>It has no side effects.</p>

It begins at the centre of the fourchette, directed posteriorly and laterally the incision is not more than 3 cm at $45^{\circ}$ to the midline. Move towards a point midway between ischio-tuberosity and the anus. This is to avoid damaging the anal sphincter and the Bartholin's glands.</p>

                              <p>This begins at the fourchette, is directed posteriorly for approximately 2.5 cms and stops just before the anal sphincter. It follows the insertion of perennial muscles and has minimal bleeding due to few blood vessels in this area. It is easy to repair, less painful and rarely causes dypareunia. However there is the danger of the incision extending to the anal sphincter.</p>

If the episiotomy is performed too early, it exposes the mother to a lot of bleeding. If performed too late, there will not be enough time to infiltrate the local anaesthesia.

                              <p>When the head reaches the pelvic floor, two fingers of the left hand are inserted between the perineum and the foetal head. Lignocaine, 0.5%, is infiltrated into the area where the incision has to be made. Using the right hand, the midwife places the tip of the opened scissors and makes an incision at the height of a contraction.</p>

                              <p>Delivery of the head should follow immediately and it should be controlled to avoid extension of the episiotomy. If there is delay before the head emerges, apply pressure at the episiotomy site between contractions to minimise bleeding. Use aseptic techniques.</p>

                             <h3 id="section-5-repair-episiotomy-heading" class="subsection-heading">Repair of the Episiotomy</h3>
                              <p>The episiotomy should be repaired as soon as possible (immediately after the third stage) before oedema sets in and while tissues are still anaesthetised. You will need a good source of direct light. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position. The midwife should be seated comfortably during the procedure.</p>
                              <p>An aseptic technique must be maintained throughout the procedure. The vagina and the episiotomy site are cleaned with antiseptic lotion and the midwife should have a sterile gown and gloves on. Sterile gauze is inserted into the vagina to absorb blood and keep the operation site dry. Absorbable sutures are used. The repair begins at the apex of the vaginal wound. A continuous or interrupted stitch is used, started from the apex to the fourchette bringing the two edges of the wound together. The perineal muscles are then sutured and finally the skin is sutured.</p>

                                      <p>The stitches should just be firm enough. If they are too loose, they may cause oedema and if they are too tight, the mother will be very uncomfortable. After suturing, remove the pack from the vagina and note on the mother's card that the pack has been removed. Insert the little finger into the anal orifice to make sure the two orifices have not been stitched together and the vaginal orifice isstill patent.</p>

                              <p>Younge invented the basic idea for the vacuum extractor in 1706 when he used a glass suction cup. In 1849, Simpson designed the instrument, but at the time it was hardly used. In 1774 Mostron introduced the modern vacuum extractor. There are opinions about the value in assisting delivery by this method and it is rarely used these days. However, it is still useful in remote areas.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Procedure</h5>
                             <p>Access to the lower uterine segment is secured by appropriate dissection of tissues around the bladder to by pass the peritoneal cavity and the baby is extracted. As the peritoneal cavity is not disturbed there is no risk of introducing infection from infected liquor or infection from the uterus. This was a popular procedure in the pre-antibiotic era but is now outdated.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Caesarean Section Hysterectomy</h4>
                              <p>This is also known as Porro's Operation. The removal of the uterus follows after caesarean section, due to other conditions of the uterus; such as placenta accreta, multiple fibroid tumours of the uterus and so on. On rare occasions and in conjuction with other gynaecological disorders this operation may be used for sterilisation purposes.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Elective Caesarean Section</h4>
                              <p>The decision to deliver by caesarean section is made during pregnancy before the onset of labour. Some reasons for this decision are absolute while others depend on combination of factors and the opinion of the obstetrician.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Emergency Caesarean Section</h4>
                              <p>This operation is performed when adverse conditions develop during labour. The psychological preparation of the mother for the operation is of paramount importance. You should be prepared to deal with the different feelings of different mothers. An opportunity should be given to mothers to explore and express their feelings, be they fear, disappointment or frustration. This can be done in a group or individual counselling setting, where uncertainties and misunderstandings can be clarified. The nurse can be of great help acting as a mediator, fostering acceptance and sense of readiness to both the apprehensive mother and her partner</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Post Operative Care</h4>
                              <p>This is the same care given to any woman who has undergone a major abdominal operation. For more details, refer to module one, unit four.</p>
                              <p>Additional care steps are also recommended. The mother should breast feed as soon as her condition permits. If for any reason she cannot breast feed, the breast should manually be expressed from the third day to prevent engorgement of the breasts. Four hourly vulva swabbing should be taken if the patient is confined to bed.</p>
                              <p>Remember that maternal mortality is four times greater than in normal labour. Elective sections usually have lower mortality rates but emergency cases are usually at high risk, especially due to the use of anaesthesia. Mothers who were in labour for a prolonged period are especially at risk of serious infection; so prophylactic antibiotics should always be used. A ruptured uterus is more rare here than in the lower segment section. All mothers with a caesarean section scar should be delivered in the hospital under vigilant observation.</p>
                              <p>The foetus is also at risk, given that respiratory problems may occur due to the anaesthesia. Intracranial damage may occur as a result of improper care during the delivery of the foetal head, which has to be brought up from the pelvis or through the small uterine incision.</p>
                              <p>Obstetric emergencies may occur suddenly or may be due to poor management or negligence on the part of the skilled medical personnel. You should always be vigilant in your observations in an effort to avoid such emergencies. When they do happen, you should be ready to respond in order to save lives and reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>

This endangers the life of the foetus. Vasa praevia can be felt on virginal examination when the membranes are still intact. The condition can be visualised on ultrasound. A speculum examination should be undertaken if this is suspected. When the membranes rupture, the foetal vessel may also rupture. The rupture of vessels should be suspected when there is fresh bleeding after the rupture of the membranes following foetal distress.</p>

                              <p>If you diagnose prolapse of the cord while performing a vaginal examination, check for the following factors that determine the method of management. Check whether the pulsation of the cord cervical dilatation is in the first or second stage. Determine the adequacy of the pelvis. If the cord is pulsating you must act very fast in order to save the baby.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Pulsating Cord with Mother in First Stage</h5>
                              <p>Explain to the mother the situation at hand while you push up the presenting part so as not to compress the cord. If the cord is outside the vagina, gently replace it in the vagina to prevent spasm and keep warm. Instruct your assistant to inform the obstetrician and the theatre staff, and keep the mother in knee chest position without removing your fingers. Continue elevating the presenting part until the patient is in theatre.</p>
                              <p>Your assistant should give the mother oxygen by facemask while someone else draws blood for grouping and cross matching. At this point you should commence an intravenous line and keep the vein open. The mother should be asked when she last had a meal and gastric aspiration should be commenced if necessary.</p>
                              <p>Once consent has been taken, the mother should be rushed to the theatre as soon as possible. If the cervical os is fully dilated and the pelvis is adequate, you should encourage the mother to push. Tell the assistant to inform the doctor and prepare for vacuum extraction. Continue encouraging the mother to push and give a generous episiotomy to hasten the delivery of the baby. Should the doctor arrive before the baby is out, he may perform vacuum extraction. If there is malpresentation, the patient should be quickly prepared for caesarean section as per steps above.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">If the Cord is not Pulsating</h5>
                              <p>The procedure to be followed varies from institution to institution. In some institutions you may be able to personally inform the patient of the situation. Otherwise, you may have to wait until the doctor comes to tell the patient about her dead foetus. If the patient is in first stage of labour and the pelvis is adequate, let nature take its course and deliver a fresh stillbirth. If the patient is in the second stage, she is encouraged to push and she will deliver a stillbirth. In case there is a contracted pelvis, a caesarean section should be performed in spite of the death of the foetus.</p>

                             <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">Haemorrhage from the Placental Site</h6>
                              <p>Bleeding can also result from the mismanagement of the third stage of labour. If ergometrine or syntocinon is not given at the end of the second stage, it remains quiescent for a few minutes. While the placenta is still attached, no bleeding occurs. However, if there are any attempts to manipulate the uterus such as massaging, kneading, squeezing and pushing, this will over-stimulate the uterus and cause uncoordinated uterine contractions, hence bleeding will begin.</p>
                              <p>Injudicious attempts to expel the placenta before complete separation will cause PPH as well as inversion of the uterus. Additionally, a full/distended bladder during the third stage inhibits proper placental separation leading to haemorrhage.</p>
                              <p>An abnormally adherent placenta can also be problematic. In placenta acreta chorionic villi penetrate the myometrium to the peritoneal surface of the uterus. In placental praevia, the placenta has a wider area of attachment than normal and the lower uterine segment may fail to contract strongly enough to control bleeding.</p>
                              <p>Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and other clotting disorders are rare but can cause slow but persistent and dangerous haemorrhage. DIC is especially associated with concealed placenta, abrupt, amniotic embolism and dead foetus. Finally, fibroids can interfere with good muscular action and prevent the closure of the blood sinuses.</p>

                             <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention of Primary Post Partum Haemorrhage</h6>
                              <p>You should be able to identify risk factors during the antenatal period through accurate history taking. Anaemia must be corrected during pregnancy. You should encourage hospital delivery, especially for women with a history of PPH, grand multipara or a history of APH.</p>
                              <p>For the mothers at risk of PPH infusion of syntocinon during labour until two hours after third stage is effective and safe for the mother. In case of prolonged labour induction can be done by use of syntocinon drip.</p>
                              <p>Ergomentrine or syntocinon should be given at crowning of the head or after delivery of the anterior shoulder of the foetus. The bladder should be emptied at the end of the first stage of labour. In anticipation of blood coagulation disorders, you should have ready two units of blood for women at risk.</p>

                             <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Primary Postpartum Haemorrhage</h6>
                              <p>The main principles of treatment involve arresting the bleeding, restoration of the blood volume and treatment of circulatory failure (shock).</p>
                              <p>You should ascertain whether the uterus is contracted, if it is not, you should rub it to cause a contraction. Ask your assistant to repeat syntometrine if you administered this at the end of the second stage. If you had not, they can begin to administer syntometrine, put up an IV infusion of normal saline and call the doctor.</p>
                              <p>When you feel a contraction, deliver the placenta by using control cord transition. When the placenta is out you should continue to rub until the final contractions expel the clots and the bleeding stops.</p>
                              <p>However, if the mother is still bleeding and the placenta is out, the uterus is not well contracted. Quickly check for the completeness of the placenta. If the placenta is complete, perform a bimanual compression whereby the right hand is inserted into the vagina in the anterior fornix above the cervix, and the left hand is placed on the abdomen and pressed downwards onto the posterior wall of the uterus so that it is compressed between the two hands. The doctor will order syntocinon drip 40 units at 40 drops per minute.</p>
                              <p>Maintain firm pressure till the uterus is felt to contract; bleeding will stop.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Primary Postpartum Haemorrhage</h4>
                              <p>If the placenta is not complete, do a bimanual compression IV with 40 units of syntocinon. Ask your assistant to inform theatre staff to prepare for exploration under general anaesthesia. Prepare the patient for theatre, ready to be transferred when the doctor arrives.</p>
                              <p>If the placenta has not separated and remains in the upper uterine segment, manual removal of the placenta under general anaesthesia is performed. If bleeding still continues (and is not due to a clotting defect) tying of the internal iliac arteries or even hysterectomy may be considered.</p>
                              <p>However, you should check the haemoglobin level and determine the need for haematinics or transfusion with blood. If the placenta is delivered and is complete and the uterus is well contracted but the mother is still bleeding, check the birth canal for any tear, which may be the cause of bleeding.</p>
                              <p>If the placenta is delivered, the uterus is well contracted and there is no tear of the perineum, which is bleeding, then you should suspect coagulation disorders. The doctor will commence the mother on fibrogen while preparation is made to transfuse fresh blood.</p>

                             <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">Haemorrhage from Lacerations</h6>
                              <p>Bleeding resulting from lacerations may occur from the cervix, the wall of the vagina, at the apex of an episiotomy wound, and/or a tear.</p>
                              <p>This usually occurs during the Spontaneous Vaginal Delivery (SVD) of a large (macrosonic) baby or when a large diameter presents in face, extraction of the after coming head in breech presentation, or due to difficult instrumental delivery.</p>
                              <p>The main signs of SVD are that the bleeding starts immediately the baby is born, the blood flow is continuous and/or the uterus is firmly contracted.</p>
                              <p>Can you think of the management of lacerations?</p>

                             <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">The Management of Lacerations</h6>
                              <p>In a lithotomy position examine the patient's birth canal to determine the location and extent of the tear. Apply pressure to the tears till they are sutured. Use aseptic technique to suture the tears. Remember that proper retractors and instruments are needed to suture a high cervical tear.</p>
                              <p>Profuse haemorrhage from a cervical tear involving a branch of the uterine artery can be temporarily controlled by clamping the artery with an artery forceps till the patient is taken to theatre. A seat bath after the suturing helps to clean the area. Antibiotics should be prescribed to prevent infection. You should also determine the level of bleeding to determine the need for transfusion or haematinics.</p>

                             <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood Coagulation Disorders</h6>
                              <p>In the event that the patient has a coagulation disorder, she may bleed profusely. You can diagnose this by doing a bedside clotting time to rule out DIC. Clotting time that is more than seven minutes is suggestive of DIC. In this case start management as follows:</p>

                              <p>This usually occurs 24 hours after delivery or up to six weeks post delivery. The mother may present with retention of a placenta piece/products of conception, blood clots or puerperal sepsis, especially due to caesarean section. There may be low grade fever, lochia is usually heavier than normal and bright red in colour. Sub involution is present.</p>

                             <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">The Management of a Secondary Post Haemorrhage</h6>
                              <p>Mothers are usually readmitted during the puerperal period. Call for the doctor. If the uterus still palpates, stimulate it to induce a contraction and expel blood clots. Give ergometrine 1 ml . Keep all pads and linen to assess blood volume. The doctor may order an ultrasound to rule out any retained products of conception. The result will determine whether the mother will be prepared for exploration under general anaesthetic or treated conservatively with antibiotic and oral ergometrine.</p>
                              <p>Haemoglobin is estimated before discharge. If it is below 9 g/dl, the option of iron replacement is discussed with the mother. The severity of anaemia determines the appropriate care with foods rich in iron or iron supplements. In severe cases the mother is transfused.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Early Signs of Scar Rupture</h5>
                              <p>Early signs of scar rupture include a constant lower abnormal pain. This pain worsens during a contraction. There is fresh bleeding, which may be mistaken for show. Contractions may continue but the cervical os fails to dilate. Pulse rate is raised due to shock and tends to increase slowly.</p>
                              <p>Vigilant observation is required for a mother with a uterine scar showing the above signs so that she can be sectioned before rupture occurs.</p>
                              <p>Epidural analgesia masks the early signs, and is therefore contraindicated in the mother with a caesarean scar. In the advanced stage, the mother complains of severe and drastic pain, which is continuous and does not correspond to the uterine action. When the scar rupture contraction ceases, the mother rapidly becomes shocked. Rupture through a scar has less chance of infection than a rupture due to obstructed labour.</p>
                              <p>The presenting part does not descend to the pelvic brim in spite of strong contraction. The cervical os dilates slowly and hangs loosely like an empty sleeve and the membranes rupture early or the bag of water is elongated like a sausage.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention of Uterus Rupture</h5>
                              <p>Prevention is possible through good antenatal care after a thorough history taking. Refer high risk patients with previous scars and contracted pelvis for assessment. Vigilant observations in labour, especially in trial and induction of labour are necessary. You should be able to recognise, at an early stage, signs of obstructed labour and ruptured uterus. Maternal education is important in case of risk factors such as a previous scar. The community should be educated on pregnancy and childbirth complications. They should be advised on the need to deliver in a hospital rather than at home.</p>

                              <p>McRober's manoeuvre is a useful position. The mother is asked and helped to lie flat on her back and bring her knees as far as possible up to the chest. This manoeuvre has been proved to rotate the symphysis pubic angle posteriorly. The midwife creates pressure gently at the mother's legs and her abdomen. The impact of the anterior shoulder is released by this pressure.</p>

                              <p>While you exert traction to the head downwards and backwards, hook the fingers into anterior axilla and rotate its shoulder forwards. When the shoulders are in anterior posterior, conduct the delivery as usual.</p>

                              <p>Identify the posterior shoulder on vaginal examination. Insert two fingers and push the posterior shoulder in the direction of the foetus chest. If the anterior shoulder dislodges, rotate it away from the symphysis pubic and deliver the anterior shoulder.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Amniotic Fluid Embolism</h4>
                              <p>This is a very rare catastrophic condition. Amniotic fluid embolism can occur at any gestation but it is most common at the end of the first stage of labour. The amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation through the uteri-placental site. An emboli is formed which obstructs one of the pulmonary arteries or alveolar capillaries. It is associated with strong contractions, the membranes having ruptured. The body responds into two phases.</p>
                              <p>In the initial phase, the pulmonary artery goes into vaso spasm causing hypoxia. In the second phase, there is left ventricular failure, haemorrhage, and blood coagulation disorders followed by pulmonary oedema.</p>

                              <p>Inversion of the uterus refers to when the uterus has turned inside out.</p>
                              <p>Classify the three degrees of inversion of the uterus.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Inversion can be classified as follows:</h5>
                              <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">First degree</h6>
                              <p>where the fundus reaches the internal os.</p>
                              <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">Second degree</h6>
                              <p>where the corpus of the uterus is inverted to internal os.</p>
                              <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">Third degree</h6>
                              <p>where both the uterus, cervix and vagina are inverted and are visible at the vagina.</p>
                              <p>Classification of inversions is also based on the time they occur. Acute refers to immediate prolapsed after delivery while the placenta is still attached. Subcute and chronic refer to an inversion, which happens 24 hours later.</p>

                              <p>Inform the mother what has happened and reassure her. Call for help from other midwives.</p>
                              <p>Give instructions as follows:</p>
                              <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                      <span class="item-text">The other assistant should elevate the foot of the bed and give pethidine 100 gm to relieve pain</span>
                                  </li>
                                   <li class="list-item">
                                      <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                      <span class="item-text">The assistant should then fix a canular, remove blood for cross match and fix an infusion</span>

                              </ul>
                               <p>You should then use Johnson's manoeuvre. Try to push the fundus using the palm of your hand. Direct the fundus to the vagina and towards the posterior fornix. Lift the uterus towards the membranes with steady pressure and return to position. Once the uterus is in position, instruct your assistant to give 0.5 gm oxitocin while you hold the uterus until you feel a hard contraction. Then the placenta can be delivered by using control cord traction. If the doctor comes before you finish the procedure, they can take over. In a health centre you should refer the mother to the hospital if you succeed, for further management.</p>
                               <p>Insert a giving set into the vagina. Use one hand to seal the vaginal orifice. Your assistant should instil a warm saline through the giving set. After pouring several litres the pressure will build up in the vagina. This pressure will restore the normal position of the uterus.</p>

                              <p>If inversion is not possible manually, it may be due to a cervical constriction ring. The doctor will prescribe a relaxant to relax the cervical os and facilitate the replacement of the inversion.</p>

                               <p>The condition develops in several stages, which you will now study in detail.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">The Initial Stage</h5>
                              <p>The venous return to the heart is decreased due to reduction of blood or fluid. There is also a reduction in stroke volume and cardiac output caused by inadequately filled ventricles of the heart. There is a fall in blood pressure, which decreases oxygen supply to the tissue and affects the function of the cells.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Compensatory Stage</h5>
                              <p>At this stage the body can compensate for up to 10% of fluid volume. When it reaches 20-28% it begins to fall. The sympathetic nervous system responds to a drop in cardiac output by constricting vessels in the gastro-intestinal tract, kidney, skin and lungs. This causes the skin to be pale and cool. Peristalsis slows, urinary output is poor and gas exchange in the lungs is impaired. This causes ischaemia and collapse of alveoli, ultimately leading to respiratory failure known as 'adult respiratory distress syndrome'. Blood is distributed to the vital organs only.</p>
                              <p>There is an increased heart rate in an effort to improve cardiac output and blood pressure. The pupils dilate and the sweat glands are stimulated causing the skin to be moist and clammy. Adrenaline and aldosterone from the adrenal medulla and adrenal cortex are released. The posterior pituitary lobe also produces an antidiuretic hormone, which causes vasoconstriction in an attempt to improve cardiac output. Venous return to the heart increases but cannot be sustained for long unless fluid loss is replaced.</p>
                               <p>Looking at this mechanism you will notice how important it is to replace the lost fluid.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Hypovolaemic Stage</h5>
                              <p>When the compensatory mechanism begins to fail, there is a further fall in cardiac output and blood pressure. Vital organs lack perfusion and coronary arteries lack supply. There is poor peripheral circulation. The pulse is either weak or absent. In the brain, the level of consciousness deteriorates and the mother becomes increasingly unresponsive.</p>
                              <p>The renal tubules become ischaemic, leading to kidney failure. Waste products such as urea and creatinine are not excreted, resulting in their increased presence in the blood. The gut's function as barrier fails due to ischaemia and gram-negative bacteria are able to enter the blood stream.</p>
                              <p>The liver can no longer metabolise drugs and hormones. As the bilirubin can no longer be conjugated, it builds up and jaundice develops. With the liver failing to act as a filter, there is a build up of lactic acid and ammonia in the blood due to the failure of waste metabolism. Liver enzymes are released in the blood circulation by dead hepatic cells.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Final Irreversible Stage of Shock</h5>
                              <p>The distractions of the cells are irreparable causing multisystem failure and ultimately death.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Outcome of Shock</h5>
                              <p>Early arrest of the cause and replacement of body fluid will give full recovery.</p>
                              <p>At times the mother may survive but develop permanent damage to various organs. This is referred to as Sheehan's syndrome. Death is usually due to a delay in treatment.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Hypovolaemic Shock</h5>
                              <p>Urgent resuscitation measures should be applied to prevent irreversible damage to the patient.</p>
                              <p>The first thing you should do is to maintain a clear airway by turning her on one side. If she is unconscious, insert an airway by turning her on one side and administer oxygen, 40% at the rate of four to six litres.</p>
                              <p>Find the source of bleeding, whenever possible and try to stop the bleeding. Replace fluid immediately. Take blood for a cross match and give blood transfusion as and when ready. Meanwhile a plasma expander such as dextran, haemocel or glucose saline (1 litre) should be administered as soon as possible.</p>
                              <p>When the blood is ready, the first 1,200 mls should be given rapidly (within 30 minutes). The doctor should remain with the patient during this exercise. Avoid excessive warmth as it will interfere with the constriction of the peripheral blood vessels, which usually occurs in response to shock.</p>

                                  <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">üí°</span> Remember:</h4>
                                  <p>Constriction of blood vessels improves cardiac output and blood pressure.</p>
                                </aside>
                              <p>Elevate the foot of the bed by 30 cm . This will raise blood pressure 10 mm Hg by gravity. This allows the blood to flow to vital centres in the brain.</p>
                              <p>Hydrocortisone 100-500 mg is given slowly in cases of suparenal failure. A sedative may be necessary in the case of restlessness to calm an apprehensive patient.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Observations</h5>
                              <p>The following observations should be made while monitoring the patient:</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Septic Shock</h4>
                              <p>This is also known as endotoxic or bactereamic shock. The main cause of septic shock is gram-negative organism such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus Proteus or Pseudomonas pyocyaneus. These organisms are commonly pathogenic in the female genital tract.</p>
                              <p>Gram-positive bacteria, viral or fungal infection, do not commonly cause septic shock. In 20-30% of cases, the cause of infection is combined organisms, and treatment becomes complex.</p>
                              <p>Can you think what the causes of septic shock are?</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Septic Shock</h5>
                              <p>Septic shock can be caused by prolonged rupture of membranes and puerperal sepsis, especially in cases of caesarean section.</p>
                              <p>The primary response of the body to septic shock is the release of histamine and enzymes produced by damaged cells. This contributes to an increase in the permeability of capillaries and vasodilatation. Mediators of opposite action are also produced causing vasoconstriction. Vasodilatation is the overall response and causes the reduction of the systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac output remains elevated during this first phase of vasodilatation. The mother's face is flushed, her skin is warm and moist. Temperature ranges between 38 and $41^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mm Hg .</p>
                              <p>In the second or late phase of vasoconstriction, there is cold hypotension. The continuity of hypotension and vasodilatation causes damage to the kidneys with reduced glomerular filtration due to the constriction of lobules and acute tubular necrosis followed by oliguria.</p>
                              <p>Adult respiratory syndrome is present in many cases. Haemorrhage occurs due to disseminated intravascular depression, which results in multisystem organ failure. There is mental confusion, coma and cardiac failure, which result in death.</p>
                              <p>Identify the source of infection by taking specimens including high vaginal swab, multistream urine and blood cultures. Check the infusion site and indwelling catheter for signs of contamination and change where appropriate.</p>

                             <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Drug Therapy for Septic Shock</h5>
                              <p>Use quick fluid therapy including glucose, saline, rigers, lactate or whole. An injection of dopamine, 20 mg per kilogram, is infused in the vasodilation stage. Hydrocortisone is given, 100 mgs IV stat, followed by 100 mg six hourly until the pulse and blood pressure are stabilised.</p>
                              <p>Antibiotics are commenced immediately after the specimens for culture and other investigations are completed. These include:</p>
