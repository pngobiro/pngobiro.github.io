                        <p>You are now going to look at abnormal purperium. First you need to reflect on the meaning of the puerperium or postpartum period.</p>
                        <p>The puerperium or postpartum period starts about one hour after delivery and continues for the next six weeks. During the postpartum period, the mother goes through physical and psychological transition caused by what she has gone through her pregnancy with all the adjustments of hormones, not to mention the stress and fatigue of labour. Her body is vulnerable to many complications due to blood loss, laceration and injury of the birth canal.</p>
                        <p>Complications during this period are associated with trauma sustained during childbirth, disorders of the circulatory system or psychological disorders. Postpartum nursing starts from early pregnancy. At that time it is important to prevent the occurrence of complications by treating all infections and controlling chronic diseases from getting worse. Give health education to maintain cleanliness and physical status by encouraging balanced diet to prevent anaemia. During labour, aseptic techniques and vigilant observation should be used to enable early detections of complications that are likely to arise. This will allow you to take appropriate action in good time. During the postpartum period, provide appropriate care and counselling to prevent anxiety, and ensure that the new mother has enough rest and sleep. Try keeping the stressed mother calm. Observe her closely to detect any early signs of complications and treat them promptly.</p>

                              <p>When endometritis develops, it manifests in about 48 to 72 hours after delivery. The mother complains of loss of appetite, headache, backache and general discomfort. The pulse rate ranges from $100-120 \mathrm{mmHg}$. The temperature is rarely above $38.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The uterus is bulky and tender to the touch. Lochia discharge may decrease in amount.

                              <p>In cases of Haemolytic streptococcus, the lochia may be odourless initially. If the infection is contained in the endometrium, it clears within seven to ten days of treatment.</p>

                              <p>Mastitis is the inflammation of the breast. If the condition is not treated, it may proceed to abscess formation. The term 'flushed breast' is applied in mild cases where the infection is superficial and localised. The condition rarely occurs prior to the eighth day of puerperium. It commonly arises during the second or third week. Mastitis may arise in two different ways. Cellulitis infection occurs when the infectious micro-organism enters through the cracked nipple and spreads through the interlobular tissue. Adenitis is a result of the multiplication of organisms which are already present in the breast itself due to engorgement, static of milk or bruising through careless handling.</p>

                              <p>This refers to the formation of clots in the veins, usually in the lower limbs. Puerperal mothers are prone to venous thrombosis. Puerperal mothers who have had a caesarean section often haemorrhage and after a difficult delivery it may take a longer time for her to move around. Another possible cause of the condition is varicosity, which may occur during delivery due to injury or inflammation. Mothers over 35 years and those with high parity are also at high risk.</p>

                             <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prophylaxis</h4>
                              <p>During pregnancy you should ensure that pregnant mothers with thrombo-embolic disorders are not given oestrogen preparations and are encouraged to do exercise. Pregnant women with marked varicose veins should wear embolic stockings or crepe bandage. Mothers at a high risk of developing thrombosis or pulmonary embolism should be given a low dose of heparin 5,000 units subcutaneous.</p>
