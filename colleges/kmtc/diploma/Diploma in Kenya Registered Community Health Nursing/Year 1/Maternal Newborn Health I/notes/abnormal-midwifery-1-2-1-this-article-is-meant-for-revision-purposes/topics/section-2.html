The uterus may be indented at the height of a contraction. Both mother and baby are affected by the contractions. The effects of weak contractions bring about very slow or no cervical dilatation. This results in prolonged labour.</p>

If there is foetal or maternal distress in the first stage of labour, the mother is prepared for caesarean section.

                        <p>In cases of incoordinate uterine action, there is alteration in the polarity of the uterus with an increase in the resting tone. The uterus is very irritable. The contractions are strong, painful and erratic but in spite of strong contractions, the cervix dilates slowly. Clinically, the patient experiences a lot of pain both before and after contraction. She is exhausted and bears down early due to severe backache. This may lead to retention of urine. Foetal hypoxia occurs due to the hypertonic state of uterus, which interferes with the placental circulation.</p>
                        <p>On Vaginal Examination (VE) the cervix is noted to dilate slowly despite frequent painful contractions. The cervix is tight, unyielding and oedematous since the mother bears down with each contraction. There are four varieties of Incoordinate uterine action, which will be explored on the next page.</p>

                              <p>This condition happens one in every thousand labours (Myles, 1999). It is a localised spasm of a ring of muscle fibres. This is a result of disorganised uterine action. It is commonly found near the junction of both the upper and lower uterine segment. It usually embraces a narrow part of the neck of the foetus. It may happen at any stage of labour but if it occurs in the third stage, it is known as an hourglass constriction.</p>
                              <p>The spasm may be triggered by an early rupture of membranes. The hypertonic uterus is irritated by being moulded round the foetus or by interuterine manipulation.</p>
                              <p>The condition can be diagnosed vaginally when there is a delay in labour. There is no advance of the presenting part and the upper segment feels tender to the touch. Inhalation of amylnitrate or 10 ml of $2\%$ IV magnesium sulphate solution may relieve spasms.</p>

                        <p>Cephalopelvic Disproportion (CPD) is usually the underlying cause of this condition. Malpresentation should be ruled out through an abdominal and vaginal examination. If malpresentation is present, the patient should be prepared for a caesarean section.</p>
                        <p>If CPD is not present, she may be allowed to continue in labour. Close observation is carried out and a record of observations should be maintained.</p>
                        <p>Reassure the mother to allay anxiety. Make observations of the foetal heart rate, maternal pulse, and respiratory rate half-hourly. Blood pressure should be taken every four hours and urine testing should be done every two hours. Any signs of maternal/foetal distress; dehydration and ketosis, should be reported promptly and may be corrected by giving intravenously (IV) 5% dextrose alternating with normal saline. You should always maintain an intake and output record.</p>
                        <p>Sedate the mother to relieve pain, calm her down and enable her to sleep. Epidural analgesia is very effective in prompting normal uterine action (or pethidine if added to the drip). A low dose of 0.5 mg syntocinon drip can be given. If, after four to six hours, there is still no progress, the mother should be prepared for a caesarean section. A small proportion of mothers with Incoordinate uterine action may end up in normal delivery or vacuum extraction. The midwife should be able to make the correct judgement call.</p>
