                        <p>Copper is absorbed mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, at rates of 35-70 per cent. The efficiency of absorption appears to vary inversely with intake.</p>
                        <p>The transfer of copper across the baso-lateral membrane of the enterocyte is energy dependent and carrier mediated, and there is competition for the pathway from other minerals, most notably zinc and Iron.</p>
                        <p>Other inhibitors include an alkaline pH, molybdenum, calcium and phosphorus and possibly the presence of phytates and sulphides.</p>
                        <p>Absorption is enhanced by the presence of animal protein, human milk and fructose. On absorption, copper is bound to plasma albumin, but becomes rapidly bound to caeruloplasmin in the liver, which then forms the major circulating source of copper. Copper is also secreted into the digestive tract, especially in the bile, and this forms the main excretory route and is believed to be an important mechanism for maintaining a constant body pool of water.</p> <!-- Corrected: "body pool of copper" implied, "water" is likely a typo in source. Keeping verbatim. -->

                        <p>Copper is found tightly bound to proteins, termed metalloproteins, some of which are cuproenzymes and take part in a variety of intracellular and extracellular reactions.</p>
                        <p>40 per cent of copper in the body is found in the muscle; the remainder is in the liver, brain and blood (in red cells and as caeruloplasmin in plasma). Essential for iron metabolism, caeruloplasmin converts ferrous iron into its ferric state. The ferric iron then binds to transferrin and enters cells. An absence of caeruloplasmin, therefore, results in accumulation of iron in liver and brain. Caeruloplasmin is also involved in the response to infection as one of the acute-phase proteins. Copper occurs as a component of several enzyme systems, including cytochrome oxidase superoxide dismutase and various amine oxidases. Cytochrome oxidase is the essential final link of the electron transport chain for the production of energy as ATP. Copper is a component of the free-radical-quenching enzyme superoxide dismutase, which also
                        has an important role in protecting the body from damage by products of the response to infection. Amine oxidase is used in cross-linkage formation in the connective tissue proteins collagen and elastin. Copper-containing enzymes are also involved in melanin production, formation of myelin, and for neurotransmitter synthesis (such as catecholamines, dopamine and encephalins).</p>
