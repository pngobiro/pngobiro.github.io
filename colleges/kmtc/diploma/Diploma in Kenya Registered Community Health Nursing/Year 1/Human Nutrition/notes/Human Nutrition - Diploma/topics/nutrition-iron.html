                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Iron is part of the haemoglobin molecule in blood and as such accounts for two thirds of the body's iron content. Combined with protein globin it is the carrier of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and therefore plays a vital role in survival. In addition some is found in myoglobin which is the pigment found in muscles that has a high affinity for oxygen.</p>
                        <p>The remainder is used in enzymes stored in the body or is found in the blood, being carried between sites in the body.</p>
                        <p>The amount of iron varies with the body weight, gender and long-term nutrition. It is also affected by the state of health, growth and pregnancy. On average the body iron content averages $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body mass in men and $38 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in women.</p>
                        <p>Too little iron gets into the body either because iron is lacking in the person's food (a primary deficiency) or because the person's body doesn't absorb or use iron normally (a secondary deficiency).</p>
                        <p>A dietary history provides clues to primary deficiencies, a health history provides clues to secondary deficiency</p>
                        <p>Then the body begins to use up its iron stores.
                        At this stage, the deficiency might be described as subclinical.
                        It exists as a correct condition and might be detected by laboratory tests, but outward signs have not yet appeared.</p>
                        <p>Finally iron stores are exhausted. Now the body cannot make enough iron containing red blood cells to replace those that are aging and dying.</p>
                        <p>The red blood cells normally carry oxygen to all body's tissues.
                        When iron is lacking fewer red blood cells are made, the new ones are pale and small, and every part of the body feels the effects of an oxygen shortage.</p>
                        <p>Now the overt signs of deficiency appear:- weakness, fatigue, palour, headaches, reflecting iron deficiency state of the blood. Physical examination would reveal these symptoms.</p>
                        <p>Therefore reviewing dietary data may suggest a nutrition problem in its early stages. Laboratory tests may detect it before it becomes over, where as physical examination picks up on the problem only after it is causing symptoms</p>

                        <p>(Organic) Haem iron must be hydrolyzed from any protein to which it is attached and is then absorbed relatively easily. The overall absorption of iron from meat may be 20-25%. The absorption takes place most effectively in the duodenum.</p>
                        <p>Non-haem, inorganic iron must first be solubilized and hydrolyzed before absorption can occur. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach performs this function and converts any ferric ($Fe^{3+}$) iron in food to its (absorbable) ferrous ($Fe^{2+}$) state. This reaction is also facilitated by ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), which can dramatically improve inorganic iron absorption. Other factors that can enhance absorption of inorganic iron include citric acid, lactic acid, fructose and peptides derived from meat. All these maintain its solubility and thus facilitating absorption. None-heme iron is less well absorbed, with a rate of only 3-8% of the amount consumed, in addition to body need, its absorption rate is influenced by the presence of absorption enhancers and inhibitors.</p>

                            <p>Most of the iron in foods is in the oxidized form of ferric iron, which is very poorly absorbed in the body. For better absorption, ferric iron has to be converted to ferrous

                        <p>Iron is carried in the body fluids attached to the protein transferring, which takes it from sites of absorption or release to sites of iron utilization or storage. A substantial amount of iron is transported around the body each day.</p>
                        <p>Iron is an element that is neither used up, nor destroyed in the properly functioning body. Unlike some minerals, it is not required for excretion, and only very small amounts appear in urine and sweat. Minute quantities are lost in desquamated cells from the skin and intestine, in shed hair and nails, and in bile and other body secretions.</p>
                        <p>The body is however efficient, economical and conservative in the use of iron. For example, iron released when the erythrocytes are old and broken down is taken up and used again and again for the manufacture of new erythrocytes. This economy is important. In normal circumstances, only about 1 mg of iron is lost from the body daily by excretion into the intestines, in urine, in sweat or through loss of hair or surface epithelial cells.

                        <p>Because iron is conserved, the nutritional needs of healthy males and postmenopausal females are very small. Women of child-bearing age, however, must replace the iron lost during menstruation and childbirth and must meet the additional requirements, of pregnancy, and lactation. Children have relatively high needs because of their rapid growth, which involves increases, not only in body size, but also in blood volume.</p>
                        <p>The dietary requirements for iron are approximately ten times the body's physiological requirements. If a normally healthy man or post-menopausal woman requires 1 mg of iron daily because of iron losses, then the dietary requirements should be about: 10 mg per day. This recommendation allows a fair margin of safety, as absorption is increased with need. Menstrual loss of iron has been estimated to average a little less than 1 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day during an entire year.
                        It is recommended that women of child-bearing age have a dietary intake of $18 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. During pregnancy, the body requires on average about 15 mg of iron daily to develop
                        the fetus and supportive tissues, and to expand the maternal blood supply. Most of this additional iron is required in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Breastfeeding women use iron to provide the approximately 2 mg of iron per litre of breast milk. However, during the first six to 15 months of intensive breastfeeding they may not menstruate, so they do not lose iron in menstrual blood.</p>
                        <p>Newborn infants are born with very high hemoglobin levels (a high red blood cell count), termed polycythaemia, which provides an extra store of iron. This iron, together with that present in breast milk, is usually sufficient for the first four to six months of life, after which iron from other foods becomes necessary. Premature and other low-birth-weight infants may have lower iron stores and may be at greater risk than other infants.</p>
