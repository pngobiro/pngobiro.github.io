\section*{Sources}

As a rule, fruits, vegetables, fresh meat and dairy products are good sources of potassium.

\section*{RDA}

The adequate intake for potassium is for adults is 4700 mg per day.

\section*{SODIUM}

Sodium ( $\mathrm{Na}+$ ) is the major cation of extracellular fluid. The normal serum sodium concentration is 135 t0 $145 \mathrm{mmol} /$ Litre .
Various intestinal secretions such as the bile and pancreatic juice contain substantial amounts of Sodium. Approximately 35\% to 40\% of the total body sodium is in the skeleton; however most of it is unexchangeable or slowly exchangeable with that in body fluids.

\section*{Distribution and Characteristics}

About half of body sodium occurs in extracellular fluid as the principal cation (electrolyte that carries positive electrical charges) and comprises over $90 \%$ of the cations in blood. $40 \%$ is found in bone tissue as an integral part of the mineral lattice, while the remaining $10 \%$ is found in intercellular fluid.
Sodium and chloride are usually considered together as they occur together in the same foods in the body.

Together with potassium, sodium and chloride contribute largely to the osmolarity of the body fluids, which in turn determines their distribution and balance. Changes in osmolarity may involve changes in content of minerals or of water.
Concentration of sodium in extracellular fluids is maintained at 3.1 to $3.3 \mathrm{gms} / \mathrm{L}(135-145$ $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ) if levels increase above this, water is retained to maintain osmolarity and the extracellular fluid volume increases. This is subsequently lost by increased sodium and water excretion for one to two days

\section*{Note:}

When there is a disturbance in sodium concentration in the body, the osmotic pressure and acid-base balance are disturbed. For example in renal or cardiac failure, excretion of sodium is reduced. Consequently, water is retained along with the sodium accumulate in the tissues, thus increasing the work load of the heart. Accumulation of fluids in the lungs (pulmonary oedema) and in the extremities (peripheral oedema) may occur.

\section*{Functions}

Sodium is the potential cation of the extracellular fluid. As free ionized sodium, it helps to control a number of body processes, which include:-
1. Water balance (osmotic pressure)

Sodium acts with other electrolytes and especially potassium in the intracellular fluid to regulate osmotic pressure and maintain proper water balance. When excretion of sodium is reduced (as is cardiac and kidney failure), water is retained along with the sodium and accumulated in the tissues thus increasing the work load of the heart. This may lead to pulmonary oedema (accumulation of fluids on the lungs) and oedema in the extremities.
2. Acid-base balance

As a base, sodium balances the acidic chloride and bi-carbonate ion in the blood and therefore regulate the acid-base balance.
3. Transmission of nerve impulses and contraction of muscles

Together with potassium, sodium creates an electral change on the nerve cell membrane which passes impulses along the nerve cell membrane which passes impulses along the nerve cell.
4. Contraction and relaxation of muscles

Sodium has a relaxing effect on muscles, working to balance those ions that stimulate their contraction
5. Regulating permeability

Sodium helps to control and operate the exchange of sodium and potassium across the cell wall.
6. Glucose absorption and transport of other nutrients across cell membranes. Sodium also helps to make cell wall permeable to other materials e.g. glucose.

\section*{Functions}

Sodium is the predominant ion of the extracellular fluid and thus regulates both extracellular and plasma volume. Sodium is also important in neuromuscular functions and maintenance of acid base balance.

\section*{Absorption and Excretion}

Sodium is readily absorbed from the intestine and carried to the kidneys, where it is filtered and carried to the blood to maintain appropriate levels. The amount absorbed is proportional to the intake in healthy adults.
About 90 to $95 \%$ of normal body sodium loss is through the urine. The rest is lost in faeces and sweat.
Sodium excretion is regulated in part by aldosterone hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex. When blood sodium levels rise, the thirst receptors in the hypothalamus stimulate the thirst sensation. Ingestion of fluids returns sodium levels to normal.

\section*{RDA}

Upper limit is 2.3 g of sodium per day (or 5.8 g of sodium chloride per day). Approximately 3 g of the daily salt intake exists naturally in foods, 3 g is added during processing and 4 g is added by the individual.

\section*{Factors affecting sodium balance}

Most of sodium consumed are absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract.
Balance is maintained through kidney excretion increases and when intake is low, excretion decreases. In cardiac or renal failure, the excretion of sodium is reduced. Consequently, sodium fluids are retained in tissues causing oedema.

\section*{Deficiency and excess}

A deficiency of sodium is as serious as an excess. Deficiencies may occur as a result of heavy losses as in cystic fibrosis, prolonged vomiting, renal disease, adrenal insufficiency, severe diarrhea, use of diuretics, or excessive and prolonged sweating.

Signs of deficiency include;
- Nausea
- Giddiness
- Apathy
- Exhaustion abdominal and muscle cramps vomiting
- Low blood pressure
- Respiratory failure if sodium is not replaced

On the other hand, too much sodium in the body can lead to the development of hypertension. Avoid too much dietary salt for a long period of time.

Note:

Sodium intakes have been shown to correlate positively with blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure is strongly associated with high sodium intake.

A general reduction in sodium intake is important that the attempt is made over a period of time in order to allow the taste buds to adapt to lower levels.

Reduction can be achieved by:
- Using less or no table salt
- Reducing the amount of salt used in cooking
- Using alternative flavoring agents e.g. herbs and spices
- Reducing amounts of processed foods in the diet, or selecting "lower salt varieties".

\section*{Food Sources:}
- Table salt (sodium chloride) added to foods in ordinary cooking s the primary source. $39 \%$ of table salt is sodium. For example, 1 tablespoon of salt contains approximately 2000 mgs sodium.
- Sodium additives such as sodium bicarbonate and monosodium glutamate
- Sodium found in many foods in their natural state e.g. meat, fish. Eggs, milk and poultry are high in sodium. Vegetable like spinach, carrots, kale and fruits plus legumes also contribute some sodium in lower quantities.
- Water is also an important source of sodium
- Medicines

\section*{Excess}

Persistent excessive sodium intake has been implicated in the development of hypertension.
Excessive salt intake has been associated with increased urinary calcium excretion which may be a risk factor for osteoporosis

\section*{Sources}

Sodium Chloride or common table salt.
Protein foods generally contain more naturally existing sodium than do vegetables and grains, whereas fruits contain little or none.

\section*{SULPHUR}

Sulphur enters the body as the sulphur containing amino acids cystine, methionine and cysteine and of many other organic molecules. The sulphur-containing side chains in these amino acids can link to each other forming disulphide bridges, which give great strength to the peptide produced. These proteins are found in proteins that form the hard parts of the body, such as skin, nails and hair. These amino acids are required for the synthesis of proteins and connective tissue constituents.

Sulphur is also an essential component of three vitamins- thiamin and biotin and panthothenic acid. Sulphur also has an important role in the detoxifying pathways used by the liver for removal of waste products. It also participates in acid base balance.

\section*{Functions}
1. It is part of the structure of the amino acids, methionine, cysteine and cystine and also keratin (fibrous protein found in nails and outer parts of the skin). It is important in the maintenance of stability of protein structure.
2. It is a component of vitamins, thiamine, biotin and pantothenic acid.
3. It participates in several detoxification reactions by which toxic materials are conjugated with active sulphate and converted to non-toxic form and excreted in urine.
4. It is important in the activation of enzymes in their functioning. As such, it participates in tissue respiration.
5. Small amounts of inorganic sulphates along with sodium and potassium are present in blood and other tissues
6. Sulphur is part of polysaccharides found in cartilage, tendons, bone and skin.
7. It plays a vital role in energy metabolism

\section*{Metabolism}

Excess inorganic sulphur generated as a result of hepatic or renal metabolism is excreted in the urine as sulphates. The metabolism of sulphur containing amino acids generates organic acids. Calcium ions combine with these acids to maintain homeostasis.

\section*{Food sources}

These include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dried beans, broccoli and cauliflower.

\section*{Deficiency/Excess}

Sulphur deficiency or toxicity is highly unlikely.

\section*{MICROMINERALS}

\section*{IRON}

Iron is part of the haemoglobin molecule in blood and as such accounts for two thirds of the body's iron content. Combined with protein globin it is the carrier of oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and therefore plays a vital role in survival. In addition some is found in myoglobin which is the pigment found in muscles that has a high affinity for oxygen.

The remainder is used in enzymes stored in the body or is found in the blood, being carried between sites in the body.

The amount of iron varies with the body weight, gender and long-term nutrition. It is also affected by the state of health, growth and pregnancy. On average the body iron content averages $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body mass in men and $38 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ in women.

Too little iron gets into the body either because iron is lacking in the person's food (a primary deficiency) or because the person's body doesn't absorb or use iron normally (a secondary deficiency).

A dietary history provides clues to primary deficiencies, a health history provides clues to secondary deficiency

Then the body begins to use up its iron stores.
At this stage, the deficiency might be described as subclinical.
It exists as a correct condition and might be detected by laboratory tests, but outward signs have not yet appeared.

Finally iron stores are exhausted. Now the body cannot make enough iron containing red blood cells to replace those that are aging and dying.

The red blood cells normally carry oxygen to all body's tissues.
When iron is lacking fewer red blood cells are made, the new ones are pale and small, and every part of the body feels the effects of an oxygen shortage.

Now the overt signs of deficiency appear:- weakness, fatigue, palour, headaches, reflecting iron deficiency state of the blood. Physical examination would reveal these symptoms.

Therefore reviewing dietary data may suggest a nutrition problem in its early stages. Laboratory tests may detect it before it becomes over, where as physical examination picks up on the problem only after it is causing symptoms

\section*{Functions}
1. Component of Hemoglobin - Iron is important as a component of hemoglobin, the pigment in the erythrocytes that carries oxygen from the lungs to the cells. The hemoglobin molecule comprises of two parts, that is Globins- aprotein, and Heme the iron-containing pigment of the blood (responsible for colour). Adequate protein and traces of copper are necessary for hemoglobin synthesis. Vitamins also promote hemoglobin formation. A red blood cell disintegrates after about 120 days. Its iron is reused by the body repeatedly for hemoglobin synthesis,
2. Component of cellular enzymes - In every cell, iron is a component of many enzymes that are important in metabolism of glucose and fatty acids for energy production.
3. It is required in the muscle cells for synthesis of myoglobin.
4. It is required in metabolically active cells for the production of cytochranes
5. It plays a vital role in the synthesis of hormones and neurotransmitters.

It has a role to play in the body's immune function.

\begin{abstract}
Absorption
(Organic) Haem iron must be hydrolyzed from any protein to which it is attached and is then absorbed relatively easily. The overall absorption of iron from meat may be 20 $25 \%$. The absorption takes place most effectively in the duodenum.

Non-haem, inorganic iron must first be solubilized and hydrolyzed before absorption can occur. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach performs this function and converts any ferric ( $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ) iron in food to its (absorbable) ferrous ( $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ) state. This reaction is also facilitated by ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), which can dramatically improve inorganic iron absorption. Other factors that can enhance absorption of inorganic iron include citric acid, lactic acid, fructose and peptides derived from meat. All these maintain its solubility and thus facilitating absorption. None-heme iron is less well absorbed, with a rate of only $3-8 \%$ of the amount consumed, in addition to body need, its absorption rate is influenced by the presence of absorption enhancers and inhibitors.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Factors that reduce iron absorption}

These generally bind with inorganic iron making it unavailable for absorption.
- Phytates (in whole cereal grains)
- Polyphenols (in tea, coffee and nuts)
- Oxalic acid (in tea, chocolate, spinach)
- Phosphates (in egg yolks
- Calcium and zinc)
- Phosvitin (in egg yolk).
- Surgical removal of stomach tissue reduces the number of cells that secrete hydrochloric acid. The acid medium necessary for iron reduction (conversion to an absorbable state) is therefore not provided.
- Mal-absorption syndromes or any disturbance that causes diarrhea or steatorrhea will hinder iron absorption.
- Severe infection of the GIT also hinders iron absorption,
- A diet low in proteins

In summary, iron in the plasma is made available from three sources:
- Absorption from the intestinal tract
- Release from the body reserves
- Release from the breakdown of hemoglobin that takes place constantly.

\section*{Note:}

Studies have revealed that phosvitin inhibits absorption of iron, not only from the egg yolk itself, but also that from other foods.
- EDTA (a food additive)
- Antacids as they create an alkaline environment
- Zinc, copper and manganese (when taken in excess in their relation to iron)
- These binding agents cause iron to be excreted from the body, so that a diet high in any of them leads to a decrease in its absorption.

\section*{Absorption of iron from various foods}
- Iron absorption from various foods is as follows:
- $30 \%$ from meat
- $15 \%$ from fish
- $20 \%$ from soybean
- $10 \%$ from egg
- $10 \%$ from cereals, vegetables and pulses.
- This gives an average of $20 \%$ from animal products. In foods with $12-15 \mathrm{mg}$ of iron, only 1 mg is absorbed.
- N/B: This is why it is very difficult to meet the iron requirement in the diet, especially for adolescent girls, so supplementation, is necessary.

\section*{Factors that enhance iron absorption}
1. The body iron status and iron demand determine the magnitude of iron absorption under any given state. Thus a state of raised physiological need of the body enhances the efficiency of absorption. For example, an anemic person may absorb as much as $50 \%$ while the healthy person absorbs only $10 \%$. Also during growth and in pregnancy when body needs are increased, the absorption rate is increased.
2. Gastric acidity - the hydrochloric acid in the gastric secretions provides a good acid medium for preparation of iron for absorption and utilization.

\section*{Note:}

Most of the iron in foods is in the oxidized form of ferric iron, which is very poorly absorbed in the body. For better absorption, ferric iron has to be converted to ferrous
iron in the presence of an acid medium such as that found in the stomach, or ascorbic acid from the diet.
3. Presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) when consumed together with the iron. The ascorbic acid reduces the ferric iron to ferrous iron which is more soluble, hence more easily absorbed.
4. Presence of a "meat factor" which is available in beef, lamb, fish, liver, pork and poultry, but not in milk, cheese or eggs. This is particularly very useful in enhancing absorption of non-heme iron. Thus a small amount of meat added to a meal where most of the iron is from plant sources will enhance the absorption of both forms of the iron.
5. Combinations of foods in a meal. Since the iron found in plant foods (non heme iron) is less well absorbed compared to that found in animal products (heme iron), combining these foods in a meal will improve absorption. Also combining in a meal foods that are rich in iron, ascorbic acid and folic acid, and not so high in the amount of fibrous vegetable foods and cereals with bran, will increase iron availability.

\section*{Iron in the body}

Iron is carried in the body fluids attached to the protein transferring, which takes it from sites of absorption or release to sites of iron utilization or storage. A substantial amount of iron is transported around the body each day.

Iron is an element that is neither used up, nor destroyed in the properly functioning body. Unlike some minerals, it is not required for excretion, and only very small amounts appear in urine and sweat. Minute quantities are lost in desquamated cells from the skin and intestine, in shed hair and nails, and in bile and other body secretions.

The body is however efficient, economical and conservative in the use of iron. For example, iron released when the erythrocytes are old and broken down is taken up and used again and again for the manufacture of new erythrocytes. This economy is important. In normal circumstances, only about 1 mg of iron is lost from the body daily by excretion into the intestines, in urine, in sweat or through loss of hair or surface epithelial cells.
Red blood cells have an average lifespan of 120 days.

\section*{Use of Iron}
- Predominantly by the bone marrow, for red blood cell synthesis
- By muscle cells for myoglobin synthesis
- In metabolically active cells for the production of cytochromes in mitochondria
- In synthesis of hormonesand nero-transmitters
- In Immune function

\section*{Loss of Iron}
- Small amounts through GIT, skin lining, in bile, urine
- Women loose iron through menstrual period
- Pathological changes in the GIT due to ulcers or some cancers causing bleeding

\section*{Stored Iron}
- Excess is stored in the liver, bone marrow and spleen for immediate needs

\section*{Deficiency}

When the number of red blood cells becomes so low that the oxygen carrying capacity to the tissues is affected the individual will suffer symptoms of anaemia including fatigue, apathy, and loss of appetite and poor temperature regulation.

Deficiency that occurs in the first 2 years of life can impair mental and motor development. This may result in poor memory and learning and a low attention span.

Immune status is also depressed, related to a reduced bactericidal capacity of phagocytes owing to lack of oxidative enzymes. However, iron is needed for bacterial growth, and an iron deficiency in malnourished children may actually protect them from bacterial infection.

When the iron stores in the body become depleted, the supply for the synthesis of new red blood cells becomes inadequate and the cells produced contain less haemoglobin and are smaller in size and fewer in number. As a result, the oxygen - carrying capacity to the tissues is affected and the individual suffers a type of anaemia which is hypochromic and microcytic.
Other effects of deficiency include: -
- Lowered capacity for physical work due to inadequate oxidative mechanism.
- Brain function is affected - with poor memory and learning, and low attention span.
- Immune status is depressed.

\section*{Iron deficiency vulnerable groups}
- People with inadequate intake due to low income, poor food choice or vegetarian diets;
- Low absorption rates due to interference from other dietary components, low stomach acidity or parasites.
- Increased needs or losses owing to growth, pregnancy, heavy menstrual losses or bleeding from other causes.

These factors tend to occur in infants, children, teenagers and women of child bearing age, and these constitute the main vulnerable groups.

Anaemia is diagnosed when the blood haemoglobin levels fall below $13 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ in men and $12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ in women.

\section*{Prevention of Iron deficiency}

It can be achieved by:
- Including more sources of iron in the diet
- Using more bio-available iron
- Reducing foods that compromise iron absorption
- Using iron fortified foods, especially in infants and young children; and
- Taking iron supplements when iron losses are high (e.g. in menstruation)
- Eradication of parasites and infections such as Malaria, Bilharzia, Hookworms etc.

\section*{Excess}

Hemochromatosis or siderosis: is an inherited disease characterized by excessive iron absorption due to the inability to regulate absorption from the intestinal lining. The disease is reported to occur most commonly where beer or other alcoholic beverages are brewed in iron cooking pots, particularly in South Africa. In alcoholics, siderosis leading to iron deposits in the liver may be associated with cirrhosis.

\section*{Recommended Daily Allowance}

Because iron is conserved, the nutritional needs of healthy males and postmenopausal females are very small. Women of child-bearing age, however, must replace the iron lost during menstruation and childbirth and must meet the additional requirements, of pregnancy, and lactation. Children have relatively high needs because of their rapid growth, which involves increases, not only in body size, but also in blood volume.

The dietary requirements for iron are approximately ten times the body's physiological requirements. If a normally healthy man or post-menopausal woman requires 1 mg of iron daily because of iron losses, then the dietary requirements should be about: 10 mg per day. This recommendation allows a fair margin of safety, as absorption is increased with need. Menstrual loss of iron has been estimated to average a little less than 1 $\mathrm{mg} /$ day during an entire year.
It is recommended that women of child-bearing age have a dietary intake of $18 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. During pregnancy, the body requires on average about 15 mg of iron daily to develop
the fetus and supportive tissues, and to expand the maternal blood supply. Most of this additional iron is required in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Breastfeeding women use iron to provide the approximately 2 mg of iron per litre of breast milk. However, during the first six to 15 months of intensive breastfeeding they may not menstruate, so they do not lose iron in menstrual blood.

Newborn infants are born with very high hemoglobin levels (a high red blood cell count), termed polycythaemia, which provides an extra store of iron. This iron, together with that present in breast milk, is usually sufficient for the first four to six months of life, after which iron from other foods becomes necessary. Premature and other low-birth-weight infants may have lower iron stores and may be at greater risk than other infants.

\section*{Exceptional needs}

Infants, adolescent girls, pregnant and Lactating women, surgery cases, accident where a lot of blood has been lost

\section*{IODINE}
lodine exists in the body as lodide, which is far less toxic than the iodine from which it derives. Any iodine ingested in food is rapidly converted to lodide in the gut. lodide is necessary for the production of the thyroid hormones, which maintain the metabolic pattern of most cells in the living organism. In addition, the hormones play a key role in early growth and development of organs, especially that of the brain. In humans, this occurs in fetal and early post-natal life. Therefore, lodine deficiency at this time of life, if it were severe enough to affect thyroid function, will cause hypothyroidism and brain damage, and mental retardation. In the adult, an absence of iodide results in an enlargement of the thyroid gland, but has major consequences when it occurs in pregnant women.

\section*{Sources of lodine}

Most of the lodine in the world is in oceans.
Soils that are mountainous are likely to be devoid of lodine since lodine has been leached due to rain.

Sea foods are a rich source particularly haddock, whiting and herring.
lodized salt is an important source of lodine in areas where food sources are low in the mineral.

\section*{Absorption and metabolism}
lodide absorption is efficient and the free lodide is concentrated by the thyroid gland. The body contains $70-80 \%$ of the body's lodide and uses it in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, combining it with the amino acid tyrosine.

Release is regulated by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Any lodine that is not used in the final hormones is recycled. Most organ systems in the body are under the influence of thyroid hormones, which control metabolism.

If the intake of iodine is insufficient, thyroid hormone levels fall and the pituitary responds by increasing secretion of TSH to accelerate uptake of iodine by the gland. However, in the absence of iodine, insufficient hormone is produced to cause this and TSH secretion continues. This results in enlargement of the cells of the gland as the attempt to trap iodide from the circulation. In addition, unfinished thyroid hormones may accumulate in the gland, contributing to the swelling. The overall size of the gland increases and it may become prominent as a swelling in the neck. This is known as goiter. Gross enlargement of the thyroid may compress other structures in the neck, leading to difficulties in breathing and swallowing.

Goitres most commonly become apparent in puberty and during pregnancy, as the needs for iodine increase. The extent of damage to the infant depends on the severity of lodine deficiency but is associated with the failure of hormone transfer across the placenta to function in fetal brain development.

In mild iodine deficiency (intakes of $50-99 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day) , there is likely to be thyroid enlargement in pregnancy, but no measurable effect on development of the neonate or child. With moderate iodine deficiency (intakes of $20-49 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day) , there is likely to be congenital hypothyroidism in the infant, and abnormalities of psychoneuromotor and intellectual development in children and adults. In populations with severe lodine deficiency (intakes below $20 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day) , goiter occurs in $90 \%$ of females of child-bearing
age. Infants born to these mothers are likely to suffer endemic cretinism, a syndrome of mental retardation, severe neurological signs including deaf mutism, spasticity and major rigidity as well as dwarfism. Up to $15 \%$ of children in these areas may be affected. It has been estimated that this intellectual impairment results in the loss of 10 - 15 IQ points at a population level, and can severely limit national development.

This is a preventable disorder, since lodide supplements can be given to women in vulnerable areas, either in the form of salt, iodized oil or by injection.

Goitre may also arise because of inhibition of lodide uptake by the gland by substances known as goitrogens. These include goitrins, which originate in the cabbage family, thioglycosides which are found in cassava, maize, bamboo shoots, sweet potato and lima beans. They are easily destroyed by cooking, but may contribute up to 4 per cent of cases of goiter in the world.

Excessive intakes of iodine can also cause thyroid enlargement: this may occur when people consume large amounts of seaweed.

\section*{ZINC}

Human zinc deficiency was first reported in the 1960s in the Middle East in teenage boys found to have poor growth and delayed sexual maturation (hypogonadal dwarfism). It is now recognized that zinc is essential for the activities of many enzymes and regulatory proteins, and plays a part in numerous, diverse functions of the body.

\section*{Sources of Zinc}

Dietary intake of zinc is correlated with the protein content of the diet because zinc occurs complexed with proteins and their derivatives. Particularly good sources are lean meat (especially offal), seafoods and dairy products. Pulses and whole grains are a moderate source, but are of importance in vegetarian diets. Low levels of zinc occur in leafy vegetables, fruits, fats, alcohol and refined cereals.

Animal sources of zinc are generally more readily available than plant sources.

\section*{Absorption of zinc}

Both ingested zinc as well as that secreted in various digestive juices, such as bile and pancreatic juice, are available for absorption. Zinc is released from bound sources and attaches to amino acids, which facilitate its absorption. The amount absorbed is regulated to match the needs of the body, although the mechanisms are unclear. There is competition for the absorption mechanism from other divalent ions, such as calcium and iron, which may reduce zinc uptake. Stress has been shown to increase zinc uptake.

Inhibitors of zinc uptake include phytate (especially in the presence of calcium), oxalic acid, polyphenols and folic acid. Zinc taken into the mucosal cells may be bound to metallothionein and then lost from the body when the cells are shed. This is thought to provide an important mechanism for regulating body levels of zinc. Overall, rates of zinc absorption average $30 \%$, although considerable variation may occur with different dietary combinations.

\section*{Zinc in the body}

Zinc is involved in:
- The metabolism of all the micronutrients
- The production of energy
- Nucleic acid synthesis (and therefore cell division);
- Oxygen and carbon dioxide transport (in carbonic anhydrase) antioxidant mechanisms (through superoxide dismutase);
- The immune system;
- Protein synthesis, and is especially important in wound healing and growth.
- The storage and release of insulin
- Nuclear transcription and activation of proteins that regulate gene expression.

With so many roles, it is not surprising that zinc is widely distributed throughout the body. Major sites are the muscle ( $60 \%$ ), bone ( $30 \%$ ), skin ( $4-6 \%$ ), with the remainder found in liver, kidney and plasma. There is no readily identified store of zinc, although in catabolic states, zinc is released from muscle and made available to the plasma.

The liver provides 'fine tuning' of plasma zinc levels, which are tightly controlled, by releasing zinc from metallothionein-zinc complexes in its cells. In infection, zinc is taken up by the liver metallothionein and plasma levels fall. Levels of zinc in other tissues, such as bone, brain, lung and heart, remain relatively stable in the event of low zinc intakes.

Excretion of zinc occurs mostly via the faeces through secretion into the digestive tract. Small amounts are lost in the urine and in skin cells.

\section*{Zinc deficiency}

Zinc status is difficult to measure because plasma zinc levels can be affected by a number of situations unrelated to status.

Signs of mild deficiency may include depressed appetite, poor taste acuity, delayed wound healing, immunosuppression, poor growth, skeletal abnormalities and delayed sexual maturation in children.

Reports from both the USA and Europe have found that the amounts of zinc provided by typical diets are below the recommended allowances for children, adolescent girls, women of reproductive age and elderly men and women.

In developing countries, the opposite problem exists; there may be sufficient zinc in the diet, but the absorption is inhibited by other factors.

\section*{Vulnerable groups}
- Marginal zinc deficiency may be a problem in children and in elderly subjects who have poor appetite and who consume little.
- It has been suggested that poor zinc status in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, may be linked to intrauterine growth retardation, although the evidence is conflicting.
- Other situations in which zinc deficiency may occur include protein-energy malnutrition.
- Prolonged intravenous nutrition.
- Alcoholics
- People with malabsorption
- Diabetics
- An inborn error of zinc metabolism known as acrodermatitis enteropathica, which affects the intestinal uptake of zinc. This produces a severe rash, which is prone to secondary infections, growth failure and behavioral abnormalities. Maintenance on large doses of supplemental zinc is necessary.
- It has been suggested that zinc deficiency may be a component in anorexia nervosa and treatment with zinc sulphate has been reported to help in restoring normal eating patterns.

\section*{COPPER}

There are approximately 100 mg of copper in the adult human body and the amount decreases with age. Deficiency of copper results in anaemia and failure to mature.

\section*{Sources of copper}

The content of copper in plan foods varies with soil conditions and food processing techniques.

However liver, shellfish, nuts, seeds (including cocoa) and legumes together with the outer parts of cereals are reported to be the richest sources ( $0,3-2.0 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{~g}$ ). Bananas potatoes, tomatoes and mushrooms have intermediate levels (0.05-3 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{g}$ ). Low levels are found in milk, bread and breakfast cereals. Drinking water
can be an important source where copper piping is used, and can provide up to 6 mg/day.

Intakes among vegetarian populations have been reported to range from 2.1 to 3.9 mg/day.

Meat and meat products ( 27 per cent), together with cereal products ( 27 per cent), together with cereal products ( 27 per cent) are the main contributors of copper in the UK diet.

\section*{Absorption of copper}

Copper is absorbed mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, at rates of 35-70 per cent. The efficiency of absorption appears to vary inversely with intake.

The transfer of copper across the baso-lateral membrane of the enterocyte is energy dependent and carrier mediated, and there is competition for the pathway from other minerals, most notably zinc and Iron.

Other inhibitors include an alkaline pH, molybdenum, calcium and phosphorus and possibly the presence of phytates and sulphides.

Absorption is enhanced by the presence of animal protein, human milk and fructose. On absorption, copper is bound to plasma albumin, but becomes rapidly bound to caeruloplasmin in the liver, which then forms the major circulating source of copper. Copper is also secreted into the digestive tract, especially in the bile, and this forms the main excretory route and is believed to be an important mechanism for maintaining a constant body pool of water.

\section*{Copper in the body}

Copper is found tightly bound to proteins, termed metalloproteins, some of which are cuproenzymes and take part in a variety of intracellular and extracellular reactions.

40 per cent of copper in the body is found in the muscle; the remainder is in the liver, brain and blood (in red cells and as caeruloplasmin in plasma). Essential for iron metabolism, caeruloplasmin converts ferrous iron into its ferric state. The ferric iron then binds to transferrin and enters cells. An absence of caeruloplasmin, therefore, results in accumulation of iron in liver and brain. Caeruloplasmin is also involved in the response to infection as one of the acute-phase proteins. Copper occurs as a component of several enzyme systems, including cytochrome oxidase superoxide dismutase and various amine oxidases. Cytochrome oxidase is the essential final link of the electron transport chain for the production of energy as ATP. Copper is a component of the free-radical-quenching enzyme superoxide dismutase, which also
has an important role in protecting the body from damage by products of the response to infection. Amine oxidase is used in cross-linkage formation in the connective tissue proteins collagen and elastin. Copper-containing enzymes are also involved in melanin production, formation of myelin, and for neurotransmitter synthesis (such as catecholamines, dopamine and encephalins).

\section*{Deficiency of copper}
- In small premature infants, malnourished infants, malnourished infants and in adults fed intravenously for long periods.
- Premature infants lack the copper normally transferred from the mother in the later stages of pregnancy. As milk is also low in copper, these infants are particularly vulnerable to inadequate copper status. They may suffer anaemia, neutropenia, skeletal fragility and a susceptibility to infections. Similar signs may be seen in infants being rehabilitated from malnutrition.

\section*{Copper toxicity}

Copper accumulates in the body in Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder, now also found to be due to a defective copper-transporting ATPase. In this case, transport into bile for excretion is affected, so that copper accumulates in the body, and becomes deposited in soft tissues. Treatment involves chelating agents which allows the excess copper to be excreted.

Accidental ingestion of excess copper causes vomiting and diarrhea, which may eliminate the mineral from the body.

A maximum safe range for adults has been set at 12 mg copper/day by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Copper balance is reported to be achieved with intakes of $1.62 \mathrm{mg} /$ day , and a minimum daily requirement has been given as $0.4-0.8 \mathrm{mg} /$ day.

\section*{FLUORINE}

\section*{Properties and function}

Fluorine is a mineral element found mainly in the teeth and skeleton. Traces of fluorine in the teeth help to protect them against decay. Fluorides consumed during childhood become a part of the dental enamel and make it more resistant to the weak organic acids formed from foods that adhere to or get stuck between the teeth. This strengthening greatly reduces the chances of decay or caries developing in the teeth. Some studies have suggested that fluoride may also help strengthen bone, particularly later in life, and may thus inhibit the development of osteoporosis.

\section*{Dietary sources}

The main source of fluorine for most human beings is the water they drink. If the water has a fluorine content of about one part per million ( 1 ppm), then it will supply adequate fluorine for the teeth. However, many water supplies contain much less than this amount. Fluorine is present in bone; consequently small fish that are consumed whole are a good source. Tea has a high fluorine content. Few other foods contain much fluorine.

\section*{Deficiency}

If the fluoride content of drinking-water in any locality is below 0.5 ppm , dental caries will probably be much more prevalent than where the concentration is higher.

The recommended level of fluoride in water is between 0.8 and 1.2 ppm . In some countries or localities where the content of fluorine in the water is less than 1 ppm, it has now become the practice to add fluoride to the water supply. This practice is strongly recommended, but it is only practicable for large piped-water supplies; in some developing countries where most people do not have piped water, it is not feasible. The addition of fluoride to toothpaste also helps reduce dental caries. Fluorine does not totally prevent dental caries, but it can reduce the incidence by 60 to 70 percent.

\section*{Excess}

An excessively high intake of fluoride causes a condition known as dental fluorosis, in which the teeth become mottled. It is usually caused by consuming excessive fluoride in water supplies that have high fluoride levels. In some parts of Africa and Asia, natural waters contain over 4 ppm of fluoride. Very high fluorine intakes also cause bone changes with sclerosis (added bone density), calcification of muscle insertions and exostoses. A survey carried out in Tanzania revealed a high incidence of fluorotic bone changes (as shown by X-ray) in older subjects who normally drank water containing over 6 ppm of fluoride. Similar findings have been well described in India. Skeletal fluorosis can cause severe pain and serious bone abnormalities.

\section*{WATER}

Water is the last but not the least, nutrient category. Adults are about $60-70 \%$ water by weight.

Humans can survive for a long period of time without food however if fluids are withheld, there is a rapid deterioration and death may result within 10 days.

Water content is somewhat higher in males than in females, because there is higher percentage body fat in females as there is less water in muscles.

Water is an essential component of the body because:
- The process of ingestion, digestion and absorption is facilitated by the presence of water, including the various secretions along the digestive tract containing digestive enzymes
- Elimination of unabsorbed material via the colon requires water to facilitate its passage
- Metabolic reactions occur in an aqueous environment
- Maintains blood volume
- Nutrients and metabolites are transported in solution within extracellular or intracellular fluids
- Mucous membranes must be kept moist for normal functioning, including the exchange of gases during respiration in the lungs
- The excretion of waste products via the kidney occurs in water
- Regulation of body temperature by transfer of heat within the circulation and the production of sweat.
- Acts as a lubricant and cushion around joints and inside the eyes, spinal cord, and amniotic sac surrounding a foetus in the womb.

Fluid intake is therefore essential for our survival and we require a regular intake.

\section*{Distribution}

Intracellular water (ICW) is the water contained within cells and accounts for two thirds of total body water.

Extracellular water is commonly estimated to account for one third of total body water or $20 \%$ of body weight, and includes the water in plasma, lymph, spinal fluid, and secretions.

Extracellular fluid is the water and dissolved substances in the plasma, lymph, spinal fluid, and secretions and also includes the intercellular (interstitial) water between and around the cells.

Edema is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the intercellular tissue spaces or body cavities

Water is ingested as fluid and part of food. The oxidation of foods in the body also produces metabolic water as an end product.

When water cannot be ingested orally or by a feeding tube, it may be administered intravenously in the form of salt (saline) solutions, which closely resembles the
electrolyte content of body fluids; dextrose solutions; parenteral nutrition, or in blood or plasma as transfusions.

Water intoxication occurs as a result of water intake in excess of the body's ability to excrete water.

The increased volume of intracellular fluid causes the cells, particularly the brain cells to swell, leading to headache, nausea, blindness, vomiting, muscle twitching and convulsions with impending stupor. If left untreated, water intoxication can be fatal.

\section*{WATER BALANCE}

The cells themselves regulate the amount and composition of fluids within and surrounding them. Imbalances such as dehydration and water intoxication can occur but the body quickly restores the balance to normal if it can. The body controls both water intake and water excretion to maintain water equilibrium.

\section*{Water intake regulation}

The body can survive for only a few days without water. When blood becomes too concentrated

Water provides the medium in which most chemical reactions take place in the body. It plays a role in energy transformation, the excretion of wastes, and temperature regulation.

People need enough water to replace daily losses from perspiration, urination and exhalation. The need for water is greater in hot and humid climates, and when physical
activity levels are high. Adequate consumption of water is indicated by the excretion of urine that is pale yellow and normal in volume.

\section*{WATER LOSS}

Water can be lost from the body in various ways:
1. Urine

The amount of urine produced is under hormonal control and is adjusted to achieve fluid balance in the body.
The volume and concentration of urine will reflect the state of hydration of an individual as follows:

Pale-yellow urine colour - indication of good level of hydration in the body
Dark yellow or brownish - an indication of severe hydration.
The volume of urine is affected by certain dietary items as follows:
Protein and sodium contents of the diet can both increase the volume of urine that needs to be excreted (known as obligatory loss). This is associated with the need to excrete urea from protein metabolism and sodium. In these cases it is important to increase fluid intakes to ensure adequate levels to meet excretory needs.

Alcohol is a diuretic and therefore increases water loss from the body. It is estimated that 10 ml dieresis occurs for every gram of alcohol ingested.

Caffeine containing drinks such as coffee, tea, chocolate and colas together with energy drinks on the market have the potential to act as diuretics. This also applies to theophylline and theobromine that are found in tea and chocolate.
2. Faeces

The fluid loss here is generally small. However, amounts can increase if there is diarrhea.
3. Skin

Losses through the skin occur continuously and are part of the body's temperature control mechanism depending on environmental temperature and the amount of physical activity. The body looses heat by evaporation of large amounts of sweat. Physical activity also generates body heat which must be los through sweating.
In a person who has a raised body temperature, it is estimated that skin losses of water as part of thermoregulation are increased by 500 ml . for each $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ above normal.

\section*{4. Lungs}

Losses occur here continuously, as gaseous exchange in the lungs takes place in a moist environment. Losses increase in the following scenarios
- When there is low humidity, for example, in dry climates or air conditioned offices
- In aircraft and at high altitude.
- During exercise the hourly rate of water loss increases from the lungs.
- In patients who are attached to ventilators.

\section*{WATER GAIN}

Water is gained in the following ways:
1. During metabolic reactions a little water is produced for cellular needs
2. From food consumed
3. From drinks

Consumption of fluids is governed by thirst and habit.
When fluid levels fall in the body, there is normally a rise in osmolality of body fluids, and an increase in sodium concentrations. In unusual circumstances, if large amounts of salt have been lost through profuse sweating, an intake of large volume of water may reduce plasma osmolality further and cause continued urine loss. This situation is potentially dangerous and requires an intake of salt with water to restore normal electrolyte balance. In the majority of circumstances, adequate salt is obtained from normal dietary intakes to prevent this happening.

Sense of thirst decreases with age.

\section*{Dehydration}

Mild dehydration - a deficit of $500 \mathrm{~mL}-1 \mathrm{~L}$ or $1-2$ percent of body weight will cause thirst to be triggered.

Mild to moderate dehydration - a deficit of 1-3.5L or 2-5 percent of body weight will lead to headaches, early fatigue, loss of precision in tasks, inability to concentrate, irritability and nausea.

Greater dehydration will cause an elevation of body temperature, increased heart rate and respiration, dizziness, weakness and raised blood pressure. Ultimately renal function will be impaired and the person may become comatose. Death can follow if fluid balance is not restored

\section*{RDA}
$6-8$ glasses of water per day, although it is not necessary to consume only water.
$35 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight per day for most sedentary adults, in a temperate environment .

\section*{Dietary sources of water}

The best sources of water are tap and bottled water; non-alcoholic beverages such as fruit juice, milk and vegetable juice; and brothy soups. Alcohol tends to increase water loss through urine, so beverages such as beer and wine are not as "hydrating" as water is.

\section*{ELECTROLYTES}

Electrolytes are substances that dissolve into positively and negatively charged ions (cations and anions) when dissolved in water. Electrolytes can be simple inorganic salts of sodium, potassium or magnesium or complex organic molecules; they play a key role in a host of normal metabolic functions.

The major extracellular electrolytes are sodium, calcium, chloride, and bicarbonate. Potassium, magnesium and phosphate are the major intracellular electrolytes.

Functions are:
Maintaining physiologic body functions, including osmotic equilibrium, acid-base balance, and intracellular and extracellular differentials.

\section*{CHLORIDE (CHLORINE)}

\section*{Introduction}

The element chlorine occurs as a poisonous gas, but is found in the body as chloride, which is the anion (negatively charged electrolyte) most commonly combined with sodium in the extracellular fluid. As chloride can move freely across membranes, it is also found inside the cell in association with potassium.
Chloride is part of a life-giving compound. It accounts for about $3 \%$ of the body's total mineral matter. The cerebrospinal fluid has the highest concentration of chloride while relatively large amount is found in the gastro intestinal secretions especially as a component of gastric hydrochloric acid, which maintains the strong acidity of the gastric juice.

\section*{Functions of Chloride}
- Together with sodium, chloride in the extracellular fluid helps to maintain water balance and to regulate osmotic pressure.
- It is important in maintenance of acid-base balance.
- It plays an important role in the maintenance of gastric acidity -chloride is secreted by the mucosa of the stomach as gastric medium for protein digestion in the stomach, and for activation of gastric enzymes
- It enhances the carbon dioxide-carrying function of the blood.

\section*{Absorption, transportation, metabolism and excretion processes.}

Chloride absorption occurs by passive transportation, but follows along with the active transport absorption of sodium. Whether chloride is present in food or gastric juice, it is absorbed into the blood circulation in the intestines. Like other irons, excess chloride is excreted by the kidneys, paralleling sodium. Chloride is also excreted through the skin along with sodium in sweat and feaces.

\section*{Deficiency}

Chloride deficiency rarely occurs, except in situations of digestive tract upsets, such as in diarrhea, vomiting and gastric suctioning. Profuse sweating places people at risk, especially infants, children and athletes. Deficiency may lead to:
- Gastro intestinal disorders
- Alkalosis
- Endocrine disorders

\section*{Food Sources}

Table salt (sodium Chloride)
Chlorinated water (treated water)
Foods rich in sodium especially those grown along the sea coast
Ripe olives and sea weeds

\section*{VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS}

\section*{Terms}

\section*{Supplements}

A supplement is a product that provides nutrients in synthetic or isolated form. The vitamin or mineral is extracted from a food source. The body does not recognize easily, synthetic or isolated nutrients.

\section*{Complement}

A complement is a product that provides nutrients as they exist in nature from their original food source. There is a mix of vitamins and minerals in their natural form.

\section*{Purpose/Function of supplements}
1. Correct overt deficiencies. Adults rarely suffer nutrient deficiencies such as scurvy, pellagra, beri-beri but they still occur.
2. Improve nutrition status - For habitual dieters, elderly, vegetarians etc.
3. Reduce disease risks i.e. menopausal women who are intolerant to lactose may not receive enough calcium. A lack of oestrogen prevents absorption and utilization of calcium.
4. Support increased nutrient needs - Women who lose a lot of blood during menstruation may need an Iron supplement. Pregnant women may need folate supplements to reduce the risk of neural tube defects.
5. Improve body's defenses. Health care workers may provide supplementation to people being treated for addictions like alcohol or other drugs and people with prolonged illnesses, injuries, surgery, malabsorption etc.
