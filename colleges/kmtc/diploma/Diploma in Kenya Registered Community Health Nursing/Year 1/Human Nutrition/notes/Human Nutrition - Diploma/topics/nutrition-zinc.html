                        <p>Human zinc deficiency was first reported in the 1960s in the Middle East in teenage boys found to have poor growth and delayed sexual maturation (hypogonadal dwarfism). It is now recognized that zinc is essential for the activities of many enzymes and regulatory proteins, and plays a part in numerous, diverse functions of the body.</p>

                        <p>Dietary intake of zinc is correlated with the protein content of the diet because zinc occurs complexed with proteins and their derivatives. Particularly good sources are lean meat (especially offal), seafoods and dairy products. Pulses and whole grains are a moderate source, but are of importance in vegetarian diets. Low levels of zinc occur in leafy vegetables, fruits, fats, alcohol and refined cereals.</p>
                        <p>Animal sources of zinc are generally more readily available than plant sources.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Both ingested zinc as well as that secreted in various digestive juices, such as bile and pancreatic juice, are available for absorption. Zinc is released from bound sources and attaches to amino acids, which facilitate its absorption. The amount absorbed is regulated to match the needs of the body, although the mechanisms are unclear. There is competition for the absorption mechanism from other divalent ions, such as calcium and iron, which may reduce zinc uptake. Stress has been shown to increase zinc uptake.</p>
                        <p>Inhibitors of zinc uptake include phytate (especially in the presence of calcium), oxalic acid, polyphenols and folic acid. Zinc taken into the mucosal cells may be bound to metallothionein and then lost from the body when the cells are shed. This is thought to provide an important mechanism for regulating body levels of zinc. Overall, rates of zinc absorption average $30\%$, although considerable variation may occur with different dietary combinations.</p>

                        <p>With so many roles, it is not surprising that zinc is widely distributed throughout the body. Major sites are the muscle ($60\%$), bone ($30\%$), skin ($4-6\%$), with the remainder found in liver, kidney and plasma. There is no readily identified store of zinc, although in catabolic states, zinc is released from muscle and made available to the plasma.</p>
                        <p>The liver provides 'fine tuning' of plasma zinc levels, which are tightly controlled, by releasing zinc from metallothionein-zinc complexes in its cells. In infection, zinc is taken up by the liver metallothionein and plasma levels fall. Levels of zinc in other tissues, such as bone, brain, lung and heart, remain relatively stable in the event of low zinc intakes.</p>
                        <p>Excretion of zinc occurs mostly via the faeces through secretion into the digestive tract. Small amounts are lost in the urine and in skin cells.</p>
