                        <p>lodine exists in the body as lodide, which is far less toxic than the iodine from which it derives. Any iodine ingested in food is rapidly converted to lodide in the gut. lodide is necessary for the production of the thyroid hormones, which maintain the metabolic pattern of most cells in the living organism. In addition, the hormones play a key role in early growth and development of organs, especially that of the brain. In humans, this occurs in fetal and early post-natal life. Therefore, lodine deficiency at this time of life, if it were severe enough to affect thyroid function, will cause hypothyroidism and brain damage, and mental retardation. In the adult, an absence of iodide results in an enlargement of the thyroid gland, but has major consequences when it occurs in pregnant women.</p>

                        <p>Most of the lodine in the world is in oceans.
                        Soils that are mountainous are likely to be devoid of lodine since lodine has been leached due to rain.</p>
                        <p>Sea foods are a rich source particularly haddock, whiting and herring.
                        lodized salt is an important source of lodine in areas where food sources are low in the mineral.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>lodide absorption is efficient and the free lodide is concentrated by the thyroid gland. The body contains $70-80\%$ of the body's lodide and uses it in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, combining it with the amino acid tyrosine.</p>
                        <p>Release is regulated by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the anterior pituitary gland. Any lodine that is not used in the final hormones is recycled. Most organ systems in the body are under the influence of thyroid hormones, which control metabolism.</p>
                        <p>If the intake of iodine is insufficient, thyroid hormone levels fall and the pituitary responds by increasing secretion of TSH to accelerate uptake of iodine by the gland. However, in the absence of iodine, insufficient hormone is produced to cause this and TSH secretion continues. This results in enlargement of the cells of the gland as the attempt to trap iodide from the circulation. In addition, unfinished thyroid hormones may accumulate in the gland, contributing to the swelling. The overall size of the gland increases and it may become prominent as a swelling in the neck. This is known as goiter. Gross enlargement of the thyroid may compress other structures in the neck, leading to difficulties in breathing and swallowing.</p>
                        <p>Goitres most commonly become apparent in puberty and during pregnancy, as the needs for iodine increase. The extent of damage to the infant depends on the severity of lodine deficiency but is associated with the failure of hormone transfer across the placenta to function in fetal brain development.</p>
                        <p>In mild iodine deficiency (intakes of $50-99 \mu \mathrm{g} /$ day) , there is likely to be thyroid enlargement in pregnancy, but no measurable effect on development of the neonate or child. With moderate iodine deficiency (intakes of $20-49 \mu \mathrm{g} /$ day) , there is likely to be congenital hypothyroidism in the infant, and abnormalities of psychoneuromotor and intellectual development in children and adults. In populations with severe lodine deficiency (intakes below $20 \mu \mathrm{g} /$ day) , goiter occurs in $90\%$ of females of child-bearing
                        age. Infants born to these mothers are likely to suffer endemic cretinism, a syndrome of mental retardation, severe neurological signs including deaf mutism, spasticity and major rigidity as well as dwarfism. Up to $15\%$ of children in these areas may be affected. It has been estimated that this intellectual impairment results in the loss of 10 - 15 IQ points at a population level, and can severely limit national development.</p>
                        <p>This is a preventable disorder, since lodide supplements can be given to women in vulnerable areas, either in the form of salt, iodized oil or by injection.</p>
                        <p>Goitre may also arise because of inhibition of lodide uptake by the gland by substances known as goitrogens. These include goitrins, which originate in the cabbage family, thioglycosides which are found in cassava, maize, bamboo shoots, sweet potato and lima beans. They are easily destroyed by cooking, but may contribute up to 4 per cent of cases of goiter in the world.</p>
                        <p>Excessive intakes of iodine can also cause thyroid enlargement: this may occur when people consume large amounts of seaweed.</p>
