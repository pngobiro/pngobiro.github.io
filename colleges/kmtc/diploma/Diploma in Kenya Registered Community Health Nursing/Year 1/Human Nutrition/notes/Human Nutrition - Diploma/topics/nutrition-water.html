                        <p>Intracellular water (ICW) is the water contained within cells and accounts for two thirds of total body water.</p>
                        <p>Extracellular water is commonly estimated to account for one third of total body water or $20\%$ of body weight, and includes the water in plasma, lymph, spinal fluid, and secretions.</p>
                        <p>Extracellular fluid is the water and dissolved substances in the plasma, lymph, spinal fluid, and secretions and also includes the intercellular (interstitial) water between and around the cells.</p>
                        <p>Edema is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the intercellular tissue spaces or body cavities</p>
                        <p>Water is ingested as fluid and part of food. The oxidation of foods in the body also produces metabolic water as an end product.</p>
                        <p>When water cannot be ingested orally or by a feeding tube, it may be administered intravenously in the form of salt (saline) solutions, which closely resembles the
                        electrolyte content of body fluids; dextrose solutions; parenteral nutrition, or in blood or plasma as transfusions.</p>
                        <p>Water intoxication occurs as a result of water intake in excess of the body's ability to excrete water.</p>
                        <p>The increased volume of intracellular fluid causes the cells, particularly the brain cells to swell, leading to headache, nausea, blindness, vomiting, muscle twitching and convulsions with impending stupor. If left untreated, water intoxication can be fatal.</p>

                                The amount of urine produced is under hormonal control and is adjusted to achieve fluid balance in the body.<br>
                                The volume and concentration of urine will reflect the state of hydration of an individual as follows:<br>
                                Pale-yellow urine colour - indication of good level of hydration in the body<br>
                                Dark yellow or brownish - an indication of severe hydration.<br> <!-- Corrected: "hydration" instead of "hydration." as per context -->
                                The volume of urine is affected by certain dietary items as follows:<br>
                                Protein and sodium contents of the diet can both increase the volume of urine that needs to be excreted (known as obligatory loss). This is associated with the need to excrete urea from protein metabolism and sodium. In these cases it is important to increase fluid intakes to ensure adequate levels to meet excretory needs.<br>
                                Alcohol is a diuretic and therefore increases water loss from the body. It is estimated that 10 ml dieresis occurs for every gram of alcohol ingested.<br>
                                Caffeine containing drinks such as coffee, tea, chocolate and colas together with energy drinks on the market have the potential to act as diuretics. This also applies to theophylline and theobromine that are found in tea and chocolate.</span>

                                Losses through the skin occur continuously and are part of the body's temperature control mechanism depending on environmental temperature and the amount of physical activity. The body looses heat by evaporation of large amounts of sweat. Physical activity also generates body heat which must be los through sweating.<br> <!-- Corrected: "lost" instead of "los" -->
                                In a person who has a raised body temperature, it is estimated that skin losses of water as part of thermoregulation are increased by 500 ml . for each $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ above normal.</span>

                        <p>Consumption of fluids is governed by thirst and habit.
                        When fluid levels fall in the body, there is normally a rise in osmolality of body fluids, and an increase in sodium concentrations. In unusual circumstances, if large amounts of salt have been lost through profuse sweating, an intake of large volume of water may reduce plasma osmolality further and cause continued urine loss. This situation is potentially dangerous and requires an intake of salt with water to restore normal electrolyte balance. In the majority of circumstances, adequate salt is obtained from normal dietary intakes to prevent this happening.</p>
