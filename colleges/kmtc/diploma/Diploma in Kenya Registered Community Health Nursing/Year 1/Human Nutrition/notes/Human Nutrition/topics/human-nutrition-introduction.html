                        <p>- Nutrition is the study of what food we eat and what it does to our body.Good nutrition is achieved by eating the right amounts of foods.</p>
                        <p>- Food must pass through various processes before it is converted into a form which is suitable for use by the cells in the body.</p>
                        <p>- Nutritional stages are ingestion, digestion, absorption, transport, assimilation, and excretion. It can also be defined as a nourishing substance, such as nutritional solutions delivered to hospitalized patients via an IV or IG tube.Good nutrition is an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity.</p>
                        <p>- It is a cornerstone of good health.</p>
                        <p>- Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.</p>
                        <p>- As nutritional health diminishes nutrient stores in the body are depleted first as stores are exhausted biochemical reactions in the body eventually slowdown finally clinical evidence (signs and symptoms)develop.</p>
                        <p>- The science of nutrition is concerned with food production and distribution ,food classes ,food values ,some psychology, sociology and a certain amount of anatomy and physiology.</p>

                        <p><strong>Nutrients</strong>-this are compounds in foods that are needed by human body for energy, for growth of tissues ,tissues,repair,and maintenance of body tissues,support body's immune functioning all that work towards a healthy living .</p>

                        <p><strong>Malnutrition</strong>-incorrect or unbalanced intake of nutrients ,may be insufficient or in excess amounts.</p>
                        <p>Malnutrition is a term encompasing undernutrition(wasting,stunting, underweight, and deficiencies of deficiencies) and over nutrition(overweight and obesity).</p>
                        <p><strong>Macronutrients</strong>-are essential nutrients required in relatively large amounts such as carbohydrates,fats,proteins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Micronutrients</strong>-are substances required in relatively small amounts such as vitamins and minerals for growth and metabolism of living organisms.</p>
                        <p><strong>Community nutrition</strong>-refers to social ,economic ,cultural,and psychological implication of food and eating.</p>
                        <p><strong>Human nutrition</strong>-is the study of food in relationto health of individuals and groups of people particularly the infants ,adoloscents,pregnant and lactacting mothers (vulnerable group) and functioning of the body organs and provide the energy the body requires.</p>
                        <p><strong>Food bioavailability</strong> -this is reduced or increased affect due to interaction of foods eg when spinach is mixed with meat in anaemic patients it works excellent,this is because spinach produces oxalic acids which binds to iron thus increase iron absorption .</p>
                        <p><strong>Acute malnutrition(wasting)</strong>-this is the result of recent rapid weight loss or failure to gain weight and is associated with an increase with an increase risk of mortality.it can moderate of severe.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chronic malnutrition (stunting)</strong>-is the result of inadequate nutrition over a much longer period of time and is associated with an increased risk of disease and eventual death.</p>
                        <p><strong>Underweight</strong>-is the outcome of wasting or stunting or a combination of both and is associated with poor growth and development.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nutritional status</strong> -is a condition in the body resulting from intake absorption and use of food Junk food-this are less important foods</p> <!-- Note: "Junk food..." is appended here in MMD -->

                        <p>Under-nutrition is particularly bad for children because it affects their mental and physical growth and development.</p>

                        <p>- Energy is defined as the capacity to do work. In nutrition, this refers to the way the body makes use of energy within the food. The ultimate source of energy in living organisms is the sun through the processes of photosynthesis. Energy for the body comes from the food we eat. In the absence of food, energy is produced from the breakdown of body tissues.</p>
                        <p>- Energy is required by the body for movement and to do work. Energy is also required continuously by the body even when we are asleep for metabolism and to keep the heart and other organs functioning. Foods that provide energy are carbohydrates, lipids (fats and oils). When energy foods are eaten, they are burned or broken down providing energy and releasing carbon dioxide. Our body requires energy to make body cells.</p>
                        <p>- Energy is needed for vital functions like heart beat and respiration, growth, repair and maintenance of body tissues, and for maintenance of body temperature.</p>
                        <p>- Energy needs above the normal requirements are needed for:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list" type="i">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">i.</span><span class="item-text">Pregnant women need energy to give to the growing baby</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">ii.</span><span class="item-text">Lactating mother needs energy to produce milk</span></li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>- Energy is measured in joules and previously it was measured in calories. There are 4.184 joules equivalent to one calorie.</p>
                        <p>- Large people, growing children, pregnant and lactating women, sick people, those doing heavy work and those living in cold places need more energy than smaller, less active people.</p>
                        <p>- The burning of food to supply energy is called metabolism.</p>
                        <p>Energy is measured in units called Calories (Ca) or Joules.</p>
                        <p>1 Ca = 4.12kilojoules</p>
