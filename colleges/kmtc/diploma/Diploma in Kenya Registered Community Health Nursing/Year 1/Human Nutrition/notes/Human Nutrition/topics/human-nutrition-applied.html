                        <p>Within the family, the distribution of food usually favours the head of the family (the man when present), and the nutritional risk groups (children and women) are at a disadvantage.</p>
                        <p>Unequal food distribution in a country result from low production of certain foods in some areas, poor infrastructure, lack of storage and preservation facilities and poverty.</p>
                        <p>These factors lead to a high incidence of malnutrition in some parts of the country.</p>

                        <p>Human breast milk is by far the best food for babies and all mothers must be encouraged to breast feed their babies exclusively for six months and to continue breast feeding for as long as possible after that.</p>
                        <p>Breast milk is:</p>
                        <p>Always fresh,</p>
                        <p>safe from diarrhoea and other infections since it contains the mother's antibodies; and it is also easily available, clean and ready for the child at all times.</p>
                        <p>It is easy to digest, has the right temperature, protects and brings the mother and baby close together. Breast feeding is cheap and is always ready.</p>
                        <p>Sucking at the breast helps the postpartum uterus to contract and breast feeding gives the mother the opportunity to care for and love her baby.</p>
                        <p>The mother's breast milk is usually sufficient for a baby for the six months of life.</p>
                        <p>By the sixth month, supplementary foods (weaning) should be introduced gradually.</p>

                        <p>Weaning is the time during which a child's diet changes from breast milk (or formula) alone to family food.</p>
                        <p>Weaning has three stages:</p>
                        <p>Stage 1: 6months The baby gets almost all nutrients from breast milk but starts other. These first foods must be easy to eat and digest and are called weaning foods.</p>
                        <p>Stage 2:6-9 months The child continues to get the same amount of breast milk but eats increasing amounts of other foods. The type of food gradually changes from weaning foods to regular family foods.</p>
                        <p>Stage 3:9-12months The child takes less breast milk and eats more and more of the family foods. Breast milk is mainly a snack and for comfort.</p>
                        <p>Under-nutrition in Sub- Sahara Africa occurs most frequently in children of weaning age (6months to three years)</p>
                        <p>To prevent under-nutrition the most important measure to be taken is to improve weaning foods.</p>
