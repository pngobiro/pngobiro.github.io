                        <p>- Proteins are complex combinations of amino acids that are essential parts of all living cells.</p>
                        <p>- Proteins are synthesised from basic units called amino acids.</p>
                        <p>- It is nitrogen that distinguishes proteins from carbohydrates and lipids.</p>
                        <p>- Amino acids are the units from which protein is synthesised and from which it is broken down during digestion.</p>
                        <p>- Therefore proteins are many amino acids linked together.</p>
                        <p>- Protein is an essential part of all living cells and is needed for growth and repair of tissues.</p>
                        <p>- Extra protein is needed for pregnancy, lactation, growing children and during sickness.</p>
                        <p>- There are thousands of different proteins in both animal and plant foods. These proteins are made of about 26 different amino acids.</p>
                        <p>- The body can convert some acids, but there are eight that it cannot make; these are called the essential amino acids and we must get from the protein in our diet.</p>
                        <p>- Proteins are made from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.They also contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur.Nitrogen is important for growth and repair of the body. Protein is broken down into amino acids.</p>
                        <p>- All extra amino acids from the diet are broken down and the nitrogen component of the compound is separated and eliminated from the body as urea.</p>
                        <p>- The rest of the structure is converted into fat or glycogen.</p>

                        <p>These are the amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the body. They therefore must be provided in the diet. There are eight known essential amino acids. These are: Lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, tryptophan, threonine and histidine and possibly arginine.</p>
                        <h4>- Non-essential amino acid</h4>
                        <p>These are the amino acid that can be manufactured or synthesized in the body as long as enough nitrogen is available. These are: glycine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, serine, arginine, glutamine, asparagines, proline, and glutamine.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Proteins are involved in:</p>
                        <p>- Growth and maintenance of body tissue, regulation of many of the normal workings of the cell, maintenance of body neutrality, antibody formation and transport of nutrients.</p>
                        <p>- Additionally, proteins are used in the production of energy when there is not enough energy available from carbohydrates and lipids.</p>
                        <p>- Growth and maintenance of tissue of body tissue</p>
                        <p>- Growth or increase muscle mass is possible only when there is an appropriate mixture of amino acids over and above those needed for maintenance and repair of tissue. Protein of the body is in a dynamic state. It is constantly broken down and resynthesized.</p>
                        <p>- Formation of essential body compounds</p>
                        <p>- Proteins are used to form hormones, enzymes, pigments.</p>
                        <p>- Hormones are produced by various glands in the body.</p>
                        <p>- This includes the hormones insulin, gastrin, growth hormones all of which are proteins.</p>
                        <p>- Every body cell contains many different enzymes all of which are proteins.</p>
                        <p>- The enzymes facilitate digestive changes in food.</p>
                        <p>- Haemoglobin, the pigment found in the blood is responsible for the red colour and the blood's capacity to carry both oxygen and carbon-dioxide is a protein substance.</p>
                        <p>- Almost all the substances involved in blood clotting are proteins.</p>
                        <p>- Regulation of water balance-Water in the body is contained in two different compartments in the tissues. Little proteins in the body results in an accumulation of fluid in the tissues that makes them soft and spongy and gives a somewhat bloated appearance. This condition is known as oedema.</p>
                        <h4>Oedema</h4>
                        <p>Condition caused by protein deficiency in which fluid collects in body tissues.</p>
                        <p>Oedema has several causes but it is recognised as an early sign of protein deficiency.</p>
                        <p>- Antibody formation</p>
                        <p>Antibodies are produced by the body to fight off foreign substances such as bacteria. The body's ability to fight infection depends on its ability to produce antibodies. These are proteins that react with particular infective organisms or foreign substances that may enter the body. The body must produce an antibody specific to each organism or foreign substance.</p>
                        <p>The need for protein for this purpose may be very extensive.</p>
                        <p>- Transport of nutrients</p>
                        <p>Proteins play an essential role in the transport of nutrients from the intestines across the intestinal wall to the blood, from the blood to the tissues, and across the cell membranes.</p>
                        <p>Most substances necessary to transport specific nutrients are proteins. Proteins in excess of the above functions is used as a source of energy or stored as fat.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Kwashiorkor is got quite easily. Children may die early or get well quickly if attended to.</p>
                        <p>Marasmic kwashiorkor: This is a state where a child is very thin like marasmic child but also has oedema like a kwashiorkor child. The child is inactive and has no appetite.</p>
                        <p>N/B: Most under nutrition is not seen.</p>
                        <p>- It is therefore important to take a child for growth monitoring so that loss of weight can be identified early and corrective feeding done.</p>
                        <p>- Excess of Protein Intake: Leads to deamination and elimination of proteins through the urine.</p>
                        <p>- Excess intake also heavily stresses the kidneys and the liver as these organs struggle to eliminate the excess nitrogen from the amino acids. Since excess proteins can be converted into fat, excess intake also leads to obesity.</p>

                        <h4>Composition of Dietary Fat</h4>
                        <p>Fat is a lipid that is solid at room temperature while Oil is a lipid that is liquid at room temperature.</p>
                        <p>Like carbohydrates, fat is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. However, the ratio of oxygen to carbon and hydrogen is much lower than in simple carbohydrates.</p>
                        <h4>Dietary fat is composed of two major components.</h4>
                        <p>These are a three carbon molecule (glycerol) with one to three compounds called fatty acids (FA) attached to it.</p>
                        <p>Fats when digested in the intestine, release glycerol and fatty acids.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h4>Saturated fatty acids</h4>
                        <p>In fatty acid chains, each carbon atom between the methyl end and the carboxyl end has the capacity of holding or having two hydrogen atoms attached to it.</p>
                        <p>When every carbon atom has two hydrogen atoms attached, the maximum number possible, the fatty acid is called a saturated fatty acid.</p>
                        <p>A saturated fatty acid has two hydrogen atoms (the maximum possible) attached to each carbon in the chain.</p>
                        <p><code>C#CC#CCCC=O</code></p> <!-- Note: MMD <smiles> tag converted to <code> -->
                        <p>Long chains above 12 carbons are the ones that common in food.</p>
                        <p>The longer the carbon chain and the more saturated, the harder the fat at room temperature.</p>
                        <p>The exception is coconut oil which is highly saturated and liquid at room temperature because of the many short-chain fatty acids.</p>
                        <h4>UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS</h4>
                        <p>These are fatty acids that have fewer than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon chain.</p>
                        <p>These have double bonds in their structure.</p>
                        <h5>Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)</h5>
                        <p>Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are fatty acids in which one hydrogen atom is missing from each of the two adjacent carbons, resulting in a double bond between the two carbons. These have only one double bond in the structure.</p>
                        <p>For example olive oil has a predominance of oleic acid (77%) a monounsaturated fatty acid.</p>
                        <h5>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)</h5>
                        <p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are fatty acids in which double bonds between carbon atoms appear in two or more places. For example corn oil has predominance (59%) of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated acid.</p>

                        <p>These fatty acids are known to cure dermatitis or inflammation of the skin and to restore the growth of young animals that have fed a diet low in fat.</p>

                        <p>Omega 3 fatty acids are found in salad cooking oils and margarines and shortening made from canola or soybean. Fish oils and shellfish are also rich in omega 3 fatty acids.</p>

                        <p>- Deficiencies of lipids in general in the diet are rare however there are deficiencies of the essential fatty acids.</p>
                        <h4>- Deficiency of Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs)</h4>
                        <p>This leads to a condition known as dermatitis.</p>
                        <p>This is a condition characterized by inflammation of the skin. Occurs mainly in infants fed on non-fat milk formula.</p>
                        <p>- Breast milk provides enough of the (EFA).</p>
                        <p>In adults deficiency is rare although it leads to cases of reproductive failure; impaired foetal development and lactation failure have been reported. Linolenic and linoleic are found in the same foods.</p>
                        <h4>Excess</h4>
                        <p>- Excess of fat in the body leads to obesity. Problems of lipids are connected to heart diseases especially cardiovascular diseases and cancers.</p>
