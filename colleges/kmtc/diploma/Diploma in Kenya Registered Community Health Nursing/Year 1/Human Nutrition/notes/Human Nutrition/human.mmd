\section*{INTRODUCTION TO NUTRITION ,DEFINITIONS AND ITS ROLE IN GOOD HEALTH}
- Nutrition is the study of what food we eat and what it does to our body.Good nutrition is achieved by eating the right amounts of foods.
- Food must pass through various processes before it is converted into a form which is suitable for use by the cells in the body.
- Nutritional stages are ingestion, digestion, absorption, transport, assimilation, and excretion. It can also be defined as a nourishing substance, such as nutritional solutions delivered to hospitalized patients via an IV or IG tube.Good nutrition is an adequate, well balanced diet combined with regular physical activity.
- It is a cornerstone of good health.
- Poor nutrition can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity.
- As nutritional health diminishes nutrient stores in the body are depleted first as stores are exhausted biochemical reactions in the body eventually
slowdown finally clinical evidence (signs and symptoms)develop.
- The science of nutrition is concerned with food production and distribution ,food classes ,food values ,some psychology, sociology and a certain amount of anatomy and physiology.

\section*{Definitions}

Nutrition-is the sum total of the processes involved in the taking in and utilization of food substances by which growth preparation and maintenance of the body are accomplished.It involves ingestion,digestion ,absorption and assimilation.
Nutrients-this are compounds in foods that are needed by human body for energy, for growth of tissues ,tissues,repair,and maintenance of body tissues,support body's immune functioning all that work towards a healthy living .
Are substance required by the body to preform its basic preforms.
Food-is any nourishing substance that is eaten ,drunk or otherwise taken into the body to sustain life provide energy and promote growth.
Balanced diet-a diet that provides the correct amounts of nutrients for the needs of an individual.
Malnutrition-incorrect or unbalanced intake of nutrients ,may be insufficient or in excess amounts.
Malnutrition is a term encompasing undernutrition(wasting,stunting, underweight, and
deficiencies of deficiencies) and over
nutrition(overweight and obesity).
Macronutrients-are essential nutrients required in relatively large amounts such as
carbohydrates,fats,proteins.
Micronutrients-are substances required in relatively small amounts such as vitamins and minerals for growth and metabolism of living organisms.
Community nutrition-refers to social ,economic ,cultural,and psychological implication of food and eating.
Human nutrition-is the study of food in relationto health of individuals and groups of people particularly the infants ,adoloscents,pregnant and lactacting mothers (vulnerable group) and functioning of the body organs and provide the energy the body requires.
Food bioavailability -this is reduced or increased affect due to interaction of foods eg when spinach is mixed with meat in anaemic patients it works excellent,this is because spinach produces oxalic acids which binds to iron thus increase iron absorption .
Acute malnutrition(wasting)-this is the result of recent rapid weight loss or failure to gain weight and is associated with an increase with an increase risk of mortality.it can moderate of severe.
Chronic malnutrition (stunting)-is the result of inadequate nutrition over a much longer period of time and is associated with an increased risk of disease and eventual death.

Underweight-is the outcome of wasting or stunting or a combination of both and is associated with poor growth and development.
Nutritional status -is a condition in the body resulting from intake absorption and use of food Junk food-this are less important foods
Faddism-false information in a community done as a fashion

\section*{Importance of good nutrition}
1. For physical and mental development for children and adolescents
2. For healthy pregnancy and deliveries
3. For resistance of infections and diseases
4. Provision of energy for working well
5. To prevent deficiencies eg kwashiokor ,marasmus

\section*{Characteristics of a healthy individual}
i. Generally well built phsically with right weight ,height for their age but hereditary traits plays a role
ii. Mentally alert
iii. Good natured
iv. Energtic
v. Good eyesight
vi. Clear skin
vii.Good appetite
viii. Head plenty of hair

\section*{MALNUTRITION}

Def: "Bad" nutrition.
- Malnutrition is an abnormal physiological condition that results from deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in the consumption of macro and or micronutrients.
- It can be due to under-nutrition or over-nutrition.
- Under-nutrition is common in developing countries.

Means eating too little food or not enough healthy foods.
Under-nutrition affects mostly children and pregnant women or lactating women.
Under-nutrition is particularly bad for children because it affects their mental and physical growth and development.
It is also a major cause of death in children.
- Over-nutrition or eating too much of certain foods (fats, sugars and refined carbohydrates) causes obesity and some degenerative diseases.

\section*{BASIC NUTRITION}

Foods can be classified into three main groups based on their nutritional function in the body:
- Energy foods (Carbohydrates)
- Body building foods (Proteins)
- Protective foods (Vitamins)

Each group (except water) contains a large number of different nutrients with a similar but not identical, chemical structure.

\section*{BALANCED DIET}

The term "balanced diet" refers to a diet that has all nutrients required by the body in the right amounts i.e. carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, fats, and water.

\section*{ENERGY REQUIREMENTS}
- Energy is defined as the capacity to do work. In nutrition, this refers to the way the body makes use of energy within the food. The ultimate source of energy in living organisms is the sun through the processes of photosynthesis. Energy for the body comes from the food we eat. In the absence of food, energy is produced from the breakdown of body tissues.
- Energy is required by the body for movement and to do work. Energy is also required continuously by the body even when we are asleep for metabolism and to keep the heart and other organs functioning. Foods that provide energy are carbohydrates, lipids (fats and oils). When energy foods are eaten, they are burned or broken down providing energy and releasing carbon dioxide. Our body requires energy to make body cells.
- Energy is needed for vital functions like heart beat and respiration, growth, repair and maintenance of body tissues, and for maintenance of body temperature.
- Energy needs above the normal requirements are needed for:
i. Pregnant women need energy to give to the growing baby
ii. Lactating mother needs energy to produce milk
iii. Children require energy to grow, run, play, and walk
iv. Adults need energy to work. Everybody needs energy for metabolism.
- Energy is measured in joules and previously it was measured in calories. There are 4.184 joules equivalent to one calorie.
- Large people, growing children, pregnant and lactating women, sick people, those doing heavy work and those living in cold places need more energy than smaller, less active people.
- The burning of food to supply energy is called metabolism.
Energy is measured in units called Calories (Ca) or Joules.
1 Ca = 4.12kilojoules

\section*{PURPOSE OF ENERGY IN THE HUMAN BODY}
- Energy is needed in the human body for the following purposes:
- Required for normal body functions such as the brains, nervous system and breathing
- Maintenance of body temperature
- Continuous action of the heart, lungs and other organs
- Breakdown, repair and building of tissues (metabolic processes)

\section*{NUTRIENTS;carbohydrates}

\section*{Definition of Terms}

Amylase: The enzyme that acts on the starch amylose Amylose: a form of starch with long straight chains of glucose units
Cellulose: a structural carbohydrate in plants that resists hydrolysis in the human digestive system.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): Is found in the nucleus of cells and determines the hereditary makeup of an individual.
Dextrin: An intermediate product of starch hydrolysis. Disaccharide: A sugar capable of being hydrolyzed to two monosaccharide molecules.
Fibre: Compounds of plant origin not capable of hydrolysis by enzymes in the human digestive system. Fructose: A monosaccharide occurring in fruits, honey and some vegetables. It is the sweetest monosaccharide.

Polysaccharide: A carbohydrate that upon hydrolysis yields more than 10 monosaccharide units.
Ribonucleic acid (RNA): Is found mainly outside the nucleus of the cell. It controls manufacture of body proteins including enzymes.
Sucrose: Ordinary table sugar, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose found in cane sugar, sugar beets, molasses, some fruits, vegetables and honey.
Def: Carbohydrates are organic compounds that consist of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
- Composition: The general formula of carbohydrates is CnH2nOn.
- They range from simple sugars of three to seven carbons to complex polymers. In nutrition, the six carbon sugars (hexoses) and the five carbon sugars (pentoses) and their polymers are the ones that play important roles.

\section*{Classification}
- Carbohydrates consist of monosaccharide, disaccharides and polysaccharides.
- Monosaccharides are either aldoses or ketoses.
- Glucose is a monosaccharide that is the most important dietary energy source.
- Disaccharides of nutritional value/importance are sucrose, lactose and maltose.
- Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates.

They are formed from monosaccharides and disaccharides.
They include starch, glycogen, dextrin, cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin..
Starch
Starch is found only in plants.
Dextrin
Dextrin is formed when heat (toasting) or enzymes (during digestion) act on starch.
Glycogen
This is the storage form of carbohydrates in humans and the primary and most readily available source of glucose and energy. It is stored mainly in the liver.
functions of carbohydrates
- Carbohydrates are a source of energy, a dietary essential and a source of palatability in the diet among others.
- Carbohydrates are the least expensive source of energy in the body. I gram of carbohydrates yields 4 kcalories of energy regardless of the source.
The specific functions of carbohydrates are:
- The primary function of carbohydrates is to provide energy. It is recommended that about $60 \%$ of the energy requirement should be provided from carbohydrates in the diet. Glucose is the major source of energy for the brains, nerve tissue and the lungs.
- Carbohydrate is a dietary essential. Although carbohydrates can be replaced as a source of energy by fat and proteins, a series of undesirable symptoms appear when there is no carbohydrate in the diet. This leads symptoms of weakness.
- Carbohydrates contribute to protein sparing. The body uses energy from carbohydrates first as a source of energy. When energy from carbohydrates is insufficient, then the body utilizes energy from proteins.
- Fat metabolism is possible only with presence of carbohydrates. Inadequate carbohydrates in the diet results in larger amounts of fat being used for energy than the body can handle.
- Provides bulk in the diet. Fibre/roughage is obtained from carbohydrates.
- Lactose remains in the small intestines for a longer time than other disaccharides and encourages
growth of beneficial bacteria. This results in a laxative effect. These bacteria synthesis vitamin K in the large intestines.
- Carbohydrates maintains body temperature
- Carbohydrates are essential in the utilisation of other nutrients in the body.
- It is a source of sweetness or palatability in the food consumed.

\section*{SOURCES}

The main carbohydrate sources are:
- Sugar. This is found in honey, sugar in fruits and other sweet foods.
- Cereals. This includes cereals such as maize, millet, sorghum, rice and wheat.
- Roots and tubers. These are cassava, sweet potatoes, irish potatoes, yams and arrowroots.
Fruits. These include, bananas, pumpkins, pineapples, avocadoes and many others.
- Lactose in milk. All other sources of carbohydrates are from plants foods.

\section*{DEFICIENCY}
- Inadequate intake of proteins and carbohydrates leads to protein energy malnutrition (PEM). This condition is due to starvation and not enough proteins and energy foods. PEM can be ;
i. kwashiorkor,
ii. marasmus or
iii. marasmic kwashiorkor
which are severe forms of PEM. Mild PEM may not show specific signs but generally the child is underweight for his/her age and not as active as their age-mates.

\section*{Marasmic kwashiorkor}

This is due mainly due to consumption of inadequate protein and energy foods.
In children this condition is evident through symptoms indicated below.

\section*{Symptoms}

Common symptoms of a marasmic kwashiorkor child are:
- Child is underweight for his/her age
- The child is very thin
- Legs and hands are like sticks
- The ribs are visible
- Very thin muscles
- Big head
- Thin face like that of an old person
- There is loss of appetite.

Marasmus occurs at an age. The child takes long to heal. This condition is due to a starvation.

\section*{Marasmus}

This is due to deficiency of carbohydrates in the diet. It is rare that a child suffers from marasmus alone because a child who is deficient in carbohydrates is most likely to be deficient in also proteins and other nutrients.

\section*{PROTEINS}
- Proteins are complex combinations of amino acids that are essential parts of all living cells.
- Proteins are synthesised from basic units called amino acids.
- It is nitrogen that distinguishes proteins from carbohydrates and lipids.
- Amino acids are the units from which protein is synthesised and from which it is broken down during digestion.
- Therefore proteins are many amino acids linked together.
- Protein is an essential part of all living cells and is needed for growth and repair of tissues.
- Extra protein is needed for pregnancy, lactation, growing children and during sickness.
- There are thousands of different proteins in both animal and plant foods. These proteins are made of about 26 different amino acids.
- The body can convert some acids, but there are eight that it cannot make; these are called the essential amino acids and we must get from the protein in our diet.
- Proteins are made from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.They also contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur.Nitrogen is important for growth and repair of the body. Protein is broken down into amino acids.
- All extra amino acids from the diet are broken down and the nitrogen component of the compound is separated and eliminated from the body as urea.
- The rest of the structure is converted into fat or glycogen.

\section*{TYPES OF AMINO ACIDS}

There are two types of amino acids, essential amino acids and non-essential amino acids.

\section*{- Essential amino acids}

These are the amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the body. They therefore must be provided in the diet. There are eight known essential amino acids. These are: Lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, tryptophan, threonine and histidine and possibly arginine.

\section*{- Non-essential amino acid}

These are the amino acid that can be manufactured or synthesized in the body as long as enough nitrogen is available. These are: glycine, tyrosine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, alanine, serine, arginine, glutamine, asparagines, proline, and glutamine.

\section*{PROTEIN QUALITY}

The quality of protein is determined by the kind of amino acid a food contains.

\section*{Biological value}
- Proteins that contain all essential amino acids in proportions capable of promoting growth when they are the sole source of protein in the diet are described as
- complete proteins or good quality proteins or proteins of high biological value. All animal proteins except gelatine are complete proteins.
- Incomplete proteins also known as poor quality proteins or proteins of low biological value are those that lack or have limited amounts of one or more essential amino acids. These are proteins from plant sources.

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF PROTEINS}

Proteins are involved in:
- Growth and maintenance of body tissue, regulation of many of the normal workings of the cell, maintenance of body neutrality, antibody formation and transport of nutrients.
- Additionally, proteins are used in the production of energy when there is not enough energy available from carbohydrates and lipids.
- Growth and maintenance of tissue of body tissue
- Growth or increase muscle mass is possible only when there is an appropriate mixture of amino acids over and above those needed for maintenance and repair of tissue. Protein of the body is in a dynamic state. It is constantly broken down and resynthesized.
- Formation of essential body compounds
- Proteins are used to form hormones, enzymes, pigments.
- Hormones are produced by various glands in the body.
- This includes the hormones insulin, gastrin, growth hormones all of which are proteins.
- Every body cell contains many different enzymes all of which are proteins.
- The enzymes facilitate digestive changes in food.
- Haemoglobin, the pigment found in the blood is responsible for the red colour and the blood's capacity to carry both oxygen and carbon-dioxide is a protein substance.
- Almost all the substances involved in blood clotting are proteins.
- Regulation of water balance-Water in the body is contained in two different compartments in the tissues. Little proteins in the body results in an accumulation of fluid in the tissues that makes them soft and spongy and gives a somewhat bloated appearance. This condition is known as oedema.

\section*{Oedema}

Condition caused by protein deficiency in which fluid collects in body tissues.
Oedema has several causes but it is recognised as an early sign of protein deficiency.
- Antibody formation

Antibodies are produced by the body to fight off foreign substances such as bacteria. The body's ability to fight infection depends on its ability to produce antibodies. These are proteins that react with particular infective organisms or foreign substances that may enter the body. The body must produce an antibody specific to each organism or foreign substance.
The need for protein for this purpose may be very extensive.
- Transport of nutrients

Proteins play an essential role in the transport of nutrients from the intestines across the intestinal wall to the blood, from the blood to the tissues, and across the cell membranes.
Most substances necessary to transport specific nutrients are proteins. Proteins in excess of the above functions is used as a source of energy or stored as fat.

\section*{DEFICIENCY}

Deficiency of proteins and energy foods leads to kwashiorkor.
This is Ghanaian name that means a displaced person/child.

\section*{Symptoms:}
- Round swollen cheeks

Oedema in the legs and hands. Too fat as swollen with water. When press a finger, it leaves a hole/dent.
Big stomach
- Weak lose muscle
- Pale thin hair that is easily pulled out.
- Pale skin that peels off easily.
- Sad looking and inactive
- May stop walking and growing

Kwashiorkor is got quite easily. Children may die early or get well quickly if attended to.
Marasmic kwashiorkor: This is a state where a child is very thin like marasmic child but also has oedema like a kwashiorkor child. The child is inactive and has no appetite.
N/B: Most under nutrition is not seen.
- It is therefore important to take a child for growth monitoring so that loss of weight can be identified early and corrective feeding done.
- Excess of Protein Intake: Leads to deamination and elimination of proteins through the urine.
- Excess intake also heavily stresses the kidneys and the liver as these organs struggle to eliminate the excess nitrogen from the amino acids. Since excess
proteins can be converted into fat, excess intake also leads to obesity.

\end{tabular}

\section*{FIBRE}

Although fibre does not add nutrient value to the body, it acts as a broom and enables the food to move through the gastro-intestinal tract through the process of peristalsis and food wastes to be eliminated from the body. On the other hand, fat clogs up the intestines. Fibre is obtained from plant sources only.

\section*{Sources}

Dietary fibre is found only in plant foods. These include fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grain cereals and legumes and whole grain products.

\section*{FATS AND OILS}
- Fat is a lipid that is solid at room temperature while oil is a lipid that is liquid at room temperature.
Like carbohydrates, fat is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
- However, the ratio of oxygen to carbon and hydrogen is much lower than in simple carbohydrates.
Dietary fat is composed of two major components.
- These are a three carbon molecule (glycerol) with one to three compounds called fatty acids (FA) attached to it. Lipids are a group of compounds that include ordinary fats and oils, waxes, and related compounds found in foods and the human body.
Fat- Solid
Oils- Liquid
- Fats are:
i. Insoluble in water
ii. Soluble in organic solvents and
iii. Capable of being used by living organisms.

\section*{Composition of Dietary Fat}

Fat is a lipid that is solid at room temperature while Oil is a lipid that is liquid at room temperature.
Like carbohydrates, fat is composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. However, the ratio of oxygen to carbon and hydrogen is much lower than in simple carbohydrates.

\section*{Dietary fat is composed of two major components.}

These are a three carbon molecule (glycerol) with one to three compounds called fatty acids (FA) attached to it.
Fats when digested in the intestine, release glycerol and fatty acids.

\section*{TYPES OF FATTY ACIDS}
- Saturated fatty acids

In fatty acid chains, each carbon atom between the methyl end and the carboxyl end has the capacity of holding or having two hydrogen atoms attached to it.
When every carbon atom has two hydrogen atoms attached, the maximum number possible, the fatty acid is called a saturated fatty acid.
A saturated fatty acid has two hydrogen atoms (the maximum possible) attached to each carbon in the chain.
<smiles>C#CC#CCCC=O</smiles>

Long chains above 12 carbons are the ones that common in food.

The longer the carbon chain and the more saturated, the harder the fat at room temperature.
The exception is coconut oil which is highly saturated and liquid at room temperature because of the many short-chain fatty acids.

\section*{UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS}

These are fatty acids that have fewer than the maximum number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon chain.
These have double bonds in their structure.

\section*{Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)}

Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are fatty acids in which one hydrogen atom is missing from each of the two adjacent carbons, resulting in a double bond between the two carbons. These have only one double bond in the structure.
For example olive oil has a predominance of oleic acid (77\%) a monounsaturated fatty acid.

\section*{Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)}

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are fatty acids in which double bonds between carbon atoms appear in two or more places. For example corn oil has predominance (59\%) of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated acid.

\section*{ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS}

This is a fatty acid that must be provided in the diet for good health.
There are three EFAs, linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic acids.
These three cannot be produced by the body.
These fatty acids are known to cure dermatitis or inflammation of the skin and to restore the growth of young animals that have fed a diet low in fat.
Omega 3 Fatty Acids
Omega 3 fatty acids are found in salad cooking oils and margarines and shortening made from canola or soybean. Fish oils and shellfish are also rich in omega 3 fatty acids.

\section*{FUNCTIONS OF FATS AND OILS}
- Provide energy in a more concentrated form than carbohydrates. 1gm of fat gives 9kcalories of energy. Therefore it provides $21 / 4$ times more concentrated in energy than carbohydrates or proteins.
- Acts as a carrier of fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K.

Are a source of essential fatty acids (EFA) needed by the body.
- Provides palatability in the food. It gives taste, flavour and juiciness that enhance food. Most times, nutritious food is not the most palatable.
- Provides satiety value of foods. Therefore it has negative effects immediately before sports or athletic events.
- They act as:
- Energy reserve in the body
- Insulates the body and keeps it warm. Maintains body temperature as the cell membranes combine with phosphorus to form layers.
- Protects important body organs like liver, kidney and heart.
- The levels of carbohydrates and fats in the diet should be enough to provide needed energy so that the protein in the diet is spared for other functions.

\section*{Sources}

The main sources of lipids in Kenya diets are:
- Found in foods such as avocado, simsim, milk, coconuts, groundnuts and all other nuts and fatty meats.
- Foods high in cholesterol are of animal origin such as eggs and liver. Foods high in fats are not necessarily high in cholesterol.
- Fats and oils used in food preparation are also a source of fat in the diet.

\section*{DEFICIENCIES}
- Deficiencies of lipids in general in the diet are rare however there are deficiencies of the essential fatty acids.
- Deficiency of Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs)

This leads to a condition known as dermatitis.
This is a condition characterized by inflammation of the skin. Occurs mainly in infants fed on non-fat milk formula.
- Breast milk provides enough of the (EFA).

In adults deficiency is rare although it leads to cases of reproductive failure; impaired foetal development and lactation failure have been reported. Linolenic and linoleic are found in the same foods.

\section*{Excess}
- Excess of fat in the body leads to obesity. Problems of lipids are connected to heart diseases especially cardiovascular diseases and cancers.

\section*{MINERALS}
- Together with vitamins, minerals are referred to as micronutrients.
- The body needs minerals for various functions:

Sodium, potassium and chlorine are found in the body fluids
- Some minerals form part of body tissue (e.g. calcium and phosphorus in bones), some form part of certain hormones
- Minerals found in the human body include:

Calcium phosphorus, Potassium
Sodium
Sulphur
Copper
Magnesium
Manganese
Iron

Chlorine
Iodine
Flourine

\section*{IRON}
- Iron is important for transport of oxygen in the body.

\section*{Functions}
- Iron is a carrier of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
- It is used in blood formation to make haemoglobin, the red pigment in blood that is responsible to carry oxygen from lungs to the cells.
- Iron plays a vital role in the body's immune system.
- It is used in antibody production and detoxification of drugs in the liver. It eliminates old red blood cells and builds new cells.
- It makes haemoglobin. Iron builds blood. Iron is found in haemoglobin of the red blood cells.
- It is found in the muscle of pigment myoglobin
- Is also an important constituent of many enzyme system
- Iron-deficiency anaemia is the most common nutritional deficiency disease worldwide.
- Foods rich in iron include meats, seafood, beans, greens, including kale and spinach and nuts

\section*{SULFATES}

\section*{Functions}
- A contributor of sulphur to many important compounds such as certain amino acids,antioxidandants, and the vitamins biotin and thiamin
- Stabilizes protein shape by forming sulphur sulphur bridges

\section*{Sources}

All protein containing foods

\section*{lodine}
- Iodine is an essential trace element that is a constituent of the thyroid hormones.
- It is found concentrated in the thyroid gland but also found in salivary, mammary and gastric glands and in the kidneys.
- Iodine found in ocean waters but it is unevenly distributed in the soils.
- Soils in mountainous regions and in areas with frequent flooding have relatively low iodine levels.

\section*{Functions}
- Iodine ensures the development and proper functioning of the brain and the nervous system.
- As part of the thyroid hormone, thyroxin, iodine plays a major role in regulating growth and development.
- It is used in energy metabolism.
- It is essential for reproduction.

\section*{Sources}
- Sea foods such as seaweed, shellfish, sardines, iodised salt and plants depending on the levels of iodine in the soils where grown.
- Levels of iodine in tropical countries will have losses due to:
- Long term exposure to air, moisture, light and heat Contaminants in salt may also enhance losses

\section*{Deficiency}
- Deficiency of iodine leads to goitre, a swelling in the neck.
- This is due to enlargement of the thyroid gland as it attempts to compensate for lack of iodine essential for the synthesis of thyroxin.
- Deficiency is common in areas of flooding, tropical rains, highlands that have iodine leached from the soils.
- Cretinism: This occurs among children born of mothers who have had a limited supply of iodine intake during adolescence and pregnancy and who live in goitre endemic areas.
- Children become physically dwarf (small) and mentally retarded, have thick, pasty skin and enlarged protruding abdomen.

\section*{Zinc}

Zinc occurs in all living tissues.
- It is a component of many enzymes and is part of the hormone insulin molecule.

\section*{Functions}

It is a component of many enzyme systems that function in:
- tissue growth, maintenance and healing;
- metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids and synthesis and degradation of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and therefore important in cell division.
Other functions include:
- sexual maturation and reproduction, development of immune reactions, contributes to wound healing as concentrated in wound tissue,
- plays a role in growth as it has a role in protein synthesis.
- It enhances the sense of taste therefore it is required for restoring taste and appetite.

\section*{Deficiency}
- Zinc deficiency leads to delayed sexual development, growth failure, loss of sense of taste, mental lethargy, skin changes, delayed wound healing, reduced resistance to diseases and low birth weight babies.
- Zinc supplementation has been found to reduce the severity and duration of diarrhoea, pneumonia, malaria and HIV/AIDS.

\section*{Dietary Sources}
- The richest sources of zinc are fish, poultry and meats.
- Eggs and dairy products are free of phytates but their zinc content is not known.
- Nuts and seeds such as pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, simsim, almonds, and cooked beans are high in zinc.
- Fermentation of staples (porridge from fermented cereals) increases the amount of phytase which breaks down the pyhtates.

\section*{Selenium}

\section*{Functions}
- Assists a group of enzyme that defend against oxidation
- Deficiency symptoms predisposition to a formof heart disease characterised by fibrous cardiac tissue

\section*{Sources}

\section*{VITAMINS}
- Vitamins and minerals are referred to as micronutrients because they are required in very small amounts in relation to the other nutrients but they are essential for good health
- Vitamins are organic substances that we take in foods but are unrelated chemically.
- They are required or essential or vital for normal functioning of the body and must be supplied in the diet.
- They are essential to health and life because without them, the body cannot use other nutrients.
- They are therefore required for specific functions.

Vitamins are special molecules made mostly by plants and are needed in very small amounts.

\section*{Classification}
- Vitamins are classified into two groups.
1. Fat soluble: Vitamins A, D, E and K and unutilised supplies can be stored in the body.
2. water soluble vitamins: vitamins $B$ complex and $C$ and cannot be stored in the body therefore they must supplied daily in the diet

\section*{Vitamin A(retinol,retinal,retinoic acid)}

\section*{Eye function}

Vitamin A is responsible for vision in dim light.
- If there is no adequate supply of vitamin A, this can be noted when one moves from a lighted room to a dark room, they can't see well.
- Making and maintenance healthy epithelium

Vitamin A maintains the health of cells and is responsible for the formation of epithelial cells.
- Essential for keeping the body lining moist and protecting the skin
Essential for an effective immune system
Vitamin A is essential for proper immune function.
- The vitamin protects the skin and the body against infections. It also plays a role in the effectiveness of the senses of taste, smell, vision and hearing.

\section*{Sources}

Liver, egg yolk and dairy products are rich sources. Precursors are found in deep yellow and dark green leafy vegetables and fruits such as pumpkins, sweet potatoes, paw paws, sukuma wiki, cowpea leaves, spinach, amaranthus, kales, spider weed (saga) managu and carrots.

\section*{Deficiency}
- Deficiency of vitamin A leads to the immune system being compromised and impairment of the visual system which progresses to xerophthalmia.
- Inability to see in deem light especially in the evenings which is referred to as night blindness (nyctalopia) and dryness of the eye (exophthalmia and kerotomalasia).
- This condition can be corrected by taking vitamin A supplementation. Reduced immune system
- A continual low intake of vitamin A leads to dry, scaly skin and increases skin and other infections (follicular
keratosis). Early treatment with vit. A pills will reverse these conditions.
- This leads to slow healing of wounds; the skin hardens and does not secrete sufficient mucus.
Lowered resistance to bacterial and viral infections occurs, therefore increased vulnerability to infection.
- Vitamin A deficiency may also lead to spontaneous fracture of bones

\section*{Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol)}
- Vitamin D is also referred to us the sunshine vitamin.

\section*{Characteristics}
- Vitamin D is very stable as it is not sensitive to heat or oxidation. It is fat soluble and it requires fat to transport and bile salts for absorption. Unlike other vitamins, vitamin D is synthesized by the action of sunlight on the skin. It is stored in the liver.

\section*{Functions}
- Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus from the intestines into the blood.
- Assists in increased calcium absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract.

\section*{Sources}
- There are only a few sources of food that contain vitamin D. These include oily fish, cod liver oils. Other foods are fortified with vitamin D such as margarine. Vitamin D is got when the skin is exposed to light.

\section*{Deficiency}
- A deficiency of vitamin D in infants and children can lead to rickets whereas in adults it leads to osteomalacia. Rickets is defective bone formation such as knock-knees and deformities in the ribs of children.

\section*{Vitamin E(tocopherol)}

\section*{Characteristics}

Vitamin E is not destroyed by heating, however, it is destroyed by rancidity.
It is fat soluble.

\section*{Functions}
- Vitamin E requires bile and fat for transportation and absorption.
- It acts as an anti-oxidant especially of unsaturated fatty acids and vitamin A.
- This is because it protects the double bond by being oxidized first.
- Vitamin E protects membranes of the nerves, muscles including blood against destruction.
Vitamin E contributes to a healthy immune system.

\section*{Deficiency}
- There is no clear indication of vitamin E deficiency in humans. However it has been observed in adults who have difficulty absorbing fats and in some premature infants who suffer from haemolytic anaemia.
- That is problems may be seen in those who have difficulty absorbing fat and in new born babies.
- Nerve degeneration weakness diffuculty walking ,leg cramps

\section*{Food Sources}

Good sources of vitamin E are vegetable oils (corn oil, sunflower oil cottonseed oil) and cereal oils, margarine, most nuts such as groundnuts, milk, liver, egg yolk, soy products, and dark leafy vegetables.

\section*{VITAMIN K(phylloquinone)}

\section*{Function}
- Vitamin K promotes coagulation of blood, that is, it is responsible for normal blood clotting.

\section*{Food Sources}
- Good dietary sources are green leafy vegetables such as spinach, sukuma wiki and cowpea leaves, fruits, cereals, carrots, egg yolk, liver and cabbage. It is synthesised in large amounts by bacteria in the intestinal tract then absorbed in the blood.
- Note in the treatment with antibiotics, the bacteria flora is destroyed thereby requiring vitamin K intake.
- There is no recommended dietary allowance for vitamin K.

\section*{Deficiency}
- Shortages are rare but individuals suffering from liver disease or who are unable to absorb fat are at risk.
- Hemorrage
- Poor skeletal mineralization

\section*{Water Soluble Vitamins (Vitamins C and B Complex)}

These vitamins are less stable than the fat soluble vitamins.
- Vitamins C, B1, folacin, B12 have no direct role in energy metabolism and all are involved directly or indirectly in blood formation.
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)

\section*{Characteristics}
- It is sweet to taste. It is water soluble. It is sensitive to heat and easily destroyed at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (boiling point of water).
- Therefore it is destroyed by boiling.

\section*{Functions}
- Vitamin C is important for growth and repair of body cells, helping the immune system to function, absorption of iron and long term health.
- It helps the body to absorb iron.
- Therefore the importance of consuming plant sources of iron such as beans together with vitamin C rich foods such as oranges, guavas and tomatoes.
- Vitamin C is important for the body's immune system to function as it helps the white blood cells to fight infection.
- Collage synthesis (strengthens blood vessel walls forms scar tissue)
- Matrix for bone growth
- Acts as an antioxidant
- Restores vitamin E to active form
- Hormone synthesis
- Support immune cell functions

\section*{Food sources}
- Vitamin C is found in many fresh fruits and vegetables in Kenya. These include citrus fruits, guavas, amaranthus, spinach, and tomatoes.
- However, the amounts present depend on the part and type of the plant, stage of maturity, exposure to air processing and method of preparation. Since the vitamin is sensitive to heat, boiling destroys it.
- This means the amount present in the food will depend on the amount of heat the food is subjected to.

\section*{Recommended Dietary Allowances}
- 60 micro grams per day. Vitamin C requires daily intake because it is not stored in the body.

\section*{Deficiency}
- Deficiency of vitamin C leads to one being more susceptible to infections, make wounds heal slowly, leads to bleeding gums, irritability and muscle wasting. A severe deficiency leads to scurvy.
- This is because failure to produce collagen leads to weak blood vessels, muscle tissue breakdown, inability to produce scar tissue and therefore soft bleeding gums.

\section*{Symptoms of scurvy are:}
- Listlessness, weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath and muscle crumbs.
- Aching bones and muscles, loss of appetite, dry feverish rough skin and bleeding and swollen gums. Slow wound healing, more susceptible to infections.
A major problem in drier parts of Kenya.
- People groups prone to deficiency include:
- The elderly, who may find it difficult to prepare and eat fruits and vegetables
- Those who eat junk food and miss eating fresh fruits and vegetables.
- Heavy drinkers and smokers.

\section*{Vitamin B complex}
- The B vitamins are a group of vitamins that each has their own roles in the body.
- They work together as a team and are generally found together in foods.
- They help break down foods to provide us with energy and the building blocks for growth.
- They help the brain; nerves and muscles function properly and aid the production of red blood cells. Vitamins are sensitive to heat and are soluble in water.
- They are therefore destroyed by cooking above $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and when vegetables are cut then washed, the vitamin get washed in the water.
- It is therefore recommended to cut vegetables before washing and not to cook vegetables at high temperatures.
Vitamin B1 (Thiamine, Aneurine, Anti-Beriberi)
Characteristics
- It is very unstable. It is sensitive to oxidation, light and ultraviolet light. It is very sensitive to temperature at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- There is no reserve of the vitamin. Excess is excreted in the urine therefore the need for daily intake.

\section*{Functions}
- Part of a co enzyme needed in energy metabolism
- Supports normal appetite
- Nervous system function

\section*{Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)}

\section*{Characteristics}
- Vitamin B2 is resistant to acid, heat and oxidation. Unstable to alkali and light therefore store food such as milk in dark bottles away from bright sunlight. It is not stored in the body therefore we need daily intake. It is water soluble.

\section*{Functions}
- It is important in cell respiration. It is essential in the formation of the red blood cells in the bone marrow.
- It is also used in the synthesis of glycogen and fatty acids breakdown.
- Supports normal vision and skin health
- Part of a co-enzyme needed for energy metabolism Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
0.6 micrograms per 1,000 Kcal about $0.8-1.8$ micrograms per day.

\section*{Sources}

Widely distributed in both animal and plant foods. Milk and milk products are major sources.

\section*{Deficiency}

Insufficient intake causes cracked lips, sore tongue and skin rashes. Riboflavin deficiency seldom occurs in isolation but rather it occurs together with other water soluble vitamin

\section*{Vitamin B3 (NIACIN)}
- It is vital for energy release in tissues and cells. Working with riboflavin and thiamine, it helps to maintain healthy nervous and digestive systems. It is relatively stable although when food is blanched, losses occur.

\section*{Function}

Part of a coenzyme needed in energy metabolism

\section*{Sources}
- Dietary sources include meat and wholemeal bread or whole grain cereals and whole meal cereal flour products.

\section*{Deficiency}
- Deficiency leads to the disease pellagra which causes diarrhoea, skin rashes and dementia. Deficiency is still wide spread in poor communities in Kenya who consume mainly maize.

\section*{FOLIC ACID /FOLATES}

\section*{Characteristics}
- Easily destroyed during prolonged storage and up to 50\% can be lost during cooking.

\section*{Functions}
- The biologically active form of folate is involved in DNA and RNA synthesis and therefore important for cell division. Folic acid is vital for healthy blood cells, the formation of new body cells and for healthy growth.

\section*{Food Sources}
- Found primarily in leafy green vegetables, oranges, fortified cereals, whole meal bread, brewer's yeast, spinach, fish, groundnuts and liver. Deficiency of iron and vitamin C impairs folate utilization.

\section*{Deficiency}

Shortages can cause a form of anaemia.

\section*{VITAMIN B12(cyanocobalamin)}

\section*{Characteristics}
- This vitamin is unusual in that it can be stored in the liver and tissue reserves last for as long as three to five years.

\section*{Function}
- Vitamin B12 is vital for growth, a healthy nervous system and for the formation of red blood cells. The metabolic functions of this vitamin are closely
associated with folic acid and a deficiency causes the same type of anaemia.
- Helps maintain nerve cells

\section*{Deficiency}
- Shortages can cause pernicious anaemia normally among people who are unable to absorb the vitamin.

\section*{Sources}

Meats, chicken, fish, liver, cheese, milk, fermented products and yeast extracts. Found in foods of animal origin only unless fortified foods.
Functions
Vitamin B1 is essential for carbohydrate metabolism. Supports appetite and nervous system functions.

\section*{Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)}
0.7-1.6 micro grams per day. Daily needs depend on how much carbohydrate we eat, and how active we are.

\section*{Sources}

Whole grain cereals, legumes, peas, chicken, eggs and milk.

\section*{Deficiency}

Loss of appetite accompanied by vomiting, nausea and constipation. Problem is common among alcoholics. This is because the deficiency affects the nervous system.

\section*{Vitamin B6(pyridoxine) \\ Chief function}
- Part of a conenzyme needed in amino acid and fatty acid metabloism
- Helps convert tryptophan to niacin and to serotonin
- Helps make red blood cells

\section*{Deficiency symptoms}
- Anaemia
- Depression,confusion,abnormal brain wave pattern,convulsions
- Rashes,greasy ,scaly dermatitis

\section*{Sources}

Meat,fish ,poultry,liver ,potatoes ,soy products ,legumes ,fruits

\section*{PANTOTHENIC acid}

Part of a coenzyme needed for energy metabolism Its widespread in foods

\section*{Deficiency symptoms}

Vomiting ,intestinal distress insomnia fatigue hypoglycemia,increased sensistivity to insulin

\section*{WATER}
- Water is an essential component of all body tissues.

\section*{Functions}
- Water is essential to the processes of digestion and absorption of food and elimination of food wastes.
- Water maintains the physical and chemical consistency of the intracellular and extra-cellular fluids.
- It maintains body temperature.
- It gives the lungs the moisture needed to breathe.
- Water also provides the form and functioning of our body's 100 trillion cells.
- If cells do not have enough water, they become dry and more vulnerable to attack by viruses.
- Water holds our body's nutrients in solution, transports and eliminates them from the body.
- Water plays a key role in the structure and function of the circulatory system. It acts as a transport medium for all nutrients and all body substances.
- Loss of $20 \%$ of body water may cause death and loss of 10\% of body water results into a severe disorders.

\section*{COMMUNITY NUTRITION}

An approach that provides a long-term solutions, promotes stability and supplies communities with methods to reduce malnutrition-often referred to food security.
A successful fight against global and local hunger must involve a community-centred approach to malnutrition. CAUSES OF MALNUTRITION

National Policies
Formal and Informal Structure
Basic Causes
Context and Potential Resources

\section*{They are divided into direct and underlying causes}

\section*{Direct /Immediate causes of malnutrition:}
- Deficient intake of a particular nutrient e.g. deficiency of protein leads to kwashiorkor, deficiency of iron leads to anaenmia, deficiency of vit. A leads to xerophthalmia, deficiency of iodine leads to goitre etc

\section*{Underlying causes:}
- Infection and disease - Poor nutrition lowers the resistance of the whole body to infections.
Under-nourished children are more prone to infection, recover from illness more slowly and frequently die from infection.
- Malnutrition tends to be underreported in disease and mortality statistics because a sick child with malnutrition is likely to develop complications such as gastroenteritis which leads to death; the deaths are then reported as being due to these diseases rather than malnutrition.
- Under nutrition and malnutrition are themselves serious problems, even when they are mild or moderate, as they influence the onset and outcome of infection.
- A malnourished child is more likely to get infections more often and more seriously than a well nourished child.
- Infection causes fever, loss of appetite, diarrhoea and vomiting, all of which interfere with the intake and absorption of food, and malnutrition follows.
- Fever and the repair of damaged cells also increase the need for food.
- Therefore, with less intake and greater need, the infected child with poor reserves tipped into a state of malnutrition.
- Off all infectious diseases, diarrhoea is the most important cause of malnutrition.
- Diarrhoea is common during the weaning periodweaning diarrhoea.

The nutrition-infection cycle

\section*{Ignorance about nutrition:}

Lack of knowledge about nutrition: Some parents sell nutritious food like eggs and chicken for money so as to buy things like sugar to prepare porridge for children. Parents' lack of understand about the need for frequenct meals in the course of the day. To meet their
nutritional requirements, children must feed four or more times a day.

\section*{Seasonal changes and lack of food production}

It happens in arid areas
Where wars and civil strife disrupt food production
During particular seasons
The worst seasonal food shortages usually occur a few weeks before the next crop is ready.
Under nutrition and malnutrition become common and children may suffer from malaria as well.

\section*{Unequal distribution of food}

Food may be unequally distributed within the family, within the region and within the country.
Within the family, the distribution of food usually favours the head of the family (the man when present), and the nutritional risk groups (children and women) are at a disadvantage.
Unequal food distribution in a country result from low production of certain foods in some areas, poor infrastructure, lack of storage and preservation facilities and poverty.
These factors lead to a high incidence of malnutrition in some parts of the country.

\section*{Factors promoting good nutrition}

\section*{Good agriculture:}
$\checkmark$ Clearing land at the right time
$\checkmark$ Planting sufficient food crops
$\checkmark$ Use irrigation and fertiliser, if necessary, and advice from agricultural instructor
$\checkmark$ Harvesting at the right time, and safe storage of the food to avoid loss through pests or through having to sell at a bad time
$\checkmark$ A good transport and distribution system to ensure delivery of enough food to all regions

\section*{Good economy}
$\checkmark$ Sufficient money and resources, wisely allocated, for priorities like agricultural improvement, food and fuel, education and health
$\checkmark$ Enough cultivatable land to grow sufficient food crops for income.
$\checkmark$ Communal production and fair distribution, marketing and pricing (e.g. through co-operative societies)

\section*{Healthy environment}
$\checkmark$ Sufficient safe water located reasonably close to houses
$\checkmark$ Adequate fuel for cooking
$\checkmark$ Use of latrines and a good general standard of sanitation
$\checkmark$ Vector and disease control important for nutrition and general health

\section*{Good education}
$\checkmark$ Teaching about good nutrition and child health in schools, families and communities
$\checkmark$ Showing ways of improving present attitudes and practices.
$\checkmark$ Special emphasis should be placed on good nutrition for the most vulnerable groups including poor mothers and children.

\section*{Healthy size.}
$\checkmark$ All the children in the family are likely to receive enough good food and attention if the family is small.
$\checkmark$ The younger children usually need more care. Encourage family planning
$\checkmark$ If either or both parent are from the home, it is important to ensure that the children are looked after properly and that they have enough food.
$\checkmark$ Problems with alcohol and drugs are common in disrupted families.
$\checkmark$ Appropriate distribution of money, work and food within the community and the family. Support for mothers is important in keeping children healthy
$\checkmark$ Priorities within the family include seeing that children get their share of high quality energy and protein food. Children need smaller portions of food given several times during the day.
$\checkmark$ Care for the children from broken or one-parent families. Social integration and communal care for these and for underprivileged families, is an children and good maternal care are important factors.

\section*{Prevention and control of disease}

Most children illnesses are preventable by immunization.
Comprehensive vaccination of children and good maternal care are important factors in good nutrition.

Early detection and effective treatment of acute diseases such as diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory tract infections.

\section*{Poverty and disease go together}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_abdbc900e59c90c73506g-58.jpg?height=489&width=1191&top_left_y=846&top_left_x=404)

\section*{Customs and beliefs affecting nutrition}

Most people have fixed customs and beliefs about different foods and cooking practices.
In some places insects like termites and grasshoppers are eaten. Such insects are rich in proteins and other nutrients. Such practices should be encouraged by the health workers
Some traditional food habits should not be promoted such as where women and children are not allowed to eat chicken and eggs, preventing children with measles from eating meat or taking salt. These traditions should
be carefully discouraged in order to prevent resistance and confrontation.

To achieve the goal of good nutrition, poor productivity has to be converted into high productivity; diseases have to be prevented or treated efficiently; and poor education must be replaced by awareness and knowledge.
Improvement of nutritional status by these means will in turn improve people's health, productivity and ability to develop further.
Solving the malnutrition problem must also take into account socio-economic, political and cultural factors that are not illustrated in the diagram.

\section*{CHILDFEEDING AND NUTRITION}

\section*{Breast feeding}

Human breast milk is by far the best food for babies and all mothers must be encouraged to breast feed their babies exclusively for six months and to continue breast feeding for as long as possible after that.
Breast milk is:
Always fresh,
safe from diarrhoea and other infections since it contains the mother's antibodies; and it is also easily available, clean and ready for the child at all times.
It is easy to digest, has the right temperature, protects and brings the mother and baby close together. Breast feeding is cheap and is always ready.

Sucking at the breast helps the postpartum uterus to contract and breast feeding gives the mother the opportunity to care for and love her baby.
The mother's breast milk is usually sufficient for a baby for the six months of life.
By the sixth month, supplementary foods (weaning) should be introduced gradually.

Advantages of breastfeeding using the breastfeeding acronym

B-Best for baby
R-Reduced allergies e.g. Asthma, aczema
E-Economical - no waste or cost
A-Antibodies thus higher immunity
S-Satisfies infants nutritional needs
T-Temperature constant, correct
F-Fresh milk-never spoiled
E-Emotional bonding
E-Easy once established
D-Digested easily 3-4 hours
I-Inhibit ovulation, reduces interval between births
N -No mixing required
G-Gastroenteritis greatly reduced

\section*{BREAST FEEDING AND HIV/AIDS}

A child born to a HIV positive mother may be HIV negative
A child may acquire the virus from the mother through breast milk
The most likely way that this may happen is when a child's gut lining is bruised.
Bruising of the child's gut happens when it is given solid foods at an early age since the foods erode some of the protective membranes along the GI Tract.
HIV positive mother should be counseled during ANC visit to choose between either feeding the baby on breast milk exclusively for four months then stop the breast milk and substitute it with animal milk and solid foods, or to feed the baby on formula feeds or milk from animals sources without any one time giving the baby her breast milk
HIV positive mother should never mix-feed the baby i.e. give breast milk and solid foods at the same time.

\section*{Weaning or complemantary feeding}

Def:-
Weaning is the time during which a child's diet changes from breast milk (or formula) alone to family food.
Weaning has three stages:
Stage 1: 6months The baby gets almost all nutrients from breast milk but starts other. These first foods must be easy to eat and digest and are called weaning foods.
Stage 2:6-9 months The child continues to get the same amount of breast milk but eats increasing
amounts of other foods. The type of food gradually changes from weaning foods to regular family foods.
Stage 3:9-12months The child takes less breast milk and eats more and more of the family foods. Breast milk is mainly a snack and for comfort.

Under-nutrition in Sub- Sahara Africa occurs most frequently in children of weaning age (6months to three years)
To prevent under-nutrition the most important measure to be taken is to improve weaning foods.

\section*{WEANING FOODS}

Three factors must be borne in mind when preparing good weaning foods for young children.
1. To provide enough energy within the small amounts that a young child can eat at one time. Ensuring an adequate intake of energy foods by:
Feeding young children frequently (4 or 5 times).
Mixing foods with a high energy concentration into the basic staple foods. E.g. one teaspoon ( 5 g ) of oil gives 45 Cal; 2 teaspoons ( 10 g ) of sugar give 40 Cal .
NB: Feed young children at least 4 times every day.
2. To add protein to the staple food i.e. porridge given to the child
Most cereals have a protein concentration of about 7\% or $8 \%$, but this protein is of low biological value. To improve the quality of the protein, small amounts of other animal or plant foods containing protein must be added. Suitable protein foods are cowpeas, beans,
groundnuts, fish powder, dried milk powder, flaked fish, minced meat or eggs.
NB: Continue breast feeding during weaning.

To provide food in a form which is easily swallowed and digested
This is done by mashing the food or grinding it into fine particles and adding liquid until it is soft.
It is important to cook it well.
Teach mothers how to enrich weaning foods.
NB: Use weaning mixtures

\section*{NUTRITION IN SPECIAL GROUPS}

\section*{NUTRITION DURING PREGNANCY AND LACTATION}

During pregnancy and lactation, a woman's nutritional needs are greater than at any other time in her life.
All the food the foetus needs to grow and the food needed for production of milk must come from the mother.
A child borne to a poorly nourished mother is likely to have a low birth weight (below 2.5 kg ).
Such babies are more likely to die in the first few months of life.
During pregnancy there is increase in weight of the woman and the BMR also increases.
These increases require extra food to provide extra energy, proteins and other nutrients.

Anaemia is a common problem in Africa, especially among pregnant women.
A child borne to an anaemic mother may have a very low reserve of body iron and is likely to develop anaemia in the few weeks of life.
It is advisable to give iron supplements routinely to pregnant women in areas where iron-deficiency anaemia is common.
This is given in the form of ferrous sulphate tablets to be taken three times a day
Folate, one of the vit. B complex, is also required for making red blood cells and should be given, together with iron, to pregnant women.
Vit. A deficiency is also bad for the baby, so multivitamin tablets should be given during pregnancy in areas where xerophthalmia is prevalent. Encourage pregnant women to eat foods rich in vit. A.
Lactating mother/mothers who have just delivered need to eat more than usual and include foods that are rich in iron and vit. A.
Women must feed well during their reproductive years. They should be in a good nutritional health before and during pregnancy and lactation.
$\checkmark$ A woman who becomes pregnant while poorly nourished has a greater risk of complications during pregnancy and is likely to give birth to a low birth weight baby.

\section*{NUTRITION AND HIV/AIDS}
$\checkmark$ Malnutrition is one of the complications of HIV/AIDS.

HIV/AIDS is associated with conditions that result in reduced food intake.
Decreased food intake may result from: an inability to swallow due to sores in the mouth and throat, loss of appetite as result of fatigue or depression, side effects from the medication or reduced quantity and quality of food in the household as a result of inability to work or reduced income due to illness.
HIV interferes with the body's ability to absorb nutrients.
Poor absorption may be caused by infection of the intestinal cells or increased incidence of opportunistic infections such as diarrhoea.
To deal with this problem effectively there should be:
Good nutrition,
Hygiene,
Food safety.
Good nutrition strengthens the immune system to fight Opportunistic infections and delays progression of the disease.
Good nutrition contributes to weight gain and stops wastage

\section*{NUTRITION FOR THE ELDERLY}

The number of elderly persons in Africa is increasing owing to improved health care and quality of life.
Care of the elderly has changed with many of them being left on their own while their children emigrate in search of jobs.

The elderly have an increased nutrition challenges due to:
Various growth and developmental challenges
Illnesses
Poor appetite
Lack of teeth making it difficulty to eat any type of food Lack of support and carers who would provide food and cook for them.

These are a few of the challenges that HWs should be concerned about.
The elderly should not be left to become malnourished or die from malnutrition due to neglect.

Abnormal nutrition and clinical malnutrition
$\checkmark$ Main types of abnormal (mal) nutrition include:
Undernutrition,
Micronutrient deficiencies
Overnutrition

Underweight is the first stage of protein energy deficiency (a mild or moderate form of protein energy malnutrition-PEM).
PEM affects up to $30 \%$ of children between 1 and 5 years old.
PEM is about 10 times more than all other forms of malnutrition except anaemia.

\section*{Protein energy malnutrition (PEM)}

\section*{Types of PEM:}
$\checkmark$ There are three syndromes of protein energy deficiency with a similar underlying causes.
These are:

\section*{Marasmus}

\section*{Kwashiorkor}

\section*{Marasmic kwashiorkor}

The syndromes are also referred to as:
Protein Calorie Malnutrition (PCM),
Protein Joule Malnutrition (PJM), and
Protein Energy Deficiency (PED)
$\checkmark$ They are rarely seen in more than 5\% of children less than 5 years old.
$\checkmark$ They are the clinical manifestation of the undernutrition problem in the community.
$\checkmark$ The difference between underweight and Marasmus, Kwashiorkor and Marasmic kwashiorkor is seen in the degree of severity of the PEM and the presence or absence of peripheral oedema.

It is only detected as a growth failure when weight for age or upper arm circumference is measured.
Early diagnosis and treatment of underweight prevents progression to clinical malnutrition.

\section*{Effects of underweight:}
$\checkmark$ Slow growth
$\checkmark$ Risk of infections as they have weak body defences and do not develop antibodies easily
$\checkmark$ Death if exposed to serious infections such as measles, gastroenteritis, whooping cough or tuberculosis.
$\checkmark$ Underweight children develop clinical form of protein energy malnutrition very rapidly during episodes of infectious diseases.

NB: Low weight = High risk
Diagnosis:
Early underweight cannot be recognised in the early stages by clinical examination.
It is only diagnosed by regular weight measurements
Underweight is uncommon in breast fed babies under nine months
To detect the "at risk" underweight child between the ages of one and five years is one of the main functions of children's clinics. To do this:
Follow the growth curve on a weight chart at regular interval
Where the birth date is not known, use a local calendar of event to estimate the age of the child.

High risk underweight children are those whose weights are between $60 \%$ and $80 \%$ of normal; those whose weights are not rising but are steady; or those whose weights are falling.
When the age is unknown, measure the mid upper arm circumference to assess children under one year old.

\section*{Management:}
$\checkmark$ Increase calories in the diet by augmenting the amount of energy foods. If this is not done, the limited amount of protein in the body will be used to provide the body with energy and therefore be wasted. The best way to increase the calorie intake of a young child is to increase the frequency of meals. Children under 2 years should eat at least 3 and preferably 4 to 5 times a day.
$\checkmark$ Protect the child from infection by immunization, prophylaxis against malaria, treatment of intestinal parasites and advice to the mother on hygienic food preparation.
$\checkmark$ Weigh the child regularly and encourage the mother by showing her the child's growth curve moving upwards along the normal weight for age path on the growth chart.
$\checkmark$ Recommend a mixed diet. Find out which additional foods the mother can easily obtain, and encourage her to mix any of these with the main staple.
$\checkmark$ Do not tell the mother to use proteins that she cannot afford.
$\checkmark$ The important thing is to increase the amount of staple or energy foods by adding a small amount of oil or margarine and some powdered groundnuts (or groundnut butter) or soya bean flour, cowpeas, red beans or any local legume.
$\checkmark$ Children's meals should also include some dark green leafy vegetables and some fruit every day.

NB: Give energy foods for underweight

\section*{Prevention}

\section*{Treatment of underweight children prevents:}
$\checkmark$ The development of clinical malnutrition (marasmus and kwashiorkor)
$\checkmark$ High mortality from infectious diseases, especially measles, tuberculosis
$\checkmark$ This means a reduction in morbidity, mortality and hospital admissions.
