\section*{DIGESTION, ABSORPTION AND UTILIZATION OF NUTRIENTS.}

\section*{CARBOHYDRATES}

Digestion: The first stage of digestion of carbohydrate takes place in the mouth. Chewing breaks up food and exposes starch and sugars to the action of enzymes. Saliva contains salivary amylase (ptyalin).
- It converts starch to maltose but time limits the action of salivary amylase, because as food enters the stomach, the acid present in the stomach blocks the action of salivary amylase. In the stomach the acid causes hydrolysis of sucrose.
- In the small intestine pancreatic amylase and intestinal amylase digest starch up to the stage of maltose. Glycogen is also broken by these enzymes to disaccharides. Enzymes maltase, sucrose and lactase present in the brush borders of the columnar cells of small intestine convert disaccharides to monosaccharaides.
- Cellulose and other polysaccharides are not digested by enzymes, so undigested material passes to large intestine forming bulk which contributes to faeces. The end products of carbohydrate digestion are monosaccharide - glucose, galactose and fructose. They are absorbed by process of active absorption by the mucosa of the small intestine.

Metabolism: It occurs inside the various cells of the body.
- There are two types of metabolism; anabolism (building up) and catabolism (breaking down). The major carbohydrate anabolic path ways are conversion of glucose into glycogen (glycogenesis) in the liver and muscles. The conversion of glucose into fat (lipogenesis) in the liver and adipose tissue.
- Carbohydrates follow two major catabolic pathways: The breakdown of glucose releasing energy (glycolysis) and converting it into usable energy (ATP) and the conversion of glycogen to glucose (glycogenolysis).
- After digestion and absorption of glucose into the blood stream it is utilized directly by the tissues for energy.
- When the absorbed glucose exceeds the body's need for energy it is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle and excess glucose is converted to triglycerides and stored as fat in adipose tissue.

\section*{PROTEIN}

Proteins taken in the diet are digested to amino acids in the stomach and small intestine. Gastric juice contains enzymes pepsin which digests protein in acid medium. It hydrolyses proteins to polypeptides. In the small intestine, pancreatic and intestinal juices contain proteolytic enzymes.
- Pancreatic juice contains trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxyl peptidase. They hydrolyse large protein molecule to smaller polypeptide. Intestinal juices contain polypeptidases \& dipeptidases which hydrolyse polypeptide \& dipeptide to individual amino acids. There are several peptidases acting on different proteins. When undigested proteins enter large intestines, bacteria causes nitrification of proteins leading to foul smelling flatus.

\section*{Absorption}
- Proteins are mainly absorbed in the form of amino acids. Amino acids are absorbed by active transport mechanism in the intestinal cells.
- Sometimes whole protein may be absorbed by the mechanism of pinocytosis. Absorbed amino acids pass into the portal blood and reach liver where they are converted to proteins.
- Other amino acids are transported through general circulation and are utilized for protein synthesis in the tissues.

\section*{Utilization of proteins in the body.}
- The amino acids from digested proteins are absorbed rapidly into the blood and passed onto different tissues to meet their needs. Some non-essential amino acids are synthesized in the liver and also released into the circulation.
- The amino acids released by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are also added to the amino acid pool in the body. The protein metabolism of mammals is in a dynamic state and the synthesis and breakdown of tissue protein takes place constantly. The unwanted amino acids are oxidized in the liver to yield energy and urea.

\section*{FAT}

Digestion In the mouth: Fat digestion starts in the mouth with hard fats beginning to melt when they reach body temperature. The salivary glands at the base of the tongue release a lipase enzyme which digests fat to a less extent in adults.

In the stomach: In the stomach fat floats as a layer above the others components of swallowed food. As a result little fat digestion takes place.

In the small Intestine: When fat enters the small intestine, the hormone cholecystokinin signals the gall bladder to release bile. Bile emulsifies fat and also provides an alkaline medium for the action of pancreatic juices.

\section*{Absorption and Utilization lipase and intestinal lipase.}
- The triglycerides are acted upon by these lipases and hydrolyzed to monolycerides and fatty acids. The cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed to give cholesterol and fatty acids.
- Small molecules of digested triglycerides (glycerol, short \& medium chain fatty acids) can diffuse into intestinal cells and are absorbed directly into the blood stream. Larger molecules (Monolycerides, long chain fatty acids) merge into spherical complexes known as micelles.
- The lipid contents of the micelles diffuse into the intestinal cells. Once inside the monolycerides and long chain fatty acids are reassembled to new triglycerides. Within the intestinal cells the new triglycerides and larger lipids like cholesterol and phospholipids are placed into transport vehicle called chylomicrons.
- The intestinal cells then release chylomicrons into the lymphatic system. The lymph circulation empties into the thoracic duct which in turn enter the subclavian vein and subsequently into the blood stream.
- The blood transport lipids to the rest of the body and cells absorb them and utilize for energy. This breakdown of fat to yield energy is called lipolysis.
- Majority of lipids enter via the lymph to the liver where the protein and lipid (cholesterol, triglycerides) are bound together to form lipoproteins.
- There are four types of lipoproteins, they are: i) chylomicrons,
ii) very low density lipo protein (VLDL)
iii) low density lipo protein (LDL)
iv) high density lipo proteins (HDL).

Chylomicrons, VLDL and LDL serve to transport and deposit lipids from the intestine and liver to the tissues for absorption. Low-density lipoprotein, which has the highest cholesterol fraction, favors lipid deposition in tissues including blood vessels and hence termed 'bad' cholesterol. HDL cholesterol removes the lipids from the tissues and transports it back to liver for disposal; hence it is termed as 'good cholesterol'.

High levels of LDL cholesterol indicate a high risk of cardiovascular disease. Apart from lipoproteins, triglycerides, cholesterol and phospholipids are synthesized in the liver. This is called lipogenesis.

\section*{FOOD COMMODITIES.}

\section*{MEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS}

\section*{BEEF}

Beef is the meat obtained from domesticated cattle. Compared to other types of meat, it has longer connective tissues which make it to be tougher taking longer cooking time and also digestion period.

\section*{Beef can be made more tender (soft) by:}
1. Hanging the meat after slaughtering as in butcheries for up to 14 days under the right conditions.
2. Marinating by use of vinegar or lemon juice.
3. Use of tenderizing salts or chemicals.
4. Beating up meat pieces by use of meat hammer (steak hammer) before grilling or frying.
5. Use of enzymes that break down the protein e.g. papain from the leaves of pawpaw tree is injected to the blood stream of the animal just before slaughtering to ensure that it is evenly distributed.

\section*{Quality purchasing points for fresh beef:}
1. Fat- should be firm, brittle in texture and creamy white. Older animals have fat which is softer and yellowish in colour. Should be moderate and not too much.
2. Marbling- in lean meat is formed by small droplets of fat which should be evenly distributed, especially in sirloin steak wing and also fore ribs.
3. Colour- the colour of the meat should be bright red. The cut surface may become dull and sticky after it is exposed to air for some time.
4. Touch- lean beef should be firm and elastic to the touch and not flabby.
5. Fluid- any moisture on the cut surface should be watery, not thick and sticky to the touch. The beef should not be over moist or too dry.
6. Grains- the grains should be fine. Long coarse fibers are a sign of cheaper quality cut of beef. Storage Large sections of meat such as sides, four quarters, hind quarters, whole sirloins and rumps should be suspended on meat hooks from racks fixed to the ceiling of the cold room.

Cuts of beef should be stored on trays at $2^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ and covered to prevent drying out of the cut surfaces. The trays need to be changed daily to prevent the meat from lying on the collected blood. Chilled beef should be stored at $-2^{\circ} \mathrm{c}\left(28^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ and frozen beef at $-18^{\circ} \mathrm{c}\left(0^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$

\section*{VEAL}

Refers to the meat obtained from young calf especially below the age of 2 years and may weigh upto 100 kgs .

\section*{Good quality veal should be:}
* Pale pink and firm
* Not soft or flabby
* Cut surfaces should not be dry, but moist
* Bones in young animals should be pinkish white, porous and with a small amount of blood in their structure.
* The fat should be firm and pinkish white
* The kidney too should be firm and well covered with fat

\section*{MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS}

Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food.

Early-lactation milk contains colostrums, which carries the mother's antibodies to the baby and can reduce the risk of many diseases in the baby. It also contains many other nutrients. As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from mammals during or soon after pregnancy and used as food for humans though it has to be treated before consumption to make it safe.

The females of all mammal species can by definition produce milk, but cow milk dominates commercial production.

Fresh milk should be taken care of to ensure that it is not contaminated and therefore it should:
- kept in the container in which it is delivered.
- Stored in the refrigerator for maximum of 5 days
- Be kept covered as it easily absorbs smells from other foods such as onions and fish
- Order fresh milk daily
- Tinned milk should be stored in cool and dry, well ventilated rooms
- Dried milk is packaged in air tight tins and kept in a dry store
- Sterilised milk will keep for 2-3 months if un-opened, but once opened, must be treated just as fresh milk Composition of milk Lipids/ fats/Water
-Protein- Normal bovine milk contains 30-35 grams of protein per liter
- Salts, minerals, and vitamins Minerals or milk salts are traditional names for a variety of cations and anions within bovine milk. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and chlorine are all included as minerals and they typically occur at concentration of 540 mM .

The milk salts strongly interact with casein, most notably calcium phosphate. It is present in excess and often, much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate. In addition to calcium, milk is a good source of many other vitamins.

Vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, K, E, thiamine, niacin, biotin, riboflavin, folates, and pantothenic acid are all present in milk. Carbohydrates

Milk contains several different carbohydrate including lactose, glucose, galactose, and other oligosaccharides. The lactose gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately $40 \%$ of whole cow's milk's calories. Lactose is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. Types of milk based on fat content

Standardized milk- This is made by combining buffalo milk and skimmed milk. The fat percentage is maintained at $4.5 \%$ while the SNF is $8.5 \%$.

Whole milk: Whole milk must contain at least $3.25 \%$ milk fat and $8.25 \%$ milk solids by weight -which means it derives about $50 \%$ of its calories from fat. Because of this relatively high fat content, whole milk is best used only for infants and young children up to age 2.

Reduced-fat milk ( $\mathbf{2 \%}$ ): This milk contains $\mathbf{2 \%}$ milk fat. The percentage of milk fat refers to the percentage of fat by weight, and much of milk's weight is water. Once you subtract the water from $2 \%$ milk, for example, you're left with a product that contains $20 \%$ fat by weight; such milk actually derives $35 \%$ of its calories from fat. Drinking $2 \%$ milk is a good way to wean oneself from whole milk at first, but is too high in fat as a permanent choice, unless your diet is otherwise very low in fat.

Low-fat milk ( $\mathbf{1 \%}$ ): One-percent milk gets $\mathbf{2 3 \%}$ of its calories from fat. Many people find lowfat milk more appealing and a good compromise.

Skimmed milk/non-fat milk: This type of milk has as much fat removed as possible. It may not contain more than $0.5 \%$ milk fat by weight, and usually contains less than 0.5 gm of fat per cup, deriving just $5 \%$ of its calories from fat. Skimmed milk has about half the calories of whole milk. It is the best choice for adults, and is the only type of milk that should be consumed by people on
strict low-fat diets. Unfortunately, skim milk has a very "thin" flavor and an unappealing bluish cast.

UHT milk - this is homogenised which is heated to a temperature of $132{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ for 1 second, the milk is then cooled and packed under sterile conditions.

Evaporated milk- this is milk which has been heated at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ until most of the water evaporates as vapour to get an end product which is 2 times heavier than the original milk.

Condensed milk- it is evaporated milk but with the addition of sugar.
Dried milk- this is milk produced by the evaporation of water from the milk by heat to produce solid that contain $5 \%$ or less moisture. Methods used include spray method and the roller method.

\section*{POULTRY:}
- Poultry is a category of domesticated birds kept by humans for the purpose of collecting their eggs, or raising for their meat and/or feathers.
- Poultry also includes other birds which are killed for their meat, such as pigeons or doves or birds considered to be game, like pheasants. Poultry comes from the French/Norman word, poule, itself derived from the Latin word Pullus, which means small animal.
- Examples of poultry are chicken, guinea fowl, duck, ostrich, pigeons, doves, pheasants, turkey Poultry is the second most widely eaten meat in the world, accounting for about $30 \%$ of meat production worldwide, after pork at $38 \%$.

The meatiest parts of a bird are the flight muscles on its chest, called breast meat, and the walking muscles on the first and second segments of its legs, called the thigh and drumstick, respectively.

The wings are also eaten, usually (in the United States) without separating them, as in Buffalo wings; the first and second segment of the wings are referred to as drumette (meatier) and flat when these need to be distinguished, though these are technical terms.

Nutritive value of poultry - Chicken is a easily digested source of protein to the human body as it has no strong connective tissues as in meat. - It provides some B vitamins, calcium and a little iron to the body. Signs of quality -plumb breast -pliable breast bone -firm flesh -white skin, unbroken and with a faint bluish tint -long hairs on the skin

\section*{STORAGE OF POULTRY}

Chilled birds should be stored between $3^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ and $5^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$. oven ready birds are eviscerated and should be stored in a refrigerator. Frozen birds should be kept in a deep freezer until required but must be thoroughly thawed, preferably in a refrigerator before being cooked. Frozen poultry should be
checked that: - The packaging is undamaged - There are no signs of freezer burns which are indicated by white patches on the skin.

\section*{EGGS}

The term egg applies to not only those of a hen but also to the edible eggs of other domesticated birds e.g. turkey, goose, guinea fowl, e.t.c. Most caterers make use of hen's egg for much of the purposes compared to others.

Eggs are an extremely versatile food commodity, suitable for inclusion in a wide range of products and dishes.

Shell quality characteristics that must be considered are as follows:
* cleanliness
* soundness (unbroken)
* smoothness

In quality eggs the yolk should be: round, firm and stand up well, and be yellow in color.

\section*{Factors that may cause loss of quality are as follows:}

The natural factors: temperature humidity, time, handling, storage, tainting Value of eggs.
* They are good sources of high biological value protein,
* Provide little quantities of iron to the body.
* They are also poor sources of calcium since its only concentrated in the shell which is not eaten.

\section*{Quality points for fresh eggs:}
* Shell-should be clean, undamaged and slightly rough.
* White-when broken, the egg should have a large proportion of thick white to thin white.
* Yolk-should be firm, round/dome shaped and good yellow colour.
* Smell- pleasant, bad eggs smell of hydrogen sulphide.

\section*{STORAGE OF EGGS}
* For the successful storage of eggs, the following conditions must be met.:
* Packaging material used should be new, clean and odourless.
* Loss of water due to evaporation should be reduced to a minimum.
* The storage room must be free from tainting products and materials and should be cleaned regularly with odourless detergent sanitizers.
* The storage room must be kept at a constant temperature and humidity must be checked.
* There should be air circulation in the storage room.
* Eggs should be stored so that they are allowed to breathe.

As far as possible, interior quality should be monitored; there should be a good proportion of thick white, the yolk should stand up well, and the flavour of white and yolk should be good. If all of the above requirements are to be met, refrigerated storage is necessary.

Cold storage of eggs In the tropics, eggs can deteriorate very quickly unless they are stored at low temperatures. The ideal temperatures for storage in such climates are $13^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or lower (usually between $10^{\circ}$ and $13^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).

Here refrigeration is a necessity for successful commercial storage; however, it may be unavailable or the costs too high.

\section*{The most important factors in successful cold storage are as follows.}
- The selection and packaging of eggs.
- The equipment and preparation of the cold store.
- Proper temperature, humidity and air circulation.
- Periodic testing for quality.
- The gradual adjustment of eggs to higher temperatures when removed from storage.
