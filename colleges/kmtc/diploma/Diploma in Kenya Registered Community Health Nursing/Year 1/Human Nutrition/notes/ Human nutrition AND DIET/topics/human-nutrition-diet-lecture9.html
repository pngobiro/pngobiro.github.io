                            <p><strong>In the mouth:</strong> Fat digestion starts in the mouth with hard fats beginning to melt when they reach body temperature. The salivary glands at the base of the tongue release a lipase enzyme which digests fat to a less extent in adults.</p>
                            <p><strong>In the stomach:</strong> In the stomach fat floats as a layer above the others components of swallowed food. As a result little fat digestion takes place.</p>
                            <p><strong>In the small Intestine:</strong> When fat enters the small intestine, the hormone cholecystokinin signals the gall bladder to release bile. Bile emulsifies fat and also provides an alkaline medium for the action of pancreatic juices.</p>

                            <p>Milk is a white liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food.</p>
                            <p>Early-lactation milk contains colostrums, which carries the mother's antibodies to the baby and can reduce the risk of many diseases in the baby. It also contains many other nutrients. As an agricultural product, milk is extracted from mammals during or soon after pregnancy and used as food for humans though it has to be treated before consumption to make it safe.</p>
                            <p>The females of all mammal species can by definition produce milk, but cow milk dominates commercial production.</p>

                            <p><strong>Lipids/ fats/Water</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Protein</strong> - Normal bovine milk contains 30-35 grams of protein per liter</p>
                            <p><strong>Salts, minerals, and vitamins</strong> - Minerals or milk salts are traditional names for a variety of cations and anions within bovine milk. Calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, citrate, and chlorine are all included as minerals and they typically occur at concentration of 540 mM .</p>
                            <p>The milk salts strongly interact with casein, most notably calcium phosphate. It is present in excess and often, much greater excess of solubility of solid calcium phosphate. In addition to calcium, milk is a good source of many other vitamins.</p>
                            <p>Vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, K, E, thiamine, niacin, biotin, riboflavin, folates, and pantothenic acid are all present in milk.</p>
                            <p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong></p>
                            <p>Milk contains several different carbohydrate including lactose, glucose, galactose, and other oligosaccharides. The lactose gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately 40% of whole cow's milk's calories. Lactose is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars, glucose and galactose.</p>

Drinking 2% milk is a good way to wean oneself from whole milk at first, but is too high in fat as a permanent choice, unless your diet is otherwise very low in fat.</span></li>

                            <p>In the tropics, eggs can deteriorate very quickly unless they are stored at low temperatures. The ideal temperatures for storage in such climates are 13¬∞C or lower (usually between 10¬∞ and 13¬∞C).</p>
                            <p>Here refrigeration is a necessity for successful commercial storage; however, it may be unavailable or the costs too high.</p>
                            <p><strong>The most important factors in successful cold storage are as follows.</strong></p>
