                        <p>The science of Nutrition is the study of the nutrients in foods and the body's handling of those nutrients</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nutrition Research</h3>
                        <p>Research always begins with a question. For example, "what foods or nutrients might protect against a common cold?" In search of an answer, scientists make educated guesses (hypotheses) and then systematically conduct research studies to test each hypothesis. An example of some types of research studies in nutrition are:-</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Epidemiological Studies</strong><br>Observe how much and what kinds of foods a group of people eat and how healthy those people are. Such findings bring to light factors that might influence the incidence of a disease in various populations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Case-Control Studies</strong><br>Compare people who do and do not have a given condition such as a disease, closely matching them in age, occupations, and other key variables so that differences in other factors will stand out. Differences then appear that may account for the condition in the group that has it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Animal Studies</strong><br>Might feed specific nutrients or diets to animals and then observe any changes in health. Such studies test possible disease causes and treatments in a laboratory where all conditions can be controlled.</li>
                            <li><strong>Human Intervention (or Clinical) Trials</strong><br>Ask people to adopt a new behavior (for example eat a citrus fruit, take a vitamin C supplement, or exercise daily). These trials help determine the effects such as measures have on the development or prevention of disease. Each type of study has advantages and disadvantages. Findings must be interpreted with an awareness of the study's limitations.</li>
                        </ol>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Describe types of research studies.</li>
                            <li>Construct research questions for different studies</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>In attempting to discover whether a nutrient relieves symptoms or cures a disease, all research tries to answer the same kinds of questions. Research on Vitamin C and the common cold illustrates particularly well what those questions are.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">a) Controls</h3>
                        <p>In most studies on the efficacy of vitamin C, researchers divide people into two groups</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>One group the experimental group receives a vitamin C supplement.</li>
                            <li>Group two the control does not get vitamin C supplement.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Researchers follow both groups to determine whether the vitamin C group has fewer or shorter colds than the control group.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Points to consider</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The two groups must be similar in all respects except for those who receive a vitamin C supplement.</li>
                            <li>Random selection, a process of choosing the members from the same population by following a laid down procedure.</li>
                            <li>All groups must have the same track records of the cold.</li>
                            <li>In experiments involving a nutrient, both diets must also be similar with respect to that nutrient.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">b) Sample size</h3>
                        <p>To ensure that there are no errors, a large sample is recommended. Statistical methods are used to determine whether differences between groups of various sizes support a hypothesis or are insignificant.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">c) Placebos</h3>
                        <p>If people take vitamin C for colds and believe, it will cure them, their chances of recovery improve. The faith of healing is known as the placebo effect. In this method a pill's given to everybody. Some of the pills contain vitamin C and others do not. A study conducted under these conditions is called a blind experiment, that is the subjects do not know (are blind to) whether they are members of the experimental group or the control group.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">d) Double blind</h3>
                        <p>The experimenters too must not know which subjects are in which group. This helps to reduce bias in the interpretation of the results. To prevent this, the pills given are coded by a third person, who does not reveal to the experimenters which subjects were which until all results have been recorded.</p>

                        <p>Committees have been formed to deliberate on the above points and have come up with guidelines and recommendations. For example there is a committee that's for Developing Dietary Allowances whose primary concerns focus on maintaining health and focus on energy and nutrient needs. Another committee on Diet and Health pays particular attention to reducing the risks of chronic diseases and focuses on dietary inadequacies and excesses.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.4.1 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)</h3>
                        <p>The amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known needs of practically all healthy people. RDAs are based on scientific knowledge and are prepared by a committee of Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. At least 40 different nations and International Organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>For nutrients that are abundant in the diet, estimated minimum requirements have been set.</li>
                            <li>For nutrients that are less-well studied, estimated safe and Adequate Dietary Intakes (ESADDI) are given.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>RDA is set for Energy, Protein, Vitamins A,D,E,K thiamine, riboflavin, Niacin, B<sub>6</sub>, folate, B<sub>12</sub> and calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, iron, zinc, iodine and selenium minerals.<br>
                        Estimated minimum requirements is set for Sodium, potassium, chloride<br>
                        Estimated safe and Adequate Dietary Intake (ESADDI) is set for Vitamins biotin and pontothenic acid and copper, manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum minerals.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Energy RDA</h4>
                        <p>Each person's food energy intake must equal the energy expended if the person is to maintain body weight. The RDA for energy is an average for a healthy population for a given age or sex. The RDAs assume that most people are engaged in light to moderate activity and not those who are more physically active. E.g. average RDA for 19-24 years man is 2900 k calories.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Protein RDA</h4>
                        <p>Protein recommendations are based on body weight. Protein RDA is high unlike energy RDA so it covers the needs for most people.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Carbohydrate and Fat</h4>
                        <p>No RDA is given for carbohydrate and fats but it is recommended that more than half of daily energy should come from carbohydrate $55-60\%$ and $1/3$ from fat, $20-30\%$.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Water Recommendation</h4>
                        <p>The bigger and more active a person is the more water the persons needs. Generally most people need at least six to eight glasses of water or liquids a day.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Fiber Recommendation</h4>
                        <p>There is no RDA for fiber. Instead it is recommended that people eat sufficient fiber from fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole-grain products which also provide minerals and vitamins, and water as well as fiber.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.4.2 Estimating a minimal Requirement</h3>
                        <p>This information is based on a healthy population's needs. The estimates are drawn from information from studies on deficiency and depletion of stores. An amount is then set, that appears sufficient to maintain body processes. When people consistently obtain a deficient intake one that is less than the requirement, their nutrient stores decline, which over time leads to deficiency symptoms.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.4.3 Establishing a generous Recommendation</h3>
                        <p>RDAS are set at the average requirement for each nutrient, which is assumed to be closest to everyone's needs. If the RDA is placed at exactly the average, half of the population would therefore be deficient. To take care of this the RDA committee sets the requirements a little higher than the average for protein, vitamins and minerals. However to avoid toxicity an upper safe level is set. RDAs are therefore stated as "safe and adequate" range, "safe" meaning "not too low" and not too high.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.4.4 Using the RDA</h3>
                        <p>Although the intent of the RDA may seem simple enough, they are the subject of misunderstanding and controversy. The following facts will help to put the RDA in perspective.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>The RDA serves as estimates of adequate energy and nutrient intakes of healthy people. They do not apply to people with health problems who may require supplemented or restricted intake.</li>
                            <li>The RDAs are intended to be met through diets composed of a variety of foods. Because foods contain a mixture of nutrients, they deliver more than just those nutrients named in the RDA table. Excess intake of vitamins and minerals are unlikely when their sources are foods rather than supplements.</li>
                            <li>The RDAs are safe and adequate recommendations that include a generous margin of safety. They are not minimum requirements, nor are they necessarily optimal intakes for all individuals.</li>
                            <li>The RDA applies to average daily intakes. To try to meet the RDA of every nutrient every day is difficult and unnecessary. The length of time over which a person's intake can deviate from the average without risk of deficiency or overdose varies, for most nutrients, it is best to try to achieve the average intakes recommended by the RDA within three days or so.</li>
                            <li>The RDAs are most appropriately used to develop and evaluate nutrition programs for populations such as school children or military personnel. The RDA can be used to estimate the risks of deficiencies for an individual only if the person's intakes are determined and averaged over a sufficient length of time. After all, the recommended intakes do meet the needs of essentially all members of a healthy population, so by definition, they apply to individuals within that population. To use the RDA this way, though, an individual must compare the RDA with the typical intake, and not just with an arbitrary day's intake.</li>
                        </ol>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How much do you need?</h3>
                        <p>Nutritional status: Can be defined as one's health condition as influenced by the intake and utilization of nutrients. An individual's needs must take into account factors such as, age, sex, height, weight, previous nutrient intake, and health status, symptoms of nutrient excesses or deficiencies and risks for developing chronic disease. The determination of these individual factors is referred to as nutritional assessment. Individual nutritional assessment involves a review of past and present dietary intake, clinical assessment with medical history, and laboratory measurements.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.5.1 Dietary Intake</h3>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>An evaluation of current and past food intake can predict deficiency or excess of nutrients. Most methods of evaluating dietary intake involve either recalling or recording daily food intake. Some methods are labor intensive for the individual; others must be done by trained professional observers. None of these methods are ideal since the accuracy of all these methods relies on the memory and reliability of the individuals.</li>
                            <li>For instance, overweight individuals tend to report less than they usually eat, whereas underweight individuals tend to report more than they actually eat.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite this problem, the following dietary intake methods are the best tools available.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1. $\mathbf{24}$ Hour Recall</h4>
                        <p>It is the most common method used. This is conducted by a trained interviewer who asks individuals to recall exactly what they ate during the preceding 24 -hour period. Detailed description of all food and drink are asked from each subject, including descriptions of cooking methods, and brand names of products. Since food intake varies from day to day, repeated 24 hour recalls on the same individual often provide more accurate estimates of typical intake.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Food Diary</h4>
                        <p>To complete a food diary individuals are instructed to record all food and drink they consume during a defined period ranging from one to seven days. At least one weekend day should be included since most people eat differently on weekends than during the school or work week. The record should include meals and snacks, brand names and cooking methods. Food records consumed or just estimating portion sizes.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Food Frequency</h4>
                        <p>A food frequency questionnaire is designed to obtain information about typical food consumption patterns.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>It represents a list of foods or food categories</li>
                            <li>Individuals respond to questions from a trained observer regarding how often each food is consumed, for example, "How often do you drink"? Responses are recorded as the numbers of times the food is consumed per day, weeks or month.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. Diet History</h4>
                        <p>A diet history is a less clearly defined procedure that includes components of the other three methods.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A typical diet history includes a 24-hour recall with a food frequency questionnaire.</li>
                            <li>The combination of 2 or more methods often provides more complete information than one method alone. For example if an individual's 24 -hour recall does not include milk, but a food frequency questionnaire suggests that the individual typically drinks milk once a day the two can be combined to provide a more accurate picture of this individual's typical intake.</li>
                            <li>Once the above information is obtained, the nutrient content of the diet can be determined by using information from several sources.</li>
                            <li>Food composition tables.</li>
                            <li>Computer diet analysis programs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.5.2 Clinical Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Clinical assessment evaluates external signs of nutritional status. Medical history should be included to assess symptoms of, or risk factors for nutrition-related diseases such as heart disease or diabetes.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.5.2.1 Anthropometric Measurements</h4>
                        <p>These are measures of height, weight and limb circumference are used to compare individuals to population standards, or to monitor changes in a specific individual.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Comparison to standards may indicate a nutritional deficiency or excess however, this information should be evaluated only within the context of a personal history. For example children who are small for age may have a nutritional deficiency or just a product of very short parents.</li>
                            <li>Measurements taken periodically and compared with previous measurements, reveal patterns and indicate trends in a person's overall nutrition status, they provide little information about the status of specific nutrients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2.5.2.2 Physical Examination</h4>
                        <p>This technique is a physical examination that looks for clues to poor nutritional status. Every part of the body can be examined to offer clues for example the hair, eyes, skin, posture, tongue, fingernails, and others. The examination requires skill, because many physical signs can reflect more than one nutrient deficiency or toxicity or even non nutrition conditions. Like other assessment techniques, a physical examination does not by itself provide conclusions, but instead may reveal possible nutrient imbalances for other assessment techniques to confirm or confirms data collected from other assessment measures.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.5.3 Laboratory Tests</h3>
                        <p>Are used to detect a developing deficiency, imbalance or toxicity state by taking a sample of body tissue or fluids (blood or urine) and analyzing them in a laboratory and compare the results with the normal values of a similar population. The goal of nutrition assessment is to discover early signs of malnutrition before symptoms appear. Laboratory tests also confirm results from other assessment methods.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">An example of Iron</h4>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Too little iron gets into the body either because iron is lacking in the person's food (a primary deficiency) or because the person's body doesn't absorb or use iron normally (a secondary deficiency).</li>
                            <li>A dietary history provides clues to primary deficiencies, a health history provides clues to secondary deficiency</li>
                            <li>Then the body begins to use up its iron stores.</li>
                            <li>At this stage, the deficiency might be described as subclinical.</li>
                            <li>It exists as a correct condition and might be detected by laboratory tests, but outward signs have not yet appeared.</li>
                            <li>Finally iron stores are exhausted. Now, the body cannot make enough iron containing red blood cells to replace those that are aging and dying.</li>
                            <li>The red blood cells normally carry oxygen to all body's tissues.</li>
                            <li>When iron is lacking fewer red blood cells are made, the new ones are pale and small, and every part of the body feels the effects of an oxygen shortage.</li>
                            <li>Now the overt signs of deficiency appear- weakness, fatigue, paler, and headaches, reflecting iron deficiency state of the blood. Physical examination would reveal these symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Therefore reviewing dietary data may suggest a nutrition problem in its early stages. Laboratory tests may detect it before it becomes overt, where as physical examination picks up on the problem only after it is causing symptoms.</li>
