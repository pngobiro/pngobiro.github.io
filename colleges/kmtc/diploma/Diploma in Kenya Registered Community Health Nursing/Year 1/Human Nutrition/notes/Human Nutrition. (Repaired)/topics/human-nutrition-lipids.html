                        <p>Lipids are organic compounds, most of which do not dissolve in water. Lipids are the body's most concentrated source of stored energy, providing 9kcalories per gram. They are an important structural component of cells, particularly in the brain and nervous system. As a component of all cell membranes, lipids protect the internal environment of cells. The layer of adipose tissue that lies under the skin and around internal organs protects the body from changes in temperatures and provides a cushion to protect against shock. Lipids help transport fat soluble substances such as vitamins A, E and D through the intestinal tract and bloodstream. They are needed for the synthesis of hormones that regulate body function.</p>

                        <p>The chart above shows the effects of individual dietary fatty acids on Total Serum Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol when $1\%$ of the energy from carbohydrates in the diet is replaced by $1\%$ of energy of the specific fatty acids. The chart shows cholesterol increases from lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), and palmitic acid (C16:0) which are found in coconut oil, palm oil, and butter. Elaidic acid (transC18:1), which is present in hydrogenated fats, is the worst because it increases LDL and decreases HDL. The saturated fatty acid stearic acid (C18:0), the monounsaturated oleic acid (C18:1), and the polyunsaturated linoleic acid (C18:2) decrease LDL and increase HDL to various degrees.</p>

                        <p>The two carbon atoms in the chain that are bound next to either side of the double bond can occur in a cis or trans configuration.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cis</strong><br>
                        A cis configuration means that adjacent hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond. The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and, in the case of the cis isomer, causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid. The more double bonds the chain has in the cis configuration, the less flexibility it has. When a chain has many cis bonds, it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations. For example, oleic acid with one double bond, has a "kink" in it, whereas linoleic acid, with two double bonds, has a more pronounced bend. Alphalinolenic acid, with three double bonds, favors a hooked shape. The effect of this is that, in restricted environments, such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer, or triglycerides in lipid droplets, cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed, and therefore could affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat.</p>
                        <p><strong>trans</strong><br>
                        A trans configuration, by contrast, means that the next two hydrogen atoms are bound to opposite sides of the double bond. As a result, they do not cause the chain to bend much, and their shape is similar to straight saturated fatty acids.</p>
                        <p>In most naturally-occurring unsaturated fatty acids, each double bond has three $n$ carbon atoms after it, for some n , and all are cis bonds. Most fatty acids in the trans configuration (trans fats) are not found in nature and are the result of human processing (e.g., hydrogenation).</p>
