                            <li><dfn>Vitamins</dfn> are essential organic that provide no energy but are needed in small amount in the diet to promote and regulated body functions. Vitamin deficiencies remain a major problem worldwide. Vitamin supplements taken in excess are becoming a major concern toxic.</li>
                            <li>How much of a vitamin is available to the body is regulated by the absorption, transport, activations, storage and excretion of that vitamin. Vitamins are established by evaluating the results from many different kinds of studies, including depletion - repletion studies, nutrient balances studies, studies that relate to a parameter of metabolic function, information from animal experiments and epidemiology observations. When information is not sufficient to develop a specific recommendation, estimated safe and adequate dairy intakes are suggested. Too little will results in a deficiency and excess can be toxic.</li>
                            <li>In most cases adequate intakes of vitamins can be obtained from a well balanced diet but certain people may need vitamin supplementation. How food is transported handled, processed, prepared and cooked must be considered in diet planning.</li>
                            <li>Most people can meet their vitamin needs from food. Except in special circumstances e.g. population of high risk for malnutrition due to inadequate nutrient intake, people with chronic diseases, vegetarians, drug and alcohol abuse, people in certain stages of life cycle. Supplements can be recommended sometimes under these conditions.</li>
                            <li>Vitamin differ from the carbohydrates, fats and proteins in the following ways:

                                    <li>Structure- vitamins are individual units; they are not linked in long chains.</li>
                                    <li>Function - vitamin do not yield usable energy when broken down, they assist enzymes that release energy from carbohydrates, fats and proteins.</li>
                                    <li>Food contents- the amount of vitamins required are measured in micrograms or milligrams rather than grams.</li>

                        <p>These include vitamins A, D, E, and K, they are normally found in the fats and oils of foods. They are insoluble in water, so they require bile for digestion and chylomicrons for absorption.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.2.1 Vitamin A</h3>
                        <p>There are several forms of vitamin A. The <dfn>retinoids</dfn>, which include retinal, retinol and retinoic acid which are used by the body to promote vision and for growth and cell differentiation and thereby maintaining the health of epithelial tissues and skin, support the immune system, promoting growth and bone remodeling. It is found in the diet in both preformed as retinal, and retinoic acid and precursor forms, <dfn>carotenoids</dfn>, most commonly beta carotene. Although carotenoids are not toxic, preformed vitamin A can be toxic at doses as low as 10X RDA. The major food sources of preformed vitamin A include liver, fish and fortified dairy products.<br> <!-- Corrected IOX to 10X -->
                        There are also provitamins A form called carotenoids. They are used by the body as Vitamin A but must be converted to retinoids. They protect cells against damage by oxygen. Carotenoids are found in fruits and vegetables e.g. pawpaw, mangoes, plums, carrots, tomatoes, green leafy vegetables etc. There is epidemiological evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables containing beta- carotene protects against cancer. Vitamin A is a micronutrient of public health concern in Kenya and other developing countries.</p>
                        <p><strong>Deficiency</strong><br>
                        Vitamin A deficiency is one of the major nutrition problem for the developing countries. More than 100 million children worldwide have some degree of vitamin A deficiency and so are vulnerable to infectious disease. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Unhealthy epithelial tissue results in infection due to invasion by bacteria and virus e.g. respiratory infections and diarrhea.</li>
                            <li>Failure of growth of bones</li>
                            <li>Night blindness</li>
                            <li>Dry eyes and skin</li>
                            <li>Anemia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Toxicity</strong><br>
                        As deficiency of vitamin A affect all the body system, so does toxicity.<br>
                        Too much vitamin A is toxic</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Headaches, pain in joints</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.2.2 Vitamin D</h3>
                        <p>Vitamin D is different from other nutrients in that the body can synthesize it with the help of sunlight; it is therefore not an essential nutrient but the dietary requirement varies depending on the amount synthesized. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption from the intestine, calcium deposition and release from the bone and the kidney.</p>
                        <p><strong>Deficiency</strong><br>
                        Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include:<br>
                        <dfn>Rickets</dfn> in children<br>
                        <dfn>Osteomalacia</dfn> in adults</p>
                        <p><strong>Toxicity</strong><br>
                        Toxicity can increase calcium absorption and bone mineralization, high blood calcium which causes deposition of calcium in the kidneys, heart, lungs and arteries.</p>
                        <p><strong>Food Sources</strong><br>
                        Animal origin include: Eggs yolk, Liver, Fatty fish, Butter, Fortified milk<br>
                        -The body makes vitamin D from exposure to the sun.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.2.3 Vitamin E</h3>
                        <p>Vitamin E functions primarily as a fat soluble antioxidant and a primary defender of the body against oxidation, protecting the lipids and other vulnerable components of the cells and their membranes from destruction. Since polyunsaturated fats are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage, its requirement increases as the polyunsaturated fat content of the diet increases. Vitamins E are very active in the lungs and red blood cells where there is high exposure to oxygen; it also helps to protect the lungs against air pollutants especially when a person is breathing hard during exercising. Vitamin E plays a role in the immune system by protecting the white blood cells.</p>
                        <p><strong>Deficiency</strong></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Hemolysis of red blood cells</li>
                            <li>Loss of muscle co-ordination and reflex.</li>
                            <li>Impaired vision and speech</li>
                            <li>Deterioration of respiratory muscles</li>
                            <li>Associated with some types of cancers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Toxicity</strong><br>
                        High doses of vitamin E can interfere with functions of vitamin K. A lot of people take vitamin E supplements for various reasons e.g. improved physical performance, enhances sexual performance, slows process of aging, slow progression of some diseases. These claims have no scientific basis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Food Sources</strong><br>
                        Oil seeds, meats, eggs, nuts, soybean oil, wheat germ, plant oils and green vegetables.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.2.4 Vitamin K</h3>
                        <p>Vitamin K is found in plants and synthesized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting. It also participates in the synthesis of bone protein. A deficiency of vitamin K results in a failure of blood to clot. Since this is a problem in new born, an anti vitamin K factor, dicumarol is used medically as an anticoagulant.</p>
                        <p><strong>Food sources</strong><br>
                        Liver, leafy vegetables and cabbage.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>These are vitamin B and C. The water-soluble vitamins are found in the watery compartments of foods. On being absorbed, the water-soluble vitamins move directly in to the blood. The kidneys, monitoring the blood that flows through them, detect and remove excess water-soluble vitamins.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.3.1 Vitamin B</h3>
                        <p>The 8 B vitamins serve as coenzymes to the enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats and proteins to produce energy. <dfn>Thiamine</dfn>, <dfn>Riboflavin</dfn> and <dfn>niacin</dfn> are the key vitamins involved in energy metabolism so their requirement varies with energy intake. Thiamine is required for the generation of energy from macronutrients and the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Riboflavin coenzymes are needed for the generation of energy. Riboflavin is needed for the utilization of several other vitamins. Niacin coenzymes are important in the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins and fat and in the synthesis of fatty acids and steroids. Supplements of the nicotinic acid form of niacin can lower elevated blood cholesterol, but their use is limited by toxicity symptoms such as flushing, tingling sensations and a red skin rash.</p>
                        <p><strong>Best food sources for:</strong></p>
                        <p>Niacin- Beef, chicken, fish and enriched grain products. The amino acid tryptophan can be converted into niacin, Liver, whole grains, legumes nuts, milk, yogurt and vegetables,<br>
                        Thiamine- lean pork, legumes, and whole or enriched grains and cereals,<br>
                        Riboflavin - milk, meat, and enriched grain products.</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Thiamine - <dfn>Beriberi</dfn> causes nervous systems abnormalities. Deficiencies are common in alcoholics. No toxicity identified</li>
                            <li>Riboflavin - affects facial skin, eyes and GI tract</li>
                            <li>Niacin - <dfn>pellagra</dfn> (dementia, dermatitis, diarrhea, death).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.3.2 Biotin and Pantothenic Acid</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Biotin</dfn> is needed for the synthesis of glucose, fatty acids and DNA and the metabolism of certain amino acids. A RDA has not been established because some biotin is made by gastrointestinal bacteria. <dfn>Pantothenic acid</dfn> is part of coenzyme A (COA), which is required for the production of energy from protein, carbohydrates and fat and the synthesis of fat and cholesterol deficiency is rare.</p>
                        <p><strong>Deficiency</strong><br>
                        Insomnia, depression, muscle pain and weakness, fatigue</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.3.3 Vitamin B<sub>6</sub></h3>
                        <p>Pyridoxal phosphate, the coenzyme form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is needed for the activity of more than 50 enzymes involved in the metabolism of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> is essential for amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, so its requirement is affected by protein intake. It's involved in making non-essential amino acids and neurotransmitters. It also helps to make the blood cells.</p>
                        <p><strong>Deficiency</strong><br>
                        Insomnia, weakness, irritability, growth failure, impaired motor function, convulsions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">7.3.4 Folate and B<sub>12</sub></h3>
                        <p>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and <dfn>folate</dfn> are closely related, each depends on the other for activation. Folate is necessary for DNA synthesis; it plays a major role in cell differentiation and division so it is particularly important for rapidly dividing cells such as those in the bone marrow where blood cells are formed.

                        <p>Vitamins are essential, organic nutrients that do not provide energy and are required in small quantities in the diet to promote and regulate chemical reactions in the body. They are classified by their solubility in either fat or water. The fat soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E and K. The water soluble vitamins are vitamin C and the B vitamins. Minerals are elements needed by the body to regulate chemical reactions and provide structure. Their bioavailability is affected by interactions with other minerals, vitamins, and other dietary components such as fiber.</p>
