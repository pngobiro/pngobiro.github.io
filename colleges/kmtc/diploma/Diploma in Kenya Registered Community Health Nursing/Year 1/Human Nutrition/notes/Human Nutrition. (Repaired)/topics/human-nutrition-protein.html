                        <p>Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes which control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of amino acids which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential, and therefore must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.</p>

                        <p><dfn>Protein</dfn>: - Compose 16% of body weight in a lean individual. <dfn>Amino acids</dfn> are the building blocks for protein.<br>
                        Proteins are involved in key body functions including: blood clotting, fluid balance, production of enzymes and hormones, vision, cell repair, a component of body structure, provides energy and Immune function.</p>
                        <p><strong>Amino Acids</strong>: - In structure, proteins resemble chains, consisting of amino acid linked together. Amino Acid contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen and some have sulfur, chains of amino acids are formed when the amino group of one amino acid links the acid group of another amino acid. Two amino acid link together to form a <dfn>dipeptide</dfn>. A <dfn>polypeptide</dfn> is formed when many amino acids link together.<br>
                        General structure of an amino acid: <code class="language-smiles">[R]C(N)C(=O)C(=O)O</code> (Note: This SMILES is for an alpha-keto acid, not a typical amino acid. A general amino acid is R-CH(NH2)-COOH).</p>
                        <p>Protein is made up of 20 different amino acid, nine from <dfn>Essential amino acids</dfn> which cannot be made by the body, also called indispensable amino acid; and eleven from <dfn>Nonessential amino acids</dfn> which can are synthesized by the body, also called dispensable. <dfn>Conditionally indispensable Amino acids</dfn> are amino acids that are normally nonessential, but must be supplied by the diet in special circumstances when the need for it exceeds the body's ability to produce it, for example Cysteine are made from Methionine and Tyrosine from Phenylalanine. Most protein foods contain at least 100 amino acids. The body can join different amino acids in different patterns to make proteins for specific functions</p>
                        <p><dfn>Transamination</dfn>: - metabolic process for synthezing non-essential amino acids.<br>
                        <dfn>Deamination</dfn>: - removal of the amino Group from the amino acid. The amino group (-$\text{NH}_2$) is incorporated into urea for excretion. The carbon skeleton is then used for energy.<br>
                        <dfn>Tripeptide</dfn>: - 3 amino acids<br>
                        <dfn>Oligopeptide</dfn>: - 3-50 amino acids<br>
                        <dfn>Sickle-cell disease</dfn>: - incorrect sequence of amino acids that form the hemoglobin.<br>
                        <dfn>Denaturation of proteins</dfn>- alteration of the form of proteins, due to treatment by heat, acid, alkaline solution or agitation. For example boiled egg coagulates because of heat and curdling of milk due to acid.<br>
                        <dfn>High-quality proteins</dfn>- Dietary protein that contains all the essential amino acids in the right proportions also called <dfn>complete proteins</dfn>. Can support growth and maintenance e.g. animal proteins.<br>
                        Dietary proteins that lack one or more essential amino acids also called <dfn>incomplete proteins</dfn>. Cannot support growth and maintenance e.g. plant proteins.<br>
                        <dfn>Limiting amino acids</dfn> - essential amino acids supplied in less amounts than needed to support protein synthesis e.g. Grains - lysine, threonine; Legumes - methionine; Nuts and seeds - lysine and Vegetables - methionine<br>
                        <dfn>Complementary value of protein</dfn>- achieved by putting two sources of proteins together in order to complement each other for the limiting amino acid e.g. rice + red beans, Chapati + green grams.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Biological value</dfn> of a protein is a measure of high efficient a food protein can turn into body tissue.</p>

Amino acid consist of a carbon atom with a hydrogen atom, a nitrogen-containing group, an acid group, and a unique side chain attached. The amino acid that the body is unable to make in sufficient amounts to meet it is needs are referred to as essential amino acid. Proteins provide structure. They regulate body functions as enzymes and hormones; transport molecules in the blood and cells; and function in the immune system, muscle contraction, fluid balance, acid balance and nerve transmission.
