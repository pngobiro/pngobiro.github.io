\section*{0}

\subsection*{1.0 INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS NUTRITION?}
1. Nutrition is more than just the food we eat. It is a science that encompasses all the interactions that occur between living organisms and food.
2. These interactions include the physiological processes by which an organism,
- Ingests
- Digests
- Absorbs
- Transports and utilize food.
3. Nutrition includes the biological actions and interactions of food with the body and their consequences for health and disease.
4. It also includes the psychological, social, cultural, economic, and technological factors that influence which foods we eat.
5. The biological importance of food is dictated by the nutrients it contains.
6. Other aspects of food such as taste, color, smell, texture, presentation and packaging help determine its psychological, cultural, social and personal value.

\subsection*{1.1 OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:
1. Define the terminology used in nutrition.
2. Classify Nutrients.
3. State nutrient needs of the body.
4. State the consequences of poor nutrition.

\subsection*{1.2 Nutrients}

Are substances in foods that are required by the body for growth, maintenance and reproduction. They provide energy, contribute to structure and regulate biological processes. To date, approximately 45 nutrients are considered essential to human life.

\section*{Essential Nutrients}

Are those substances that must be supplied in the diet because they either cannot be made by the body or cannot be made in large enough quantities to meet needs?

\section*{Non-Essential Substances}

Can be made by the body for example; Lecithin, which is needed for nerve function, is not an essential nutrient because it can be made in the body from other substances. On
the other hand, Vitamin A, which is needed for vision, is essential in the human diet because it cannot be made by the human body.

\subsection*{1.3 Classes of Nutrients}

Food is more than something to satisfy your appetite. Food is fuel for your body. Each type of nutrient has a specific purpose and meets a specific need that your body has. The six nutrients are: Water, Carbohydrates, Protein, Lipids and Micronutrients which are Vitamins and Minerals.

\subsection*{1.3.1 Water}

Is water a nutrient in a class by itself? Yes, water is a nutrient. It is the most important nutrient. Water makes up about $60 \%$ of the human body. Your body uses water 24 hours a day. It functions as a solvent, a lubricant, a transport medium, and a regulator of body temperature. It does not provide energy. .

\subsection*{1.3.2 Carbohydrates}

Include sugars, simple carbohydrates, and starches, more complex carbohydrates that are made of many sugars linked together. They provide a readily available source of energy. Fruits, vegetables and grains are the main sources of carbohydrates in the diet. Fiber is also a form of carbohydrate.

\subsection*{1.3.3 Protein}

Protein provides structure and regulation of body processes. They are made of amino acids. Some amino acids can be made by the body, and others are essential in the diet.
- Dietary protein must provide the correct combination of amino acids to meet the need for the essential amino acids.
- Meat, milk, grains and legumes are good dietary sources of protein.

\subsection*{1.3.4 Lipids}

Lipids commonly referred to as fats, provide a storage form of energy. Most lipids contain fatty acids. Several of which are essential nutrients. Lipids in the diet include fats and oils that occur naturally in food and those that are added in cooking or at the table.

Alcohol consumed in the diet also provides energy, but alcohol is not an essential nutrient.

\subsection*{1.3.5 Micronutrients}

Vitamins and minerals are classified as micronutrients because they are needed in small amounts in the diet.
- The amount required is expressed in milligrams or micrograms.
- They do not provide energy but help regulate the production of energy from macronutrients.
- Vitamins and minerals are found in most of the foods we eat. Fresh foods are generally the best sources of vitamins and minerals because storage, processing and cooking often result in losses.
- Many of the vitamins and minerals in today's diet come from those intentionally added to food during manufacturing and processing or from nutritional supplements.

\subsection*{1.4 Nutrients in the Body: Biochemical and Physiological Needs}

Together, the macronutrients and micronutrients provide three basic functions:-
- Energy
- Structure
- Regulation

Which are needed for:-
- Growth
- Maintenance
- Reproduction

\section*{Kilocalories}

The energy needed for all body processes and activities is measured in Kilocalories or in kilojoules.
1 Kilocalorie = 4.18 K joules
- Carbohydrates and protein provide 4 K calories per gram
- Lipids provide 9 K calories per gram
- Alcohol provides 7 K calories per gram.

If more energy is consumed than needed, the extra is stored as body fat, resulting in weight gain. If less energy is consumed in the diet than is needed, the body will burn its own carbohydrates, protein and lipids in order to meet energy needs.

\subsection*{1.5 Structural Nutrients}

Nutrients from the diet are also needed for the formation and maintenance of body structure, water, proteins, lipids and minerals are important structural nutrients. For example, muscle is made up of primarily protein and water, and bone is composed of a protein core embedded with minerals.

\subsection*{1.6 Regulatory Nutrients}

Nutrients are also involved in the regulation of the biochemical reactions of the living body. Together these reactions are referred to as metabolism.
- Reactions must be regulated by being turned on and off and speeded up and slowed down at appropriate times in order to maintain a constant environment inside the body, referred to as homeostasis.
- Vitamins, minerals, proteins are the chief regulatory nutrients. For example, proteins are involved in the regulation of body fluids. If we drink too little, a
protein signals the kidneys to decrease the amount of water lost in the urine. Without regulation of this process, dehydration would frequently occur.
- The regulation of the amount of sugar, glucose in the blood is another example of homeostasis regulated by proteins.
- When a food is high in sugar, such as a bottle of soda, is consumed, the concentration of glucose in blood will rise. This causes the release of a protein that signals the removal of glucose from the blood and speeds up the chemical reactions needed to store the sugar for later use, or use it for energy.
- When this process is not regulated it can result in a disorder called diabetes.

\subsection*{1.7 Nutrient Requirement: How much of each Nutrient do we need?}

To support life and maintain health, nutrients must not only be supplied, they must be supplied in appropriate_amounts.
- Both deficiencies and excess of nutrients can affect health either in short term or over a lifetime.
- The amount of each nutrient needed by the body depends on the nutrient's function as well as the needs of individuals.

\subsection*{1.8 Effects of too little or too much}

Conditions resulting from either too much or too little of one or more nutrients are referred to as malnutrition.

\subsection*{1.8.1 Under-Nutrition}

A deficiency of nutrients, starvation, the most severe form of under nutrition is a deficiency of energy that causes poor growth, weight loss, decreased ability to do work, the inability to reproduce and if severe enough death.
- Deficiencies of individual nutrients may also occur.
- The symptoms of a single nutrient deficiency demonstrate the body functions that rely on the deficient nutrient.
- For example, vitamin A is necessary for vision, as a result, a deficiency interferes with vision. Vitamin D is necessary for bone development; therefore a deficiency causes abnormal bone development.

\section*{Nutrient Deficiency Stages}

\section*{Here is what is happening}

Here's how you can tell:

\subsection*{1.8.2 Over-Nutrition}

An excess of nutrients, is also a form of malnutrition. When food is consumed in excess of energy need, the extra is stored as body fat. Some fat is necessary to insulate the body and store energy, but an excess of body fat, called obesity, increases the risk for many chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.
- When excess of specific nutrients are consumed, an adverse or toxic reaction may occur. For example, a large dose of vitamin A can cause liver and kidney damage. Nutrient toxicities rarely occur as a result of food consumption because the amounts of vitamins and minerals in individual foods are well below nutrient requirements. Our intake of foods and therefore, vitamins and minerals is limited by our need for energy and the size of our stomachs.
- On some rare occasion, a toxic level of a nutrient can be obtained from food. For instance, fish oils which are high in vitamin A can cause toxic reactions if eaten in high amounts.
- Nutrient toxicity results more frequently from the use of vitamin and mineral supplements; than from food.

\subsection*{1.9 Short and long term effects of poor nutrition}

The effects of a nutritional excess or deficiency may occur rapidly or take a lifetime to develop. Both short-term and long-term nutritional effects have important health implications.
- For example, the symptoms associated with lack of water occur rapidly. An athlete exercising in hot weather may become dehydrated in a matter of hours, developing symptoms of such as headaches, dizziness, and confusion. Drinking water relieves the symptoms as rapidly as they appeared.
- The effects of other nutritional imbalances may take weeks or months to manifest themselves. For example consumption of an iron-deficient diet over weeks or months will slowly cause symptoms such as a decreased capacity to work and irritability, which are indicative of iron deficiency anemia.
- Large doses of vitamin B 6 when taken for months to years, cause nervous system abnormalities such as numbness and poor co-ordination.
- An excess or deficiency of energy is another nutritional imbalance that takes a long term to manifest itself. When excess energy is consumed, excess body fat is deposited, but it may be months before the weight gain is significant. Likewise, as anyone who has tried to lose weight knows, it can take months of consuming less energy to use up the excess fat.
- Recently nutritional effects that occur over a much longer time have become an important health focus. An individual's nutrient intake today can affect the development of cancer, or heart disease 20, 30 or 40 years from now.
- The specific effects of nutrition on the development of chronic disease are difficult to determine because numerous variables or risk factors such as, heredity, air pollution, and stress, poverty, displacement etc. are often involved.
- However nutrition has received a great deal of attention because it can be changed to decrease an individual's risk.

\subsection*{1.10 Summary of Definitions}

Foods products derived from plants or animals that can be taken into the body to yield nutrients for maintenance of life and the growth and repair of tissues.
Nutrients substances obtained from food and used in the body to provide energy and structural materials and to regulate growth, maintenance and repair of body's tissues; nutrients may also reduce the risk for some chronic diseases.

\section*{Essential nutrients}

Nutrients a person must obtain from food because the body cannot make them for itself in sufficient quantity to meet physiological needs, also called indispensable nutrients. About 40 nutrients are known to be essential for human beings.

\section*{Energy}

The capacity to do work. The energy in food is chemical energy. The body can convert this chemical energy to mechanical, electrical or heat energy.

\section*{Energy -Yielding Nutrients}

The nutrients that breakdown to yield energy the body can use:-
- Carbohydrates
- Fat
- Protein

\section*{Calorie}

This is a unit by which energy is measured. Food energy is measured in kilocalories (1000 calories equal 1 kilocalorie)
- One kilocalorie is the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of water $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{Macronutrients}

Nutrients needed by the body in large amounts. These include Carbohydrates, Proteins and Lipids.

\section*{Metabolism}

The sum of all the chemical reactions that take place in a living organism.
Homeostasis
The capacity to maintain a balanced internal body environment.

\section*{Malnutrition}

Poor nutritional status resulting from a dietary intake either above or below that which is optimal to meet nutritional needs.

\section*{Under nutrition}

Poor nutrition status resulting from a dietary intake below that which meets nutritional needs.

\section*{Over nutrition}

Poor nutritional status resulting from a dietary intake in excess of that which is optimal for nutritional needs.

\section*{Toxic}

The capacity to produce injury at some level of intake.

\section*{Risk factor}

A characteristic or circumstance that is associated with the occurrence of a particular disease.

\subsection*{1.11 Summary}

In this lesson an overview of the nutrition, nutrients and consequences of poor nutrition was provided. There are six categories of nutrients that the body needs to acquire from food: Protein, carbohydrates, fat, fiber vitamins and minerals and water. These nutrients can be classified as macronutrient and micronutrient. All nutrients play a key role in maintaining the normal growth and functioning of the body, as well as prevention of nutrition related health conditions.

\section*{LESSON TWO}

\section*{THE SCIENCE OF NUTRITION}

\subsection*{2.0 INTRODUCTION}

The science of Nutrition is the study of the nutrients in foods and the body's handling of those nutrients

\section*{NUTRITION RESEARCH}

Research always begins with a question. For example, "what foods or nutrients might protect against a common cold?" In search of an answer, scientists make educated guesses (hypotheses) and then systematically conduct research studies to test each hypothesis. An example of some types of research studies in nutrition are:-

\section*{1. Epidemiological Studies}

Observe how much and what kinds of foods a group of people eat and how healthy those people are. Such findings bring to light factors that might influence the incidence of a disease in various populations.

\section*{2. Case-Control Studies}

Compare people who do and do not have a given condition such as a disease, closely matching them in age, occupations, and other key variables so that differences in other factors will stand out. Differences then appear that may account for the condition in the group that has it.
3. Animal Studies

Might feed specific nutrients or diets to animals and then observe any changes in health. Such studies test possible disease causes and treatments in a laboratory where all conditions can be controlled.

\section*{4. Human Intervention (or Clinical)}

Trials ask people to adopt a new behavior (for example eat a citrus fruit, take a vitamin C supplement, or exercise daily).
These trials help determine the effects such as measures have on the development or prevention of disease. Each type of study has advantages and disadvantages. Findings must be interpreted with an awareness of the study's limitations.

\subsection*{2.1 OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
1. Describe types of research studies.
2. Construct research questions for different studies
3. State the points to consider before making conclusions about an experiment
4. State the factors that will help to put the RDA in perspective.

In attempting to discover whether a nutrient relieves symptoms or cures a disease, all research tries to answer the same kinds of questions. Research on Vitamin C and the common cold illustrates particularly well what those questions are.
a) Controls

In most studies on the efficacy of vitamin C, researchers divide people into two groups
1. One group the experimental group receives a vitamin C supplement.
2. Group two the control does not get vitamin C supplement.
- Researchers follow both groups to determine whether the vitamin C group has fewer or shorter colds than the control group.

\section*{Points to consider}
- The two groups must be similar in all respects except for those who receive a vitamin C supplement.
- Random selection, a process of choosing the members from the same population by following a laid down procedure.
- All groups must have the same track records of the cold.
- In experiments involving a nutrient, both diets must also be similar with respect to that nutrient.
b) Sample size

To ensure that there are no errors, a large sample is recommended. Statistical methods are used to determine whether differences between groups of various sizes support a hypothesis or are insignificant.
c) Placebos

If people take vitamin C for colds and believe, it will cure them, their chances of recovery improve. The faith of healing is known as the placebo effect. In this method a pill's given to everybody. Some of the pills contain vitamin C and others do not. A study conducted under these conditions is called a blind experiment, that is the subjects do not know (are blind to) whether they are members of the experimental group or the control group.
d) Double blind

The experimenters too must not know which subjects are in which group. This helps to reduce bias in the interpretation of the results. To prevent this, the pills given are coded by a third person, who does not reveal to the experimenters which subjects were which until all results have been recorded.

\subsection*{2.2 Correlations and Causes}
- Research often examines the relationships between 2 or more variables, for example, daily vitamin C intake and the number of colds.
- Findings sometimes suggest no correlation between the two variables.
- Regardless of the amount of vitamin C eaten, the numbers of colds remain the same.
- Other times, studies find either a positive correlation (the vitamin C, the more colds) or a negative correlation (the more vitamin C the fewer the colds).
- Correlation evidence proves only that 2 variables are associated, not that one is the cause of the other.
- To prove that A causes B, scientists have to find evidence of the mechanism, that is to catch A in the act of causing B .
- Other scientists must confirm or disapprove the findings through replication before the results are accepted into the body of nutrition knowledge.
- Before results are published they are subjected to peer review - a process whereby a panel of scientists evaluates the study to confirm that it followed standard scientific methods.

\subsection*{2.3 Research versus Rumours}

Who decides that she takes vitamin C when she feels a cold coming on and "it works all the time". She knows what she is taking, she has faith in its efficacy, and she tends not to notice when it doesn't work. Before concluding that an experiment has shown that a nutrient cures a disease or alleviates a symptom ask these questions;
1. Was there similarity between the control group and the experimental group?
2. Was the sample size large enough to rule out chance variations?
3. Was a placebo effectively administered (blind)?
4. Was the experiment double blind?

In summary findings from research have laid down the foundation for quantifying how much of each nutrient the body needs.

\subsection*{2.4 Recommended Nutrient Intakes}

If nutritionist could define all the dietary factors a person needs to support good health, they ideally would.
1. Estimate the amounts of food energy the person needs to consume and the amount of physical activity the person needs to engage in to balance that energy intake.
2. Distribute the three energy yielding nutrients so that the person receives.
a) Enough protein to meet protein needs
b) Sufficient carbohydrates and fat to fill the remaining energy allowance, balanced in the way that supports health best.
3. Estimate how much water and fiber will support health optimally.
4. Estimate the minimum and maximum amounts of each vitamin and mineral consistent with health.
5. Set upper limits for intakes of dietary constituents that are harmful in large amounts > salt, fat and alcohol.

Committees have been formed to deliberate on the above points and have come up with guidelines and recommendations. For example there is a committee that's for Developing Dietary Allowances whose primary concerns focus on maintaining health and focus on energy and nutrient needs. Another committee on Diet and Health pays particular attention to reducing the risks of chronic diseases and focuses on dietary inadequacies and excesses.

\subsection*{2.4.1 Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)}

The amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known needs of practically all healthy people. RDAs are based on scientific knowledge and are prepared by a committee of Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. At least 40 different nations and International Organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.
- For nutrients that are abundant in the diet, estimated minimum requirements have been set.
- For nutrients that are less-well studied, estimated safe and Adequate Dietary Intakes (ESADDI) are given.

RDA is set for Energy, Protein, Vitamins A,D,E,K thiamine, riboflavin, Niacin, B ${ }_{6}$, folate, $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, iron, zinc, iodine and selenium minerals.
Estimated minimum requirements is set for Sodium, potassium, chloride
Estimated safe and Adequate Dietary Intake (ESADDI) is set for Vitamins biotin and pontothenic acid and copper, manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum minerals.

\section*{Energy RDA}

Each person's food energy intake must equal the energy expended if the person is to maintain body weight. The RDA for energy is an average for a healthy population for a given age or sex. The RDAs assume that most people are engaged in light to moderate activity and not those who are more physically active. E.g. average RDA for 19-24 years man is 2900 k calories.

\section*{Protein RDA}

Protein recommendations are based on body weight. Protein RDA is high unlike energy RDA so it covers the needs for most people.

\section*{Carbohydrate and Fat}

No RDA is given for carbohydrate and fats but it is recommended that more than half of daily energy should come from carbohydrate $55-60 \%$ and $1 / 3$ from fat, $20-30 \%$.

\section*{Water Recommendation}

The bigger and more active a person is the more water the persons needs. Generally most people need at least six to eight glasses of water or liquids a day.

\section*{Fiber Recommendation}

There is no RDA for fiber. Instead it is recommended that people eat sufficient fiber from fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole-grain products which also provide minerals and vitamins, and water as well as fiber.

\subsection*{2.4.2 Estimating a minimal Requirement}

This information is based on a healthy population's needs. The estimates are drawn from information from studies on deficiency and depletion of stores. An amount is then set, that appears sufficient to maintain body processes. When people consistently obtain a deficient intake one that is less than the requirement, their nutrient stores decline, which over time leads to deficiency symptoms.

\subsection*{2.4.3 Establishing a generous Recommendation}

RDAS are set at the average requirement for each nutrient, which is assumed to be closest to everyone's needs. If the RDA is placed at exactly the average, half of the population would therefore be deficient. To take care of this the RDA committee sets the requirements a little higher than the average for protein, vitamins and minerals. However to avoid toxicity an upper safe level is set. RDAs are therefore stated as "safe and adequate" range, "safe" meaning "not too low" and not too high.

\subsection*{2.4.4 Using the RDA}

Although the intent of the RDA may seem simple enough, they are the subject of misunderstanding and controversy. The following facts will help to put the RDA in perspective.
1. The RDA serves as estimates of adequate energy and nutrient intakes of healthy people. They do not apply to people with health problems who may require supplemented or restricted intake.
2. The RDAs are intended to be met through diets composed of a variety of foods. Because foods contain a mixture of nutrients, they deliver more than just those nutrients named in the RDA table. Excess intake of vitamins and minerals are unlikely when their sources are foods rather than supplements.
3. The RDAs are safe and adequate recommendations that include a generous margin of safety. They are not minimum requirements, nor are they necessarily optimal intakes for all individuals.
4. The RDA applies to average daily intakes. To try to meet the RDA of every nutrient every day is difficult and unnecessary. The length of time over which a person's intake can deviate from the average without risk of deficiency or overdose varies, for most nutrients, it is best to try to achieve the average intakes recommended by the RDA within three days or so.
5. The RDAs are most appropriately used to develop and evaluate nutrition programs for populations such as school children or military personnel. The RDA can be used to estimate the risks of deficiencies for an individual only if the
person's intakes are determined and averaged over a sufficient length of time. After all, the recommended intakes do meet the needs of essentially all members of a healthy population, so by definition, they apply to individuals within that population. To use the RDA this way, though, an individual must compare the RDA with the typical intake, and not just with an arbitrary day's intake.

\subsection*{2.4.5 Revising the RDA}

Suggestions for next revision include:-
1. Providing several sets of RDA,
- One for health
- One for disease prevention
- Another for disease treatment
2. Providing a range of values to accommodate people's diverse needs.
3. Using the most current RDA for food labels.
4. Establishing RDA for nutrients and non nutrients such as fiber, cholesterol and beta carotene that influence health.
5. Addressing the needs of elderly people and other nutritional vulnerable subgroups such as those in hardship areas.
6. Changing the name from dietary to nutrient allowances in recognition that in some circumstances desired intakes may not be possible from foods alone.

\subsection*{2.5 Nutritional Assessment}

\section*{How much do you need?}

Nutritional status: Can be defined as one's health condition as influenced by the intake and utilization of nutrients. An individual's needs must take into account factors such as, age, sex, height, weight, previous nutrient intake, and health status, symptoms of nutrient excesses or deficiencies and risks for developing chronic disease. The determination of these individual factors is referred to as nutritional assessment. Individual nutritional assessment involves a review of past and present dietary intake, clinical assessment with medical history, and laboratory measurements.

\subsection*{2.5.1 Dietary Intake}
- An evaluation of current and past food intake can predict deficiency or excess of nutrients. Most methods of evaluating dietary intake involve either recalling or recording daily food intake. Some methods are labor intensive for the individual; others must be done by trained professional observers. None of these methods are ideal since the accuracy of all these methods relies on the memory and reliability of the individuals.
- For instance, overweight individuals tend to report less than they usually eat, whereas underweight individuals tend to report more than they actually eat.

Despite this problem, the following dietary intake methods are the best tools available.

\section*{1. $\mathbf{2 4}$ Hour Recall}

It is the most common method used. This is conducted by a trained interviewer who asks individuals to recall exactly what they ate during the preceding 24 -hour period. Detailed description of all food and drink are asked from each subject, including descriptions of cooking methods, and brand names of products. Since food intake varies from day to day, repeated 24 hour recalls on the same individual often provide more accurate estimates of typical intake.

\section*{2. Food Diary}

To complete a food diary individuals are instructed to record all food and drink they consume during a defined period ranging from one to seven days. At least one weekend day should be included since most people eat differently on weekends than during the school or work week. The record should include meals and snacks, brand names and cooking methods. Food records consumed or just estimating portion sizes.

\section*{3. Food Frequency}

A food frequency questionnaire is designed to obtain information about typical food consumption patterns.
- It represents a list of foods or food categories
- Individuals respond to questions from a trained observer regarding how often each food is consumed, for example, "How often do you drink"? Responses are recorded as the numbers of times the food is consumed per day, weeks or month.

\section*{4. Diet History}

A diet history is a less clearly defined procedure that includes components of the other three methods.
- A typical diet history includes a 24-hour recall with a food frequency questionnaire.
- The combination of 2 or more methods often provides more complete information than one method alone. For example if an individual's 24 -hour recall does not include milk, but a food frequency questionnaire suggests that the individual typically drinks milk once a day the two can be combined to provide a more accurate picture of this individual's typical intake.
- Once the above information is obtained, the nutrient content of the diet can be determined by using information from several sources.
- Food composition tables.
- Computer diet analysis programs.

\subsection*{2.5.2 Clinical Assessment}

Clinical assessment evaluates external signs of nutritional status. Medical history should be included to assess symptoms of, or risk factors for nutrition-related diseases such as heart disease or diabetes.

\subsection*{2.5.2.1 Anthropometric Measurements}

These are measures of height, weight and limb circumference are used to compare individuals to population standards, or to monitor changes in a specific individual.
- Comparison to standards may indicate a nutritional deficiency or excess however, this information should be evaluated only within the context of a personal history. For example children who are small for age may have a nutritional deficiency or just a product of very short parents.
- Measurements taken periodically and compared with previous measurements, reveal patterns and indicate trends in a person's overall nutrition status, they provide little information about the status of specific nutrients.

\subsection*{2.5.2.2 Physical Examination}

This technique is a physical examination that looks for clues to poor nutritional status. Every part of the body can be examined to offer clues for example the hair, eyes, skin, posture, tongue, fingernails, and others. The examination requires skill, because many physical signs can reflect more than one nutrient deficiency or toxicity or even non nutrition conditions. Like other assessment techniques, a physical examination does not by itself provide conclusions, but instead may reveal possible nutrient imbalances for other assessment techniques to confirm or confirms data collected from other assessment measures.

\subsection*{2.5.3 Laboratory Tests}

Are used to detect a developing deficiency, imbalance or toxicity state by taking a sample of body tissue or fluids (blood or urine) and analyzing them in a laboratory and compare the results with the normal values of a similar population. The goal of nutrition assessment is to discover early signs of malnutrition before symptoms appear. Laboratory tests also confirm results from other assessment methods.

\section*{An example of Iron}
- Too little iron gets into the body either because iron is lacking in the person's food (a primary deficiency) or because the person's body doesn't absorb or use iron normally (a secondary deficiency).
- A dietary history provides clues to primary deficiencies, a health history provides clues to secondary deficiency
- Then the body begins to use up its iron stores.
- At this stage, the deficiency might be described as subclinical.
- It exists as a correct condition and might be detected by laboratory tests, but outward signs have not yet appeared.
- Finally iron stores are exhausted. Now, the body cannot make enough iron containing red blood cells to replace those that are aging and dying.
- The red blood cells normally carry oxygen to all body's tissues.
- When iron is lacking fewer red blood cells are made, the new ones are pale and small, and every part of the body feels the effects of an oxygen shortage.
- Now the overt signs of deficiency appear- weakness, fatigue, paler, and headaches, reflecting iron deficiency state of the blood. Physical examination would reveal these symptoms.
- Therefore reviewing dietary data may suggest a nutrition problem in its early stages. Laboratory tests may detect it before it becomes overt, where as physical examination picks up on the problem only after it is causing symptoms.

\subsection*{2.9 Definitions Summary}
- Requirement : The amount of a nutrient that will maintain normal biochemical and physiological functions and prevent the development of specific deficiency signs, distinguished from the RDA, which is a recommended and generous allowance that provided for variability among individuals.
- Deficient: The amount of a nutrient below which almost all healthy people can be expected, overtime, to experience deficiency symptoms
- Upper safe margin: The amount of a nutrient that appears safe for most healthy people and beyond which there is concern that some people will experience toxicity symptoms.
- Nutrition Assessment: A comprehensive approach completed by a nutritionist/dietician, to defining nutrition status that uses health, socioeconomic, diet history, anthropometric measurements, physical examination and laboratory tests.
- Overt: Out in the open and easy to observe
- Primary deficiency: A nutrient deficiency caused by inadequate dietary intake of a nutrient.
- Secondary deficiency: A nutrient deficiency caused by something other than diet, such as a disease condition that reduces absorption, accelerates use, hastens excretion or destroys the nutrient.
- Sub clinical deficiency: A deficiency in the early stages, before the outward signs have appeared.
- Covert: hidden as if under covers
- Food consumption Survey: A survey that measures the amounts and kinds of foods people consume (using diet histories) estimates the nutrient intakes, and compares them with a standard such as the RDA.
- Nutritional status survey: A survey that evaluates people's nutrition status using diet histories, anthropometric measures, physical examinations and laboratory tests.
- Chronic diseases: Degenerative diseases characterized by deterioration of the body organs, also called chronic, non communicable diseases, e.g. heart disease,
cancer and diabetes.

\subsection*{2.6 Activity}
1. Compare the purpose of the Dietary Guidelines to that of the RDAs.
2. Discuss the methods you would use to determine the nutrition status of an individual. Illustrate this with a specific example.

\subsection*{2.7 Questions}
1. List the methods of nutrition research
2. What is a control group?
3. What is a placebo?
4. What is a double-blind study?

\subsection*{2.8 Summary}

In this lesson we learnt uses of scientific methods to understand the relationship between food and the nutrient needs of the body. The scientific methods involve the observation of natural events, experimentation to test the hypotheses, and the development of theories that explain the observed phenomenon based on the outcome of the experiments.
Science of nutrition uses many different types of experimental approaches to determine nutrient function and requirements.

\section*{LESSON 3}

\section*{PLANNING A HEALTHY DIET}

\subsection*{3.0 INTRODUCTION}

Dietary standards are guidelines for the amounts of essential nutrients that must be produced in the diet to avoid nutritional deficiencies in the population. They are designed to meet the needs of the majority of healthy persons. As a result, dietary standards are not dietary requirements. Their recommendations exceed the requirements for most individuals because they are designed to suggest intakes at which practically no one will suffer a deficiency.

\subsection*{3.1 OBJECTIVES:}

By the end of this lesson the student will be able to:
1. State the principles of diet planning.
2. Identify tools which have been developed for planning individual diets.
3. List the types of information included on food labels

\subsection*{3.2 Diet Planning Principles}

Diet planners have developed several ways of selecting foods. Whatever plan or combination of plans they use, they keep in mind the six basic diet planning principles.
1. Adequacy
2. Balance
3. K calorie (energy) control
4. Nutrient density
5. Moderation
6. Variety

\begin{abstract}
Adequacy
RDA is all about adequacy. An adequate diet provides sufficient energy and enough of all nutrients to meet the needs of healthy people. For example: - Iron, each day the body loses some iron, so people have to replace it by eating foods that contain iron. A person whose diet fails to provide enough iron rich foods may develop the symptoms of irondeficiency anemia. The person may feel weak, tired, and listless, have frequent headaches, and find even the smallest amount of muscular work very tasking. To prevent these deficiency symptoms, diet planners must include foods that supply adequate iron.
\end{abstract}

\section*{Balance}

The essential minerals calcium and iron, taken together, illustrate the importance of dietary balance. Meats, fish and poultry are rich in iron, but poor in calcium. Whereas milk and milk products are rich in calcium but poor in iron. Milk and milk products
except breast milk are very low in iron; dependence on them can lead to iron-deficiency anemia.
The art of balancing the diet involves using enough, but not too much of each type of food. Use some meat or meat alternatives for iron, use some milk and milk products for calcium, but also save some space for other foods for other nutrients e.g. vegetables, fruits, grains.

\section*{K calorie (Energy Control)}

Diets should not include too much or too little energy foods, but just enough to meet an individual's needs.

\section*{Nutrient Density}

The food guide provides a strong foundation for a healthy diet but does not explain the nutrient density of some foods such as processed food. To eat well without overeating, select foods that deliver the most nutrients for the least food energy. For examplecalcium, you can get about 300 milligrams of calcium from either 45 grams of cheddar cheese or 250 ml or 1 cup of milk. Milk will provide exactly same amount of calcium as cheese but less k calories or a glass of coke and a bowl of watermelon. Each provides 150 k calories, but the water melon offers a little protein, some vitamins, minerals and fiber along with energy, the coke beverage offers only "empty" k calories. Water melon or any fruit is more nutrient dense than carbonated beverages.

\section*{Moderation}

Foods rich in fat and sugar provide enjoyment and energy but have relatively few nutrients, in excess promote weight gain. These foods should therefore be eaten in moderation.

\section*{Variety}

People should select foods from each of the food groups daily. People also vary the choices within each food group from day to day for several reasons.
1. Different foods within the same food group contain different nutrients. For example among fruits, strawberries are very high in vitamin C while watermelon is richer in vitamin A.
2. "Variety is the spice of life". Even if a person eats beans frequently, the person can choose pinto beans, chick peas etc. to include variety in recipes to avoid monotony.

\subsection*{3.2 Diet-Planning Guides}

To plan the above diets planners need tools. Two of the most commonly used tools are food groups and exchange lists.

\subsection*{3.2.1 Food Group Plans}

These are Diet-planning tools that sort foods of similar origin and nutrient content into groups and then specify that people should eat certain number of servings from each group.
* FOOD GUIDE PYRAMID
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_79a58ce87a4537b574cfg-26.jpg?height=1221&width=1636&top_left_y=379&top_left_x=304)

Five food groups:-
- Breads, cereals, and other grain products and staples.
- Vegetables
- Fruits
- Meat, poultry, fish and alternatives.
- Milk, cheese and yoghurt.

\section*{Miscellaneous foods}

Synthetic drinks e.g. chocolate drink, salad dressing, jams etc. do not fit into any food group. They mostly provide too much sugar or fat. Such foods should be used sparingly.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_79a58ce87a4537b574cfg-27.jpg?height=1191&width=1565&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=340)

The six divisions of a pyramid are divided into 3 main categories of energy $1,600,2,200$, and 2,800 as follows:
- The 1600 k calories plan assumes a total of 53 grams fat and 6 teaspoons of added sugar.
- The 2200 k cal plan assumes a total of 73 grams of fat and allows 12 teaspoons of added sugar.
- The 2800 k cal plan assumes a total of 93 grams of fat and allows 18 teaspoons of added sugar.

\subsection*{3.3.1 Serving Sizes \\ What is a serving?}
- The answer differs for each food within a group.
- Servings may not represent the amounts people actually put on their plates.

\section*{Major nutrients from each food group}

\section*{Breads, cereals, other grain and staples}

Complex carbohydrates, riboflavin, thiamine, niacin, iron, protein, magnesium, fiber.

\section*{Vegetables}

Vitamin A, vitamin C, folate, potassium, magnesium, and fiber have no fat or cholesterol.

\section*{Fruits}

Vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, and fiber. Have no sodium, fat and cholesterol.

\section*{Meat, Poultry, Fish and Alternatives}

Protein, phosphorous, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, zinc, magnesium, iron, niacin and thiamin.

\section*{Milk, Cheese, and Yoghurt}

Calcium, riboflavin, protein, Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}>$ fortified with vitamin D \& A

\section*{Fats, Sweets and Alcoholic Beverages}

Sugar, fat, alcohol and food energy.

\subsection*{3.3.2 Vegetarian Food Guide}

Vegetarian diets rely mainly on plant foods, grains, vegetables, legumes, fruits, seeds and nuts. Some vegetarian diets include milk and milk products and eggs.
- Vegetarians select meat alternatives for protein.
- Legumes help to supply iron and some from vegetable selections e.g. one cup of dark leafy greens.
- Vegetarians who do not take milk may lack adequate calcium and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.

\subsection*{3.3.3 Ethnic Food Guides}

Food guide pyramids may be developed for different cultures depending on the types of foods consumed. E.g. food mix squares for young children's foods.

\section*{MEAL PLAN FOR TODDLERS USING A FOOD SQUARE GUIDE}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\multirow{2}{*}{A Staple}} & \\
\hline & & B Proteins and Substitutes \\
\hline Cereals, Tubers Or Roots & Breast Milk & All legumes and animal foods \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{C} & D \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Vitamins and Minerals} & Energy \\
\hline Vegetables and Fruits & & Fats, Oils and Sugar \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

A guide for developing nutritious recipes for children should consider:
- Nutrient value
- Provide variety in the menu so as to include all nutrients.
- Same idea could be adopted for planning meals for the family and individuals depending on their needs.
- It is simple to use and construct, especially for the less educated.
- Includes locally produced foods

\section*{AMOUNTS OF FOODS TO OFFER}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Age & Texture & Frequency & Amount of food per meal \\
\hline 6-8 months & Start with thick porridge, well mashed foods. Continue with mashed family foods & \begin{tabular}{l}
2-3 meals per day plus frequent breastfeeds \\
Depending on the child's appetite 1-2 snacks may be offered
\end{tabular} & Start with 2-3 tablespoonfuls per feed increasing gradually to $1 / 2$ of a 250 ml cup \\
\hline 9-11 month & Finely chopped or mashed foods, and foods that baby can pick up & \begin{tabular}{l}
3-4 meals plus breastfeeds \\
Depending on the child's appetite 1-2 snacks may be offered
\end{tabular} & $1 / 2 \quad$ of a $\quad 250 \quad \mathrm{ml}$ cup/bowl \\
\hline 12-23 months & Family foods, chopped or mashed if necessary & \begin{tabular}{l}
3-4 meals plus breastfeeds \\
Depending on the child's appetite 1-2 snacks may be offered
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
$3 / 4$ to one 250 ml \\
cup/bowl
\end{tabular} \\
\hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{If baby is not breastfed, give in addition: 1-2 cups of milk per day, and 1-2 extra meals per day} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{3.3.4 Exchange Lists}

These are Diet planning tools that organize foods by their proportions of carbohydrates, fats, and protein. They were originally developed for people with diabetes. They are useful for general planning of diets.

\section*{* Portion Size.}

All the food portions in a given list provide approximately the same amount of energy nutrients (CHO, fat and protein, and the same number of calories.
- Portion sizes are strictly defined so that every item on a given list provides roughly the same amount of energy.
- Any food on a list can then be exchanged, or traded for any other food on the same list without affecting a plan's balance or total k calories.
- Food planner usually combines tools for a more adequate, nutritious diet based on variety.

\subsection*{3.3.5 Food Labels}

Food manufacturers are mandated to present nutrition information on food packages. According to law, every food label must prominently display and express in ordinary words:
1. The common or usual name of the product.
2. The name and address of the manufacturer, packer or distributor.
3. The net contents in terms of weight measure or count.
4. The ingredients in descending order of predominance by weight.
5. The serving size and number of servings per container.
6. The quantities of specified nutrients and food constituents.

\section*{* Ingredients List}
- All foods must list all ingredients on the label.
- Ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance by weight i.e. the first ingredient named is the one that predominates by weight.
- This way the consumer is able to tell which product is more nutrient dense e.g.
1. An orange powder - sugar, citric acid and orange flavor.

VS
Juice- water, tomato concentrate, concentrates of carrots and celery juice.
2. A canned fruit- sugar, apple, water

VS
Apple and water
- $2^{\text {nd }}$ choice is more nutrient dense
- Reference Daily Intake (RDI) values are based on 2500 k cal and 2000 k cal diet.

\section*{New labels include}
- Total food energy (k calories)
- Food energy from fat (k calories)
- Total fat (gms)
- Saturated fat (gm)
- Sodium (mg)
- Total carbohydrates (gm)
- Dietary fiber (gm)
- Sugars (gm)
- Protein (gm)

\section*{Other information}
- Vitamin A
- Vitamin C
- Iron
- Calcium

\subsection*{3.4 Health Claims}

Health claims are statements that describe an association between a specific nutrient or food substance and a specific health problem for example
- Reduce the risk of osteoporosis - Good source of calcium \& phosphorous
- Reduce hypertension/high blood pressure - "low sodium"
- Dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease - "low cholesterol)" low fat" "fat free".
- Fruits and vegetables and cancer - "good source of vitamin A, Vitamin C or dietary fiber.
Beware of claims that are not based on scientific studies.

\subsection*{3.5 Activity}

Keep a food record of everything you eat for three days, list next to each food the food group from the Food Guide Pyramid in which it belong and the number of servings you consumed. For mixed foods, list all food groups that apply. Compare the number of servings from each group that you consumed with the number recommended. Does your diet meet the guidelines of the Food Guide Pyramid?

\subsection*{3.6 Question}
1. State the key dietary planning principles give examples.
2. List four dietary planning tools and explain how you would use them in planning meals.

\subsection*{3.7 Summary}

In this lesson a variety of tools for planning individuals' diets have been discussed. The Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes variety and recommends the number of servings from each of the five major food groups needed to plan diets that avoid nutrient deficiencies and meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines. The food exchange list groups foods as carbohydrates, proteins and fats only. They are mostly used for planning patients diets. Other meal planning tools such as ethic food guide pyramids and food mix squares have also been suggested as alternatives. The use of food labels in planning meals has also been discussed.

\section*{LESSON 4}

\section*{CARBOHYDRATES}

\subsection*{4.0 INTRODUCTION}

Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread, and other grain-based products. Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Polysaccharides are often referred to as complex carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take slightly longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in blood glucose levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases which have become more frequent in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than formerly, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear, however.

Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-sugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients. However, the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient, starch, varies in its absorption. Gelatinized starch (starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water) is far more digestible than plain starch. And starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion. The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans. Additionally, up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty.

\subsection*{4.1 OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:
* Define carbohydrates
\$ State the basic units of carbohydrates and their sources.
* State the functions of carbohydrates.
* Describe the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates.

\subsection*{4.2 Carbohydrates- Chemical Structure}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Disaccharide & Description & Component monosaccharides \\
\hline Sucrose & common table sugar & glucose $1 \alpha \rightarrow 2$ fructose \\
\hline Maltose & product of starch hydrolysis & glucose $1 \alpha \rightarrow 4$ glucose \\
\hline Trehalose & found in fungi & glucose $1 \alpha \rightarrow 1$ glucose \\
\hline Lactose & main sugar in milk & galactose $1 \beta \rightarrow 4$ glucose \\
\hline Melibiose & found in legumes & galactose $1 \alpha \rightarrow 6$ glucose \\

\subsection*{4.2.3 Types of Complex Carbohydrates}

Complex carbohydrates contain many glucose units and a few other monosaccharides strung together as polysaccharides. Three are important in nutrition: glycogen, starch and fiber. Glycogen is a storage form of energy in the animal's body (human). Starch plays the same role in plants.

\section*{a. Oligosaccharides}
1. 3-10 mono's joined together
2. Two major ologo's
a. (galactose + glucose + fructose)
b. Starchyose (galactose + glucose + fructose)
3. Legumes (beans + nuts) and other vegetables

\section*{b. Polysaccharides}
1. Up to 3000 monosaccharides
2. Starches and glycogen

\section*{c. Dietary fiber}

Definition - consist of substances that cannot be digested in the stomach or small intestines because humans lack the enzyme necessary for digestion. Fiber can be categorized into two:

\section*{1. Insoluble fiber}
a. Don't dissolve in water for examples: Pure cellulose, hemicelluloses, Bran fiber and vegetable fiber.

\section*{2. Soluble fiber}
a. Dissolve or swell in $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for example Gums, pectin, guava, vegetables and fruits

\subsection*{4.6 Functions of Carbohydrates}
1. Homeostasis: Maintaining an equilibrium environment in the body e.g. glucose homeostasis- maintain blood glucose levels at $60-120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
2. Hypoglycemia: high concentration of glucose in the blood ( ${ }^{\wedge} 120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ )
3. Insulin: A hormone from the pancreas Insulin moves glucose into the cells therefore lowers blood glucose levels, also facilitates the storage of glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles.
4. Glucagon: A hormone from the pancreas, releases glucose from liver to raise blood glucose levels.
5. Gluconeogenesis: Liver makes glucose from protein and glycogen.
6. Ketosis: Rapid fat break-down in starvation and fasting. Causes imbalance in blood acid /base (PH)

\section*{Prevention of ketosis}
- Consume adequate starch and fiber
- Minimum of $50-100 \mathrm{~g}$ of CHO /day to prevent ketosis. Recommended $55-60 \%$ of calories from CHO (i.e. on 2000 kcal diet, $1,000-1,200 \mathrm{kcal}$ from CHO).
- $30 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of fiber from fruits, vegetables whole grains.

\section*{7. Available and Unavailable Carbohydrates}

Available: Simple sugars and starches are easily digested in the small intestines, they are joined by alpha bonds
Unavailable: Oligosaccharides and dietary fiber are not digestible in the small intestines. They are joined by beta bonds
- Glycogen from muscles is used only for muscle activity.
- Glycogen from liver used by the rest of the body.

\subsection*{4.7 Carbohydrates as Food}
1. Simple Sugars
a. Low nutrient density ( mostly calories - low in vitamins and minerals)
b. Low in fat and proteins.
c. Good source of energy
d. Not proven to cause hyperactivity, heart disease, diabetes
e. Does contribute to dental carries

\section*{2. Lactose}
a. Lactose is absent or low in $70 \%$ of adults.
b. Lactose - glucose + galactose

Lactose is bacterial digestion in the large intestines this causes gas, diarrhea and bloat experienced by people suffering from lactose intolerance.

\subsection*{4.8 Energy Source}

\section*{a. Energy Production}

The energy nutrients include:
1. CHO - glucose - energy
2. Fat - ketones - energy
3. Proteins - glucose - energy

\section*{b. Energy Needs}

Brain and Red blood cells depend on carbohydrates as a source of energy. They cannot use fat directly for energy. If CHO is low in diet protein is converted to glucose to provide energy.

\section*{c. Protein Conservation}

After several days of CHO deficiency (Starvation) the body uses fat for energy in order to spare proteins. Fat is broken down to form ketones which are used for energy. Ketones are made in liver. The Brain and red blood cells use some energy from ketones in time of energy deprivation. High levels of ketones in the blood can cause dehydration (ketosis) due to acidity from accumulation of ketones a condition refered to as ketosis.

\section*{d. Regulation of Glucose}

Blood glucose levels:
1. Normal levels $70-120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
2. Hyperglycemia $>170 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
3. Hypoglycemia $<40-5-\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$

\section*{e. Hormonal regulation}

Insulin
1. Secreted when blood glucose is high
2. Allows glucose into cells
3. Excess glucose is converted to glycogen in liver and muscles

\section*{Glucagon}

You are hungry (fasting state)
a. Blood glucose levels too low
b. Pancreas releases glucagon
1. Glycogen is broken down to glucose

\section*{2. Protein is used to make glucose}

\subsection*{4.9 SUGAR ALCOHOLS}

Nutritive sweeteners
a. Sorbitol
b. Manitol
c. Xylitol

They are metabolized to form glucose they therefore contribute energy.
Sorbitol is used as a sweetner by the food industry it is also used in confectioneries such as gums, candy, mint etc.

\section*{Other sweeteners include:}
a. Saccharin
b. Aspartame (180-200x sweet)
c. Acesulfame

These are non-nutritive in that they do not contribute any energy even though they are many times sweeter than the regular sugar.

\subsection*{4.10 FIBER}

Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate (or a polysaccharide) that is completely not absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea.
- Found in plant foods, vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes.
- Are polysaccharides

\subsection*{4.10.1 Types of Fibers}

Cellulose is the primary constituent of plant cell walls and therefore occurs in all vegetables, fruits and legumes.
- It is made up of glucose molecules connected in long chains.
- The chains do not branch
- Are held together by beta bonds
- Are therefore indigestible by human enzymes.

Hemicelluloses - are the main constituents of cereal fiber.
- Are composed of various monosaccharides with branching side chains.
- Some are soluble and others insoluble depending on the arrangements of the chains.

Pectins - consist of a backbone of carbohydrate with side chains of monosaccharide.
- Found mainly in vegetables and fruits especially citrus fruits and apples.
- Pectins can be isolated and used by food industry to thicken jam, keep salad dressing from separating and control texture and consistency
- Pectins can perform many functions because they readily form gels in water.

\section*{Gums and mucilage's}
- Are secreted by cut branch of a plant.
- Are composed of various monosaccharide and their derivative.
- Gums e.g gum Arabic are used as additives by food industry.
- Mucilages are similar to gums in structure e.g. guar and carrageen.
- Are added to foods as stabilizers.

Lignin - Has a 3 - dimensional structure that gives strength
- Because of its toughness it is rarely consumed by people.
- It is found in the woody parts of vegetables e.g. carrots or small seeds of fruit e.g. strawberries.

\section*{Soluble fibers}
- Gums
- Pectins
- Some hemicellulses
- Mucilages

\section*{Insoluble fiber}
cellulose
many hemicelluloses
lignins

\subsection*{4.10.2 Soluble Fibers}

Found mostly in fruits, oats, barley, and legumes

\section*{Functions}
- Delay the stomach's emptying and the transit of chyme through the intestines.
- Delay glucose absorption
- Lower blood cholesterol

\subsection*{4.10.3 Insoluble Fibers}

Found mostly in vegetables, wheat and cereals.

\section*{Functions}
- Accelerate the transit of chyme through the intestines.
- Increase fecal weight
- Slow starch breakdown and delay glucose absorption into the blood.

\section*{Both soluble and insoluble fiber;}
- Influence transit time and nutrient absorption in the GI tract.
- Are partially fermented by micro organisms in the digestive tract to fragments that the body can use.
- Other physical properties of fibers that affect the GI function and nutrient absorption.
1. Water holding capacity - the capacity to capture water like a sponge, swelling and increasing the bulk of the intestine's contents.
2. Viscosity - the capacity to form viscous, gel-like solutions
3. Cation - exchange capacity - the ability to bind minerals.
4. Bile - binding capacity - the ability to bind bile.
5. Ferment ability - the extent to which bacteria can ferment them in the digestive tract.

Phytic acid - A non nutrient component of plant seeds, also called phytate. Found in the husks of grains, legumes, and seeds and is capable of binding minerals e.g. zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium and copper.

\subsection*{4.10.4 Health benefits of Fiber}

Recommended Adequate amounts of fiber are 20-35 grams per day
- Enhances weight control
- Lowers blood cholesterol
- Helps prevent colon cancer
- Helps prevent and control diabetes
- Helps prevent and alleviate hemorrhoids
- Helps prevent appendicitis
- Helps prevent diverticulitis

\section*{Excess fiber}
- Displaces energy and nutrient dense foods
- Causes intestinal discomfort and distention
- Interferes with mineral absorption

\section*{Glycemic Effect}

The term glycemic effect describes the effect of food on blood glucose
1. That is how quickly glucose is absorbed after a person eats,
2. how high glucose rises and
3. How quickly it returns to normal.

Fast absorption, a quick rise in blood glucose, and an overreaction that forces glucose below normal are undesirable.
- Different foods have different glycemic index e.g. ice cream which is a sugar food, produces less response compared to potatoes a high starch food.
- It also differs depending on whether a food is eaten alone or as a mixed meal.
- Also eating small meals frequently spreads glucose absorption across the day, therefore has the same advantage as foods of low glycemic index.
- This information is very important for people with diabetes. Glycemic index should be included in meal planning to improve glucose control.

\subsection*{4.11 Components of Energy Expenditure}

Basal Metabolism takes up $2 / 3$ of total energy expenditure and is used for basic support of life processes. Metabolic activities include:
- Maintenance of body temperature
- Inhaling and exhaling air by lungs
- Bone marrow making red blood cells.
- Heart beating 100,000 times a day.
- Kidney filtering waste

\section*{Definitions}
- Basal metabolism: The energy needed to maintain life when a body is at complete rest.
- Basal metabolic rate (BMR): The rate at which the body spends energy for maintenance of the above activities. Expressed as kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per hour.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_79a58ce87a4537b574cfg-42.jpg?height=942&width=1007&top_left_y=1394&top_left_x=521)
4.11.1 Factors that Affect the BMR
1. Age- lean body mass diminishes with age, slowing the BMR
2. Height - in tall, thin people, the BRM is high
3. Growth - In children and pregnant women BMR is high.
4. Body composition - The more lean the tissue the higher the BMR, the more fat tissue, the lower BMR.
5. Fever-Fever raises BMR
6. Stresses - Stresses e.g. diseases raise BMR
7. Environmental Temperature - Both heat and cold raise the BMR
8. Fasting/Starvation - lowers BMR
9. Malnutrition-lowers BMR
10. Hormones - The thyroid hormone thyroxin, e.g. can speed or slow down the BMR
11. Smoking - Nicotine increases energy expenditure
12. Caffeine - increases energy expenditure
13. Sleep-BMR's lowest when sleeping

\subsection*{4.11.2 Physical Activity}

The second component of energy expenditure is physical activity, for example, voluntary movement of skeletal muscles. Levels of activity influence both weight gain and weight loss. The amount of energy needed depends on 3 factors:
1. Muscle mass
2. Body weight
3. Activity

The activity's duration, frequency and intensity also influence energy cost. The longer, the more frequent and the more kilocalories spent per minute.

\subsection*{4.11.3 Thermic Effect of Food}

The body uses some energy to process food. Digestion uses at least $10 \%$ of energy intake as thermic effect of food (i.e. heat produced during the digestive activities) e.g. if a person ingests 2000 kcal he will spend 200 kcal on thermic effect of food.

\subsection*{4.11.4 Adaptive Thermogenesis}

Some additional energy is spent when a person has to adapt to dramatic changes. For example, cold, overfeeding, starvation, trauma, stress, extra work, building tissues, producing enzymes and hormones. This energy varies with individuals and therefore is not included in basal of energy expenditure.

\subsection*{4.11 Estimating Energy Requirement}

In calculating energy RDA all the components of energy must be included:
1. Energy spent on Basal Metabolism
2. Energy spent on physical activity
3. Energy spent on digestion and metabolism of food.

\subsection*{4.12 Body Weight, Body Composition and Health}

Body Composition - the proportions of muscle, bone, fat and other tissues that makes up a person's total body weight.
Researchers assess body composition indirectly based on the following assumption.
Body weight $=$ fat + lean tissue (including water)

\subsection*{4.13.1 Healthy Body Weight}
1. How much should a person weigh?
2. How can a person know if her weight is appropriate for her height and age?
3. How can a person know if his weight is jeopardizing his health?

\section*{Definition of Healthy Body Weight}
- A weight within the suggested range for height as shown by a standard weight table e.g. 5'4" over 35 year's midpoint 140 ranges 122-157.
- A fat distribution pattern that is associated with a low risk of illness and death.
- Freedom from all medical conditions that would suggest a need for weight loss e.g. diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, obesity.

\section*{Body Mass Index}
$$\frac{\text { BMI }=\text { weight }(\mathrm{kg})}{\text { Height }(\mathrm{m})^{2}}$$
- $\mathrm{BMI}<20=$ underweight
- BMI 20-25 = normal
- BMI 25-30 = overweight
- BMI > = obese

\section*{Advantages}

Weight measures are inexpensive, easy to take and highly accurate.

\section*{Disadvantage}

Do not indicate weight of fat and where fat is located.

\section*{Body Fat and Its Distribution}

Men $\quad 10-25 \%$ body fat
Women 18-32\% body fat

\subsection*{4.13.2 Measurements for FAT}

\section*{Fat Fold Measures:}

Skin fold test is a clinical estimate of total fatness in which the thickness of a fold of skin on the back of the arm (over the triceps muscle), below the shoulder blade (sub scapular) or in other places is measured with a caliper.

\section*{Waist - Hip - Ratio}

To calculate waist to hip ratio, divide the waistline measurement by the hip measurement. E.g. a woman with a 28 "waist and 38 "hips would have a ratio of: $28 / 38=0.74$

In general, women with a ratio of 0.80 or greater and men with a ratio of 0.95 or greater are at high risk of obesity related health problems.
\begin{tabular}{|llll|}
\hline Women & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Ratio \\
$\geq 0.8$
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Implication \\
high risk
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Men \\
$\geq 0.95$
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{4.13.3 Other measures of Body Composition.}

\section*{1. Hydrodensitometry}
- A method of measuring body density in which the person is first weighed and then submerged in water. Researchers through a mathematical equation are able to estimate the percentage of body fat.
- Advantages
- More accurate, useful in research.
- Disadvantages
- Bulky, expensive, and non potable equipment required.
- Clientele to be measured limited not good for very young, very old ill or fearful people.

\section*{2. Bioelectrical Impedance Technique}

A very low intensity electrical current is briefly sent through the body by way of electrodes placed on the wrist and ankle.
- The leaner the person the less resistance to the current.
- A mathematical equation is used to estimate the percentage of fat.

\subsection*{4.14 Health Risks Associated with Body Weight and Fat}
- Underweight associated with malnutrition, less resistance to disease, decreased healing process.
- Underweight women can be infertile, have underweight infants, premature deliveries babies bone with defects.
- Energy intake - necessary for milk production needs 650 kilocalories per day over regular RDA
- Severe energy restriction - reduces milk production.

\subsection*{4.15 DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF CARBOHYDRATES}

\subsection*{4.15.1 Digestion}

Mouth: Salivary amylase starts to hydrolyze starch to shorter polysaccharides and to maltose.
Stomach: Salivary enzyme amylase is digested by protein digesting enzymes. Starch is therefore not digested because there are no enzymes to digest CHO. Fibers delay gastric emptying. This provides a feeling of fullness and satiety.
Small intestine: Pancreatic amylase enters the intestine via the pancreatic duct and continues breaking down the polysaccharides to shorter glucose chains and disaccharides. The final step takes place on the outer membranes of the intestinal cells.

\section*{Enzymes action}
- Maltase - breaks maltose into 2 glucose molecules.
- Sucrase - breaks sucrose into 1 glucose and 1 fructose molecule.
- Lactase - breaks lactose into 1 glucose and 1 galactose molecule.
- Fructose and galactose are processed in the liver to form glucose.
- Fibers delay the absorption of carbohydrates and fats in the small intestines
- Fiber in the intestines binds minerals.
- Can cause a risk of deficiency, this can be kept minimal when fiber is taken in moderation.

\section*{Large intestine}
- Within 1 to 4 hours after a meal all sugars and most starches are digested. Bacteria in the intestines tract ferment fibers.
- This process generates water, gas and short - chain fatty acids.
- Short-chain fatty acids are absorbed in the colon and are used for energy.
- Fiber contributes up to $15 \%$ of the daily food energy.

\subsection*{4.15.2 Absorption into the Blood Stream}
- Glucose can be absorbed in the mouth.
- Monosacchorides are absorbed into the cells lining the small intestines by active transport and are taken up in the blood circulation.
- Liver - fructose and galactose are converted to glucose and other compounds.

\subsection*{4.16 Lactose Intolerance}

Normally the enzyme lactase is responsible for the digestion and efficient absorption of lactose a dissacharide found in milk. Lactase levels are highest after birth to digest milk which is the first and only food for infants. Lactase activity declines dramatically during childhood and adolescence to about 5 to $10 \%$ of the activity at birth.
Lactose intolerance is a condition that results from inability to digest the milk sugar lactose; characterized by bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. Lactose intolerance differs from milk allergy, which is caused by an immune reaction to the protein in milk.

Symptoms of less lactase to handle the lactose hydrolysis are:
- The undigested molecules attract water and cause bloating, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea.
- The undigested lactose also becomes food for intestinal bacteria, which multiply and produce irritating acid and gas, contributing further to discomfort and diarrhea.

\section*{Causes}
- Lactase deficiency
- Intestinal villi:
- damaged by disease
- Certain medicines
- Prolonged diarrhea
- Malnutrition
- Born with a lactase deficiency

\section*{Prevalence}

The prevalence of lactose intolerance varies widely among ethnic groups, indicating that the trait is genetically determined.

\section*{Dietary changes for management of lactose intolerance.}
- Excluding milk and milk products can lead to nutrient deficiencies e.g. calcium and $\mathrm{B}_{2}$.
- Most people can tolerate a small amount of milk with meals.
- Most people can tolerate- fermented milk products e.g. yoghurt and cheeses. The bacteria in these foods digest lactose for their own use.

\section*{Glucose}
- Primary role is to supply energy to body cells.
- Glucose plays a central role in carbohydrate metabolism.

Glucose is stored as glycogen.
Liver - stores $1 / 3$ of the body's total glycogen.
- Glycogen is hydrolyzed to supply energy to the central nervous system and other organs regardless of whether a person has eaten or not.

Muscle cells - store 2/3 of the body's total glycogen.
- Glycogen holds water, it is therefore bulky. It can only be stored for short periods of time.

\section*{Making glucose from protein}
- When glycogen stores are depleted, body proteins are broken down to make glucose.
- This process is referred to as gluconeogenesis.
- Only enough CHO can prevent this use of protein for energy.
- This role of CHo is known as its protein sparing action.

\section*{Making ketone bodies from fat}
- Low glucose leads to fat use.
- Fat is broken down to provide energy in the presence of glucose, this ensures complete breakdown of fat.
- But when glucose is absent fat breakdown is not complete and forms ketone bodies.
- Muscles and tissues can use ketone bodies for energy.
- When their production exceeds their use, they accumulate in the body to and cause ketosis.
To ensure complete sparing of protein and prevent ketosis requires $50-100 \mathrm{gms}$ of carbohydrate a day

\section*{Converting glucose to fat}

Liver breaks extra glucose into smaller molecules and then puts them together to form fat. Then fat travels to the fatty tissues of the body for storage. Fat cells can store unlimited amounts of fat.

\section*{Maintaining glucose homeostasis}

Normal blood glucose is $80-120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$. Blood glucose level is regulated by 2 hormones, insulin and glycogen.

\section*{Insulin}
1. High blood glucose stimulates the pancreas to release insulin.
2. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into cells and storage as glycogen in the liver and muscle.
3. Insulin also stimulates the conversion of excess glucose into fat for storage.
4. Blood glucose begins to decline.

\section*{Glucagon}
1. Low blood glucose stimulates the pancreas to release glucagon into the blood stream.
2. Glucagon stimulates liver cells to breakdown glycogen and release glucose into the blood, blood glucose begins to rise.

\section*{Other hormones.}

Stress hormone epinephrine and other hormones also bring glucose out of storage.

\section*{Balancing within normal range}
- Eating balanced meals helps maintain a happy medium between extremes.
- Balanced meals provide abundant complex CHO , fibers and protein and a little fat. The fibers and fat slow down the digestion and absorption of CHO, so that glucose enters the blood gradually, proving a steady supply.
- Dietary proteins stimulate the secretion of glucagon, whose effects oppose those of insulin helping maintain blood glucose within normal range.

\section*{Diabetes or hypoglycemia}

Caused by inability to regulate blood glucose.
In insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM)
The pancreas does not produce insulin - causes
- Genetics
- Toxins
- Virus
- Disorder of immune system

In non insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), cells fail to produce insulin causing obesity. Fat cells resist insulin.
Dietary control - low fat, complex carbohydrates and fiber, limited sugars Spreading total food intake over many meals and snacks a day without an increase in energy intake is a relatively easy and effective way to lower blood cholesterol.
Cholesterol becomes harmful when it forms deposits in the artery walls. The deposit leads to atherosclerosis, a disease that causes heart attacks and strokes.

\subsection*{4.17 Definition Summary}

Homeostasis: Maintaining an equilibrium environment in the body e.g. glucose homeostasis- maintain blood glucose levels at $60-120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
Hyperglycemia: high concentration of glucose in the blood ( $\wedge 120 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ )
Insulin: A hormone from the pancreas.
Glucagon: A hormone from the pancreas, releases glucose from liver to raise blood glucose levels.
Gluconeogenesis: Liver makes glucose from protein and glycogen.
Ketosis: Rapid fat break-down in starvation and fasting.
Basal metabolism: The energy needed to maintain life when a body is at complete rest.
Basal metabolic rate (BMR): The rate at which the body spends energy for maintenance of the above activities.
Body composition - the proportions of muscle, bone, fat and other tissues that makes up a person's total body weight.

\subsection*{4.18 Question}
1. State the different classes of carbohydrates.
2. What are considered to be the normal range of glucose and which are the hormones responsible for maintaining it?
3. What are the health benefits of fibre discuss this giving specific example?
4. How is energy expenditure calculated and what are some of the health risks associated with too much energy intake?
5. What are the enzymes involved in the digestion of carbohydrates? Why are some
carbohydrates digestible and others are not?
6. What is lactose intolerance?

\subsection*{4.19 Activity}

If your diet contains less than the recommended 55 to 60\% of energy from carbohydrate, suggest some high carbohydrate alternative to your low-carbohydrate.
Discuss the health condition that is associated with poor regulation of blood glucose levels.

\subsection*{4.20 Summary}

In Lesson four we learnt that Carbohydrates are chemical compounds that contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. In food, they include sugars, starches and fibers. Simple carbohydrates include monosaccharides and disaccharides and are found in foods like table sugar, honey, milk and fruit. Complex carbohydrates are polysaccharides and include glycogen in animals and starches and fiber in plants. We learned about the health benefits of fibre. We also looked at different ways energy is utilized and calculated. Discussed also was the digestion of carbohydrates.

\section*{LESSON 5}

\section*{LIPIDS}

\subsection*{5.0 INTRODUCTION}

Lipids are organic compounds, most of which do not dissolve in water. Lipids are the body's most concentrated source of stored energy, providing 9kcalories per gram. They are an important structural component of cells, particularly in the brain and nervous system. As a component of all cell membranes, lipids protect the internal environment of cells. The layer of adipose tissue that lies under the skin and around internal organs protects the body from changes in temperatures and provides a cushion to protect against shock. Lipids help transport fat soluble substances such as vitamins A, E and D through the intestinal tract and bloodstream. They are needed for the synthesis of hormones that regulate body function.

\subsection*{5.1 OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* State the difference between lipids and fats.
* Differentiate between saturated fatty acid and unsaturated
* Discuss the role of lipids in the body.
* State the functions of fat in the diet.

\subsection*{5.2 Definitions}

Fats are lipids that are solid at room temperature. Oils are lipids that are liquid at room temperature. They dissolve in chloroform, benzene, and ether but not in water. Lipids contain fewer oxygen atoms per carbon atom compared to carbohydrates and proteins. They have more kilocalories per gram (9) compared to carbohydrates (4) or protein (4). Trigycerides are the main form of fat in food

\subsection*{5.3 Types of Fatty Acids}

Saturated fatty acids- refers to a fatty acid in which the carbon atoms are bound to as many hydrogens as possible and therefore contains no carbon - carbon double bond e.g. .stearic
Unsaturated Fatty acids- refers to a fatty acid that contains one or more carbon-carbon double bonds e.g. monounsaturated fatty acid contains one carbon-carbon double bond e.g. oleic acid - olive oil, while polyunsaturated fatty acid contains two or more carbon carbon double bond e.g. linoleic and linolenic acid, corn, soybean and sunflower are good sources. Omega - 3 ( $\omega-3$ ) fatty acid has a double bond at the $3^{\text {rd }}$ carbon - e.g. linolenic acid e.g. fish oils. Omega-6 ( $\omega-6$ ) fatty acid has a double bond at the sixth carbon e.g. linoleic acid. Omega - 3 and omega - 6 are essential fatty acids.

\subsection*{5.3.1 Functions of lipids}
- Form part of vital structures in the body - growth
- Take part in immune system and vision
- Form cell membrane
- Make hormone - like compounds - eicosanoids.

\subsection*{5.4 Essential Fatty Acids}

These are fatty acids that must be present in the diet to maintain health because they cannot be synthesized by the body in adequate amount. They include linoleic found in vegetable oil, arachidonic found in both animal and vegetable fats and alpha-linolenic acids found in vegetable oils.
RDA- $10 \% \mathrm{kcal}$, of essential fatty acid should come from poly-unsaturated fat.

\subsection*{5.4.1 Essential Fatty Acids Deficiency}

This is a condition that results when the diet does not supply sufficient amounts of linoleic, arachidonic or alpha-linolenic acid. Symptoms such as flaky, itchy, sore skin, diarrhea and retarded growth may occur.

\subsection*{5.5 Triglycerides}

These are the major form of lipids in food and the major storage form of lipid in the body. They form $95 \%$ of fat in the body and food. They consist of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule.

General structure of a triglyceride
triacylglycerol

The chemical formula is $\mathbf{R C O O -} \mathbf{C H}_{\mathbf{2}} \mathbf{C H}\left(-\mathrm{OOCR}{ }^{\prime}\right) \mathbf{C H}_{2}-\mathrm{OOCR}{ }^{\prime \prime}$, where $\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{R}^{\prime}$, and $\mathrm{R}^{\prime \prime}$ are longer alkyl chains. The three fatty acids RCOOH,

Esterification /Condensation- The process of putting together 1 glycerol molecule +3 fatty acids to form a Triglyceride.

\section*{Functions of Triglycerides}
- Unlimited storage of energy
- Main source of energy for muscles
- $40 \%$ of energy used by the body at rest.
- Insulates and protects the body organs (adipose tissue)
- Transports fat - soluble vitamins (A, D, E AND K)

\subsection*{5.6 Phospholipids}

They are lipids with a phosphorus-containing group called a phosphate group.
1. E.g. lecithins are important components of all cell membranes.
2. They participate in the digestion of fat in the intestines.
3. Are non-essential

\subsection*{5.7 Sterols - Cholesterol}
- Found in animal foods only
- Makes some hormones e.g. vitamin D
- An essential part of the cell
<smiles>CC(=O)OC1CCC2(C)C(=CCC3C2CCC2(C)C(C(C)CCCC(C)C)CCC32)C1</smiles>

\section*{Cholesterol and lecithin}
- Made by the body are non-essential
- Cholesterol needed for Synthesis of steroid hormones e.g. estrogen testosterone, vitamin D calcitriol
- Bile salts - fat emulsification
- Part of the cell structure.
- Too much cholesterol is associated with heart disease and cancer.

\section*{Cell membrane + phosphor lipids}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_79a58ce87a4537b574cfg-55.jpg?height=899&width=1443&top_left_y=491&top_left_x=306)

\section*{Constituents of the lipoprotein}

\subsection*{5.8 Lipoproteins}

Lipids are transported in the blood attached to a protein.
LDL - cholesterol
HDL - cholesterol

Chylomicrons contain so little protein and so much triglycerides that they are lowest in density.
- VLDL are half triglycerides accounting for their low density.
- LDL are half cholesterol, accounting for their implication in heart disease.
- HDL are half protein accounting for their high density

\section*{Low density lipoproteins}
- Associated with atherosclerosis
- Heart disease

Fats have a high satiety value compared to carbohydrates. Hydrogenation of fatty acids is when hydrogens are added at the double bonds to make the fat solid e.g. margarine and other shortenings. Makes trans fatty acids which are associated with cancer. Palm oil and coconut oil are saturated fats but do not contain cholesterol.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_79a58ce87a4537b574cfg-56.jpg?height=619&width=1036&top_left_y=1260&top_left_x=322)

The chart above shows the effects of individual dietary fatty acids on Total Serum Cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol when $1 \%$ of the energy from carbohydrates in the diet is replaced by $1 \%$ of energy of the specific fatty acids. The chart shows cholesterol increases from lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), and palmitic acid (C16:0) which are found in coconut oil, palm oil, and butter. Elaidic acid (transC18:1), which is present in hydrogenated fats, is the worst because it increases LDL and decreases HDL. The saturated fatty acid stearic acid (C18:0), the monounsaturated oleic acid (C18:1), and the polyunsaturated linoleic acid (C18:2) decrease LDL and increase HDL to various degrees.

\section*{Emulsifacation}

Phospholipids and cholesterol act as emulsifiers in digestion and also in fats and oils in foods e.g. salad dressings.

\section*{RDA for fat}
- There is no RDA for fat.
- Recommended intake is 20-30\% of total kcal.
- Cholesterol >300 mg/day

Concentration of Fat in foods:
Highest nutrient dense for fat
$100 \%$-salad oils, butter, margarine and mayonnaise
$80 \%$ - walnuts, bologna, avocados, bacon
$75 \%$ - peanut butter and cheddar cheese
60 \% - steak, hamburgers
$50 \%$ - chocolate bars ice-cream, doughnuts, whole milk.
35 \% - pumpkin pie, cupcake
15 \% - bread

\section*{Rancidity}
- Unsaturated fatty acids are easily oxidized. Produce unpleasant flavors and odors.
- Vitamins E is a natural antioxidant found in polyunsaturated fats.
- BHA and BHT are added to fats as antioxidants (burylated hydroxynisol and bury lated hydroxyl-toluene)

A cis configuration means that adjacent hydrogen atoms are on the same side of the double bond. The rigidity of the double bond freezes its conformation and, in the case of
the cis isomer, causes the chain to bend and restricts the conformational freedom of the fatty acid. The more double bonds the chain has in the cis configuration, the less flexibility it has. When a chain has many cis bonds, it becomes quite curved in its most accessible conformations. For example, oleic acid with one double bond, has a "kink" in it, whereas linoleic acid, with two double bonds, has a more pronounced bend. Alphalinolenic acid, with three double bonds, favors a hooked shape. The effect of this is that, in restricted environments, such as when fatty acids are part of a phospholipid in a lipid bilayer, or triglycerides in lipid droplets, cis bonds limit the ability of fatty acids to be closely packed, and therefore could affect the melting temperature of the membrane or of the fat.

\section*{trans}

A trans configuration, by contrast, means that the next two hydrogen atoms are bound to opposite sides of the double bond. As a result, they do not cause the chain to bend much, and their shape is similar to straight saturated fatty acids.

In most naturally-occurring unsaturated fatty acids, each double bond has three $n$ carbon atoms after it, for some n , and all are cis bonds. Most fatty acids in the trans configuration (trans fats) are not found in nature and are the result of human processing (e.g., hydrogenation).

\subsection*{5.11 Digestion, Absorption and Transport of Lipids}

On average the GI receives 50 to 100 gms of triglyceride per day, 4 to 8 grams of phospholipids and 300 to 450 mg of cholesterol.

\subsection*{5.11.1 Lipid Digestion}

The goal is to breakdown triglycerides into small molecules that the body can absorb and use, for example monoglycerides, fatty acids and glycerol.

\section*{Mouth}
- Starts off slowly in the mouth.
- Salivary glands at the base of the tongue release a lipase enzyme that plays a small role in fat digestion; this enzyme is more active in infants than adults. In infants this enzyme efficiently digests the short and medium - chain fatty acids found in milk.

\section*{Stomach}

Little fat digestion - floats on top of the other food components.

\section*{Small intestines}
- When fat enters the small intestine, the hormone cholecystokin (CKK) signals the gall bladder to release its stores of bile an emulsifier.
- Liver manufactures bile acids from cholesterol, and the gall bladder stores the bile until it is needed.
- At the end of each bile acid are side chains of amino acids and at the other end is a sterol portion that is attracted to fat. Bile draws fat molecules into the surrounding watery fluids. There, the fats meet lipase enzymes from the pancreas and small intestine and are fully digested.

\section*{Emulsification of fat by bile}
1. In the stomach, the fat and water GI juices tend to separate. The enzymes are in the water and can't get at the fat.
2. When fat enters the small intestines, the gall bladder secrets bile. Bile has an affinity for both fat and water, so it can bring the fat into solution in the water.
3. After emulsification, the fat is mixed in the water solution, so the enzymes have access to it.

Bile contains acids and salts, cholesterol, phospholipids (leathin) antibodies, water electrolytes and bilirubi (a pigment from breakdown of hemi.
The fibers that are most effective in lowering cholesterol are the soluble pectin and gums found in fruits, oats and legumes.

\subsection*{5.11.2 Lipid Absorption}
- Glycerol, shortchain and medium chain fatty acids diffuse into the intestinal cells, are absorbed directly into the blood stream.
- Larger units, the monoglycerides, and long-chain fatty acids, merge into complexes, called micelles. The micelles easily diffuse into the intestinal cells. Once inside the monoglycerides + long chain fatty acids are reassembled into new triglycerides.
- In the intestinal walls the triglycerides and other large lipids (cholesterol and phospholipids) are packed into transport vehicles known as chylomicrons. The intestinal cells then release the chylomicrons into the lymphatic system.

\subsection*{5.11.3 Lipid Transportation}
- Lipids are transported in the blood as lipoproteins.
- There are four different kinds of lipoproteins they differ in amounts of various components.
- Chylomicrons - transport lipids to liver. Special receptors on membranes of liver cells recognize and remove the lipids from the blood.
- In the liver the chylomicrons are broken down. VLDL - very low density lipoproteins (high in triglycerides)
- The liver picks up the fatty acids arriving from the blood and use them to make
- Cholesterol
- Other fatty acids
- Other compounds.

Liver cells also make lipids from CHO , proteins and alcohol.
Liver is the most active site of lipid synthesis.
- The lipids in liver are then packed with proteins to make very-low densitylipoproteins (VLDL)
- VLDL travel through the body.
- The cells remove triglycerides causing VLDL to shrink.
- VLDL gather cholesterol from other lipoproteins circulating in the blood stream and eventually become LDL-low-density-lipoprotein.

\section*{LDL}

Made from VLDL and are high in cholesterol.
- Circulates in the blood, making their contents available to the cells of all tissues e.g. muscle, including heart muscle, fat stores, mammary glands and others.
- The cells take triglycerides from LDLs.
- They also collect cholesterol and phospholipids to build:-
- New cell membranes.
- To make hormones
- To make other compounds.
- Or to store for later use.

LDLs are removed from circulation by special protein receptors on the membrane of liver cells.
HDL - high-density-lipoprotein
- Made primarily of protein.
- Fat cells may release glycerol, fatty acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids to the blood.
- The liver makes HDL packages to carry cholesterol and phospholipids from the cells back to the liver for recycling or disposal.
- HDL are healthy
- LDLs are less healthy.

\section*{Factors that improve the LDL to HDL ratio}
1. Weight control
2. Monounsaturated or polyunsaturated, instead of saturated, fatty acids in diet.
3. Soluble fibers
4. Antioxidants
5. Moderate alcohol consumption
6. Physical activity

\section*{Functions of Lipids in the body}
1. Provide energy
2. Insulating against extreme temperature
3. Protect against shock
4. Building cell structures.

\section*{Triglycerides in the blood}

Fat supplies energy for muscle activity and the heart muscle.
Lipids metabolism
Catabolic + anabolic process

\section*{Storing Fat as Energy}
- Fat provides more than 2 x the energy of CHO and fat, making it an extremely efficient storage form of energy.
- Body's storage for energy in adipose tissue is unlimited.
- Adipose cells have a special enzyme on their surface-lipase CLDL) that captures circulating triglycerides from lipoproteins.
- Hydrolyzes them to fatty acids and monoglycerides.
- Inside the cell the enzymes reassemble the pieces for storage.

\section*{Making fat from $\mathbf{C H O}$ or protein}

Special enzyme can convert CHO or protein to fat.

\section*{Efficiency of making fat from fat}
- Fats are more easily converted to fat as compared to CHO where the process in much longer and uses up energy.
- To limit fat storage therefore limit amount of fat intake.

\section*{Using Fat for Energy}
- Fat supplies $60 \%$ of the body's energy needs during rest.
- During exercise or prolonged periods of food deprivation fat stores may be used for energy needs.
- An enzyme, hormone-sensitive lipase inside the adipose cells breakdown the stored fat in form of triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids and releases them to the blood stream.
- Body fat cannot be broken down completely in the absence of glucose thus leading to ketosis.

\section*{Health Effects}
1. Heart disease if cholesterol is high.
2. Risks from saturated fats as they raise blood cholesterol.
3. Effects of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids.
-Lower LCL cholesterol.
-Polyunsaturated fatty lower both HDL and LDL.
-Monounsaturated fats raise HDL
4. Risks from trans-fatty acids since they raise LDL and lower HDL like some saturated fats.
5. Benefits from $\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ fatty acids.
- Improves lipid profile therefore improve blood lipids.
- Prevents blood clots
- Lower blood pressure especially in people with hypertension or atherosclerosis.
6. Cancer- dietary fat is linked to some types of cancer in animal studies.

Reduced or delayed cancer development and reduced rate of growth and size and number of tumors, with $\mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{6}$ fatty acids.
7. Obesity - Intake of fat contributes to fat storage and hence weight gain.

\subsection*{5.12 Question}
1. What is a lipid?
2. What are the four classes of lipids found in the body?
3. What distinguishes a saturated fat from a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat?
4. Name the functions of fats in the diet.
5. Name the functions of essential fatty acids in the body.

\subsection*{5.13Activity}

Review all three days of the food record you kept in lesson three. Identify two foods from your diet that are sources of each of the following:
a. Cholesterol
b. Saturated fat
c. Polyunsaturated fat
d. Monounsaturated fat
e. Omega-3 fatty acids
f. Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.

State the recommended intake of fats in the diet. What are some of the health benefits of fat in the body? Discuss the risks associated with excess intake of some types of fat.

\subsection*{5.14 Summary}

Lesson six discusses lipids as a group of organic compounds, most of which do not dissolve in water. In the body, lipids provide a concentrated source of energy, insulate against shock and temperature changes, are a structural component of cell membranes, are necessary for the nervous system, and are used to synthesize hormones and other molecules. In the diet, they provide energy and contribute to the texture and flavor of food.

\section*{LESSON 6}

\section*{PROTEINS}

\section*{(1)}

\subsection*{6.0 INTRODUCTION}

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes which control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of amino acids which are characterized by inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. About twenty amino acids are found in the human body, and about ten of these are essential, and therefore must be included in the diet. A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). A complete protein source contains all the essential amino acids; an incomplete protein source lacks one or more of the essential amino acids.

\subsection*{6.1 OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
* Describe the chemical structure of proteins
* Discuss the role of essential Amino Acids
* Explain the concept of nitrogen balance
* Explain the causes and consequences of dietary protein deficiency

\subsection*{6.2 Definitions}

Protein: - Compose 16\% of body weight in a lean individual. Amino acids are the building blocks for protein.
Proteins are involved in key body functions including: blood clotting, fluid balance, production of enzymes and hormones, vision, cell repair, a component of body structure, provides energy and Immune function.

Amino Acids: - In structure, proteins resemble chains, consisting of amino acid linked together. Amino Acid contains carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen and some have sulfur, chains of amino acids are formed when the amino group of one amino acid links the acid group of another amino acid. Two amino acid link together to form a dipeptide. A polypeptide is formed when many amino acids link together.
<smiles>[R]C(N)C(=O)C(=O)O</smiles>

Amino acid
Protein is made up of 20 different amino acid, nine from Essential amino acids which cannot be made by the body, also called indispensable amino acid; and eleven from Nonessential amino acids which can are synthesized by the body, also called dispensable. Conditionally indispensable Amino acids are amino acids that are normally nonessential, but must be supplied by the diet in special circumstances when the need for it exceeds the body's ability to produce it, for example Cysteine are made from Methionine and Tyrosine from Phenylalanine. Most protein foods contain at least 100 amino acids. The body can join different amino acids in different patterns to make proteins for specific functions

Transamination: - metabolic process for synthezing non-essential amino acids.
Deamination: - removal of the amino Group from the amino acid. The amino group ($\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ ) is incorporated into urea for excretion. The carbon skeleton is then used for energy.
Tripeptide: - 3 amino acids
Oligopeptide: $-3-50$ amino acids
Sickle-cell disease: - incorrect sequence of amino acids that form the hemoglobin.
Denaturation of proteins- alteration of the form of proteins, due to treatment by heat, acid, alkaline solution or agitation. For example boiled egg coagulates because of heat and curdling of milk due to acid.
High-quality proteins- Dietary protein that contains all the essential amino acids in the right proportions also called complete proteins. Can support growth and maintenance e.g. animal proteins.
Dietary proteins that lack one or more essential amino acids also called incomplete proteins. Cannot support growth and maintenance e.g. plant proteins.
Limiting amino acids - essential amino acids supplied in less amounts than needed to support protein synthesis e.g. Grains - lysine, threonine; Legumes - methionine; Nuts and seeds - lysine and Vegetables - methionine
Complementary value of protein- achieved by putting two sources of proteins together in order to complement each other for the limiting amino acid e.g. rice + red beans, Chapati + green grams.

Biological value of a protein is a measure of high efficient a food protein can turn into body tissue.
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { Chemical score }=\frac{\mathrm{mg} \text { of limiting amino acid per g of test protein }}{\mathrm{mg} \text { of amino acid per g of egg protein }} \times 100 \\
& \text { Net protein utilization }=\frac{\text { Nitrogen retained }}{\text { Nitrogen intake }} \times 100 \\
& \text { Biological value }=\frac{\text { Nitrogen retained }}{\text { Nitrogen absorbed }} \times 100
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{Biological value}
\begin{tabular}{lll} 
Egg & 100 & 100 \\
Milk & 95 & 93 \\
Fish & 71 & 76 \\
Beef & 69 & 74 \\
Rice & 67 & 86 \\
Peanuts & 65 & 55 \\
Corn & 49 & 72 \\
Soya bean & 47 & 73
\end{tabular}

Protein Efficiency Ratio is another way of measuring a food's protein quality.

\section*{- RDA for proteins}
- 0.8 gm of protein per kilogram of desirable body weight e.g. 56 gms per day for 70 kg (154(bs) man and 44 gms for a 55 kilogram (120 lbs) woman.
- Elderly is 1 gm per kilogram per body weight.
- Highly trained athletes is 1.5 gm per kilogram of body weight.
- Children is 2.2 gm per kilogram of body weight.

\subsection*{6.4 Functions of Proteins}

\section*{Body Constituents}
- Muscle tissue
- Connective tissue
- Blood clotting factors
- Blood transport proteins
- Lipoproteins
- Visual pigments
- Inside bones (protein matrix)

\section*{Maintaining Fluid Balance}
- Blood proteins albumin and globulin help maintain fluid balance in the body.
- Blood pressure in arteries forces fluid out to the extracellular space to take nutrients to the cells.
-Proteins counter this by attracting fluid back to the blood. (Osmotic and entotic pressures)
If a person does not eat enough protein; water is retained in the tissues (oedema). Other conditions that lead to oedema include: Heart disease; Kidney disease; Liver disease; Pregnancy; Children with PEM

\section*{Contribution to Acid-Base Balance}

Proteins act as buffers by providing hydrogen ions to maintain a neutral pH .

\section*{Forming Hormones and Enzymes}

Perform many regulatory functions.

\section*{Contribute to Immune function}

Antibodies are proteins - it inactivates foreign proteins to prevent infection.
Energy - Lack of immune response due to protein deficient diet.

\section*{Forms Glucose}

If the diet does not provide enough carbohydrates, then the liver makes glucose from amino acids - gluconeo genesis.

\section*{Provide Energy}

Provides 4 calories per gram of protein -Deamination

\subsection*{6.5 Proteins in Foods}
- Fruit and fat groups - no protein
- Vegetables- 2gms per exchange
- Starch/bread - 3gms exchange
- Meat - 7 gms exchange
- Milk - 8 gms exchange

\subsection*{6.6 Protein Deficiency}

Protein Energy-Malnutrition (PEM) - is a condition caused by consuming insufficient amounts of protein and k calories overtime. The deficiency results in body wasting and increased susceptibility to infections. 500 million children are affected by PEM

\subsection*{6.6.1 Kwashiorkor}

This is a form of PEM that results from inadequate protein intake. It is most common among children aged $1-3$ years who are unable to meet their high protein needs with the available diet.

\section*{Symptoms include:}
- Apathy
- Listlessness
- Failure to grow and gain weight
- Withdrawn
- Edema
- Dry flaky-paint skin
- Anorexia
- Enlarged liver
- Thinning and loss of hair color
- Infection and parasites

\subsection*{6.6.2 Marasmus}

This is another form of PEM that results from a severe deprivation, or impaired absorption, of energy, protein, vitamin and minerals causing severe body wasting. Marasmus is common in children aged 6 to 18 months.

\section*{Causes:}
- Illness, infections and disease
- Improper weaning practices
- Famine and other disasters
- Ignorance of care takers
- Poverty
- Mother's education

\section*{Symptoms}
- Failure to grow and gain weight
- Very wasted, no subcutaneous fat
- Illness and infections
- No edema
- Hair, sparse, thin, dry, pull out
- Good appetite
- Skin, dry, easily wrinkles

Both marasmus and kwashiorkor are characterized by edema for kwashiorkor and wasting for maramus. The combination of Infection, fever, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia often leads to Heart failure and occasionally sudden death.
Rehabilitation
- 24-48 hours - fluid and electrolytes to blood pressure and strengthen heart.
- Protein and energy foods is very small amounts gradually
- Easier to treat marasmus than kwashiorkor child.

\section*{A DIAGRAM OF A CELL MEMBRANE}

Membrane proteins serve as pumps gates, receptors, energy transducers and enzymes.
$>$ Tyrosine - Melanin
- Thyroxin

Tryptophan - precursor for serotonin and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{3}$ or niacin

\subsection*{6.7 Nitrogen Balance}

When the body maintains the same amount of protein in its tissues from day to day it is in nitrogen balance. Nitrogen balance is the amount of nitrogen consumed as compared with the amount of nitrogen excreted in a given period of time.
$>$ Positive nitrogen balance- Nitrogen intake exceeds output e.g. in growing infants and children, Pregnant women, People recovering from protein deficiency.
- Negative nitrogen balance more protein loss than intake e.g. in starvation, injuries, fever burns, infections.

\subsection*{6.8 Protein Turnover}

Synthesis and degradation of body proteins.
- Broken to free amino acids into the circulation.
- Recycled to make other proteins e.g. non-essential amino acids.
- Others used for energy
- Amino acids used to make neurotransmitters e.g. nerepinephrine/epinephrine) which transmit messages by the nervous system.

\subsection*{6.9. Measures of Protein Quality}

\section*{1. Amino Acid Scoring (chemical score)}

The simplest way to evaluate a food protein's quality is to determine its amino acid composition and comparing it with a reference protein.
If the test protein's limiting amino acid is $70 \%$ of the amount found in reference protein then it is given a score of 70 .

\section*{2. Biological value}

Measures proteins efficiency in supporting the body's needs.
- Amino acids are used to make neurotransmitters e.g. neuropinephrine and epinephrine, which function in transmission of messages by the nervous system.
- Tyrosine can be made into melanin which is responsible for color of hair, eyes and skin.
- Tyrosine can also be made into the hormone thyroxin which helps to regulate the metabolic rate.

Scientists feed a given food protein to experimental animals as the only protein in their diet and measure the animals retention and loss of nitrogen.
The more protein retained the higher the quality. Biological value is expressed as a percentage of the absorbed nitrogen that is retained. E.g. egg $=$ BV 100
A BV of 70 given in adequate quantities can support human growth as long as energy intake is adequate.

\section*{3. Net Protein Utilization}

NPU measures nitrogen retention also, but instead of measuring retention of absorbed nitrogen as in BV, NPU measures retention of food nitrogen.

\section*{4. Protein Efficiency Ratio}

A measure of protein quality assessed by given protein supports weight gain in growing rats, used to establish the protein quality for infant formulas and baby foods.

\section*{5. Protein - Digestibility - Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)}

A measure of protein quality assessed by comparing the amino acid balance of a food protein with the amino acid requirements of preschool- aged children and then correcting for the true.

\subsection*{6.10 Protein Digestion}

\section*{Mouth}

Protein are crushed and moistened in the mouth.

\section*{Stomach}

In the stomach, hydrochloric acid denatures proteins so that digestive enzymes can act on the peptide bonds, and also converts the inactive form of enzyme pepsinogen to active form pepsin. Pepsin breaks down large polypeptides into smaller polypeptides and some amino acids.

\section*{Small intestine}

In small intestine, pancreatic and intestinal proteases hydrolyzes polypeptides further into short peptide chains oligopeptides, tripeptides, dipeptides and amino acids.
Trypsin - among other proteases which digest protein in the small intestine, breaks large proteins to peptides.

\section*{Absorption}

The cells of the small intestine absorb amino acids and have peptidase enzymes on their surfaces that split most of the dipeptides and tripeptides into single amino acids. The membranes of intestinal cells transport the amino acids into the cells, where they are released into the bloodstream.

\subsection*{6.9 Activity}

Imagine that you have decided to become a lacto-vegetarian. Replace the animal foods in your diet with plant foods or dairy products. Calculate the protein content of this lactovegetarian diet. Does it meet your RDA for protein? If you already consume a lactovegetarian diet, try to convert your diet into a vegan diet by substituting plant sources of protein for dairy products.

\subsection*{6.10 Question}
1. How are amino acids classified, give examples?
2. List the main functions of proteins in the body.
3. Why can protein balance be calculated by measuring nitrogen intake and output?
4. Define protein quality.
5. Explain protein complementation giving examples.
6. State the groups of people that are most vulnerable to protein deficiency

\subsection*{6.11 Summary}

In this lesson we learnt that proteins are made of amino acid. Amino acid consist of a carbon atom with a hydrogen atom, a nitrogen-containing group, an acid group, and a unique side chain attached. The amino acid that the body is unable to make in sufficient amounts to meet it is needs are referred to as essential amino acid. Proteins provide structure. They regulate body functions as enzymes and hormones; transport molecules in the blood and cells; and function in the immune system, muscle contraction, fluid balance, acid balance and nerve transmission. Discussed also is protein digestion.

\section*{LESSON 7}

\section*{VITAMINS}

\subsection*{7.0 INTRODUCTION}
- Vitamins are essential organic that provide no energy but are needed in small amount in the diet to promote and regulated body functions. Vitamin deficiencies remain a major problem worldwide. Vitamin supplements taken in excess are becoming a major concern toxic.
- How much of a vitamin is available to the body is regulated by the absorption, transport, activations, storage and excretion of that vitamin. Vitamins are established by evaluating the results from many different kinds of studies, including depletion - repletion studies, nutrient balances studies, studies that relate to a parameter of metabolic function, information from animal experiments and epidemiology observations. When information is not sufficient to develop a specific recommendation, estimated safe and adequate dairy intakes are suggested. Too little will results in a deficiency and excess can be toxic.
- In most cases adequate intakes of vitamins can be obtained from a well balanced diet but certain people may need vitamin supplementation. How food is transported handled, processed, prepared and cooked must be considered in diet planning.
- Most people can meet their vitamin needs from food. Except in special circumstances e.g. population of high risk for malnutrition due to inadequate nutrient intake, people with chronic diseases, vegetarians, drug and alcohol abuse, people in certain stages of life cycle. Supplements can be recommended sometimes under these conditions.
- Vitamin differ from the carbohydrates, fats and proteins in the following ways:
- Structure- vitamins are individual units; they are not linked in long chains.
- Function - vitamin do not yield usable energy when broken down, they assist enzymes that release energy from carbohydrates, fats and proteins.
- Food contents- the amount of vitamins required are measured in micrograms or milligrams rather than grams.
- The fat soluble vitamins include vitamins A,D,E,K while water-soluble vitamins are Vitamin B and C.

\subsection*{7.1 OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:
* Discuss the differences between fat soluble and water soluble vitamins
* Describe the function and dietary sources of vitamins
* List the dietary reference values for vitamins.

Explain the consequences of inadequate and excessive vitamin intake

\subsection*{7.2 Fat Soluble Vitamins}

These include vitamins A, D, E, and K, they are normally found in the fats and oils of foods. They are insoluble in water, so they require bile for digestion and chylomicrons for absorption.

\subsection*{7.2.1 Vitamin A}

There are several forms of vitamin A. The retinoids, which include retinal, retinol and retinoic acid which are used by the body to promote vision and for growth and cell differentiation and thereby maintaining the health of epithelial tissues and skin, support the immune system, promoting growth and bone remodeling. It is found in the diet in both preformed as retinal, and retinoic acid and precursor forms, carotenoids, most commonly beta carotene. Although carotenoids are not toxic, preformed vitamin A can be toxic at doses as low as IOX RDA. The major food sources of preformed vitamin A include liver, fish and fortified dairy products.
There are also provitamins A form called carotenoids. They are used by the body as Vitamin A but must be converted to retinoids. They protect cells against damage by oxygen. Carotenoids are found in fruits and vegetables e.g. pawpaw, mangoes, plums, carrots, tomatoes, green leafy vegetables etc. There is epidemiological evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables containing beta- carotene protects against cancer. Vitamin A is a micronutrient of public health concern in Kenya and other developing countries.

\section*{Deficiency}

Vitamin A deficiency is one of the major nutrition problem for the developing countries. More than 100 million children worldwide have some degree of vitamin A deficiency and so are vulnerable to infectious disease. Symptoms of vitamin A deficiency include:
- Unhealthy epithelial tissue results in infection due to invasion by bacteria and virus e.g. respiratory infections and diarrhea.
- Failure of growth of bones
- Night blindness
- Dry eyes and skin
- Anemia

\section*{Toxicity}

As deficiency of vitamin A affect all the body system, so does toxicity.
Too much vitamin A is toxic
- Headaches, pain in joints
- Itching and rashes
- Loss of hair
- Muscle weakness
- Diarrhea, loss of appetite
- Amenorrhea, enlarged liver and spleen

\section*{Food Sources}
- Plant origin-Dark green, orange, red fruits and vegetables
- Animal origin-Meat especially liver, fish liver oils, milk and milk products and eggs.

\subsection*{7.2.2 Vitamin D}

Vitamin D is different from other nutrients in that the body can synthesize it with the help of sunlight; it is therefore not an essential nutrient but the dietary requirement varies depending on the amount synthesized. Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption from the intestine, calcium deposition and release from the bone and the kidney.

\section*{Deficiency}

Symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include:
Rickets in children
Osteomalacia in adults

\section*{Toxicity}

Toxicity can increase calcium absorption and bone mineralization, high blood calcium which causes deposition of calcium in the kidneys, heart, lungs and arteries.

\section*{Food Sources}

Animal origin include: Eggs yolk, Liver, Fatty fish, Butter, Fortified milk
-The body makes vitamin D from exposure to the sun.

\subsection*{7.2.3 Vitamin E}

Vitamin E functions primarily as a fat soluble antioxidant and a primary defender of the body against oxidation, protecting the lipids and other vulnerable components of the cells and their membranes from destruction. Since polyunsaturated fats are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage, its requirement increases as the polyunsaturated fat content of the diet increases. Vitamins E are very active in the lungs and red blood cells where there is high exposure to oxygen; it also helps to protect the lungs against air pollutants especially when a person is breathing hard during exercising. Vitamin E plays a role in the immune system by protecting the white blood cells.

\section*{Deficiency}
- Hemolysis of red blood cells
- Loss of muscle co-ordination and reflex.
- Impaired vision and speech
- Deterioration of respiratory muscles
- Associated with some types of cancers.

\section*{Toxicity}

High doses of vitamin E can interfere with functions of vitamin K. A lot of people take vitamin E supplements for various reasons e.g. improved physical performance, enhances
sexual performance, slows process of aging, slow progression of some diseases. These claims have no scientific basis.

\section*{Food Sources}

Oil seeds, meats, eggs, nuts, soybean oil, wheat germ, plant oils and green vegetables.

\subsection*{7.2.4 Vitamin K}

Vitamin K is found in plants and synthesized by bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting. It also participates in the synthesis of bone protein. A deficiency of vitamin K results in a failure of blood to clot. Since this is a problem in new born, an anti vitamin K factor, dicumarol is used medically as an anticoagulant.

\section*{Food sources}

Liver, leafy vegetables and cabbage.

\subsection*{7.3 Water Soluble Vitamins}

These are vitamin B and C. The water-soluble vitamins are found in the watery compartments of foods. On being absorbed, the water-soluble vitamins move directly in to the blood. The kidneys, monitoring the blood that flows through them, detect and remove excess water-soluble vitamins.

\subsection*{7.3.1 Vitamin B}

The 8 B vitamins serve as coenzymes to the enzymes that are involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats and proteins to produce energy. Thiamine, Riboflavin and niacin are the key vitamins involved in energy metabolism so their requirement varies with energy intake. Thiamine is required for the generation of energy from macronutrients and the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Riboflavin coenzymes are needed for the generation of energy. Riboflavin is needed for the utilization of several other vitamins. Niacin coenzymes are important in the breakdown of carbohydrates, proteins and fat and in the synthesis of fatty acids and steroids. Supplements of the nicotinic acid form of niacin can lower elevated blood cholesterol, but their use is limited by toxicity symptoms such as flushing, tingling sensations and a red skin rash.

\section*{Best food sources for:}

Niacin- Beef, chicken, fish and enriched grain products. The amino acid tryptophan can be converted into niacin, Liver, whole grains, legumes nuts, milk, yogurt and vegetables,
Thiamine- lean pork, legumes, and whole or enriched grains and cereals, Riboflavin - milk, meat, and enriched grain products.

\section*{Deficiencies}
- Thiamine - Beriberi causes nervous systems abnormalities. Deficiencies are common in alcoholics. No toxicity identified
- Riboflavin - affects facial skin, eyes and GI tract
- Niacin - pellagra (dementia, dermatitis, diarrhea, death).

\subsection*{7.3.2 Biotin and Pantothenic Acid}

Biotin is needed for the synthesis of glucose, fatty acids and DNA and the metabolism of certain amino acids. A RDA has not been established because some biotin is made by gastrointestinal bacteria. Pantothenic acid is part of coenzyme A (COA), which is required for the production of energy from protein, carbohydrates and fat and the synthesis of fat and cholesterol deficiency is rare.

\section*{Deficiency}

Insomnia, depression, muscle pain and weakness, fatigue

\section*{Food sources}

Liver, eggs, yolks, cereals, and yeast.

\subsection*{7.3.3 Vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{6}$}

Pyridoxal phosphate, the coenzyme form of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ is needed for the activity of more than 50 enzymes involved in the metabolism of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ is essential for amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, so its requirement is affected by protein intake. It's involved in making non-essential amino acids and neurotransmitters. It also helps to make the blood cells.

\section*{Deficiency}

Insomnia, weakness, irritability, growth failure, impaired motor function, convulsions.

\section*{Toxicity}

Nerve damage, numbness, muscle weakness.

\section*{Food Sources}

Meats, fish, eggs, poultry, green and leafy vegetables, legumes, fruits and whole grains.

\subsection*{7.3.4 Folate and $B_{12}$}

Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate are closely related, each depends on the other for activation. Folate is necessary for DNA synthesis; it plays a major role in cell differentiation and division so it is particularly important for rapidly dividing cells such as those in the bone marrow where blood cells are formed. The requirements are increased during pregnancy and folate supplement before and during pregnancy have been shown to prevent neural tube defects. Vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ is needed to maintain metabolism of folate and fatty acids and to maintain the insulation - myelin, surrounding nerves. The absorption of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ requires intrinsic factor, which is a protein secreted in the stomach. Deficiency is a problem in vegetarians and individuals who do not produce intrinsic factor.

\section*{Deficiency}
- Immature large blood cells- Megaloblastic anemia
- Blood disorder caused by lack of intrinsic factor and characterized by deficit of red blood cells- Pernicious anemia if not treated it can be fatal.

\section*{Food Sources}

Folate: vegetables, legumes, seeds, liver.
$\mathrm{B}_{12}$ : animal foods and products fermented by micro organisms.

\subsection*{7.3.5 Vitamin C}

Vitamin C is necessary for the maintenance of connective tissue in the body. In some settings, vitamin C helps specific enzyme perform its job such as synthesis of essential molecules such as collagen, neurotransmitters, and hormones, but in others, it acts as an antioxidant. It also strengthens resistance to infection and in absorption of iron. High doses cause diarrhea and abdominal pain.

\section*{Deficiency}

Scurvy is characterized by poor wound healing, bleeding, and other symptoms related to improper formation and maintenance of collagen.

\section*{Significant Sources}

Citrus fruits, cabbage-type vegetables, dark green vegetables, cantaloupe, strawberries, peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, papayas, mangoes.

\subsection*{7.4 Water Intake}

Water is an essential nutrient, as important to life as the others. You can survive only a few days without water while deficiency of the other nutrients may take weeks, months or even a year to develop. The dietary water sources include water, beverages, fruits and vegetables and water generated during metabolism. Thirst and satiety influence water intake in response to changes sensed by the mouth, hypothalamus and nerves. Dehydration the condition in which body water output exceeds water input e.g Heavy sweating, diarrhoea and vomiting. Water intoxication is the condition where body water contents are too high e.g. kidney disorder.

\section*{Water losses}
- Urine 1500 mls a day
- Lungs -vapor
- Skin- sweat
- Feaces

Total loss $21 / 2$ liter a day

\section*{Recommended intake}

Infant - $1.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kcal}$
Adults - 1.0 to $1.5 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kcal}$
Water maintains blood volume and blood pressure. Hormones involved in maintaining water balance and electrolyte balance
1. ADH water retention
2. Angiotensin blood vessel constriction raises blood pressure
3. Aldosterone sodium retention

\section*{Fluid and Electrolyte balance}
- Sodium chloride and potassium are electrolytes involved in fluid balance.
- water follows electrolytes
- water flows in the direction of higher concentration of solutes -osmotic pressure
- This process helps to distribute fluids inside and outside cells, thus ensuring appropriate balance to support life processes

\section*{LESSON 8}

\subsection*{8.0 DIGESTION SYSTEM}

The digestive system provides two major functions: digestion and absorption. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are digested and absorbed as sugars, fatty acids and amino acids, respectively. Not all components of food are digested. Vitamins, minerals, and water can be absorbed without digestion, and some substances, such as components of fiber, cannot be digested by humans and so are excreted without being absorbed. These unabsorbed substances pass through the digestive tract and out in the feces.

\subsection*{8.1 OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:
1. Name the organs involved in the digestion and absorption of food.
2. List mechanisms by which nutrients are absorbed.
3. List organs involved in elimination of waste products from the body

\subsection*{8.2 Digestion}

\section*{Gastrointestinal (GI) tract}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_79a58ce87a4537b574cfg-95.jpg?height=806&width=722&top_left_y=1267&top_left_x=327)

The main sites in the body used in digestion and absorption of nutrients are:
- Mouth
- Esophagus
- Stomach
- Small intestines
- Large intestine
- Rectum and anus

Saliva - Fluid produced by salivary glands in the mouth, contains lubricants, enzymes and other substances.
Mucus - A thick fluid secreted by glands in the body. Acts as a lubricant and a means of protection for cells.
Cysozyme - Produced by body cell. Protects against bacteria.
Sphincters - Regulate passage or flow of materials from one part to the next.
Heartburn and ulcers - Caused by high acid in stomach.
Bicarbonate ions - from pancreas neutralize the chime before it moves to small intestines.
Peristalsis - Food is propelled through the GI by peristalsis, a wave of muscle action.
Stomach wall is very muscular to facilitate grinding and mixing action. (diagonal, circular, longitudinal).
Enzymes in digestion - Most digestive enzymes are made by the pancreas and small intestines, few in the mouth and stomach.

\subsection*{8.3 Fat Digestion}

Stomach - lipase needs an acid media (gastric lipase).
Small intestines - pancreatic lipase.
Cholecystokinin - a hormone that stimulates the enzymes to be released from the pancreas and bile from the gall bladder.
Bile - emulsifies fats to form water soluble micelles which can be digested by "lipases. Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) a hormone that controls the emptying of the stomach.

\subsection*{8.5 Carbohydrate Digestion}

Mouth - saliva Amylase breaks down starch to smaller sugar units e.g. maltose. Amylase does not work in acid environment.
Small intestine -pancreatic amylase- monosaccharides and dissacharides. - sucrose, malatose lactose (dissacharidases) glucose, fructose, galactose.breaks starch into simple sugars.

\section*{Absorption}

Small intestines site for most digestion and absorption of nutrients.
Wall of intestine:
- Folded
- Finger like projects
- Villi
- Absorptive cells - each has a brush border - micro villi
- All these folds, fingers and indentations in the small intestine increase surface area 600 times.

\subsection*{8.6 Protein Digestion}

Stomach - pepsin - peptones
Gastric - a hormone that stimulates enzyme and acid secretion in the stomach.

\section*{Small intestine}

Chime - a mixture of stomach secretions and partially digested food. - neutralized by bicarbonate ions.
Secretion - A hormone that causes bicarbonate ions to be released by the pancreas. Trypsin - among other proteases which digest protein in the small intestine, breaks large proteins to peptides.

\subsection*{8.7 Types of Absorption}

Passive absorption - substances are permeable to the walls of the small intestine e.g. water and some minerals. Move from area of high concentration to area of low concentration.
Facilitated absorption- a carrier e.g. sodium but not energy is needed to carry the substances across the intestinal walls e.g. fructose.Move from area of high concentration to area of low concentration.Active absorption - uses a carrier and energy e.g. glucose, galactose and amino acids.
Portal and Lymphatic systems
Portal vein > capillaries from the intestine and stomach drain into a large portal vein that goes to the liver e.g. water soluble nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, short-chain fatty acids, B vitamins and vitamin C .

\section*{Lymphatic system}

Carry fat soluble nutrients (long-chain fatty acids, fat soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K)
Large intestines
Small intestine 85\% - 90\% of the water absorbed.
Large intestine - some $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ potassium and sodium.
Bacteria - vitamin K and Biotin.

\subsection*{8.8 Question}
1. List three organ systems involved in the digestion and absorption of food.
2. List the functions of the liver
3. What products of digestion are transported by the lymphatic system?
4. What is the form of energy used by cells?

\subsection*{8.9 Activity}

Most foods contain some protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Discuss where in the digestive tract the digestion of each of these nutrients begins. Does the presence of high-protein
food in the digestive tract inhibit the digestion and absorption of foods high in carbohydrate or fat? Why or why not?

\subsection*{8.10 Summary}

Lesson eight discusses digestion as a process by which food is broken down into units that are small enough to be absorbed. Absorption is the process by which nutrients are transported into the body.

\section*{Functions of the liver.}

Synthesis
- A large part of amino acid synthesis
- The liver performs several roles in carbohydrate metabolism:
- Gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of glucose from certain amino acids, lactate or glycerol)
- Glycogenolysis (the breakdown of glycogen into glucose)
- Glycogenesis (the formation of glycogen from glucose)(muscle tissues can also do this)
- The liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein metabolism, synthesis as well as degradation
- The liver also performs several roles in lipid metabolism:
- Cholesterol synthesis
- Lipogenesis, the production of triglycerides (fats).
- The liver produces coagulation factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V, VII, IX, X and XI, as well as protein C, protein S and antithrombin.
- In the first trimester fetus, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production. By the 32nd week of gestation, the bone marrow has almost completely taken over that task.
- The liver produces and excretes bile (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.
- The liver also produces insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a polypeptide protein hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults.
- The liver is a major site of thrombopoietin production. Thrombopoietin is a glycoprotein hormone that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow.

\section*{Breakdown}
- The breakdown of insulin and other hormones
- The liver breaks down hemoglobin, creating metabolites that are added to bile as pigment (bilirubin and biliverdin).
- The liver breaks down or modifies toxic substances (e.g., methylation) and most medicinal products in a process called drug metabolism. This sometimes results in toxication, when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are conjugated to avail excretion in bile or urine.
- The liver converts ammonia to urea.

\section*{Other functions}
- The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of glycogen), vitamin A (1-2 years' supply), vitamin D (1-4 months' supply), vitamin B12 (1-3 years' supply), iron, and copper.
- The liver is responsible for immunological effects- the reticuloendothelial system of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the portal system.
- The liver produces albumin, the major osmolar component of blood serum.
- The liver synthesizes angiotensinogen, a hormone that is responsible for raising the blood pressure when activated by renin, an enzyme that is released when the kidney senses low blood pressure.
