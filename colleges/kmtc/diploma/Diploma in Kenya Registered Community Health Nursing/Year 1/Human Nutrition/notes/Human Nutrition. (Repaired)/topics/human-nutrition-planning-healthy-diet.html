                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Diet planners have developed several ways of selecting foods. Whatever plan or combination of plans they use, they keep in mind the six basic diet planning principles.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Adequacy</li>
                            <li>Balance</li>
                            <li>K calorie (energy) control</li>
                            <li>Nutrient density</li>
                            <li>Moderation</li>
                            <li>Variety</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Adequacy</h3>
                        <p>RDA is all about adequacy. An adequate diet provides sufficient energy and enough of all nutrients to meet the needs of healthy people. For example: - Iron, each day the body loses some iron, so people have to replace it by eating foods that contain iron. A person whose diet fails to provide enough iron rich foods may develop the symptoms of irondeficiency anemia. The person may feel weak, tired, and listless, have frequent headaches, and find even the smallest amount of muscular work very tasking. To prevent these deficiency symptoms, diet planners must include foods that supply adequate iron.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Balance</h3>
                        <p>The essential minerals calcium and iron, taken together, illustrate the importance of dietary balance. Meats, fish and poultry are rich in iron, but poor in calcium. Whereas milk and milk products are rich in calcium but poor in iron. Milk and milk products except breast milk are very low in iron; dependence on them can lead to iron-deficiency anemia.<br>
                        The art of balancing the diet involves using enough, but not too much of each type of food. Use some meat or meat alternatives for iron, use some milk and milk products for calcium, but also save some space for other foods for other nutrients e.g. vegetables, fruits, grains.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">K calorie (Energy Control)</h3>
                        <p>Diets should not include too much or too little energy foods, but just enough to meet an individual's needs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nutrient Density</h3>
                        <p>The food guide provides a strong foundation for a healthy diet but does not explain the nutrient density of some foods such as processed food. To eat well without overeating, select foods that deliver the most nutrients for the least food energy. For examplecalcium, you can get about 300 milligrams of calcium from either 45 grams of cheddar cheese or 250 ml or 1 cup of milk. Milk will provide exactly same amount of calcium as cheese but less k calories or a glass of coke and a bowl of watermelon. Each provides 150 k calories, but the water melon offers a little protein, some vitamins, minerals and fiber along with energy, the coke beverage offers only "empty" k calories. Water melon or any fruit is more nutrient dense than carbonated beverages.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Moderation</h3>
                        <p>Foods rich in fat and sugar provide enjoyment and energy but have relatively few nutrients, in excess promote weight gain. These foods should therefore be eaten in moderation.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Variety</h3>
                        <p>People should select foods from each of the food groups daily. People also vary the choices within each food group from day to day for several reasons.</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Different foods within the same food group contain different nutrients. For example among fruits, strawberries are very high in vitamin C while watermelon is richer in vitamin A.</li>
                            <li>"Variety is the spice of life". Even if a person eats beans frequently, the person can choose pinto beans, chick peas etc. to include variety in recipes to avoid monotony.</li>

The Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes variety and recommends the number of servings from each of the five major food groups needed to plan diets that avoid nutrient deficiencies and meet the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines. The food exchange list groups foods as carbohydrates, proteins and fats only. They are mostly used for planning patients diets. Other meal planning tools such as ethic food guide pyramids and food mix squares have also been suggested as alternatives. The use of food labels in planning meals has also been discussed.</p>
