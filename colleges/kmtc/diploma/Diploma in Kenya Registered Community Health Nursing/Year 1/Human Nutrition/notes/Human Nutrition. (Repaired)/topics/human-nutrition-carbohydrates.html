                        <p>Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They constitute a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread, and other grain-based products. Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Polysaccharides are often referred to as complex carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take slightly longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in blood glucose levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases which have become more frequent in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than formerly, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear, however.</p>
                        <p>Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-sugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients. However, the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient, starch, varies in its absorption. Gelatinized starch (starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water) is far more digestible than plain starch. And starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion. The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans. Additionally, up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty.</p>

                        The energy nutrients include:</p>
                        <ol class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>CHO - glucose - energy</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>b. Energy Needs</strong><br>
                        Brain and Red blood cells depend on carbohydrates as a source of energy. They cannot use fat directly for energy. If CHO is low in diet protein is converted to glucose to provide energy.</p>
                        <p><strong>c. Protein Conservation</strong><br>
                        After several days of CHO deficiency (Starvation) the body uses fat for energy in order to spare proteins. Fat is broken down to form ketones which are used for energy. Ketones are made in liver. The Brain and red blood cells use some energy from ketones in time of energy deprivation. High levels of ketones in the blood can cause dehydration (ketosis) due to acidity from accumulation of ketones a condition refered to as ketosis.</p>

                        <p>The body uses some energy to process food. Digestion uses at least $10\%$ of energy intake as thermic effect of food (i.e. heat produced during the digestive activities) e.g. if a person ingests 2000 kcal he will spend 200 kcal on thermic effect of food.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Normally the enzyme lactase is responsible for the digestion and efficient absorption of lactose a dissacharide found in milk. Lactase levels are highest after birth to digest milk which is the first and only food for infants. Lactase activity declines dramatically during childhood and adolescence to about 5 to $10\%$ of the activity at birth.<br>
                        Lactose intolerance is a condition that results from inability to digest the milk sugar lactose; characterized by bloating, gas, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea. Lactose intolerance differs from milk allergy, which is caused by an immune reaction to the protein in milk.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms of less lactase to handle the lactose hydrolysis are:</p>

                        <p><strong>Converting glucose to fat</strong><br>
                        Liver breaks extra glucose into smaller molecules and then puts them together to form fat. Then fat travels to the fatty tissues of the body for storage. Fat cells can store unlimited amounts of fat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Maintaining glucose homeostasis</strong><br>
                        Normal blood glucose is $80-120 \text{ mg/dl}$. Blood glucose level is regulated by 2 hormones, insulin and glycogen.</p>
                        <p><strong>Insulin</strong></p>

                            <li>Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose into cells and storage as glycogen in the liver and muscle.</li>
                            <li>Insulin also stimulates the conversion of excess glucose into fat for storage.</li>
                            <li>Blood glucose begins to decline.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Low blood glucose stimulates the pancreas to release glucagon into the blood stream.</li>
                            <li>Glucagon stimulates liver cells to breakdown glycogen and release glucose into the blood, blood glucose begins to rise.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Other hormones.</strong><br>
                        Stress hormone epinephrine and other hormones also bring glucose out of storage.</p>

                            <li>Eating balanced meals helps maintain a happy medium between extremes.</li>
                            <li>Balanced meals provide abundant complex CHO , fibers and protein and a little fat. The fibers and fat slow down the digestion and absorption of CHO, so that glucose enters the blood gradually, proving a steady supply.</li>
                            <li>Dietary proteins stimulate the secretion of glucagon, whose effects oppose those of insulin helping maintain blood glucose within normal range.</li>

                        Caused by inability to regulate blood glucose.<br>
                        In insulin dependent diabetes (IDDM)<br>
                        The pancreas does not produce insulin - causes</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In non insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), cells fail to produce insulin causing obesity. Fat cells resist insulin.<br>
                        Dietary control - low fat, complex carbohydrates and fiber, limited sugars Spreading total food intake over many meals and snacks a day without an increase in energy intake is a relatively easy and effective way to lower blood cholesterol.<br>
                        Cholesterol becomes harmful when it forms deposits in the artery walls. The deposit leads to atherosclerosis, a disease that causes heart attacks and strokes.</p>

Complex carbohydrates are polysaccharides and include glycogen in animals and starches and fiber in plants. We learned about the health benefits of fibre.
