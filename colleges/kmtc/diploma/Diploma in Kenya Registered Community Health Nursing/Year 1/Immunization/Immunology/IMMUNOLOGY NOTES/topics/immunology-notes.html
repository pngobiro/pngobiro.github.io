                            <li>The scientific study of the immune system, known as immunology, dates from about the late 1800's.</li>
                            <li>In 1796, the British physician Edward Jenner administrated the first vaccination (from the Latin vacca, meaning "cow"). To protect from the smallpox virus he vaccinated a child with a cowpox virus.</li>
                            <li>Louis Pasteur discovered vaccines for cholera, anthrax, and rabies.</li>
                            <li>In 1883, the Russian biologist Elie Metchnikoff discovered phagocytes.</li>
                            <li>In 1890, Emil A. Behring and S. Kitasato discovered antitoxins (antibodies).</li>

                            <li><strong>First line of defense</strong> - intact skin and mucosae prevent entry of microorganisms</li>

                            <li><strong>Lysozyme in tears and other secretions</strong> - Degrades peptidoglycan in bacterial cell wall</li>
                            <li><strong>Respiratory cilia</strong> - Elevate mucus containing trapped organisms</li>
                            <li><strong>Low pH in stomach and vagina</strong> - Retards growth of microbes</li>
                            <li><strong>Surface phagocytes</strong> - Ingest and destroy microbes (eg. alveolar macrophages)</li>
                            <li><strong>Normal flora of throat, colon and vagina</strong> - prevents colonization by pathogens</li>
                            <li><strong>Natural killer cells</strong> - Kill virus infected cells</li>
                            <li><strong>Neutrophils</strong> - Ingest and destroy microbes</li>
                            <li><strong>Macrophages and dendritic cells</strong> - Ingest and destroy microbes</li>
                            <li><strong>Cytokines e.g interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factor, chemokines, lymphokines</strong> - Important in cell signaling. Their release has an effect on the behavior of cells around them</li>
                            <li><strong>Complement system</strong> - blood proteins forming an attack complex creating holes on bacterial membranes</li>
                            <li><strong>Fever</strong> - Elevated temperature retards bacterial growth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inflammatory response</strong> - Limits spread of microbes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Types of innate immunity</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is of three types-
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Species Immunity</li>

                            <li><strong>Species immunity</strong> is the total immunity shown by all members of a species against pathogen; e.g. birds immune to tetanus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Racial immunity</strong> is that in which various races show marked difference in their resistance to certain infectious disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Individual immunity</strong> is very specific for each and every individual despite having same racial background and opportunity for exposure.</li>

                            <li><strong>Third line of defense</strong> - mounts attack against particular foreign substances</li>
                            <li>Takes longer to act than the innate system</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Characteristics of Acquired Immunity:</h3>
                        <p><strong>(i) Specificity:</strong></p>
                        <p>It is the ability to differentiate between various foreign molecules (for-eign antigens).</p>
                        <p><strong>(ii) Diversity:</strong></p>
                        <p>It can recognise a vast variety of foreign molecules (foreign antigens).</p>
                        <p><strong>(iii) Discrimination between Self and Non-self:</strong></p>
                        <p>It can recognise and respond to foreign molecules (non-self) and can avoid response to those molecules that are present within the body (self) of the animal.</p>
                        <p><strong>(iv) Memory:</strong></p>
                        <p>When the immune system encounters a specific foreign agent, (e.g., a microbe) for the first time, it generates immune response and eliminates the invader. This is called first encounter. The immune system retains the memory of the first encounter. As a result, a second encounter occurs more quickly and abundantly than the first encounter.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Acquired Immunity</h3>
                        <p>Acquired Immunity is of two types- active and passive immunity.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Active immunity</strong>
                                <p>It is induced by natural exposure to a pathogen or by vaccination. It can be categorized into two types- Naturally acquired and Artificially acquired active immunity.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Passive immunity</strong>
                                <p>Passive immunity is achieve by transfer of immune products, such as antibody or sensitized T-cells, from an immune individual to non immune one. It is of two types- Naturally acquired and Artificially acquired passive immunity</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Mechanism of active immunity</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body's immune system provide protection by synthesizing antibodies or immunoglobulins in response to an antigen.</li>
                            <li>Primary immune response takes place when the host is attacked by certain microbes for first time. The antibodies start to generate after certain period as the binding of an antigen with its particular antibody is very specific.</li>
                            <li>Secondary immune response occurs when an individual is being attacked by the same antigen subsequently. It is a rapid process.</li>
                            <li>Acquired active immune response takes two distinct forms- humoral and cell mediated response.</li>
                        </ul>

                          <p>Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or social immunity) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through previous infections or vaccination, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune.</p>
                          <h3>HERD IMMUNITY CONT..</h3>
                          <ul>

                               <li>In the blood, the antigens are specifically and with high affinity bound by antibodies to form an antigen-antibody complex. The immune complex is then transported to cellular systems where it can be destroyed or deactivated.</li>
                               <li>There are several types of antibodies and antigens, and each antibody is capable of binding only to a specific antigen. The specificity of the binding is due to specific chemical constitution of each antibody.</li>

                     <h2 id="section-heading-acquired-summary" class="section-heading">ACQUIRED IMMUNITY</h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                          <ul>
                               <li>Immunity may be acquired naturally or artificially and both forms may be active or passive</li>
                               <li>The immune response to an antigen following the first exposure (primary immunization) is called the primary response.</li>
                               <li>Second and subsequent exposures give rise to a secondary response</li>
                          </ul>
                          
                          <h3>The Primary Response</h3>
                          <ul>
                               <li>There is a slow and delayed rise in antibody levels, peaking 1-2 weeks after infection.</li>
                               <li>This delayed response reflects the time required to activate the T-lymphocyte system, which then stimulates B lymphocyte division.</li>
                          </ul>
                          
                          <h3>The Secondary Response</h3>
                          <p>On subsequent exposures to the same antigen, the immune response is much faster and significantly more powerful, because of memory B-lymphocytes</p>
                          
                          <h3>Active Immunity</h3>
                          <p>It means that the individual has responded to an antigen and produced his own antibodies, lymphocytes are activated and the memory cells formed provide long-lasting resistance.</p>
                          
                          <h3>Passive Immunity</h3>
                          <p>In passive immunity the individual is given antibodies produced by someone else. The antibodies eventually break down, so passive immunity is relatively brief.</p>
                          
                          <h3>Natural Active Acquired Immunity</h3>
                          <p>The body may be stimulated to produce its own antibodies by:</p>
                          <ul>
                               <li>Having the disease.</li>
                               <li>Having a subclinical infection.</li>
                          </ul>
                          
                          <h3>Artificial Active Acquired Immunity</h3>
                          <ul>
                               <li>This type of immunity develops in response to the administration of dead or live artificially weakened pathogens (vaccines) or deactivated toxins (toxoids).</li>
                               <li>The vaccines and toxoids stimulate the development of immunity but they cannot cause the disease.</li>
                               <li>Many infectious diseases can be prevented by artificial immunization- Vaccine administration</li>
                               <li>Active immunization against some infectious disorders gives lifelong immunity, e.g. diphtheria, whooping cough or mumps.</li>
                               <li>In other infections revaccination is necessary.</li>
                               <li>In older or poorly nourished individuals, lymphocyte production, especially B-lymphocytes, is reduced and the primary and secondary response may be inadequate.</li>
                          </ul>
                          
                          <h3>Passive Artificially Acquired Immunity</h3>
                          <ul>
                               <li>In this type, ready-made antibodies, in human or animal serum, are injected into the recipient.</li>
                               <li>The source of the antibodies may be an individual who has recovered from the infection, or animals, commonly horses, that have been artificially actively immunized.</li>
                               <li>Specific immunoglobulins may be administered prophylactically to prevent the development of disease in people who have been exposed to the infection, or therapeutically after the disease has developed.</li>

                               <li>Most of autoimmune diseases are antibody mediated</li>
                               <li>They include;
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>

                          <h3>Rheumatoid Arthritis</h3>
                          <ul>
                               <li>The body produces antibodies to the synovial membranes</li>
                               <li>The antibody called rheumatoid factor can be detected in the blood.</li>
                               <li>It leads to chronically inflamed joints that are stiff, painful and swollen.</li>
                          </ul>

                          <h3>Hashimoto's disease</h3>
                          <p>The body makes antibodies to thyroglobulin, leading to destruction of thyroid hormone, and hypo secretion of the thyroid.</p>

                          <h3>Graves' disease</h3>
                          <ul>
                               <li>The body makes antibodies to thyroid cells.</li>
                               <li>Unlike Hashimoto's disease, however, the effect of the antibodies is to stimulate the gland, with a resultant hyperthyroidism</li>
                          </ul>

                          <h3>Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</h3>
                          <p>In this, individuals make antibodies to their own red blood cells, leading to haemolytic anaemia.</p>

                          <h3>Myasthenia gravis</h3>
                          <ul>
                               <li>antibodies are produced that bind to and block the acetylcholine receptors of neuromuscular junctions.</li>
                               <li>The transmission of nerve impulses to muscle fibers is therefore blocked.</li>
                               <li>This causes progressive and extensive muscle weakness</li>

                               <li>HIV has an affinity for cells that have a protein receptor called CD4 in their membrane e.g. T-lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and some B-lymphocytes</li>
                               <li>Helper T-cells are the main cells involved. When infected their number is reduced, causing suppression of both antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunity</li>
                               <li>This leads to widespread opportunistic infections</li>
