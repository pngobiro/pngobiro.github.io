                        <p>Humans and animals have survived on earth for hundreds of thousands of years because they
                            have many built-in or naturally occurring mechanisms of defense against pathogens and
                            infectious disease they cause.</p>
                        <p>The ability of any animal to resist these invaders and recover from disease is due to many

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE</h3>
                        <p>The body's first line of defense consists of physical, chemical, and cellular barriers
                            designed to prevent pathogens from entering the body.</p>

                        <h4>a) Mechanical and physical factors</h4>
                        <p><strong>i. Skin:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intact, unbroken skin that covers our bodies serves as a physical or mechanical barrier
                                to pathogens.</li>
                            <li>Very few pathogens are able to penetrate the skin.</li>
                            <li>The dryness of most areas of skin inhibits colonization by many pathogens.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>ii. Mucous membranes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They serve as physical and mechanical barriers to pathogens.</li>
                            <li>Most pathogens can only pass when these membranes have are cut or scratched.</li>
                            <li>The sticky mucous produced by the goblet cells within the mucus membranes serve to
                                entrap invaders(pathogens). They can be removed by normal reflex like coughing or
                                sneezing.</li>
                            <li>Such areas include nose (respiratory tract), mouth, and vagina.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>b). Cellular and Chemical factors:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body temperature - &lt;37°c and acidity of the skin inhibit the growth of pathogens.
                            </li>
                            <li>The oily sebum that is produced by sebaceous glands in the skin contains fatty acids
                                which are toxic to some pathogens.</li>
                            <li>Perspiration (sweat) aids in flushing organisms from pores and surface of skin.</li>
                            <li>Sweat contains enzyme-lysozyme which degrades peptidoglycan in bacteria cell walls.</li>
                            <li>Sloughing off of dead skin cells removes potential pathogens from the skin.</li>
                            <li>Sticky mucus produced by the mucous membranes contains lysozyme,lactoferin,and
                                lactoperoxidase that kill bacteria or inhibit growth.</li>
                            <li>Lactoferrin binds with iron, a mineral that is required by all pathogens;because they
                                are unable to compete with lactoferrin for free iron,the pathogens are deprived of these
                                essential nutrient.</li>
                            <li>Lactoperoxidase is an enzyme that produces superoxide radicals, highly reactive forms of
                                oxygen which are toxic to bacteria.</li>
                            <li>Because mucosal cells are among the most rapidly dividing cells in the body, they are
                                constantly being produced and released from the mucous membranes. Bacteria that is
                                adhering to the cells are often expelled along with the cells they are attached.</li>
                            <li>The hair, mucous membranes and irregular chambers of the nose serve to trap much of the
                                inhaled debris.</li>
                            <li>The cilia present on the epithelial cells of the posterior nasal membranes, nasal
                                sinuses, bronchi and trachea sweep the trapped dust and microbes upward toward the
                                throat where they are swallowed or expelled by sneezing and coughing.</li>
                            <li>Swallowing of saliva can be thought of as a non-specific defense mechanism ,because
                                thousands of bacteria are removed from the oral cavity every time we swallow. Humans
                                swallow approximately I litre of saliva per day.</li>
                            <li>Digestive enzymes, acidity of the stomach (approx.PH I.5), alkalinity of the intestines
                                protects the digestive system from bacteria colonization.</li>
                            <li>Peristalsis and expulsion of feces serve to remove bacteria from the intestine. Bacteria
                                make up 50% of feces.</li>
                            <li>Microorganisms are continually flushed from the urethra by frequent urination and
                                expulsion of mucus secretions.</li>
                            <li>The low PH of vaginal fluid usually inhibits colonization of the vagina by pathogens.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>c). Microbial antagonism:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The indigenous microflora prevent colonization by new arrivals to a particular
                                anatomical site through competition for colonization sites, nutrients and production of
                                substances that kill other bacteria.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Its normal function is to store and deliver iron to the host cells.</li>
                            <li>Transferrin serves as a nonspecific host defense mechanism by sequestering iron and
                                depriving pathogens of these essential nutrient.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>b) Fever:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal body temperature fluctuates between 36.2c and 37.5c.Average 37.2c.</li>
                            <li>A body temperature greater than 37.8 c is generally considered to as be fever.</li>

                                substances</li>
                            <li>Fever acts as a body nonspecific host defense mechanism by:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stimulating white blood cells(leukocytes) to deploy and destroy invaders</li>
                                    <li>Reducing the available free plasma iron ,which limits growth of pathogens that
                                        require iron for replication and synthesis of toxins.</li>
                                    <li>Inducing the production of interleukin- I (IL-I) which causes the proliferation,

                        <ul>
                            <li>are small antiviral proteins produced by virus-infected cells .</li>
                            <li>They are called interferons because they "interfere" with viral replication.</li>
                            <li>There are three types of interferons alpha, beta and gamma induced by different stimuli,
                                including viruses ,tumors, bacteria and other foreign cells.
                                <ul>

                            <li>Interferons produced by a virus-infected cell are unable to save that cell from
                                destruction, but once they are released from that cell, they attach to the membranes of
                                surrounding cells and prevent viral replication from occurring in those cells.</li>
                            <li>Thus the spread of infection is inhibited ,allowing the body to fight the disease more

                        <ul>
                            <li>the body normally responds to local injury,irritation,microbial invasion or bacterial
                                toxin by a complex series of events collectively referred to as inflammation or
                                inflammatory response.</li>
                            <li>The 3 major events in acute inflammation are:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>An increase in the diameter of capillaries , which increases blood flow to the

                        </ul>

                        <h4>f). Phagocytosis:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>is the process by which phagocytes surround and engulf (ingest) foreign material.</li>
                            <li>The phagocytic white blood cells are called phagocytes.</li>
                            <li>The three major categories of leukocytes found in blood are-
                                <ul>
                                    <li>monocytes</li>
                                    <li>lymphocytes and</li>
                                    <li>granulocytes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The three types of granulocytes are:eosinophils,basophils and neutrophils.</li>
                            <li>The two most important groups of phagocytes in the human body are macrophages and
                                neutrophils; sometimes called 'professional phagocytes' because their major function is
                                phagocytosis.</li>
                            <li>Phagocytes serve as a 'clean-up crew' to rid the body of unwanted and often harmful
                                substances such as dead cells, unused cellular secretions, debris and microorganisms.
                            </li>
                            <li>Granulocytes-are named from the prominent cytoplasmic granules that they posses. The
                                phagocytic granulocytes include neutrophils and eosinophils .</li>
                            <li>Neutrophils are much more efficient in phagocytosis than eosinophils .</li>
                            <li>Macrophages-develop from monocytes during the inflammatory response to infections.</li>
                            <li>Those that leave the blood stream and migrate to infected areas are called wandering
                                macrophages. Fixed macrophages remain in the tissues and organs and serve to trap
                                foreign debris.</li>
                            <li>Macrophages are extremely efficient phagocytes. They are found in tissues of the
                                reticuloendothelial system(RES).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>g). Chemotaxis:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>phagocytosis begins when phagocytes move to the site where they are needed. The directed
                                migration is called chemotaxis and is the result of chemical attraction called
                                chemotaxic agents.</li>
                            <li>Chemotaxic agents produced that are produced by various cells of the human body are
                                called chemokines.</li>
                            <li>Chemotaxic agents are produced during the complement cascade and inflammation.</li>
                            <li>The phagocytes move along the concentration gradient, meaning they move from areas of
                                low concentration of chemotaxic agents to the area of the highest concentration.</li>
                            <li>The area of highest concentration is the site where the chemotaxic agents are being
                                produced or released-often the site of inflammation.</li>

                            <li>When a large proportion of people are immunized in a community, even those few people
                                who have not been vaccinated also get some protection because the disease becomes so
                                uncommon. This is called herd immunity.</li>
                            <li>It is mainly effective for those diseases that pass from man to man e.g measles, polio
                                and pertusis.</li>

                            <li><strong>Immunization:</strong>- is the process of protecting a person from a particular
                                disease.</li>
                            <li>It happens when a vaccine against a disease has been given.This is called active
                                immunization.</li>
                            <li>Some vaccines are made from live bacteria or viruses that have been modified enough not
                                to cause a severe infection, but they are still similar to the original bacteria or
                                viruses for the body.</li>
