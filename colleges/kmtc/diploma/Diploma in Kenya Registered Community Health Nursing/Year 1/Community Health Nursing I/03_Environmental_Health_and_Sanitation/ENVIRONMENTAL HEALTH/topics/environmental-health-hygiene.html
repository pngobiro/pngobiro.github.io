                        <p>The skin is an extensive and important organ containing many nerve endings, glands and blood vessels. A healthy skin should be firm, supple (shiny) and elastic. Cleanliness of the skin is very important for a lot of dirt collects on the skin surface.</p>
                        <p>This dirt is composed of:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Dried sebum.</li>
                            <li>Solids that are left by the evaporated sweat.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>If not washed out, the above will clog the pores of the secreting glands. In order to maintain the cleanliness of the skin, we need to have daily baths (warm or cold baths). We should clean our bodies with soap because soap removes dirt because of its alkaline nature which forms an emulsion with the oily sebum and the dirt is washed off with water.</p>

                        <p>Nurses should not have pointed or painted nails as they can injure the patient and self, and microorganisms can be harbored by them. Infection can set in if poorly cut, a condition known as Paronychia.</p>

                        <p>It is advisable to apply glycerin or Vaseline to the palms and hands. Wash hands and nails frequently with soap and water.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE FEET</h3>
                        <p>Clean feet daily and dry them thoroughly especially between the toes. Sweat glands in the feet are many and many people have excessive sweating, a condition called hyperhidrosis. This is offensive to some and can also cause soreness. Socks should be cleaned every day and feet should be cleaned at least twice per day.</p>
                        <p>Change socks & stockings frequently and do not re-use them. Some people apply spirit and deodorants which encourage evaporation. Shoes should be dusted daily and aired, and also cleaned inside. Using nice inner soles which can be washed daily is recommended.</p>

                            <li><strong>Callosities</strong> - caused by pressure and friction of the under surface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bunions</strong> - due to wearing sharp pointed shoes.</li>

                            <li>Leather shoes are the best because they are porous and allow air circulation.</li>
                            <li>They are also easy to clean.</li>
                            <li>The inner part should be firm and soft.</li>
                            <li>Heels should be low to avoid throwing the weight of the body ahead.</li>

                        <p>Accumulated food particles will cause decay and makes micro organisms attack the gum and teeth causing dental caries (teeth decay). This leads to insufficient chewing and thus ill health. Infected teeth can spread infections to other parts of the body. One can also use saline water for teeth care and gargling too.</p>
