\section*{ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH}

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Environmental health is the branch of public health that is concerned with all aspects of the natural and built environment that may affect human health. Wikipedia.

\section*{Officers}
- (Also known as Public Health officers)
- Responsible for carrying out measures for protecting public health, including administering and enforcing legislation related to environmental health and providing support to minimize health and safety hazards.

\section*{ENVIRONMENT TYPES}

\section*{Types of Environment}
1. Natural environment - is not man-made, such as Earth and all of its natural component including ground, water, flora and fauna. It is full of beauty and hazards.
2. Induced environment - are those been affected by human action e.g. highly polluted air that results from exhaust emissions of automobiles in heavily populated cities.
3. Controlled environment - is a natural or induced environment that has been changed in some way to reduce or eliminate potential environmental hazards e.g. a home or workplace that is cooled to reduce potential hazards associated with heat.
4. Artificial environment - one that fully created to prevent definite hazardous conditions from affecting people or material e.g. environment within the space shuttle.
5. Closed environment - one that is completely or almost completely shut off from natural environment. Both controlled and artificial environment must be closed.
6. Free environment - one that does not interfere with the free movement of air.

PUBLIC HEALTH ACT
- CAP 242 (revised-2012-from 1986)
- Commencement was $6{ }^{\text {th }}$ sept 1921
- Go to- www.kenyalaw.org
- Or Google public health Act.
- It is an act of parliament to make provision for securing and maintaining health
- (Students to read on the act)

\section*{HYGIENEOBJECTIVES (BY THE END OF THE SESSION)}
- Define personal hygiene
- Explain importance of maintaining

P/H
- Describe the factors involved in maintenance of P/H
- Analyze conditions which occur due to poor hygiene

\section*{HYGIENE}
- Hygiene is the study of health and observance of health rules.
- Study methods and means of preserving health.
- Hygiene is classified into two:-
1) Personal hygiene.
2) Communal hygiene.

\section*{PERSONAL HYGIENE}
- It's a branch of hygiene which deals with health maintenance in the individual in order to safe guard his own health and the health of others.
- By knowing and practicing the rules of hygiene and sanitation and adhering to the principles of good health and living

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF GOOD HEALTH AND LIVING}
- Preventive or prophylactic measures.
- Appropriate waste disposal.
- Maintenance of body cleanliness.
- Water treatment.
- Immunization.
- Aspect of diet or food safety.

\section*{2) PROMPT CARE WHEN INJURIES OR ILLNESS DEVELOP}

Personal health is the responsibility of each individual who should be able to keep himself physically fit so that one can make the greatest contribution to the community he/she is in.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING PERSONAL HYGIENE TO HEALTH}
- Personal hygiene contributes to health in several ways:-
1. It protects the individual against disease germs that are present in the environment.
2. It protects the family by reducing the spread of disease germs.

\section*{CONT}
3. It promotes health-
- This is a state of maximum, physical, mental(Psychological), social, spiritual well being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
4. It promotes morale.
- An individual will confidently face the others.

\section*{MEASURES TO PROTECT AND IMPROVE HEALTH}
1) Personal cleanliness.
2) Care of mouth and teeth.
3) Care of gut.
4) Food and drink.
5) Rest and recreation.
6) Protection against elements such as heat, cold, rain and wind.

\section*{CONT}
7). Protection against disease carrying insects.
8). Avoidance of sources of the disease such as ensuring that water is treated.
9). Proper disposal of waste to prevent environmental contamination.
10). Special protective measures such as wearing protective clothing depending on the environment we are in.

\section*{NOTE}
- There is need to cultivate a healthy mind and companionship.
- The individual needs to participate in group activities in order to avoid concentrating on personal depressing problems or feelings so as to keep a health mind.

\section*{PERSONAL CLEANLINESS}

We should keep our body and clothing clean.

\section*{SKIN}
- The skin as an extensive and important organ containing many nerve endings, glands and blood vessels.
A healthy skin be firm, supple (shiny) and elastic.
Cleanliness of the skin is very important for a lot of dirt collect in the skin surface.

\section*{CONT}
- This dirt is composed of :
- Dried sebum.
- Solids that are left by the evaporated sweat.
- Dust from environment.
- Micro-organisms.
- Epithelial scales.
- If not washed out-the above will clog the pores of the secreting glands
- In order to maintain the cleanliness of the skin, we need to have daily baths (warm or cold baths)
We should clean our bodies with soap because soap removes dirt because of its alkaline nature which forms an emulsion with the oily sebum and the dirt is washed off with water.

\section*{ADVANTAGES OF WARM BATHS}
The recommended temperature is $38^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ or $100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
Warm baths are refreshing and have a sedative action due to the soothing effect on the nerve endings.
Regulation of temperature.
Opening of the spores.
Relieve of cough illness-eliminates phlegm-the cause of irritation.
Accelerates blood circulation-avoiding migraine.
Relieve of stress.
Keep the skin moist and lubricated.

\section*{BENEFITS OF COLD BATH}
- Improved blood circulation
- Increases testosterone
- Increases energy and well being
- Strengthens immunity

\section*{STRUCTURES OF THE SKIN}


\section*{This was covered in anatomy and physiology}
Students need to revise on the skin
Draw and label the diagram of the skin

\section*{NOTE..........................
We are supposed to take adequate and well balanced diet in order to maintain an healthy skin.}
- Especially if there is an injury.
- New cells develop and there is repair of the damaged ones.

\section*{Functions of the skin}
- Will be covered later but students can revise their anatomy and physiology notes

\section*{SOME EFFECTS OF UN CLEANLINESS}
- Skin diseases e.g. acne, scabies, ring worms, pediculosis.
- Lice (Pediculosis).
- Bed bugs.
- Fleas.
- Bad smell-oral.
- Dental caries.

\section*{CLEANLINESS OF THE HEAD/HAIR}
- Proper care of the hair and daily brushing.
- Shampoo at frequent intervals for moisturizing and blood supply.
- Fresh air is also required for the hair.

\section*{HAND /NAILS}
- Hands Kept clean every time free from cracks and roughness.
- These occur due to exposure to cold wind, use of antiseptics and manual work.
- Nails should be cut short in a curve manner.

\section*{CONT}
${ }^{-}$Nurses should not have pointed or painted nails.
- Can injure the pt and self.
${ }^{-}$Micro-organisms can be harbored by them.
${ }^{-}$Infection can set in if poorly cut- Paronychia.

\section*{PARONYCHIA}

\section*{CONT....................}
- It is advisable to apply glycerin or Vaseline to the palms and hands
- Wash hands and nails frequently with soap and water.
-When should we was hands?

\section*{THE FEET}
- Clean feet daily and dry them thoroughly especially between the toes.
- Sweat glands in the feet are many and many people have excessive sweating a condition called hyperhydrosis.
- This is offensive to some and can also cause soreness.
- Socks should be cleaned every day and cleaning feet at least twice per day.

\section*{CONT}
- Change socks \& stockings frequently and no re-using
- Some people apply spirit and deodorants which encourage evaporation
- Shoes should be dusted daily and airedalso clean inside
- Using of nice inner soles which can be washed daily is recommended

\section*{SOME PROBLEMS THAT OCCUR IF FEET IS NOT CLEANED WELL}
${ }^{-}$Corns -from ill fitting shoes.
- Callosities-caused by pressure and friction of the under surface.
- Bunions -due to wearing sharp pointed shoes (see diagram next slide).

BUNION
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_25_842675fb4bc37d393bfeg-036.jpg?height=1328&width=2100&top_left_y=471&top_left_x=117)

\section*{HYPERTROPHIED NAILS (ONYCHAUXIS)}
- Hard thick nails mostly resulting in injuries
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_25_842675fb4bc37d393bfeg-037.jpg?height=1123&width=2192&top_left_y=698&top_left_x=133)

PREVENTION OF THE ABOVE
PROBLEMS
- Wear comfortable shoes which are well fitting and don't clamp the toes
- Leather shoes are the best because for they are porous and allow air circulation
- They are also easy to clean
- The inner part should be firm and soft
- Heels should be low to avoid throwing the weight of the body ahead

\section*{THE NURSE'S SHOE}
- Laced shoes are the best because they provide better support
- A medium heel tipped with rubber is advocated to help in quick and quiet walking
- Have at least 2 pairs -to alternate in wearing

\section*{CARE OF MOUTH AND TEETH}
${ }^{-}$If mouth is not cleaned, it can become infected and the tongue can develop sores and bad smell

\section*{Prevention_}
- Clean mouth in the morning and evening and if possible after each meal
- Use an effective tooth brush or the traditional sticks or roots
- Use up and down movements and also circular movements

\section*{CONT ...................................}
- One can use dental floss because tooth brush can not remove all the food remains
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_08_25_842675fb4bc37d393bfeg-041.jpg?height=1101&width=2159&top_left_y=755&top_left_x=169)

\section*{CONT............................
- Accumulated food particles will cause}
decay and makes micro organisms attack the gum and teeth causing dental caries(teeth decay)
- this leads to insufficient chewing and thus ill health.
- Infected teeth can spread infections to other parts of the body
- One can also use saline water for teeth care and gaggling too.

\section*{HYGIENE}
- Prevention of mouth diseases e.g. stomatitis, gingivitis, dental caries etc.
Improves self image
Promotes digestion
Gives pleasure in eating-taste of food
Good health teeth enhance speech
Cutting of cost-dental care

FACFORS THAT AFFECT OUR HEALTH
- Exercises
- Physical exercise are essential for health to be maintained
- Recreation
- Rest and sleep
- Posture
- Habit formation
${ }^{-}$Includes good and bad habits

\section*{NUTRITION}
- Nutrition can be defined as the study of food and how our bodies use food
- Main food groups
- Proteins
- Carbohydrates
- Fats and oils

Vitamins and minerals
water

\section*{ROLE OF FOOD IN THE BODY}
T) To provide energy, necessary for warmth and functioning of the body e.g. the heart requires energy to work, muscles to move etc
- Energy foods include-carbohydrates, fats and oils
2). Foods to build new cells and tissues- e.g. cells of the muscles replace worn out tissue or cells
- Foods rich in proteins include fish, eggs, milk, beans, meat etc

\section*{CONT}
3). Protection-protecting the body against diseases and facilitating assimilation and use of other nutrients, vitamins and minerals e.g. vegetables and fruits
4). Constituents-
${ }^{-}$It is involved in preparing hormones e.g. insulin, thyroxine etc
- Many foods belong to two categories -e.g. beans-provide proteins and carbohydrates

\section*{CONT}
- Some foods may be categorized but there is no single food that provides sufficient nutrients for growth and maintenance of the body.
- Therefore a proper diet is a mixed diet from 3 main groups.
- Food provide enjoyment, since eating and drinking are among pleasures of life.
- Food nourishes the body and the soul, this is by adding flavors to the food.

\section*{PROTEINS}
- Healthy adults require proteins for wearing out and repair.
- Healthy infants and children for growth
- Pregnant women require extra proteins for repair and for the fetus.
- Breastfeeding mothers require extra proteins for the baby and repair.

\section*{CONT............................
Sick adults require extra proteins}
because of worn out cells
- Sick children require proteins for worn out cells, growth and development.

\section*{PROTEIN CONTENT IN FOOD}

Most foods are a mixture of nutrient and contain water even if they look dry.
- Many foods have a lot of one nutrient and a little of other nutrients.
- Foods are called after the nutrient there is most- i.e. if a lot of protein-protein foods-etc -carbohydrates and fats -energy foods.
- Vitamins and minerals-protective foods
- some foods hardly contain any food nutrient e.g. soda.

\section*{PLANT FOODS WHICH GIVE}

PROTEINS
1)-legumes
- E.g. soya, beans, green grams, etcwhen dry they contain 20-30\% proteins-soya \& beans 34\%.
2)-Good staple food
- Maize, wheat, millet,
- Protein content-8-10 \%-they are foods of grass family.

\section*{CONT.........................}
3)-dark green leaves-
- Spinach, sukuma wiki, pumpkin leaves ( $3-7 \%$ ).
4)-Poor staple food-
- Roots forming e.g. yams, bananas, cassava etc-
- Protein content -1\%.

\section*{CONT}
5).Animal food protein
- All foods from animals give proteins except butter(fat from milk)-
- Some animal foods contain more proteins than others e.g.
- breast milk.
- fish(all types)-63\%.
- Meat (all types- cow, goat pig monkey mice.
- chicken -eggs.
${ }^{-}$insects- e.g. grass hoppers.

\section*{AMINO ACIDS}
- Proteins are made from amino acids-body makes some amino acids but have 8 amino acids the body cant make
- The amino acids made by the body are called essential amino acids
- Those it cant make are-non essential amino acids
- The essential amino acids are to be eaten in food-protein-e.g. methionine, lysine, leucin.

\section*{REFERENCE PROTEINS}
- Mothers milk and eggs protein provide protein whose amino acids are perfect for body building
- These proteins are therefore used as a reference to compare the usefulness of other proteins for body building e.g.
- Maize contains very little amino acid-lysin but it has enough methionine amino acids
- Peas have more lysin than methionine.

NET PROTEIN UTILIZATION (NPU)
- A measure of the quality of a food.
- NPU means the amount to which proteins are used for body building.
- Eggs and mothers milk have an NPU of 100\%.
- Proteins that are only partly used for body building have an NPU of less than $100 \%$.

CONT.............................
- Maize e.g. has an NPU of 55\%
- Animal proteins have a higher NPU than plants
${ }^{-}$E.g. -fish-83\% and soya -56\%

\section*{OVERVIEW_}
- The food category depends on the nutrient which contains in higher quantities (the most in food).
- When teaching on nutrition start with proteins because they cannot be substituted.
- The grass family carbohydrates are more superior than root.
${ }^{-}$Irish potatoes superior than sweet potatoes -if not peeled.
- Use real teaching aids/food items.

METHODS OF FOOD STORAGE AND
COOKING
Vegetables
- The term vegetables includes some fruits e.g. tomatoes, pumpkins
- Leafs such as sukuma and cabbage
- Roots such as carrots, flowers such as cauliflower
- Vegetables are nearly eaten soon after they are harvested and not stored for long periods

\section*{CONT}
- Good habit to have a kitchen garden
- Some vegetable grow wild in rural areas
- Pumpkins can be stored for several months with little loss of nutrients
- Tomatoes and vegetables may be stored but loose some vitamins.

\section*{CONT}
- Prolonged cooking lowers vitamin C content.
Cook for 20 minutes only.
Many vegetables contain enzyme oxidase which becomes active when vegetable is cut or bruised.
The enzyme is not active if vegetables are intact.
Oxidase enzyme destroys vitamin C.

\section*{PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES}
Preferably picked fresh from garden.
Wash in running water, avoid soaking cut vegetable.
Don't leave cut vegetables for long.
Cook for 20 minutes not to destroy vitamin C
Plant vegetable in our small gardens -even sacks
Waste water can be utilized

\section*{FRUITS}
- Some fruits grow wild while others are planted
- The main nutrient value of fruits is vitamin C
- Fruits such as avocado and a few others fat, proteins or starch.
- Fruits may not be stored for long.
- Prolonged storage and cooking can make them loss some nutrients.

\section*{PREPARATION FOR STORAGE OF FRUITS}
- Wash fruits and remove skin and seeds.
- For every 5 kilos of fruits use 3 kg of sugar.
- Place in a cooking pot and add water to cover fruits.
- Simmer for one hour and allow to cool
${ }^{-}$Put in a container with a lid/cover well fitting.

CEREALS(MAIZE, MILLET, SORGHUM, RICE)
- Highly milled products-can be stored better.
- Low fat content reduces chance for unpleasant smell and low vitamin content makes it less attractive to insects and pests.

\section*{CONT.}
- The dried seeds can be kept/stored
- Variety such as maize are liable to be attacked by weevils and other insects
- Pesticides can be used to prevent attack by weevils
- Avoid excess pesticides so as to keep the food safe for consumption

\section*{CONT}
- Cereals must be washed thoroughly to remove the pesticide
- Excess water can be removed to cook other foods e.g. soup or rice

\section*{STARCH ROOTS}
- May not be stored for long like the cereals-just a few months
- Prolonged cooking should be avoided
- Excess water can prepare other foods
- Peeling Irish potatoes reduces nutritive value

\section*{LEGUMES}

\section*{- Just like cereals they can be dried and stored}
- Use of insecticides is encouraged.
- Legumes can be soaked in cold water before cooking -no nutritional value is lost.
- Avoid prolonged cooking and excess water
- The excess water can prepare other foods.

NB: Control of rats, birds, monkeys from reaching food stores is important to food destruction.

\section*{FISH AND MEAT}
- These animal products deteriorate very rapidly
- They soften and begin to produce an offensive smell called putrefaction
- This process is due bacterial action
- Most preservation methods limit or prevent growth of bacteria

\section*{PRESERVATIONS}

\section*{Smoking}

Meat cut into strips about 15 by $2.5-5 \mathrm{~cm}$ in diameter.
They are placed on a rack made of wood or expanded metal over a slow fire.
Smoke passes over the surfaces of the meat
Fish are preserved the same way after degutting -the gut contains many bacteria.

\section*{II).DRYING}
- Meat, fish, vegetables can be sun dried
- Most bacteria do not readily multiply in a dry medium
- The vegetables and fruits loose some vitamins
iii).Salting
Used for fish and meat
There is the dry method and wet method

\section*{DRYMETHOD}
- Meat is cut into strips just like smoking then use 300 gms of salt for each 5 kgs of meat

\section*{WET METHOD}
- Cut meat into strips.
- Use 500 gms salt for 5 Its of water.
- Get a 20 It container.

\section*{CONT.......................
1 0Its-water -I kg-salt.}
- Soak and leave it for 3 days.
- Remove after 3 days.
- Hang to dry just like in the dry method.

\section*{Canning and bottling}
- Used to preserve cooked cereals, legumes, and fruits
Carried out in industriessome nutrients are lost during the process
- The food remain sealed until ready for consumption

\section*{Thing to remember about}
sealed food
- Blow tins (expanded tins)
- Indicates formation of gas by clostridium bacteria and not fit for consumption
- Dental tins
${ }^{-}$Leaking tins
-Poorly sealed tins or the iron has been eroded by the contents

\section*{Labeling}
- The label should show content and what has been added into the content
- Date of manufacture

\section*{Environment}
${ }^{-}$should be hygienic
${ }^{-}$Both the materials and the people

\section*{Eggs}
- Not stored for long periods
- Can be tested by putting in water -the good one sink and the bad one float

\section*{Milk and milk products}
- Milk may be boiled, consumed sour or pasteurized

\section*{Types of milk}
- Raw milk-from cow
- Skimmed milk -fat removed
- Whole powdered milk-dried whole
- Evaporated and condensed milk
- Homogenized milk (UHT)-cream evenly distributed
- Pasteurized milk-heated in high temperatures for a short while then cooled

\section*{Other methods of food preservations}

\section*{Refrigeration}
- Freezing arrests bacteria and frozen foods can be kept for long
- No removing and returning the food
- cut food in small pieces and remove only what_is required for cooking
Avoid opening the fridge

\section*{Chemicals}
- Certain chemicals are added to the food during processing for preservation
- May include acids or alkaline
- The food can either be canned or bottled

\section*{Food protection-}
- Food is an organic substance
- It grows bacteria very easily and so contamination is also easy
- Sometimes the microbes are already present in the food
- Other organisms are introduced during food preparation or during serving

\section*{Contaminants of food include:-}

\section*{Moulds}

These are fungi spread by spores
They grow on jam, fruits, bread etc
The spores exist in the air and grow in dumb conditions
2).Bacteria

Types:-
Due to poison or toxins made by bacteria in food
Actual infection of the bacteria originating from the bowel due poor hand washing

\section*{Food poisoning due to toxins}
- There are different types e.g staphylococcus
${ }^{-}$It comes from boils or sores on hand of food handlers
- If the bacteria is introduced into the food, it multiplies if the food is in a warm place
- Food commonly affected are milk and meat

\section*{Symptoms include:-}
- Acute diarrhoea and vomiting
- Occurs a few hours after ingestion

Botulin poisoning (botulism)
- Caused by a toxin from clostridium
- Botulinum-an anaerobic bacteria
- It affects nerves and can be fatal mostly found in tinned food

\section*{Food poisoning due to bacteria infection:-}
- The commonest organism is salmonella-causes typhoid fever
- Source may be pests e.g. rats, rodents, convalescent patients( carriers)
- Duck eggs may also have salmonella Signs and symptoms
After 24 hrs-of eating the fooddiarrhoea, vomiting and fever occurs

\section*{Prevention of bacteria poisoning}
1) Cleanliness of food preparation
2) Washing hands
3) People with sores and wounds in their hands should not handle food
4) Kitchen to be rat proof

\section*{Cont..................}
5) Minimal handling of food-avoid taking out and returning food in the fridge
6) Food cupboards should be fly proof
7) Health education on food handling
8) Proper food preservation

\section*{Food poisoning due to chemicals or poisonous foods}
- Arsenic poisonous chemicals or insecticides or other poisonous chemicals are accidentally introduced to food
- Can cause of D \& V or even death
- Sometimes poisonous plants e.g. mushrooms or fish may be eaten by mistake

\section*{Intestinal anthrax}
- Causative organism is a bacteria called-bacillus anthracis
- Happens when an animal is consumed-affected
- The consumers develop intestinal anthrax
- The bacteria is an endospore forming

\section*{RVF-(rift valley fever)}
- A viral disease spread by a mosquito mostly among cows
- Humans are affected when they handle the meat from an infected animal

\section*{Food budgeting}
${ }^{-}$Budgeting is planning to spend money wisely
${ }^{-}$All families must budget for food among other H/H utilities
- Careful budgeting is vital so as to feed the family
${ }^{-}$Food e.g. cereals can be bought in large quantities-
- Other foods can be bought daily
${ }^{-}$Need to plant seasonal fruits

\section*{Cont............}
- Consider the following while budgeting:-
- Minimum family budget
- Basic salary especially for the lowest paid worker
${ }^{-}$Food takes almost 2/3rds of the budget fro the lowest paid worker if a family has 6 people
- The jobless are worse

\section*{Food selling}
- Avoid selling family food
- Sell only excess food
- Families tend to sell food after harvest only to buy later at a higher price
- Farmers must be encouraged to plant more food
- Encourage better food storage techniques

\section*{Buying}
- The nurse should be able to understand the specific food prices
- This will enable to make a good judgment when educating on food security and balanced diet

\section*{Community hygiene(Environmental sanitation)}
- Keep environment as safe as possible for man use
- Environmental health programmes emphasizes on prevention, control and reducing health hazards
- It involves promoting and maintaining good health standards

\section*{Cont.....................
Environmental health}
programmes are coordinated with other health needs of the community
- E.g. curative, preventive and promotive health
- Environmental sanitation programmes aims at reaching certain health standards on:-

\section*{Cont......................}
- Water supply
- Food hygiene
- Solid waste and water disposal
- Housing
- Control of vector and rodents
- School sanitation

\section*{Water supply}
- Pure water contains some minerals salts
- It is- clear,
- sparkling,
- colorless
- and tasteless

\section*{Water contaminants}
1) Disease producing organisms e.g. bacteria
2) Parasites e.g. snails
3) Chemicals -from factories and farms-can be poisonous
4) Vectors e.g. mosquitoes which breed in water

\section*{Water sources}
- Surface water such as dams
- Springs
- Wells-deep and shallow
- Rivers
- Rain water

NB:-
Water should be protected from contamination to avoid poor health

\section*{Protection of water supply}
- It is easier to protect water from contamination than to treat when contaminated
i). Spring water
- The "eye" of the spring need to be protected
${ }^{-}$Dig a trench $1 / 3^{\text {rd }}$ of a meter below the eye
${ }^{-}$Lay stones along the trench
- Cover with reeds or grass

\section*{Cont.......................}
${ }^{-}$Make steps and a path at the side of the spring
- The radius of the protected area should be 3 meters
- Construct a drain to protect contamination form soil-20 meters radius
- Fence all round-radius of 35 meters
- No latrine nearby or discharge from industrial waste

\section*{ii) Wells-deep and shallow}
- Put measure to protect from contamination
- 35 meters away from any pollution e.g. latrine
- Enclose a radius of 35 meters
- Have a cover -concrete-and slopping
- A well fitting cover-walls should have water proof cement
${ }^{-}$Raise water using a pump if possible to minimize contamination
- Usually contaminated by excreta from different sources
- Cleanest water mostly in the middle-sunlight helps in purification
- Not easy to protect river water

\section*{iv).Rain water}
- Collected from roofs of houses with corrugated iron sheets and earth tiles
- The water is safe if collected into tanks
- Scrub the tank once per year
- Cover tanks to avoid mosquito breeding
${ }^{-}$First rain water should not be allowed into the tank

\section*{Methods of water purification \\ 1).Boiling \\ - All water apart water from water works should be boiled}

\section*{2).Distillation \\ - Steam is collected, cooled and condensed back to water}

\section*{3).Natural self-purification}
- The 3 pot system
- If water is allowed to stand -most harmful micro organisms which may have gotten into the water may die
- Two big pots used
- First pot stands for 24 hours
- Water emptied into a smaller pot
- The second pot follows same procedure

\section*{4).Filtration}
- Can be done in small scale for HH use or large scale
- Different types of filters are used
- One common filter is made up of sand and stone layers
- Bottom layer-stones
- Middle layer-coarse sand
- Top layer-fine sand
- The same applies to large scale filtration

\section*{5).Chlorination}
- After filtration chlorine can be added to kill remaining microbes
- Water from other sources might also be chlorinated
${ }^{-}$E.g. water guard etc

\section*{Diseases associated with water}

\section*{Classified as:-}
- Water borne diseases
- Water acts as the passive vehicle for the infecting agent e.g. cholera, Typhoid, lambliasis, etc
- Water washed diseases
- Occur due to lack of adequate water e.g. scabies, skin diseases and eye infections
- Water related diseases
${ }^{-}$Because insects breed in the water e.g. malaria

\section*{Large scale water treatment}
- Raw water
- Water is directed into certain direction where it passes through a coarse screen-large particles are removed e.g. logs
- The water then passes through a medium coarse screen-medium sized particles are removed
- A third screen removes smaller particles

\section*{The particles are removed and water continues to flow}

\section*{- Weirs are created to reduce the force of the flow}
Water enters a tank for natural segmentation to take place
It passes through a second tank where segmentation is chemically aided by adding Aluminum sulphate
- Fine particles settle to the bottom a process called flocculation
- Water is directed to another tank where filtration takes place
- Water is then analysed to know the amount of microbes to know the amount of chlorine to be used
- Chlorine is the added a process called chlorination
- Water PH now is around 7.8-7.2
- To make water natural again with a PH of 7, sodium bicarbonate is added
- Water is directed to another tank for stabilization-chlorine and sodium bicarbonate mix
- The water is the directed to a reservoir for consumption

\section*{Refuse disposal}
${ }^{-}$Refuse collection and disposal
TYPES OF REFUSE
1).Dry rubbish
- Consist of tins, bottles, paper, dry leaves, dust, rugs etc

\section*{Urban}
- Rubbish is put in dust bins and emptied by the local authorities
- rubbish can be burnt or buried by a system called controlled tippingused to fill unwanted gullies and depressions
- In rural areas it is burned and buried
- The ash can be used in the farms to enrich soil

\section*{Vegetable and food waste}
- Consist of left over food, vegetables, peelings, garden weeds, fat and grease etc

In urban setting
- Wrapped in papers and put in dust bins
- Need for segregation of the waste

In rural areas
- Composting is commonly used which later is used as manure
- To be on the leeward side to avoid smell
- About 10 meters away from the house
- Made by digging a hole-should be at least 5 mts by 2.5 mts bt 1.5 deep
- Divide into 2 portions

\section*{cont................}
${ }^{-}$Food and wet waste should be covered with soil or grass to avoid house flies
- This helps it to decompose faster-should be turned after 30 days then after 60 days-it is ready as manure after 3 months-(90 days)

\section*{Methods of refuse disposal(recommeded)}
1) Compost pit
2) Burning
3) Burying
- This is very applicable in the rural areas

\title{
Process of waste management:- \\ 1)Segregation \\ 2)Handling \\ 3)Transportation \\ 4) Disposal
}

\section*{Institutions}
Compost pit
Incineration
Burying
Controlled tipping

\section*{Markets}
- Controlled tipping
- Incineration

Industries
- Controlled tipping
- Incineration
${ }^{\bullet}$ By product cycling
NB:-
${ }^{-}$Plastic bags are a nuisance in public health

\section*{Waste water disposal}
- Home stead with piped water Have open concrete drain which lead to a soaking pit or kitchen garden
Soaking pit can be filled with broken stones or cover with a concrete slab

\section*{Markets and town centres}
- Should be drained into the sewage works

Industries
${ }^{-}$Drained into soaking pit
- Can under go chemical treatment before draining into COTNORTORO CVICTOM

\section*{Excreta disposal}
i. Pit latrine
ii. Toilet

Water carriage system
Lavatory
Water closet
Water borne sewage with flush toilets

\section*{The pit latrine}
- Dug at least 20 meters from the house on the leeward side
- At least 40 meters away from any water source
- Each HH should have an excreta disposal facility
- At least have a slab of concrete
- Well ventilated
- Fly proof-gauze wire put
- Well lit

\section*{Cont...................}
- The hole can have a cover made of wood with a handle
- Well roofed where possible
- Kept clean in and out all the time
- Construct a new one when almost full or remove

Parts of a latrine
- Hole in the ground
- Squatting place
- A hut for privacy and extreme weather
- A cover made of timber
- A door
- air vents
${ }^{-}$Fly trap
- Ventilated improved pit
- Have a pipe, with a fly trap
- This fly trap is usually fine gauze wire
${ }^{-}$Modified VIP
- this one has fly trap and also has space where papers or dry leaves are burnt
- Smoke is allowed to get into the Pit
- This helps to kill the flies

\section*{The trench pit latrine (multiple pits)}
${ }^{-}$The trench is dug to have many pits
- Divided in to the number of latrines needed
- Structure is constructed
- Method used in rural schools

\section*{Water carriage system}
- More common in towns
- Most convenient and healthy method of excreta disposal
${ }^{-}$Urine and excreta is passed into a pan
- This is cleaned by flushing water from a tank into the pan

\section*{Cont}
- The pan is connected into a sewage disposal system
- This runs into a septic tank
- Excreta flows from the main sewer through a large screen removing rubbish e.g. paper
${ }^{-}$It then flows into a grit channel to remove sand and grit

\section*{Cont...........}
- Then it flows into a settling tank where the Solids go to the bottomthis is called sludge
- The fluids remain on top the fluid it is made pure by exposing into air and special bacteria while sprinkling it over rough stones in filters which are coated with the special bacteria

\section*{Cont................}
- The fluids is then drained into a nearby river or Lake
- This sludge is taken off separately digested into tanks
- Allowed to dry and sold as Manure for the garden

\section*{The septic tank}
- Used where there is no sewage work but a water sewage system
- Sewage is carried by pipes into big tanks some distance away from the building
- Scum forms on the top part of the tank and the special bacteria working in the sewage underneath the scum makes it harmless
The sludge must be emptied

\section*{Cont.............}
- That harmless fluid very slowly flows away into a soak pit and then through the soil
- The tank is built into the underground and is always kept covered

\section*{Other factors related to health}

Lighting
- Good light is important to good health
- The house should be provided with adequate windows and safe lights

\section*{Types of light}
1. Natural light/sunlight
2. Artificial light

Natural light
- The best light
- Includes ultra violet rays which destroys bacteria
- Act on the skin to make vitamin D

\section*{Artificial lights}
${ }^{-}$Includes lamps, candles and electricity
- Electricity produces clean light but can cause fires
- Interior walls should be painted white
${ }^{-}$Lights in the ward should be arranged to ensure patients comfort
${ }^{-}$Lights for e.g. reading, sawing should be strong enough and concentrated in a good position

\section*{Note}
${ }^{-}$It is dangerous to work switches with wet hands or while standing in water

\section*{Effects of poor light}
- Students homework

\section*{Ventilation}
- Free passage of air through a building
- A good house should be well ventilated to keep or leave in it healthy and free from droplet infection
- Germs content in the air are increased by overcrowding

\section*{Types of ventilation}
1. Natural
2. Mechanical - fans and airconditioning unit used in buildings
- Living in poorly ventilated rooms produces and increases the rate of infection with respiratory diseases

\section*{Warmth and heating}
${ }^{-}$Important for people living in low climactic regions

- Be specific and mention the diseases they cause e.g. plague

The life cycle of a house fly is 10
days
- Eggs are laid in warm organic waste e.g manure, excreta, decaying vegetables, left over foods
- The body of the house fly and legs are hairy and so they carry bacteria
- The house fly dissolves food with saliva before they eat it
${ }^{-}$It also vomits and defecates on the
