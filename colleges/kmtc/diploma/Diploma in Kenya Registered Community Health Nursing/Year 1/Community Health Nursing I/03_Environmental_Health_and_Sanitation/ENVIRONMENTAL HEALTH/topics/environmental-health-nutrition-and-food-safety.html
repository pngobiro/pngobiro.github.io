                        <p>Nutrition can be defined as the study of food and how our bodies use food.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Main food groups</h3>
                        <ul>

                        <ol>
                            <li>To provide energy, necessary for warmth and functioning of the body e.g. the heart requires energy to work, muscles to move etc. Energy foods include carbohydrates, fats and oils.</li>
                            <li>Foods to build new cells and tissues - e.g. cells of the muscles replace worn out tissue or cells. Foods rich in proteins include fish, eggs, milk, beans, meat etc.</li>
                            <li>Protection - protecting the body against diseases and facilitating assimilation and use of other nutrients, vitamins and minerals e.g. vegetables and fruits.</li>
                            <li>Constituents - It is involved in preparing hormones e.g. insulin, thyroxine etc. Many foods belong to two categories - e.g. beans-provide proteins and carbohydrates.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Some foods may be categorized but there is no single food that provides sufficient nutrients for growth and maintenance of the body. Therefore a proper diet is a mixed diet from the 3 main groups. Food provides enjoyment, since eating and drinking are among pleasures of life. Food nourishes the body and the soul, this is by adding flavors to the food.</p>

                        <p>Healthy adults require proteins for wearing out and repair. Healthy infants and children for growth. Pregnant women require extra proteins for repair and for the fetus. Breastfeeding mothers require extra proteins for the baby and repair.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PROTEIN CONTENT IN FOOD</h3>
                        <p>Most foods are a mixture of nutrients and contain water even if they look dry. Many foods have a lot of one nutrient and a little of other nutrients. Foods are called after the nutrient there is most- i.e. if a lot of protein-protein foods-etc -carbohydrates and fats -energy foods. Vitamins and minerals-protective foods. Some foods hardly contain any food nutrient e.g. soda.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PLANT FOODS WHICH GIVE PROTEINS</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Legumes:</strong> E.g. soya, beans, green grams, etc. When dry they contain 20-30% proteins - soya & beans 34%.</li>
                            <li><strong>Good staple food:</strong> Maize, wheat, millet. Protein content - 8-10% - they are foods of grass family.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dark green leaves:</strong> Spinach, sukuma wiki, pumpkin leaves (3-7%).</li>
                            <li><strong>Poor staple food:</strong> Roots forming e.g. yams, bananas, cassava etc. Protein content - 1%.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Animal food protein</h4>
                        <p>All foods from animals give proteins except butter (fat from milk). Some animal foods contain more proteins than others e.g. breast milk, fish (all types) - 63%, meat (all types- cow, goat pig monkey mice), chicken, eggs, insects (e.g. grass hoppers).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">AMINO ACIDS</h4>
                        <p>Proteins are made from amino acids. The body makes some amino acids but there are 8 amino acids the body can't make. The amino acids made by the body are called non-essential amino acids. Those it can't make are essential amino acids, which must be eaten in food (e.g. methionine, lysine, leucin).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">REFERENCE PROTEINS</h4>
                        <p>Mother's milk and egg protein provide protein whose amino acids are perfect for body building. These proteins are therefore used as a reference to compare the usefulness of other proteins for body building e.g. Maize contains very little amino acid-lysin but it has enough methionine amino acids. Peas have more lysin than methionine.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">NET PROTEIN UTILIZATION (NPU)</h4>
                        <p>A measure of the quality of a food. NPU means the amount to which proteins are used for body building. Eggs and mother's milk have an NPU of 100%. Proteins that are only partly used for body building have an NPU of less than 100%. Maize e.g. has an NPU of 55%. Animal proteins have a higher NPU than plants e.g. -fish-83% and soya -56%.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vegetables</h3>
                        <p>The term vegetables includes some fruits e.g. tomatoes, pumpkins, leaves such as sukuma and cabbage, roots such as carrots, and flowers such as cauliflower. Vegetables are best eaten soon after they are harvested and not stored for long periods. It is a good habit to have a kitchen garden. Prolonged cooking lowers vitamin C content; cook for 20 minutes only. Many vegetables contain the enzyme oxidase which becomes active when a vegetable is cut or bruised, destroying vitamin C.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PREPARATION OF VEGETABLES</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preferably picked fresh from garden.</li>
                            <li>Wash in running water, avoid soaking cut vegetable.</li>
                            <li>Don't leave cut vegetables for long.</li>
                            <li>Cook for 20 minutes not to destroy vitamin C.</li>
                            <li>Plant vegetables in our small gardens - even sacks.</li>
                            <li>Waste water can be utilized.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">FRUITS</h3>
                        <p>The main nutrient value of fruits is vitamin C, though some like avocado provide fat, proteins, or starch. Fruits may not be stored for long. Prolonged storage and cooking can make them lose some nutrients.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PREPARATION FOR STORAGE OF FRUITS</h4>
                        <p>Wash fruits and remove skin and seeds. For every 5 kilos of fruits use 3 kg of sugar. Place in a cooking pot and add water to cover fruits. Simmer for one hour and allow to cool. Put in a container with a well-fitting lid/cover.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CEREALS (MAIZE, MILLET, SORGHUM, RICE)</h3>
                        <p>Highly milled products can be stored better. Low fat content reduces chance for unpleasant smell and low vitamin content makes it less attractive to insects and pests. The dried seeds can be stored. Variety such as maize are liable to be attacked by weevils and other insects. Pesticides can be used to prevent attack by weevils. Avoid excess pesticides so as to keep the food safe for consumption. Cereals must be washed thoroughly to remove the pesticide. Excess water can be used to cook other foods e.g. soup or rice.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">STARCH ROOTS</h3>
                        <p>May not be stored for long like the cereals - just a few months. Prolonged cooking should be avoided. Excess water can prepare other foods. Peeling Irish potatoes reduces nutritive value.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LEGUMES</h3>
                        <p>Just like cereals they can be dried and stored. Use of insecticides is encouraged. Legumes can be soaked in cold water before cooking - no nutritional value is lost. Avoid prolonged cooking and excess water. The excess water can prepare other foods.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note"><p>Control of rats, birds, and monkeys from reaching food stores is important to prevent food destruction.</p></aside>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">FISH AND MEAT</h3>
                        <p>These animal products deteriorate very rapidly. They soften and begin to produce an offensive smell called putrefaction. This process is due to bacterial action. Most preservation methods limit or prevent growth of bacteria.</p>

                        <p>Meat cut into strips about 15 by 2.5-5 cm in diameter. They are placed on a rack made of wood or expanded metal over a slow fire. Smoke passes over the surfaces of the meat. Fish are preserved the same way after degutting - the gut contains many bacteria.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">DRYING</h3>
                        <p>Meat, fish, vegetables can be sun dried. Most bacteria do not readily multiply in a dry medium. The vegetables and fruits lose some vitamins.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Salting</h3>
                        <p>Used for fish and meat. There is the dry method and wet method.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>DRY METHOD:</strong> Meat is cut into strips just like smoking then use 300 gms of salt for each 5 kgs of meat.</li>
                            <li><strong>WET METHOD:</strong> Cut meat into strips. Use 500 gms salt for 5 lts of water. Get a 20 lt container. For 10 lts water, use 1 kg salt. Soak and leave it for 3 days. Remove after 3 days. Hang to dry just like in the dry method.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Canning and bottling</h3>
                        <p>Used to preserve cooked cereals, legumes, and fruits. Carried out in industries; some nutrients are lost during the process. The food remain sealed until ready for consumption.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Things to remember about sealed food:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Blown tins (expanded tins):</strong> Indicates formation of gas by clostridium bacteria and not fit for consumption.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dented tins / Leaking tins / Poorly sealed tins:</strong> The iron may have been eroded by the contents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The label should show content, what has been added, and the date of manufacture. The environment for processing should be hygienic, including materials and people.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Eggs</h3>
                        <p>Not stored for long periods. Can be tested by putting in water - the good one sinks and the bad one floats.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Milk and milk products</h3>
                        <p>Milk may be boiled, consumed sour or pasteurized.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Raw milk:</strong> from cow</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Refrigeration:</strong> Freezing arrests bacteria and frozen foods can be kept for long. Do not remove and return food. Cut food in small pieces and remove only what is required for cooking. Avoid opening the fridge.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemicals:</strong> Certain chemicals are added to the food during processing for preservation. May include acids or alkaline. The food can either be canned or bottled.</li>

                        <p>Food is an organic substance. It grows bacteria very easily and so contamination is also easy. Sometimes the microbes are already present in the food. Other organisms are introduced during food preparation or during serving.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Contaminants of food include:</h3>
                        <h4>1. Moulds</h4>
                        <p>These are fungi spread by spores. They grow on jam, fruits, bread etc. The spores exist in the air and grow in damp conditions.</p>
                        <h4>2. Bacteria</h4>
                        <p>Types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to poison or toxins made by bacteria in food.</li>
                            <li>Actual infection of the bacteria originating from the bowel due to poor hand washing.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Food poisoning due to toxins</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Staphylococcus:</strong> It comes from boils or sores on hand of food handlers. If the bacteria is introduced into the food, it multiplies if the food is in a warm place. Food commonly affected are milk and meat. Symptoms include acute diarrhoea and vomiting, occurring a few hours after ingestion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Botulin poisoning (botulism):</strong> Caused by a toxin from Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic bacteria. It affects nerves and can be fatal, mostly found in tinned food.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Food poisoning due to bacteria infection</h4>
                        <p>The commonest organism is Salmonella, which causes typhoid fever. Source may be pests e.g. rats, rodents, convalescent patients (carriers). Duck eggs may also have salmonella. Signs and symptoms appear after 24 hrs of eating the food: diarrhoea, vomiting and fever occurs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention of bacteria poisoning</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cleanliness of food preparation areas.</li>
                            <li>Washing hands.</li>
                            <li>People with sores and wounds in their hands should not handle food.</li>
                            <li>Kitchen to be rat proof.</li>
                            <li>Minimal handling of food - avoid taking out and returning food in the fridge.</li>
                            <li>Food cupboards should be fly proof.</li>
                            <li>Health education on food handling.</li>
                            <li>Proper food preservation.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Other Foodborne Illnesses</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chemical Poisoning:</strong> Arsenic, insecticides or other poisonous chemicals accidentally introduced to food can cause D&V or even death. Sometimes poisonous plants e.g. mushrooms or fish may be eaten by mistake.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intestinal anthrax:</strong> Causative organism is a bacteria called Bacillus anthracis. Happens when an affected animal is consumed. The consumers develop intestinal anthrax. The bacteria is an endospore former.</li>
                            <li><strong>RVF (Rift Valley Fever):</strong> A viral disease spread by a mosquito mostly among cows. Humans are affected when they handle the meat from an infected animal.</li>

                        <p>Budgeting is planning to spend money wisely. All families must budget for food among other household utilities. Careful budgeting is vital so as to feed the family. Food e.g. cereals can be bought in large quantities. Other foods can be bought daily. Need to plant seasonal fruits.</p>
                        <p>Consider the following while budgeting:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Minimum family budget.</li>
                            <li>Basic salary especially for the lowest paid worker.</li>
                            <li>Food takes almost 2/3rds of the budget for the lowest paid worker if a family has 6 people.</li>
                            <li>The jobless are worse.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Food selling</h3>
                        <p>Avoid selling family food. Sell only excess food. Families tend to sell food after harvest only to buy later at a higher price. Farmers must be encouraged to plant more food. Encourage better food storage techniques.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Buying</h3>
                        <p>The nurse should be able to understand the specific food prices. This will enable them to make a good judgment when educating on food security and balanced diet.</p>
