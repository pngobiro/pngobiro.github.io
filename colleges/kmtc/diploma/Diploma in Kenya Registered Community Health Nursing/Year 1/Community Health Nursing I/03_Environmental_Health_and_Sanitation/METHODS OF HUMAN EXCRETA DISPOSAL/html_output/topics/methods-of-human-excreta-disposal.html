                Safe disposal of excreta, so that it does not contaminate the
                environment, water, food or hands, is essential for ensuring a
                healthy environment and for protecting personal health. This can
                be accomplished in many ways, some requiring water, others
                requiring little or none. Regardless of method, the safe
                disposal of human faeces is one of the principal ways of
                breaking the faecal-oral disease transmission cycle. Sanitation
                is therefore a critical barrier to disease transmission.
              </p>
              <p>
                Plans for locating sanitation facilities, and for treating and
                removing waste, must consider cultural issues, particularly as
                sanitation is usually focused on the household. Excreta disposal
                may be a difficult subject for a community to discuss: it may be
                taboo, or people may not like to discuss issues they regard as
                personal and unclean. In some cases, people may feel that
                sanitation facilities are not appropriate for children, or that
                children's faeces are not harmful. In others, separate
                facilities may be required for men and women, and it may be
                necessary to locate the facilities so that no one can be seen
                entering the latrine building. If the disposal facilities smell
                and are a breeding ground for flies, people may not use them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Health improvement comes from the proper use of sanitation
                facilities, not simply their physical presence, and they may be
                abandoned if the level of service does not meet the social and
                cultural needs of community members at an affordable cost, as
                shown in Figure 4.1. Within a community, several different
                sanitation options may be required, with varying levels of
                convenience and cost (sometimes called a sanitation ladder). The
                advantage of this approach is that it allows households to
                progressively upgrade sanitation facilities over time.

                <p>
                  Cartage is the most basic form of excreta disposal-faeces are
                  collected in a container and disposed of daily. An example is
                  the bucket latrine, in which household wastes are collected in
                  buckets under a hole in the floor of a specific room. Each
                  day, the bucket is emptied into a larger container and the
                  contents disposed of. Bucket latrines should not be promoted
                  because they pose health risks to both users and collectors
                  and may spread disease. If cartage is considered for your
                  community, a vault latrine (a latrine where wastes are stored
                  in a sealed container) that is mechanically emptied on a
                  regular basis is a better choice.

              </h3>
              <div class="content-card">
                <p>
                  In most pit latrine systems, faecal matter is stored in a pit
                  and left to decompose. Unless specifically designed, pit
                  latrines do not require periodic emptying; once a pit is full
                  it is sealed and a new pit dug. If faecal matter is left to
                  decompose in dry conditions for at least two years, the
                  contents can be safely emptied manually and the pit reused.
                  Indeed, some pit latrines are designed to allow faecal matter
                  to compost and be reused in agriculture. Other designs use two
                  alternating pits, reducing the need for new pits. Some pit
                  designs are meant to be completely dry, while some use small
                  quantities of water. Ventilation to remove odours and flies is
                  incorporated into certain designs, while others are very basic
                  and use traditional materials and approaches. As with all
                  sanitation designs, it is important to know what community
                  members want and can pay for before embarking on construction.
                  An example of an improved pit latrine is shown in Figure 4.2.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sanplat</h4>
                <p>
                  The sanplat is the cheapest and most basic pit latrine. It is
                  a small concrete platform (usually $60 \mathrm{~cm} \times 60
                  \mathrm{~cm}$ or smaller), laid on top of logs or other
                  supporting material traditionally used to cover the pit. The
                  purpose of the sanplat is to provide a sanitary (san) platform
                  (plat) which can be easily cleaned to limit the presence of
                  helminths such as hookworm. Once the pit is full, the sanplat
                  can easily be moved. However, the sanplat design does not
                  overcome problems with odours or flies and may not be
                  acceptable to some community members. The sanplat is best used
                  when there is very little money for improving sanitation and
                  where odours and flies will be tolerated.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The VIP latrine</h4>
                <p>
                  The VIP (ventilated improved pit) latrine is designed to
                  overcome some of the problems with traditional latrine
                  designs, but it is more expensive than a sanplat. It has a
                  vent pipe from the pit to above the roof of the building as
                  shown in Figures 4.3 and 4.4. When air flows across the top of
                  the vent pipe, air is drawn up the pipe from the pit and fresh
                  air is drawn into the pit from the building. Offensive odours
                  from the pit thus pass through the vent pipe and do not enter
                  the building. The location of VIP latrines is important:
                  unless a clear flow of air is maintained across the top of the
                  vent, the ventilation system may not be effective. VIP
                  latrines should therefore be located away from trees or high
                  buildings that may limit airflow. A dark vent pipe also helps
                  the air to rise. The top of the pipe is usually covered with
                  mosquito meshing. If the inside of the building is kept
                  partially dark, the flies will be attracted to light at the
                  top of the pipe, where they will be trapped and die.

                <p>
                  When the VIP latrine is constructed and used properly, it
                  provides great improvements in fly and odour control, but may
                  not eliminate either completely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A VIP latrine is designed to work as a dry system, with any
                  liquid in the content infiltrating into the surrounding soil.
                  Although some liquid inevitably will enter the pit, it should
                  be minimized. For example, it would not be appropriate to
                  dispose of household wastewater into the pit as this may
                  prevent decomposition of the contents. VIP latrines are most
                  appropriate where people do not use water for cleaning
                  themselves after defecating, but use solid materials such as
                  paper, corncobs or leaves.

                <p>
                  VIP latrines may be designed with single or double pits.
                  Double pits may be used, for example, when cultural taboos
                  prohibit the mixing of male and female faeces. Twin pits may
                  also be used to facilitate emptying and composting. When one
                  pit is full, the other can be emptied and reused. The pit of a
                  VIP latrine is usually located directly beneath the slab to
                  prevent fouling of the chute, which would lead to odour and
                  fly problems, and require regular cleaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The VIP latrine is more expensive than either traditional
                  designs or the sanplat and this should be borne in mind when
                  considering its use. In some areas, traditional latrines or
                  sanplat latrines can be improved by providing ventilation.
                  However, it likely that traditional floor materials will allow
                  light to enter the pit, which will make fly control more
                  difficult. Installing a vent pipe on an existing latrine may
                  damage it. When considering a VIP latrine as an improvement on
                  existing sanitation, it is important to be aware that this may
                  require the construction of a new latrine, not simply the
                  upgrading of an existing one.
                </p>
                <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pour-flush latrines</h4>
                <p>
                  A pour-flush latrine is a type of pit latrine where small
                  volumes of water (commonly 1-3 litres) are used to flush
                  faeces into the pit. They are most appropriate where people
                  use water to clean themselves after defecating (e.g. in Muslim
                  cultures) and where people have access to reliable water
                  supplies close to the home. Solid materials should not be
                  disposed of into pour-flush latrines, as this could block the
                  pipe and even cause it to break.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A pour-flush latrine has a small collection pan set in a slab.
                  Wastes are disposed of through a section of pipe bent into a U
                  shape (a U-bend) to maintain a water seal for reducing fly and
                  odour problems. A vent pipe may also be added to the pit to
                  help with fly and odour problems. The pit of a pour-flush
                  latrine may be located directly beneath the slab or set to one
                  side, but offset pits may require more water to prevent
                  blockages. The pit is usually connected to a soakaway to allow
                  liquids to infiltrate the soil, leaving solid waste to
                  decompose. Pour-flush latrines can also be designed to be
                  connected to smallbore sewers at a later date. As with VIP
                  latrines, twin pits may be used.

                  A septic tank is a form of on-site sanitation that provides
                  the convenience of a sewerage system. It is usually linked to
                  flush toilets and can receive domestic wastewater (or
                  sullage). Since flush toilets tend to use large amounts of
                  water, septic tanks are usually appropriate only for
                  households with water piped into the home. The tank is offset
                  from the house and linked to the toilet and domestic
                  wastewater by a short drain. It is designed to hold solids and
                  is linked to a soakaway to dispose of liquid waste (effluent).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Septic tanks generally require relatively large amounts of
                  land and periodic emptying by vacuum tankers. This is often
                  expensive and the trucks will need easy access to the tank.
                  Septic tanks thus tend to be high-cost solutions for improving
                  sanitation. They are commonly used only by communities whose
                  members have access to water supply within the home, have land
                  available and who can afford the cost of emptying the tanks.
                  Communal septic tanks may be feasible if a large number of
                  households close to the tank can be connected with very short
                  lengths of sewer pipe. For such a system to work, however,
                  each household needs sufficient water to flush faeces into the
                  septic tank effectively. This approach will probably be
                  effective only when water is supplied to at least one tap on
                  each plot.

                  An aquaprivy is similar to a septic tank; it can be connected
                  to flush toilets and take most household wastewater. It
                  consists of a large tank with a water seal formed by a simple
                  down pipe into the tank to prevent odour and fly problems. Its
                  drawback is that water must be added each day to maintain the
                  water seal, and this is often difficult to do unless water is
                  piped into the home. The tank is connected to a soakaway to
                  dispose of effluent. Unlike a septic tank, the aquaprivy tank
                  is located directly below the house, but it, too, requires
                  periodic emptying and must be accessible to a vacuum tanker.
                  Aquaprivies are expensive and do not offer any real advantages
                  over pour-flush latrines.

                <p>
                  Sewerage systems are designed to collect excreta and domestic
                  wastewater and transport them away from homes to a treatment
                  and/or disposal point. All sewerage systems require water for
                  flushing waste away. Conventional sewerage is a high-cost
                  sanitation option; it is usually deep-laid and must be
                  maintained by professional staff. Such a system is thus
                  appropriate only where funds are available for operation and
                  maintenance by trained staff. All sewerage systems should be
                  linked to a treatment plant, as the raw faeces they carry
                  represent a public health risk
                </p>
                <p>
                  Modified sewerage systems are also designed to transport waste
                  away from the home, but work on different principles from
                  conventional sewerage systems. They do not require high-volume
                  flush toilets, but do need significant amounts of water for
                  flushing. At least one tap on each plot or property is
                  therefore essential. Small-bore sewers are designed to carry
                  only effluent, and each home requires an interceptor tank to
                  collect and store solid material, which must be regularly
                  emptied by mechanical means.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Shallow sewers are larger-diameter sewers that carry both
                  solid and liquid wastes. They differ from conventional sewers
                  in that solids deposited in the pipes are resuspended when
                  water builds up behind the blockage. To ensure that enough
                  water is available to move the solids, all household
                  wastewater should be disposed of into the sewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While both of these modified sewerage systems have problems,
                  they have been successfully managed by communities and have
                  far lower water requirements than conventional sewers. The
                  modified technologies may be appropriate in larger villages
                  that have water supplies close to, or within, the homes.

                All wastes in sewerage or septic tank systems require treatment
                before disposal, so that surface water and groundwater sources
                are not contaminated and communities are not exposed to health
                risks from untreated sewage. This can be accomplished either
                through high-cost conventional treatment systems, or through a
                series of waste stabilization ponds (or lagoons).

                <p>
                  Waste stabilization ponds require more land, but are cheaper
                  and easier to operate and maintain, and need fewer trained
                  staff than other treatment systems. The final water from waste
                  stabilization ponds can be very good if the ponds are properly
                  maintained. Without proper maintenance, however, the quality
                  of the final effluent may be poor and pose a risk to health if
                  it is used for irrigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In usual configurations, sewage flows through a series of
                  ponds where the solid and liquid wastes undergo natural
                  breakdown processes, including microbial activity. Usually, at
                  least two ponds are used, and more commonly three. If the
                  sludge (the solid part of the waste) from septic tanks is to
                  be treated in a waste stabilization pond, it should go into a
                  special pond at the start of the series because it is
                  potentially highly toxic. Subsequent ponds treat effluent (the
                  liquid part of the waste). Wastewater in stabilization ponds
                  tends to have a high organic content and can serve as breeding
                  sites for Culex mosquitoes that transmit lymphatic filariasis
                  and other infections. The ponds should therefore be sited well
                  away from human habitation, at least beyond the flying
                  distance of the mosquitoes (over a kilometre with wind
                  assistance).

                  As society uses more water, the demand on natural water
                  resources becomes ever greater. Some of the demands for water,
                  particularly for agriculture and fish breeding, can be met by
                  reusing properly treated effluent, since the water quality
                  requirements for these purposes are not as high as for
                  drinking-water. Treated wastewater can also be used to

                  The use of untreated wastewater in agriculture or aquaculture
                  poses high health risks to farmers and consumers alike, and
                  only the reuse of treated wastewater should be promoted. The
                  treated wastes should not contain pathogens (bacteria,
                  viruses, helminths or protozoa), because these could
                  contaminate products and infect consumers, or be accidentally
                  ingested by farmers during handling. Properly operated
                  sewage-treatment plants should produce treated effluent of
                  good enough quality for use in irrigation or fishbreeding
                  ponds. If treated wastewater is to be reused, the community
                  should ask the operator of the sewage-treatment plant or the
                  local health body to carry out regular monitoring to ensure
                  that the effluent is safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Solid waste from pit latrines and sewage-treatment plants can
                  also be a valuable resource for farmers as an organic
                  fertilizer and soil conditioner, provided that it has been
                  allowed to properly decompose and contains no pathogens. It is
                  particularly important to ensure that roundworm (Ascaris) eggs
                  are no longer infective. Normally, it takes two years for the
                  waste in a pit latrine to decompose, but longer if the pit is
                  wet. Some composting pit latrines (e.g. the Viet Nam latrine)
                  accelerate the decomposition of sludge and inactivation of
                  roundworm eggs by increasing the temperature in the sludge
                  pile. Before your community reuses sludge, however, health
                  officials should be consulted about the minimum time for
                  sludge decomposition. If possible, the quality of the sludge
                  should occasionally be tested. However, testing for
                  microorganisms such as protozoa and helminths is expensive,
                  and it may be more effective to use retention time to judge
                  whether the sludge will be safe to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the microbial quality of treated effluent and sludge is
                  the major health concern, chemical contamination is also a
                  consideration. In particular, wastewater reuse may increase
                  the nitrate and chloride content of the soil. Nitrate has been
                  linked to the "blue-baby" syndrome that can be fatal in
                  infants. Although chloride is not a health concern, it can
                  increase water salinity and affect soil fertility. If
                  community members suspect that a water source is contaminated
                  with chemicals, they should seek the advice of local health
                  and environment officials and request that periodic monitoring
                  of wastewater quality be carried out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When wastewater is reused, care should be taken to separate
                  domestic effluent from industrial effluent, since the
                  industrial effluent may contain chemicals harmful to health or
                  the environment, such as heavy metals. If industrial sewage is
                  mixed with domestic sewage, it is therefore not advisable to
                  reuse the wastewater. Food products fertilized with such
                  wastewater may pose a health risk to consumers, and the
                  repeated application of solid or liquid wastes may cause
                  chemical build-up in soils, leading to long-term problems for
                  water resources.
