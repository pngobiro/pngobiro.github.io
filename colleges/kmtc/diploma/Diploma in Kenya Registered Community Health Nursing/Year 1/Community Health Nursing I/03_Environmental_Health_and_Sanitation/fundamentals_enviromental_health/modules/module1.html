                   <p>Let's define some key terms that we will use throughout this course:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Environment</strong>- It is a collective term used to describe all the living and non-living things that make up our surroundings.</li>
                         <li><strong>Health</strong>- A complete state of physical, mental and social wellbeing of an individual and not just merely the absence of disease or infirmity.</li>
                          <li><strong>Agent</strong>- These are living organisms that transmit diseases.
                               <ul>
                                   <li>Microorganisms that release toxins to environment that causes diseases or death.</li>
                               </ul>
                           </li>
                         <li><strong>Host</strong>- A living organism where a parasite lives.</li>
                           <li><strong>Health promotion</strong>- It is an active process for better health, encompassing educational components, behavior change initiatives and environmental organizational and legislative interventions strategies.</li>
                     </ul>
                       <p>These terms help us define the elements involved in environmental health.</p>
