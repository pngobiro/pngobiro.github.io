                   <p>The department of EHS is one of the oldest departments. The first PHO, the then called Sanitary inspector was employed in 1907. The title has undergone several changes to the current PHO and PHT. Currently the department has 4185 certificate holders(PHT's) and diploma (PHO's).</p>
                   <p>PHT's are deployed to be in charge of public health activities at locations and sub-locations while PHO's take divisions and districts.</p>
                   <p>In some ways public health is a modern concept of human development in science, although it has roots and entiquity from the beginning of human civilization.</p>

                   <p>Early religions attempted to regulate the behavior that was specifically related to health from the type of food eaten to regulating certain indulgent behaviours such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations.</p>
                    <p>The establishment of government's placed responsibility on leaders to develop public health policies and programmes in order to gain some understanding of the causes of diseases and thus ensure social stability, prosperity and maintain order.</p>

                    <p>By Roman times, it was well understood that proper diversion of human waste was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measures of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also children were protected by inoculating a scratch on their forearm with the pus from a lesion. This practice was not documented in the west until the early 18th century and was used on a very limited basis. The practice of vaccination didn't become prevalent until the 1820's following the work of Edward Jennet to treat smallpox.</p>
                    <p>The science of epidemiology was founded by John Snow's identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in London. Dr Snow believed in the Germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing Miasma Theory. Although Miasma theory correctly teaches us that a disease is as a result of poor sanitation, it was based upon the prevailing theory of spontaneous generation.</p>
                    <p>Germ theory developed slowly; despite Antony Van Leeuwen Hocks observations of microorganisms(Which are now known to cause many of the most common infectious diseases) in the year 1680. The modern era of public health didn't begin until the 1880's with Louis Pasteur's Germ theory and production of artificial vaccines.</p>

                      <p>Other public health interventions included latrinization, the building of sewers, the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a land field, providing clean water and draining stagnant water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.</p>
                    <p>This contribution was made by Edwin Chadwick ion 1843 who published a report on the sanitation of the working class population in Great Britain at the time. So begun the inspection of the modern public health. The industrial revolution had initially caused the spread of disease through large cornubations around work, houses and factories.</p>
                      <p>These settlements were cramped and primitive and there was no organized sanitation. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>From the earliest civilization some form of public health had existed as a conscious effort by authorities to apply social, scientific and medical knowledge to the protection of the health of the communities. In Egypt and Rome, both had sometime built modern towns and had fairly developed sanitary systems. In Rome, public baths were available to everyone and workers went in the evening to wash and do away with the fatigue of the day. Inoculation against smallpox was practiced in India and China before Christian era. Rome built Leprosaria and like Greece, sort to regulate prostitution.</p>
                     <p>The latrine and flash closets were intended many years before other Arabian cities had health departments with Public Health workers. In Europe, leprosy cases were isolated and almost eliminated. Some of the teachings in major religions can also be regarded as a form of public health aiming at cleanliness. The isolation of the sufferers and ritual absentation from foods likely to convey diseases.</p>
