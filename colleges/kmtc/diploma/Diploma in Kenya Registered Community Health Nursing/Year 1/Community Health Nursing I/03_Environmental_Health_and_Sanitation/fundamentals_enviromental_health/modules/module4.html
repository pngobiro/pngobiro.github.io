                    <p>The first missionary society in Mombasa in 1888 appears to have been the first to undertake medical work in Kenya. Their main concern was the spread of Christianity which they did simultaneously with medical services. Consequently they laid foundation of curative and preventive medicine. Their work of preaching the gospel and healing the sick entailed considerable difficulties e.g. they had language problems and couldn't communicate with the local people easily. Secondly there were no roads and thirdly people were not prepared to accept their teaching. They used persuasions in order to get a few people to teach. Some parents refused to allow their children to be taught as they considered looking after cattle as more important.</p>
                    <p>The missionaries worked persistently and carried out curative and preventive medicine throughout Kenya and Uganda. They established missionary stations and built either dispensaries or small hospitals in every station which helped in the treatment and eradication of common diseases.</p>

                   <p>Medical services both in Kenya and Uganda were amalgamated but in 1903 the services were separately developed in the two countries. Active environment work started in Kenya between 1913 and 1920 when the first sanitary inspectors were employed.</p>
                    <p>Their work was to teach and inspect. They spent most of their time in teaching people in the rural areas how to build good houses and in addition conducted immunization campaigns against smallpox, plague, and other communicable diseases. The number of sanitary inspectors employed at that time was small and the government needed some local people to train in order to assist them in their work.</p>

                   <p>During this period considerable interest was directed towards environmental sanitation which called for proper manning and policy making.</p>
                    <p>In 1920, the first director of Medical Services was appointed to advice the government on medical requirement for the whole country and to plan, execute preventive measures against communicable diseases.</p>

                      <p>For the purpose of rural development, the native authority ordinance was passed in 1924 which required local councils to contribute funds for public health measures. The funds were used in improving facilities such as water supplies for use by the communities.</p>
                      <p>A number of people who were trained as masons or carpenters were designated as sanitary workers. They started rural sanitation by advicing the local people on how to build their houses, protect springs and were also responsible for immunization against communicable diseases.</p>
                     <p>Between 1933 and 1939 more European Health inspectors were employed to work in various districts and to plan and improve environmental health services. Further expansion took place between 1940 and 1954. These include;</p>

                        <li>Health centers were established and run by the local health authorities(Later these were taken by the central government.)</li>
