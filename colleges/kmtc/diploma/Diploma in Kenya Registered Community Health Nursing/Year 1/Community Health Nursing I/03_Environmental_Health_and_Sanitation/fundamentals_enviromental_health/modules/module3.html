                    <p>The Mosaic Law, given to the Israelites through Moses, provided guidance on various aspects of life, including health and hygiene. Some of these laws are still relevant today. It is also termed as founder of Modern Medicine and health practices.</p>
                    <p>The Mosaic law defined to the Israelites many of the things which were termed as unclean. In our modern health practice we know that any thing that's termed unclean can cause diseases to us.</p>
                    <p>Isolation were used by Israelites to prevent spread of diseases to different people. In modern isolation is used to control the spread of diseases e.g. leprosy, viral haemorrhage.</p>
