                    <ul>
                         <li>Community Health
                            <p>Is that part of medicine concerned with the health of the whole community in prevention of the disease they suffer from. This is achieved by making a community diagnosis of which diseases are important and which can be prevented and then organizing suitable control programmes.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Air Quality
                           <p>Diseases related to respiratory tract are prevented by ensuring the air we breath does not contain disease causing organisms.</p>
                        </li>
                       <li>Pollution Control
                            <p>Pollution is the presence of impurities/pollutants in our environment. These harmful substances will spoil the air, food, water and soil. These poollutants may be from; Agricultural activities, Industrial and Social activities. The presence of pollutants in the environment will adversely affect the health of a population.</p>
                        </li>
                       <li>Food quality Control
                           <p>Food is essential for development, growth and energy. Food is also resp[onsible for the spread of many important diseases. The aim of food quality control is to prevent food spoilage or contamination at any stage of contact, collection, storage, sell, preparation and consumption.</p>
                       </li>
                        <li>Built Environment
                           <p>Housing is one of the essential aspects of environmental health by protecting people from from environmental hazards. Poor housing exposes people to diseases leading to poor health. Dampness in buildings and overcrowding, inadequate ventilation, poor lighting encourage the spread of airborne/droplets infection.</p>
                            <p>Dirty surroundings, poor waste disposal, lack of wholesome water, poor food storage and preparation facilities, poor excreta disposal are some of the factors associated with disease transmission. Poor housing provides harborage for disease carrying pest/vectors</p>
                       </li>
                         <li>Occupational Health and Industrial Hygiene
                            <p>Workers in various occupations suffer from diseases other people suffer from. The work environment may expose workers to unique occupational hazards in addition to the common diseases. Occupational Health Services are provided to offer preventive and curative health care to workers in all occupations for all diseases whether arising from home or work place.</p>
                       </li>
                        <li>Management
                             <p>To implement environmental health programmes we need resources and good management is required to manage these resources. These resources include; personnel, money, equipment and materials. To achieve desired results, good management is important.</p>
