                     <p>Public health (Community health) is part of medicine which is concerned with the health of the population and prevention of disease from which they suffer. It is well known that prevention is better than cure this means that the best sort of prevention is before people become ill i.e. before a person departs from the pathway of health and starts down the pathway of disease this is known as Primary Prevention.</p>
                     <p>PRIMARY PREVENTION</p>
                     <p>Primary prevention provided by a combination of methods mainly aimed at people and the environment in which they live.</p>
                    <p>Primary prevention can be done at 2 levels;</p>

                   <p>Then next best time for prevention of diseases is after the disease has started but before symptom have appeared. This stage is called pre-colonial/sub-clinical/ Pre-symptomatic. Prevention at this stage is called Secondary prevention. The process of finding out this sub-clinical process is called Screening.</p>
                   <p>Examples are weighing babies and young children to see if their weights fall into the nutrition danger area. Examining Urine and faeces for parasites for parasites and examining mothers for early signs of complications. Tracing of contacts is another form of screening for infectious diseases e.g. tuberculosis, leprosy to see if other persons in a family are also infected.</p>
                   <p>Surveillance of diseases is another form of secondary prevention. It is achieved by keeping of records of the number of the new cases of diseases like measles and meningitis to see if a control programme is working or detect an epidemic early.</p>
