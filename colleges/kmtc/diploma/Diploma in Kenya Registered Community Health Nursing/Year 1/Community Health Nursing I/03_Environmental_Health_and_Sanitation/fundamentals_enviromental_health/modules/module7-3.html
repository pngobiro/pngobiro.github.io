                   <p>Risk assessment is the determination of qualitative and quantitative value of risk related to a concrete solution, a recognized threat(Hazard)</p>
                   <p>In the context of p[public health, risk assessment is the process of quantifying the probability of harmful effect to individuals or population from certain human activities. In most countries, the use of specific chemicals or the operations of specific facilities e.g. power plant manufacturing plant is not allowed unless it can be shown that they do not increase the risk of death or illness above a specified threshold.</p>

                   <ul>
                       <li>Hazard Identification- Aims to determine the qualitative nature of the potential adverse consequences of the contaminant (Chemical, radiation, noise e.t.c) the strength of the evidence it can have that effect. This is done for chemical hazards by drawing from the results of the science of toxicology, epidemiology e.t.c.</li>
                       <li>Dose-response analysis- Is determining the relationship between dose, the probability of the incidence of effect (Dose-response assessment.). The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals to humans and/or from high to lower doses. In addition, the differences between individuals due to genetics or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine an effect unlikely to yield on observable effects which are a no-effect concentration. In developing such a dose to account for the largely unknown effects of the animals to human extra populations, increased variabilities in humans, or a missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety factors in the estimate of the safe dose typically, a factor of 10 for each unknown step.</li>
                        <li>Exposure quantification- Aims to determine the amount of a contaminate(dose) that individuals and populations will receive. This is done by examining results of the discipline of exposure assessment. At different locations, lifestyle, other factors likely to influence the amount of contaminant that is received, a range of distribution of possible values is generated in this step. Particular care is taken to determine the exposure of the susceptible population.</li>

                    <p>This includes a circulation of the single loss expectancy(SLE) of an asset. The SLE can be defined as the loss of value to asset based on a single security incident. The team then calculates the annualized rate of occurrence(ARO) of the threat to the asset.</p>
                    <p>The ARO is an estimate based on the data of how often a threat would be successful in exploiting a vulnerability. For this information, the Annualized Loss Expectancy(ALE) can be calculated. The ALE is a calculation of the SLE multiplied by the ARO or how much an organization could estimate to lose from an asset based on the risk threats and vulnerabilities. It then becomes possible from a financial perspective to justify expenditure to implement counter measures to protect the asset.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                   <p>In qualitative risk assessment one does not try to assign hard financial values to assets, expected losses and cost of controls. Instead, one calculates relative values.</p>
                   <p>The benefits of qualitative approach are that it overcomes the challenges of calculation accurate figures for asset values, cost of control and so on and the process is much less demanding on staff.</p>
                    <p>The drawback of a qualitative approach is the resulting figures are vague and some decision markers especially those with finance of accounting backgrounds may not be comfortable with the relative values determined during a qualitative risk assessment project.</p>
