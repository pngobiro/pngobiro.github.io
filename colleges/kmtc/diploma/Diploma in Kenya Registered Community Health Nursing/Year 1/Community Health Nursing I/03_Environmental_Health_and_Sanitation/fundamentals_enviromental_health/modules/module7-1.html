                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>Vast rural and urban human settlements in Kenya lack adequate sanitation. Lack of wholesome water supplies and basic sanitary facilities coupled with unsafe food, poor and inadequate housing result in high morbidity and mortality rates due to preventable diseases, mainly related to environmental sanitation. This therefore calls for more focus on Environmental Health Interventions.</p>
                    <p>In conformity with the current National Health Sector Strategic Plan (2005-2010) whose theme is "Reversing The Trends‚Äù, DEHS encourages active participation of communities and other sector players in the execution of environmental intervention activities.</p>
