                        <h3>Social Cognitive Theory (SCT)</h3>
                        <p>It describes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the influence of individual experiences,</li>
                            <li>the actions of others, and</li>
                            <li>environmental factors on individual health behaviors.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>SCT provides opportunities for social support through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>instilling expectations,</li>
                            <li>self-efficacy, and</li>
                            <li>using observational learning and other reinforcements to achieve behavior change.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Key components of the SCT related to individual behavior change include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Self-efficacy:</strong> The belief that an individual has control over and is able to execute a behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Behavioral capability:</strong> Understanding and having the skill to perform a behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Expectations:</strong> Determining the outcomes of behavior change.</li>
                            <li><strong>Expectancies:</strong> Assigning a value to the outcomes of behavior change.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-control:</strong> Regulating and monitoring individual behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Observational learning:</strong> Watching and observing outcomes of others performing or modeling the desired behavior.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reinforcements:</strong> Promoting incentives and rewards that encourage behavior change.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Motivation Model of Health</h3>
                        <p>Education 'Motivation Model' of Health Education conceptualizes that people are motivated to change behavior to healthy practices, when a particular health-behavior addresses or arouse their 'need'.</p>
                        <p>Common motivational theories used in health education are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maslow's Hierarchy</li>
                            <li>Self-Esteem</li>
                            <li>Transtheoretical Model</li>
                            <li>Health Belief Model</li>
                            <li>Self-Efficacy</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Maslows Hierarchy</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basic, physiological needs appear at the base of the pyramid.</li>
                            <li>As you move upward, you address needs that are less urgent to satisfy, but develop greater and greater psychological health, until you realize self-actualization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Disadvantages of motivational model of health is that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It requires other needs for it to be fulfilled such as economic and social factors</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Social Intervention Model</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The social model of health examines all the factors which contribute to health such as social, cultural, political and the environment.</li>
                            <li>The social model of health places importance on the changes that needs to be made by society, empowering people to be in charge of their own health and lifestyles, in order to make the population healthier..</li>

                        <h3>Theory of Reasoned Action/Planned Behavior</h3>
                        <p>Two closely associated theories - The Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior - suggest that a person's health behavior is determined by their intention to perform a behavior.</p>
                        <p>A person's intention to perform a behavior (behavioral intention) is predicted by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a person's attitude toward the behavior, and</li>
                            <li>subjective norms regarding the behavior.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Subjective norms are the result of social and environmental surroundings and a person's perceived control over the behavior.</p>
                        <p>Generally, positive attitude and positive subjective norms result in greater perceived control and increase the likelihood of intentions governing changes in behavior.</p>

                        <h3>Cognitive Theory</h3>
                        <p>The Cognitive Learning Theory: is a broad theory used to explain the mental processes and how they are influenced by both internal and external factors in order to produce learning in an individual.</p>
                        <p>The theory is credited to education psychologist Jean Piaget.</p>
                        <p>An individual's decision to engage in a particular behavior is based on the outcomes the individual expects will come as a result of performing the behavior.</p>
                        <p>This was developed by Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen in 1967.</p>

                        <h3>Humanist theory</h3>
                        <p>The humanistic perspective is an approach to psychology that emphasizes empathy and stresses the good in human behavior.</p>
                        <p>In counseling and therapy, this approach allows a psychologist to focus on ways to help improve an individual's self-image or self-actualization - the things that make them feel worthwhile.</p>

                            <li>The behaviour change approach is used to bring about changes in an individual's thinking or perception.</li>
                            <li>You should be able to use this method to change the behaviour of individuals within your community and help them make their own health-related decisions.</li>
                            <li>This approach can be applied using locally available methods and media such as leaflets and posters.</li>

                            <li>It's important to remember that self-empowerment is rooted in awareness and understanding that people can act to change their own lives on their own behalf.</li>
                            <li>Using the self-empowerment approach you can provide the tools they will need to make their own choices about their health and increase their control over their physical, social and psychological health.</li>
                            <li>It is a process which empowers families and communities to improve their quality of life, and achieve and maintain health and wellness.</li>
