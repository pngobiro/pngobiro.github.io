                        <ol>
                            <li>The infect skin is the body first organ to defense against infection and injury.</li>
                            <li>Individual differences exit in the nature of the skin and its appendages.</li>
                            <li>Changes occur through out the life span in the skin, mucus membrane, hair, nails and the teeth.</li>
                            <li>The health of the skin and mucus membrane is highly dependant on adequate nourishment, fluid intake and exercise.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Concept of health and disease:-</h3>
                        <p>It is important for health workers to understand certain concepts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Health: -</strong> According to who the definition of health is as follows:</p>
                        <blockquote>"Health is a state of complete physical , mental and social well being and not merely an absence of disease or in ferity".</blockquote>
                        <p>Some of the other definitions of health are as follows:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Health means well - ness, the opposite of illness</li>
                            <li>The condition of being sound in body, mind or spirit, especially freedom from physical disease or pain</li>
                            <li>Health is a positive state of well being that is felt physically, mentally, socially and spiritually.</li>
                            <li>Health is a way life, requiring a knowledge of body, functions and how to keep fit, and the will to cultivate healthy habits including diet and exercise.</li>
                            <li>Health is related to a person's self realization, relationships with others and feeling of giving a worth while contribution to the society.</li>
                            <li>Health is an individual responsibility, and if a person makes no effort to be healthy, no one can provide him with health.</li>
                            <li>Health is a positive quality of life which helps us to live life to its fullest and serve our fellowmen to the best of arability.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p><strong>Nursing: -</strong> Most people think of Nursing as caring for the sick or helping the doctor in the care and treatment of patients. It is much more than this Nursing includes carrying activities in hospital and in community. Nursing includes preventing illness, disability and death. Nursing responsibility is also includes health education, research, training and supervision of health personnel and administration.</p>
                        <p>Nursing is helping a person with those things he cannot do for himself, but are necessary for him to get back his former health and independence.</p>
                        <p>In Nursing we should try to do even more. We should do, all we can to help people to live a life that is fully healthy in body, mind and spirit and social relationship.</p>
                        <p>When nursing an individual we should remember his feelings and beliefs, try to understand his problems, also the needs of his family and of the community. Nursing is an important part of work of a health worker.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Concept of Disease:</h3>
                        <p>There have been many attempts to define disease. webster defines disease as " a condition in which body health is impaired, a departure from a state of health, an alteration of the human body interrupting the performance of vital functions". The Oxford English Dictionary defines disease as " a condition of the body or some part or organ of the body in which its functions are disrupted or deranged". From an ecological point of view, disease is defined as maladjustment of the human organism to the environment" (80) . From a sociological point of view., disease is considered a social phenomenon, occurring in all societies (81) and defined and fought in terms of the particular cultural forces prevalent in the society. The simplest definition is, of course, that disease is just the opposite of health - i.e., any deviation from normal functioning or state of complete physical or mental well -being - -since health and disease are mutually exclusive. These definitions are considered inadequate because they do not give a criterion by which to decide when a disease state begins, nor do they lend themselves to measurement of disease.</p>
                        <p>He WHO has defined health but not disease. This is because disease has many shades ("spectrum of disease") ranging from in apparent (sub clinical) cases to severe manifest illness. Some diseases commence acutely (e.g., food poisoning), and some insidiously (e.g., mental illness, rheumatoid arthritis). In some diseases, a "carrier" state occurs in which the individual remains outwardly healthy, and is able to infect others (e.g., typhoid fever). In some instances, the same organism may cause more than one clinical manifestation (e.g., streptococcus). In some cases, the same disease may be caused by more than one organism (e.g., diarrhea). Some diseases have a short course, and some a prolonged course. It is easy to determine illness when the signs and symptoms are manifest, but in many diseases the borderline between normal and abnormal is indistinct as in the case of diabetes, hypertension and mental illness. The end -point or final outcome of disease is variable - recovery, disability or death of the host.</p>
                        <p>Distinction is also made between the words disease. , illness and sickness which are not wholly synonymous. The term "disease" literally means "without ease" (uneasiness) - disease, the opposite of ease - when something is wrong with bodily function. "Illness" refers not only to the presence of a specific disease, but also to the individual's perceptions and behavior in response to the disease, as well as the impact of that disease on the psychosocial environment (82) "Sickness" refers to a state of social dysfunction. Suffer (83) has suggested the following Usage:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Disease</strong> is a physiological/psychological dysfunctin;</li>
                            <li><strong>Illness</strong> is a subjective state of the person who feels aware of not being well;</li>
                            <li><strong>Sickness</strong> is a state of social dysfunction, i.e., a role that the individual assumes when ill ("sickness role'').</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The clinician sees people who are ill rather than the diseases, which he must diagnose and treat (84). However, it is possible to be victim of disease without feeling ill, and to be ill without signs of physical impairment. In short, an adequate definition of disease is yet to be found - a definition that is satisfactory or acceptable to the epidemiologist, clinician, sociologist and the statistician.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">a 1.Human biology</h4>
                        <p><strong>Human Biology: -</strong> Hereditary characteristics that is height, weight, color of the skin, blood groups etc. are determined by gene which are coming one from mother and one from father. The genetic constitution of man is land at the time of conception. So the state of health therefore depends partly on genetic constitution inherited by the individual. There are inherited disease s like diabetes, cleft palate, epilepsy and hypertension etc. or genetic defects.</p>
                        <p><strong>Enviromment: -</strong> In the environment, the various living and non living things surrounding man plays an important role. Environment implies air, water and soil but also social and economic conditions in which man lives. This relation between man and environment is called "Human ecology". The man's environment is divided into three major components.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>(a) Physical Environment: -</strong> This is the part of man's external environment eg: water, air, housing, climate, soil, nutrition etc. Man has altered everything in his physical environment due to air pollution, water pollution, excessive novice, radiation hazards are main and man has become ill health</li>
                            <li><strong>(b) Biological Environment: -</strong> This is the living component of man's external environmental. It consists of plants, animals, insects, bacteria and virus with which man is in constant relationship. When the delicate balance is disturbed man's health is affected.</li>
                            <li><strong>(c) Social Environment:-</strong> This pertains to man in relationship with his fellow human beings. The social environment is quite broad and ill defined. It is composed of customs, habits, income, occupation, religion, standard of living, human behavior, availability of health services, and social and political organizations. Maladjustment may result in problems like drug addiction, alcoholism, crime, violence, suicides, divorces, mental illness, hypertension, peptic ulcer etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When man has controlled physical and biological enviromment and also social environment, the health and well being of the individually maintained.</p>
                        <p><strong>(3) Way of living: -</strong> Health may not be given by one person to another parson. It depends upon the way of living, the level of personal hygiene education and the life style of the people. People must maintained the rules of hygiene, eating, balanced diets, healthy habits, immunization and periodic medical checkups by increasing standard of living can control tuberculosis and not smoking can decrease the cancer and heart decease. By way of life the people can raise their health status.</p>
                        <p><strong>(4) Economic status: -</strong> It is known that people who are rich enjoys the better health than those who are poor. This is due to economic status. Poverty leads to sickness and sickness leads to poverty.</p>
                        <p><strong>(5) Health Services: -</strong> In India health services are provided by physicians, nurses, health assistants, Health workers, dais etc. The services are both curative and preventive. They are medical care, control of community diseases mother and child health and family planning, improvement of environment, school health services, collection of vital statistics and health education.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">(b) Physical Health</h3>
                        <p><strong>(1) Skin Care: -</strong> To preserve cleanliness of skin and to keep healthy, regular baths and proper clothing are necessary. Other wise, the sebaceous glands will be locked with that, which intern will interfere with the excretion process and further favor the occurrence of certain skin condition such as scabies, Impetigo, prickly heat and ring worm etc. Skin is the one of the most vital organ of the body the function of the skin are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It protects the body from heat, cold, humidity and entry of micro organisms</li>
                            <li>It acts as a sensory agent for touch.</li>
                            <li>It is having a good source of vitamin D which is converted by using the sunrays</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Skin Types: -</strong> there are four types of skin.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Normal Skin: -</strong> It is found in babies and in small children. It is neither too dry nor too greasy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dry Skin: -</strong> It is never moist to be. If the skin is dry, one should not apply the soap. Use plenty of vegetable oils and massage the skin frequently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oily skin: -</strong> It is due to over activity of oil glands. So washing with the soap and water is increased to prevent oil secretions and stagnate dirt.</li>
                            <li><strong>Combination skin: -</strong> Often times, we come across a combination of the dry skin and oily skin.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Bathing of the skin: -</strong> Skin is in contact with the external environment and accumulates dirt. By taking daily bath with soap and water, not only remove dirt and free from all body odors. Soap is good surface cleaning agent. It gives a sense of freshness and well being and free from infection. Baths help not only in cleanliness, but also in maintaining good circulation of blood, tone of muscle, improves appetite. Baths may vary according to climatic conditions and be classified according to condition of the patient and temperature of the water.</p>
                        <p><strong>Purpose of bath: -</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To remove waste products and clean the skin.</li>
                            <li>To refresh and promote relaxation.</li>
                            <li>To stimulate circulation.</li>
                            <li>To observe the condition of the skin</li>
                            <li>The best time for the bath is either before breakfast or at least one hour after meals.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There are four types of baths:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Cold bath: -</strong> In this the temperature of the water must be 65 degrees F. cold baths give a mild shock causing contraction of superficial blood vessels but soon the vessels dilate giving a feeling of warmth and shivering. The bath should not longer more than 3 minutes because this may cause decreased temperature or fall of temperature. It is not prefer for heart patients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Warm Bath: -</strong> The temperature of water should be 100 degrees F. It is stimulating the skin and increases the blood circulation.

                        <p>The following standards of housing have been recommended by the environmental hygiene committee (1949) in India.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Site :-</strong> House must be located in healthy locality. Avoid building on clay soil or damp soil. It should not subjected to flooding during rains. It should be away from dust, smoke, smell and noise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Space: -</strong> House should be in proper lighting and ventilation. There should be open place all around the house. In rural due to plenty of land the house should be build up not exceed 1/3 rd of total area and in urban area 2/3 rds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Walls:-</strong> Walls should be reasonably strong, and unsuitalbe for rats and vermin. A 9" birck wall plastered smooth will meet the above requirement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Floor:-</strong> It must have a hard surface Eg: cement or stone floor. So that it can be easily washed and kept clean and dry. It should be free from dampness.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Rural Housing: -</h4>
                        <p>Most people in villages are living in thatched huts which do not meet requirements of health. Huts an dark with low roof and without windows. The size is not enough for family and besides cattle, goat and hens are rearing and also no sanitary facility. Fire hazards are very easy.</p>
                        <p>Nows huts are replaced by better houses. In rural area the standard expected of houses are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Atleast two living rooms.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ventilation and lighting: -</h4>
                        <p><strong>Defenitation :-</strong> Ventilation may be defined as exchange of air between outdoors and indoors. By this the stagnated air in the house is replaced by a supply of fresh air from outside.</p>
                        <p>In a well ventilated room the air is:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Constanthy circulating.</li>
                            <li>Of comfortable temperature.</li>
                            <li>60% of moistue in the air.</li>
                            <li>Free from smoke and other impurities and unpleasant smells.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Poor ventilation has the following effects on the room occupants:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Yawning, fatigue, irritability, and lessened efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Feeling of heat sweating and may be fainting.</li>
                            <li>Poor appetite.</li>
                            <li>Insomnia (Sleeplessness)</li>
                            <li>Headaches.</li>
                            <li>Spread of infections such as colds, and lowered resistance to infections.</li>
                            <li>Irritation of eyes and air passages if smoke is present.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The recommended standards of ventilation on are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Floor space of 50-100 sq. feet per person.</li>
                            <li>Air change in living rooms two or three changes per hour, in work rooms four to six changes.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Types of Ventilation:</strong> There are 2 typesof ventilation.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>NaturalVentilation.</li>
                            <li>Artificial or michanical ventilation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p><strong>1. Natural Ventilation:-</strong> In India this is most by means of doors and windows. This is brought about by means of certain forces are wind, diffusion, temperature.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Wind: -</strong> It brings about natural ventilation by its movement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diffusion:-</strong> or Spreading out, the gases is called diffusion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature: -</strong> Temperature between indoors and out doors is different. Then the movement of air from hoter region to colder region to become normal temperature.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Doors and windows facing each other provide, what is known as "Cross ventilation".</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2. Artificial Ventilation:-</strong> This is done by following way.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. <strong>Electric fans:</strong> Electric Fans are the simplest means. In a closed room electric fans above will not ensure adequate ventilation.</li>
                            <li><strong>2. Air conditioners: -</strong> The principle in that fresh air is drawn into the room by an electric fan or pum the air is filtered and moistened, and cooled or warmed as required. An airconditioned room must have spring doors which are kept shut, and no open windows.</li>
                            <li><strong>3. In large halls:</strong> a bigger water cooler is implanted to proper fresh air to all parts and withdraws the impure air.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">LIGHTING</h4>
                        <p>Good lighting is essential for proper vision and health of eyes. The requirements of good lighting are :</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. <strong>Sufficiency -</strong> The intensity of light must be sufficient.</li>
                            <li>b. <strong>Destribution :-</strong> of light must be uniform.</li>
                            <li>c. <strong>Absence of glare:</strong> Glare means excessive brightness. It hurts the eye & decrease critical vision. It is important cause of accidents.</li>
                            <li>d. <strong>Absence of sharp shadows: -</strong> It should not present in the field o vision.</li>
                            <li>e. <strong>Steadiness:-</strong> The source of light should be constant.</li>
                            <li>f. <strong>Colour :</strong> The colour of light is not important as long as the intensity adequate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Measurement of light: -</strong> The light should be measured in foot candles.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Living room 7 Foot candles</li>

                            <li>Bed Room 4-6 Foot candles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Types of lighting are two.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Natural Lighting:-</strong> It is derived mainly from the sky and party by reflextion. It depends upon the time of day, season, weather and clouds. It is affected by the facing of building to north or south, size and shape of windows. the colour of walls and ceilings. It should always white.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Artificial lighting:-</strong> It may not depends upon day light during all hours. Not only during night time sometimes, we need artificial light during day time. It is from electric bulbs, tube lights etc., Tube lights are cool and efficeint.'</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disposal of refuse:</h3>
                        <p>Refuse means any kind of waste material. Solid refuse is applied to, refuse from houses, street sweepings, commercial and industrial and agriculatural operatons. Exereta means human urine and faces. Improper disposal of these wastes are caused ill health in the community.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Methods of Disposal of Dry refuse: -</h4>
                        <p>Refuse should never be thrown on the ground nor swept into a comer. If it is not disposal property, it must be put into abin.</p>
                        <p>Any thing wet or must should be first wrapped in paper:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. The refuse bin should have well - fitting lid to protect refuse from flies and others insects, crows, rats and dogs.</li>
                            <li>b. Be made of plastic or metal which is easy to wash.</li>
                            <li>c. Be emptied daily and disposed of by a safe method.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Methods</h4>
                        <p><strong>1. Burning: -</strong> This is the best method of refuse disposal a. In cineration: By this method bacteria will be killed and refuse reduced to a small amount of ash. It should be carried away from houses to avoid smell and smoke, preferably in an incinerator. In this a cheif drawback is that the refuse is a loss to the community in terms of manure.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Feeding to animals:-</strong> Left over food and vegetables waste may be fed to animals such as pigs. A seperate bin may be kept for this purpose.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Burrying:-</strong> In a pit or trench, 3 ft deep, to prevent dogs or rats from getting at the refuse. Every time when refuse is dumped, it must be covered with some soil. When done in a large, this is called "Controlled tipping method. The refused may be broken down by bacteria into manure whichmay be used after 3-6 months. and the pits used again for fresh refuse.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Composting :</strong> In rural areas this is a very useful method. The compost pit is made as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Select a site near to the house but away from any water source.</li>
                            <li>b. Dig a pit 3 metres x 3 metres x a metre deep, or a little larger if needed.</li>
                            <li>c. The walls of the pit may be lined with bricks.</li>
                            <li>d. Fill the pit with alternate layers of house refuse and cowdung in proportionf 3:1 and cover each layer with soil to avoid fly breeding.</li>
                            <li>e. From time to time the compost may be turned and mixed with a long pole.</li>
                            <li>f. The top layer should be of refuse covered with earth to about 30 cm. above ground lelel. When full, the compost pit is left forr 6 months, after which the contents can be used as manufreand the pit used again</li>
                            <li>g. Two such pits will be needed for alternative use.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>5. Incineration :</strong> Incineration is a form of burning which is the safest method of refuse disposal, especially for hospital refuse such as dirty dressings, but glass and tin should not be included. Properly constructed incinerators are built and should be well maintained. The resulting ash may be used for road making or repair.</p>
                        <p><strong>6. Dumping on Land</strong> This is a method which can be used to fill up low-lying land, but is not without health hazards. The dumping ground must be well away from houses because it will attract files and rats, and have a bad smell. To lessen flies, the refuse may be burned. The land may later be used for cultivation.</p>
                        <p><strong>7. Disposal of the Dead</strong> Depending on custom and religious practice, the following methods are used:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. <strong>Burying.</strong> Christians and Muslisms preper this method. Adequate fresh land is needed. Graves are dut 3-5 feet deep. The burial ground should be on sandy loam soil, not too close to houses. There should be a wall around, and trees planted.</li>
                            <li>b. <strong>Cremation or burning.</strong> Hindus and Buddhists ussually cremate their dead on the open pyre. Less land is required for this method, but fuel is needed. The cremation ground should be well away from any houses. The modern method of cremation by the use of a furnace is quicker and uses less space.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Excreta:</h4>
                        <p>The problem of diseases spread from faeces to mouth is very great in India. In rural areas it is common for people to pass motion on the ground and leave it uncovered.</p>
                        <p>Improper disposal of human exreta lead to the spread of disease in the following ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Flies can convey germs and worm ova from faeces to food.</li>
                            <li>Drinking water may be contaminated by infected faeces.</li>
                            <li>Food may be contaminated by inadequate hand-washing after defaecation.</li>
                            <li>Vegetables and fruits may be contaminated with worm ova in soil or manure, and eaten raw without being washed or cooked.</li>
                            <li>Wet ground may be heavily infected with tetanus frim the faeces of man or animals in soil.</li>
                            <li>Wounds or cracks in the skin may get infected with tetanus from the faeces ofman or animals in soil.</li>
                            <li>Cattle or pits may swallow tapeworm ova passed in human faeces, and later when the met is eaten after insufficient cooking, a tapeworm begins to grow in a new host.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Thus in numerous ways, by imporper disposal of excreta, the following diseases are spread:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Bacteria diseases:</strong> Cholera, typhiod and paratyphiod fevers, bacillary dysentery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parasitic diseases:</strong> amoebiasis, intestinal worms such as hookworm, foundworm and tapeworm.</li>
                            <li><strong>Virus diseases :</strong> poliamyelitis, and infectious hepatitis.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">METHODS OF DISPOSAL OF DRY REFUSE</h4>
                        <p>Refuse should never be thrown on the ground nor swept into a corner. If it cannot be properly disposed of immediately, it must be put into a bin. Anything wet or moist should first be wrapped in paper.</p>
                        <p>The refuse bin should</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. have a well fitting lid to protect refuse from flies and other insects, crows, rats and dogs.</li>
                            <li>b. Be made of plastic or metal which is easy to wash.</li>
                            <li>c. be emptied daily and disposed of by a safe method.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Methods of Refuse Disposal</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Feeding to animals:</strong> Left over food and vegetables waste may be fed to animals such as pigs. A separate bin may be kept for this purpose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Burning:</strong> By this method bacteria will be killed and refuse reduced to a small amount of ash. Burning should be carried out well away from houses to avoid smell and smoke, preferably in an incinerator.</li>
                            <li><strong>Burying :</strong> In a pit or trench 3 feet deep, to prevent dogs or rats from getting at the refuse. Each time refuse is dumped it must be covered with some soil. When done on a large scale this is called 'controlled tipping' method. Refuse is broken down by bacteria into manure which may be used at the end of 3-6 months, and the pits used again for fresh refuse.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">METHODS OF DISPOSAL OF WET REFUSE AND EXCRETA</h4>
                        <p><strong>Disposal of Sullage water:</strong> If waste water collects, it has to be drained away to a safe place. Wherever water is scarce, the sullage water should not be wasted but made use of in such a way that there is no health hazard.</p>
                        <p>Drains should be well planned for free flow of water, and checked frequently for any blockage. The water must not be allowed to flow into a clean source of waster. It may flow into a kitchen garden or cultivated field, where it is used to help in growing food.</p>
                        <p>Papaya and banana trees are good for using up waste water and good food for the family.</p>
                        <p>If a kitchen garden is not possible, the drain should pass to a soakage pit.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Soakage pit:</h5>
                        <p>This is made as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Select a place near the house where waste water runs out of the house.</li>
                            <li>Dig a pit 2 metres deep and 11/2 metres in diameter.</li>
                            <li>Fill the lowest 1/3 of the pit with stones and bricks of 3/ 4 size.</li>
                            <li>Fill the middle 1/3 of the pit with stones or bricks of 1/2 size.</li>
                            <li>Fill the upper 1/3 of the pit with stones or bricks of 1/4 size.</li>
                            <li>The waste water should flow into the soakage pit through a pipe. The pipe should be empty into a basket filled with straw and leaves which is placed in the middle of the upper part of the pit, and which serves as a filter. This basket should be removed and cleaned or replaced every 2-3 months.</li>
                            <li>Cover the top layer of the pit with a layer of earth to above ground level. Build a parapet 10 cm . high round the top of the pit to protect it from rain water.</li>
                            <li>The soakage pit should not be used in the rainy season (block off the drain).</li>
                            <li>If the pit starts overflowing, it must be emptied, and the stones or bricks washed, dried and replaced.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Sullage from cattle sheds:</strong> Cattle shed floors should be washed daily and the waster drained away into a soakage pit.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Disposal of Excreta:</h4>
                        <p>In urban areas there is water carriage system. Large pipes called sewers collect from house drains and carry away for treatment the excreta together with sullage water and rain water, called 'sewage' .</p>
                        <p>In rural areas, usually there is no public system of sewage disposal. Village people need to be shown a safe and practical method of excreta disposal.</p>
                        <p>It has been found that privately owned latrines are best, as they are most likely to be kept clean. Types of latrines are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. Service type.</li>
                            <li>b. Sanitary latrines.</li>
                            <li>c. Simple latrines.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Service type Latrine :</strong> This type needs someone to collect and empty the buckets of nightsoil (excreta). It is not recommended except in case of sickness, when a commode or bedpan is needed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sanitary Latrine:</strong> This is one which does not cause nuisance due to sight or smell, the excreta is not left exposed, and it does not pollute the soil nor any water source. The best type of sanitary latrine is the water seal pit latrine. This should be situated conveniently near to the house, but 15 metres from any water source. There should be space for a second pit which is due when the first pit is full. This latrine consists of :</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Squatting plate</strong> made of cement concrete 3 feet sqare and 2 inches thick, with raised foot plates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pan :</strong> This must have a smooth surface to prevent excreta sticking to the sides. It slopes from front to back.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trap:</strong> This is a bent pipe 3" diameter, connected to the pan. It holds water and therefore acts as a water sseal. The water seal (a) prevents smell from the excreta in the pit, and (b) prevents flies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Connecting Pipe:</strong> This is a 3" diameter pipe about 3 feet long. It connects to the trap and slopes down to the pit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pit or Dug Well :</strong> This is 1 metre square or 1 metre diameter and 21/2 metres deep. It must be provided with a strong cover below ground level, which is covered with earth. Inside the pit, the excret is made harmless by anarobic bacteria.</li>
                            <li><strong>Superstructure:</strong> This is for privacy and can be made of any material according to the means of the family.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Maintenance of the Latrine</strong> If carefully used and maintained, the latrine can last a family of five for 3 to 4 years.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Each time it is used for defaecation, the latrine must be flushed with 1 litre water.</li>
                            <li>The squaring place should be washed frequently and kept dry and clean. Disinfectants should not be used as this would destroy the action of bacteria.</li>
                            <li>When the pit is full, the latrine cannot be flushed. . A fresh pits should be dug, connected to the latrine structure and covered with the old pit cover. The old pit should be filled up with easrth, left for atleast six months, then the contents can be dug up and used as manure.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Simple Latrine for a camp,</strong> especially where there is shortage of water, or for a family where a sanitary latrine cannot be constructed, this type of latrine is suitable.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Dig a pit about 1/2 metre wide and 1-2 metres deep. It can be of any length. It should be atleast 20 metres from buildings and water source.</li>
                            <li>Make a platform of wood or cement, with a hole in the centre, to place over the pit. Make a wooden cover with handle.</li>
                            <li>Erect screens of local materials to surround the latrine. The screen can be moved along the trench as it is filled up. The used end of the trench provides good soil for plants.</li>
                            <li>Each time after use, throw in a little lime, ashes or soil, to reduce smell and keep flies away.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The latrine should be kept clean by careful use and washing down when necessary.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bio-gas plant</strong> In India the use of biogas plant is being promoted. The plant is expensive to instal, but once installed is of great benefit to the family or community using it. The prinicple is that night soil passes from latrine to a large covered container where decomposition takes place. Animal waste such as cowdung is added and the resulting gas can be piped into the building for use with a gas cooking plate.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sewage Purification</h4>
                        <p>Large quantities of sewage from a total community is offensive in smell and contains millions of bacteria. It has to be purified to protect the health of the community.</p>
                        <p>Two types of bacteria are involved in the purification of sewage:</p>
                        <p>The stages of sewage purification are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Screening :</strong> A metal screen strins out floating refuse such as bits of wood and rags. This refuse is disposed of by burying.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grit chamger :</strong> This is a long narrow trench where heavier solids such as sand and gravel will settle, to be removed later and used for roads or land fillings.</li>
                            <li>. <strong>Primary Sedimentation Tank:</strong> The sewage flows through slowly for 6-8 hours while other solids settle and form a black mud called 'sludge'. The sludge is pumped out into another tank, while the upper liquid part called 'effluent' passes on to be further purified. Sludge is dried to make manure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biological Treatment</strong> One of the following two types of treatment is used.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a. <strong>Trickling filter:</strong> This is a round bed of stones. A pipe with a row of holes rotates at the top of the filter. The effluent flows through the pipe on to the filter bed. As it passes through, it gets oxidised by aerobic bacteria and is purified.</li>
                                    <li>b. <strong>Activated Sludge Process :</strong> The effluent is kept in a tank for about 6 hours together with a dose of activated sludge. This sludge contains plenty of aerobic bacteria. By pumping air into the bottom of the tank, the mixture is agitated and oxidised. Harmful organisms such as cholera and typhiod germs are distroyed by this process.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Final Sedimentation:</strong> The purified effluent is kept in a tank for 21/2 hours. The sludge that collects is rich in aerobic bacteria and some is used for the activated sludge process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chlorination:</strong> Effluent from the Final sedimentation tank is chlorinated and is then safely allowed to flow into fields for irrigation or into rivers or streams.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Other methods of sewage disposal:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Oxidation pond:</strong> This is a cheap and sutable method for a small community. It is an open pool 3-5 feet deep with an inlet and an outlet. The organic matter in sewage is oxidised, because of the presence of :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) Sunlight In India this is usualy in plentiful supply.</li>
                                    <li>b) Bacteria which feed on the organic matter and produce carbon dioxide.</li>
                                    <li>c) Algae in the pond. Algae uses up carbon dioxide and producess oxygen with the help of sunlight.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Land Treatment of sewage:</strong> This method is used in some towns. After screening, grit removal and primary sidementation, the effluent is used for cultivation certain food crops such as plantains and other fruits trees, and of some vegetables (not to be eaten raw).</li>
                            <li><strong>Sea Outfall sewage</strong> gets diluted and gradually oxidised in the sea, but there is a chance of solid matter getting washed back. If this method is used, the sewage should be carried well out into deep water.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">COMMUNITY EDCATION AND JOINT PLANNING FOR REFUSE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL:</h4>
                        <p>The health Worker in community should use every opportunity to educate people about the diseases spread by the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Dry refuse left on the ground or in a heap, or thrown into water drains.</li>
                            <li>Water collections near houses and wells.</li>
                            <li>Defaecating on the ground. Until they have built latrines, people should be taught to at least dig a hole for passing motion and to cover it with earth, as cats do.</li>

                        <p>Wate is a basic human need. No-one can live without water. Water forms over half (57%) of the body weight, and without a supply of water a person will die within three days. A village or community cannot survive without water supply. Water is needed for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drinking and cooking.</li>
                            <li>Cleanliness - washing the body, clothes, house and utensils.</li>
                            <li>Food growing and for animals</li>
                            <li>Fire-fighting, industries, and for generating electricity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Safe water supply is a basic health need. It is estmated that 50% of illness in India could be prevented by provision of safe and adequate supply of water.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">SOURCES OF WATER IN THE COMMUNITY :</h4>
                        <p><strong>1. Rain -</strong> may be collected and stored. It is very soft water and more suitable for washing than for drinking purposes.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Surface water:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>a) Lakes, tanks and reservoirs.:</strong> Town and cities often depend on wate stored in reservioirs. Water from the 'catchment area' around is collected and sent to the water works for treatment/ In rural areas rain water may be collected in a large tank by means of a bund. Lakes are natural collections of water. This water is usually contaminated by humans and animals and is unsafe for drinking purposes.</li>
                            <li><strong>b) Streams, rivers and canals.</strong> Rivers collect water from streams on their way to the sea. Some rivers are important for water supply, but it is always polluted and must be treated in the water works. Canals are artificial water ways, made mainly for transport.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>3. Ground Water:-</strong> Some rain sinks into the ground until it reaches an impervious layer such as rock or clay, where it forms sub soil water, or even deeper underground lakes and streams. Ground water is safer than surface water and may require no treatment. The supply is usually constant. Even in summer. Disadvanges of ground water are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The water is hard because it has absorbed salts from rock and soil. Hard water means that more soap is needed, and that boilers and water pipes get clogged up or eroded.</li>
                            <li>It usually requires pumping.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Sources of ground water are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Springs -</strong> Where ground water finds its way to the surface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wells,</strong> which are of three kinds:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a. <strong>Shallow wells:</strong> These contain sub soil water which may easily be polluted by sewage water.</li>
                                    <li>b. <strong>Deep wells:</strong> These collect water from below the first impervious layer (of rock or clay) They can supply safe waster if proper precautions are taken.</li>
                                    <li>c. <strong>Tube wells:</strong> These are usually very deep. Water is tapped by boring a tube into the ground, and a pump is attached.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p>A safe well is one which:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Is on high ground and at least 15 metres away from any source of pollution such as latrines, refuse or soakage pit.</li>
                            <li>is a deep well or tube well, below the first impervious layer.</li>
                            <li>is lines with bricks and cement to a depth of at least 6 metres to prevent contamination by sub-soil water.</li>
                            <li>has a parapet wall of brick and cement of at least 70 cm from ground level, and a sloping cement platform with channel for carrying away the waste water (preferably to a vegetables garden or fruit trees).</li>
                            <li>has a cover, and no trees with overhanding branches nearby.</li>
                            <li>has a pump, or a special bucket with rope, kept free from contamination.</li>
                            <li>is never used for pot cleaning, clothes washing etc.</li>
                            <li>has a seperate place nearby for washing clothes etc.</li>
                            <li>is cleaned out once a year, and disinfected regularly.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Chlorination</h5>
                        <p>By adding sufficient bleaching powder to water, it is disinfected and made sasfe to drink. This is called chlorination.</p>
                        <p>wells should be chlorinated weekly, and other water sources whenever there is an epidemic of water-borne diseases.</p>
                        <p>The principle of chlorination is to add sufficient bleaching powder to ensure that the water contains 0.5 parts of chlorine per million parts of water, after 30 minutes of contact. 0.1 ml . of orthotoludine reagent is added to 1 ml . of the water in a test tube, and they yellow colour matched to find out the amount of chlorine. (0-T test)</p>
                        <p>To chlorinate a well you will need:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a bucket with rope or chain.</li>
                            <li>bleaching powder in an air tight container.</li>
                            <li>container for measuring.</li>
                            <li>particulars about diameter of the well, depth of water and chlorine content of the bleaching powder you have.</li>
                            <li>notebook for recording.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>To calculate, for example in a well 4 feet diameter and water 10 feet deep, when chlorine content is 20 %, calculate as follows:</p>
                        <p>4 x 4 x 10 x 5 (constant figure) = 800 gallons of water in well. / 14 (cont.fig)</p>
                        <p>800 x = 50 gr. or 37 grams of bleaching powder. / 20 (% of chlorine) needed.</p>
                        <p>Next, fix the rope or chain to the bucket. Mix the calculated amount of bleaching powder in the bucket three - fourths full of water. Then lower the bucket into the well and shake it about in the water. Take care not to disturb the bottom of the well.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Water Purification in the Home</h5>
                        <p>If water is obtained from a doubtful source, it should be purified in one of the following ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>By boiling:</strong> The waster should be kept boiling for 5 minutes. All water given to babies and young children must be boiled to prevent risk of disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>By chemical disinefection:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a). Iodine 2 drops of 2% tincture per litre of clear water. Allow 20-30 minutes before drinking.</li>
                                    <li>b) Potassium permanganate enough to make the water a good pink colour. This is not so reliable as the Iodine treatment, but is useful in the case of a cholera epidemic.</li>
                                    <li>c). Bleaching powder: Make a bottle of strong solution by adding 25 gm in 1 littre of water. Keep the bottle top tightly screwed down. Use in the strength of 1 ml . to 5 litres of water, and let it stand for half an hour before using.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Filtration</strong> There are various types of domestic filters, but they do not remove the viruses of poliamyelitis and infectious hepatitis. Filters are expensive and require regular cleaning.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Safety in Storing and Drawing Water</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The container must be clean and supplied with a suitable cover to prevent dust, flies and other insects, rats or birds from polluting the water.</li>
                            <li>Water should be poured out if the container is small enough. If not, the container should have a tap for drawing or dipper with long handle should be kept inside the container.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Water Purification for Towns:</h5>
                        <p>The methods used are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Storage and sedimentation.</li>
                            <li>Filtration.</li>
                            <li>Chlorination.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>1. Storage:</strong> This takes place either in the reservoir, or in storage tanks at the water works. Chemicals may be added to aid in the coagulating and settling of solid materials, which sink to the bottom of the tank.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Filtration: -</strong> Large cement tanks are prepared, with collecting pipes at the bottom. The tanks are filled up in layers with large stones, then small stones and gravel, then sand about two feet deep on the top. Inlet pipes let in the water which floods over the filter and passes through, becoming clean in the process. when filteration becomes too slow, another filter bed is used while the first is cleaned.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Chlorination:</strong> Chlorine gas, a powerful disinfectant, is injected in to the water in measured doses. By this means any remianing bacteria are killed. Ammonia may be injected also, to remove the taste of chlorine and yet prolong its action.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Distribution of Water:</h5>
                        <p>From the water works, the purified water is pumped into protected storage tanks underground, or straight to overhead water towers. From the tower the water flows in water mains made of iron with well-sealed joints, and branches from these mains, called service pipes, go to the houses.</p>
                        <p>If the water supply is constant and plentiful, water can be taken directly from the tap at any time. If however, the suply is intermittent, then storage tanks are needed in houses, and these must be kept very clean and free from contamination.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">USE OF WATER IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ILLNESS:</h4>
