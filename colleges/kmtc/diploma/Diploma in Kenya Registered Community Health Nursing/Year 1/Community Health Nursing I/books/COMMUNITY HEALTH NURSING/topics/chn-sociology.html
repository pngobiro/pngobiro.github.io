                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Introduction:</h3>
                        <p>The term sociology was coined by Augusta comte, a French philosopher in 1837.</p>
                        <p>It derived from Latin work "Societus" means "society", the Greek word "logos" means "study or science" Sociology is the "Science of Society"</p>
                        <p>No man is an is land, long ago, Aristotle, the Greek philosopher, remarked that he who doesn't need society is either a beast or god from the time of birth unit death, all normal human beings one part of a group, the family or community.</p>
                        <p>In other words, a community is a net work of human relationships. It is major functioning unit of Society.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Definition:</h3>
                        <p>Sociology defines that " as the study of society that is, Study of mans behavior in groups or inter - action and interrelations among human beings of social relation ships.</p>
                        <p>Sociology is the study of behavior of the individual, group, crowd, mob, audience and others social situations.</p>
                        <p>Attitudes of the individuals towards cultural and social values. Sociology can be defined as the study of relationships between human beings.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Groups:</h3>
                        <p>Man is a social animal. In any society it is natural for individual to form groups. The individual needs the group. Often a person belongs to several different groups at one time, to meet different needs.</p>
                        <p>A Social group is a collection of individuals two or more, interacting on each other, who have some common objects of attention and participate in similar activities.</p>
                        <p>A group is a social unit and consists of number of individuals who stand in definite status and role relationships to one another and which possess a set of values or norms of its own regulating behavior.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Classification of groups:</h4>
                        <p>Some groups are formed naturally others are organized for a purpose. A group maybe a large number only two or three persons.</p>
                        <p>According to Cooley, the group may be classified into two</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Primary group</li>
                            <li>Secondary group</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>1.primary group:</h5>
                        <p>It is the nucleus of all social organizations. It is a small group in a small number of persons come "into direct contact with one another. They meet face-to-face association for mutual help, companionship and discussion of common questions. It is such as a family, a small group of close friends. Or a playgroup among children. This relationship of sympathy and mutual identification that is "we feeling" is present. The relation of the people may be close and the contacts should also be close. Due to more intimacy the members feel more belonging and of being one unit. Every member shares the interests. There is a common life give and take. The group is usually bound together and strong ties of affection and loyalty. Decision may be taken in a group through the mode of voting but some times there is quarrelling the members may even hate one another.</p>
                        <p>Primary groups are found in every culture and society. They are very important for the child in his social development.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2.Secondary group:</h5>
                        <p>A secondary group is one which is large in size such as a city, nation, political party, corporation and labor union. A secondary group is a collection of individuals of some common interest or aim. Membership is voluntary and relationships are formal. The contacts become superficial and undefined. Every secondary group is controlled by formal rubs or laws or it can't violate. These rules are necessary any in every large-scale organization for securing efficiency, order and economy. In a section group where members do things together there may be face-to-face relationship, but as a group grows bigger there is less direct contact between members. In the modern society, secondary groups have taken ones many of the primary functions of the family, example in Bal wades, schools, churches. These institutions influence the attitudes, moral standards and behavior of people. Even also, the secondary group can't meet all human social needs, and the family is still the basic unit of society and most important for the child.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to Sumner's classification the groups classified into two</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>In group</li>
                            <li>Out group</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>1 In group</h5>
                        <p>The individual belongs to a number of groups are his ingroups. All other groups to which he does not belong are his outgroups.</p>
                        <p>There the family, the tribe, the college, to the person belongs are his in-groups of similar attitudes and reactions in their members. The members of such a group identify themselves with one another and with the group as a whole.</p>
                        <p>Ingroupness produces among them the sense of belonging together, which is the core of group life.</p>
                        <p>The members in the in-group feel that their personal welfare in bond with that of the other members of the group. Between them there is sympathy, co-operation, goodwill, mutual help and respect for one another's rights. They possess a feeling of brother hood and ready to sacrifice them selves for the group. The members signify their unity by the word" we</p>
                        
                        <h5>2. The out-group:</h5>
                        <p>The out group attitude is antipathy which may range in mildly intense hatred. The members feel instead of "we' they feel "they". So the treatment towards out groups are differ by the members. Example welcoming a daughter-in-law into the family. A wife working in a women's college becomes a member of the out-group for a husband working in a man's college. Though wife and husband are under in-group members.</p>
                        <p>However the distinction between in-group and out-group is overlapping and each group satisfies it or the other aspect of his personality.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Structure and activities of groups and organizations:</h3>
                        <p>A group or organization is made up of individuals each with a special position and part to play. We call this individual's 'role' . One person may have very different roles in several different social groups. He is a member of his family, a citizen of the state, a member of a certain caste or religious group, and functions with a different role in each of the groups of which he is a member.</p>
                        <p>Organization Structure means the role relationships the role relationships with the organization. Some persons are put in authority over others.</p>
                        <p>An organization chart shows the structure in a clear way. It shows each one's</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a area of responsibility (downward lines).</li>
                            <li>b Authority for reporting and accounting (upward lines).</li>
                            <li>c. Horizontal lines, for exchange of information with those on the same level.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Lines of Communication (downward, upward and horizontal) should be observed by everyone for the health, harmony and efficiency of the organization. Everyone should know the proper authority for reporting, consulting, making requests and receiving orders. Each one should also know his/her own area of authority and supervision, and with whom to communicate.</p>
                        <p>Activities of group and organizations may differ very much, depending on the purpose for which the group is formed. Examples are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>India as a nation, a republic, is itself a social organization. The state is the most important agent of social control, as it makes the laws and has power to enforce the law.</li>
                            <li>Political parties. These are groups working to get into power or stay in power.</li>
                            <li>Economic groups: commercial companies, transport companies, farmers' groups etc.</li>
                            <li>Religious groups, caste groups Harijans etc.</li>
                            <li>Professional groups such as teachers associations, nurses associations, students associations.</li>
                            <li>Trade unions, for collective bargaining with management in factories or public services.</li>
                            <li>Clubs for recreation, cultural activities, sports, drama, music, reading etc/</li>
                            <li>Panchayats, for village administration and justice.</li>
                            <li>Village advisory Councils formed of village leaders (formal and informal) for health and development.</li>
                            <li>Mahila Mandals (Women's, groups), in which women learn many useful things such as family and home care, adult education, and women's development. By working together as a group, women can do much to help themselves.</li>
                            <li>Youth groups: The village youth are stimulated to help in practical ways in village development projects such as sanitation. They help with health education through drama, song, films etc. By taking part in village leaders' meetings they learn to be good citizens.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">URBAN AND RURAL ADMINISTRATIVE PATTERNS</h3>
                        <p>Government administration means the processes by which the government carries out the laws and affairs of the nation and states. This is necessary for the welfare of society in order to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Maintain law and order.</li>
                            <li>Protect rights of individuals and groups.</li>
                            <li>Provide education for members of the society.</li>
                            <li>Protect the people's health, including environmental sanitation, and health services.</li>
                            <li>Protect the old, handicapped, and deprived sections of society.</li>
                            <li>Provide for transport (roads, buses, trains etc.) communication (postal and telephone systems, radio etc) and Electricity supply.</li>
                            <li>Develop commerce and industry.</li>
                            <li>Improve the social and economic position of the people, including housing schemes, employment schemes.</li>
                            <li>Provide facilities for sports and entertaiment.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>It will be seen from the above, that all aspects of modern life is under the control of Government. The Goverment has heavy responsibilities. Politicians of the ruling powers are Ministers fo various departments such as for finance, agriculture, transport, education, health, and family welfare. The ministries have the advice of I.A.S officers (Indian Administrative Service). They also have the assistance of the police services.</p>
                        <p>Administration works like a complex machine. There is a network of administrators serving in Government offices in urban and rural areas, connected with the state and central administration. In urban areas, administrative bodies include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>City Corporation - for a population above 2,00,000.</li>
                            <li>Municipal Boards - for 10, 000 to 2, 00, 000 .</li>
                            <li>Town area Committee - for 5,000 to 10,000 .</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In rural areas we have 'Panchayati Raj'. In each village there is a Gram Panchayat with a Sarpanch (president) as head. At Block level, the heads of all the Gram Panchayats form a Panchayat Samiti together with the Block Development Officer (B.D.O.) AND local Member of Parliament (M.P.) and Member of Legislative Assembly (M.L.A.s). At District level the heads of all Panchayat Samitis are members of the Zilla Parishad, which is presided over by the District Collector. The District Collector is a senor officer of the Indian Administrative Service (I.A.S).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CORPORATIONS, PANCHAYATS AND CO-OPERATIVES:</h3>
                        <p>The city Corporation is made up of elected Councilors, and the head of the Corporation is the mayor. The Corporation is responsible for:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Road maintenance, and streetlights.</li>
                            <li>Water supply and drainage.</li>
                            <li>Sewage and refuse disposal, public latrines, destruction of stray dogs</li>
                            <li>Food sanitation and adulteration of food.</li>
                            <li>Public health and disease prevention. Including immunizations.</li>
                            <li>Registration of vital events.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Panchayati Raj is the means by which village people can share in managing and improving their own society and way of life. It is made up of:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Gram Sabha, a meeting of all the adults of village. It means at least twice a year.</li>
                            <li>The Gram Panchayat, an executive body, made up of 15 to 30 members elected by the Gram Sabha. Members hold office for 3 to 4 years. The Gram panchayat is responsible for:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a Public services such as sanitation and disease control.</li>
                                    <li>b Social and economic development of the village.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The Nyaya Panchayat is a village court, which tries civil cases and minor criminal cases. There is usually one Nyaya Panchayat for a group of five Gram Panchayats.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Co-Operatives:</strong> These are groups formed in villages in order to</p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Crowed and Public audience:</h3>
                        <p>Crowd is described as collection of individuals who are all attending and reaching to some common object, their reactions being of a simple prep tent sort and accompanied by strong emotional responses.</p>
                        <p>Crowd may be defined as a collection of individuals united temporarily and in close proximately to each other whose object may be different kinds.</p>
                        <p>A crowd is a gathering with one another for a considerable number of persons around a center or point of common attraction.</p>
                        <p>Crowds and audiences are temporary collection of human beings, in contrast to groups, which are more enduring. While groups have a proper structure, there is no such structure in crows and audience. Though they are temporary and without structure. Crowds and audiences are of great significance in social life.</p>
                        <p>The crowd is the most transitory and unstable of all social groups. It is an unorganized group.</p>
                        <p>Crowd's form quickly and also dissolved quickly as we can see in the market place. The crowd differs from the audience in that the participants in an assembly, public meeting, cinema house etc. Fall into the predetermined order and are arranged according to some principle of selection, but in a crowd there is no such order whatever.</p>
                        <p>In between the audience and the crowd is the gathering of people who assemble to watch a snake charmer or to listen to a lecture by a medicine vendor in the market place. In such assemblages there is a minimum order, the persons will stand around their focus is on the perform or the vendor. But in a crowd there is no definite order at all. People just gather together.</p>
                        <p>Milgram and Toch describe collective behavior as "group behavior which originates spontaneously, is relatively unorganized, family unpredictable on interstimulation among the participants". It includes crowd behavior riots, protest movement public revolt, etc, . The persons in a crowd may behave in the most noble and heroin manner as well as in the most savage and destructive manner.</p>
                        <p>The audience is a form of institutionalized crowd or follows certain rules and an accepted pattern of conduct. Audience is organized and guided by Intellect.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Co-operation:</h4>
                        <p>It is an integrating activity and in believed to be the opposite of competition. It means working together for the common interest.</p>
                        <p>Co-operation is a form of social interaction where two ro more persons work together to gain a common goal.</p>
                        <p>It is the process by which individuals attaiment of common objective. The people work together to solve problems. The work of each person may be different; but there is a common aim on the part of all, to complete the work.</p>
                        <p>co-operation may b e voluntary, when people willingly work together, or organized co-operation as in implementing development plans. It is a universal phenomenon.</p>
                        <p>Example: In the ants we can observe the co-operation is evident for survival. People learn their first lessons in co-operations as members of the family. Individuals cannot reach goals without cooperation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Competition:</h4>

                        <p>It occurs whenever there is an insufficient supply of anything that human beings desire. It is a force, which compels people to act against one another. It is a natural result of universal struggle for existence. It may be the struggle for bread, struggle for luxuries, power social position, mates, fame, sports etc.</p>
                        <p>Competition is helpful when it stimulates individuals or groups to grater effect. It is harmful when competition turns to conflict with possible violence. It is an effort to out do the completion in achieving some mutually desired goal. It aim is to destroy the opponent. The competitor Observed and follow the rules of competition, to eliminate fraud. When these rules are broken, it becomes conflict. It is never entirely unrestricted.</p>
                        <p>It is an unconscious activity. It is universal. It acts in the achievement of individuals to proper places.</p>
                        <p>It is a source of motivation and it is a conductive to progress. It is a prerequisite to social progress and welfare of the group.</p>

                        <p>It is the social process in which individuals or groups seek their ends by directly challenging the antagonist by violence or threat of violence.</p>

                        <p>It is, in other words, a competition in its more occasional personal and hostile forms. It is a process by which one party attempts to destroy the other party.</p>
                        <p>Thoroughly, Normally violence is associated with conflict, in can occur without it. Ii is a conscious action and personnel activity. Conflict lacks continuity and it is universal. Due to frustration and aggression. The conflict may be arising. It disregards social norms.</p>

                        <p>Socialization is the process by which the individual acquires those behavior patterns, beliefs, standards and motives that are valued by and appropriate in his own cultural group and family.</p>
                        <p>Socialization begins as the means for acquiring distinctive human qualities than can only come from contract with other humans. Among these qualities are language, attitudes, a sense of social organization and moral conduct.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Imitation -</strong> the child watches others' behavior and tries to do the same. Later, imitation helps a person to conform to the norms and culture of society.</li>
                            <li><strong>Role - learning,</strong> e.g. a child plays the role of mother when playing with a doll. Student Health workers learn the role the Health Worker by practice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Punishment and Reward:</strong> The child needs to learn self-control to gradually take the place of control by punishment and rewards.</li>
                            <li><strong>Development of Self:</strong> By giving a name to a child, he develops the sense of which he is - an individual. Gradually he should learn to see himself as others see him. If he feels guilty when he does something wrong, it means his conscience has developed. This is another important step in the process of socialization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Co-operation with others</strong> is another valuable step in socialization. The individual needs to realize his role and the role of others in the team. He needs to learn how to communicate with and 'give and take' with others.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adjustment:</strong> This is one of the more difficult lessons is socialization. It is not easy to live in harmony with others and to fit into a new situation. Often there are conflicts. Adjustment requires us to understand others even if we can only 'agree to disagree'.</li>

                        <p>Social control is also exercised for promoting the welfare of the group as a whole. For social control, educating is the most effective means of control and the family is the most significant agency. Reward is a positive means while punishment is a negative means.</p>
                        <p>Social control in modern society is mostly exercised through an appeal to reason. The increasing complexity of culture will increase rather than diminish the need for effective social control.</p>

                        <p>We do not have accurate statistics regarding unmarried mothers in India. Social customs and traditions in India, the problem of unmarried mothers in India must be insignificant. Such mothers have a multiplicity of needs not only for medical termination of pregnancy but also for understanding and warmth and guidance all of which nursing can provide.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Handicapped:</h4>
                        <p>The handicapped are blind, deaf, and dumb, orthopedically handicapped, leprosy affected, mentally retarded, and emotionally and socially handicapped.</p>

                        <p>Social problems may start with individual problems such as alcoholism, prostitution, venereal disease or delinquency. When these problems affect a large number of people they become social problems and a danger to the welfare and safety of the whole community.</p>
                        <p>Many social problems are due to the population growth, which leads to overcrowding especially in city slums. We then have problems of housing, sanitation, communicable diseases, poverty and crime.</p>
                        <p>It will be seen that many of the social problems are connected with community health. In order to solve social problems, there is a need to coordinate activities in the areas of social welfare and assistance, community health services, and laws to control socialevils.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Delinquency and Crime</h4>
                        <p>Juvenile delinquency refers to the criminal offences by children and youth. In an adult the delinquent act Is called a crime.</p>
                        <p>There is a high rate of delinquency and crime in the city: in market places, bus stands, railway stations and near cinemas and hotels. Thefts are common, also burglary (breaking into steal) and sexual offences.</p>
                        <p>Juvenile delinquency often starts with a breakdown of family life, and lack of affection, also of controls in the hame. The child fails to socialize. He does not learn to accept the norms and values of society. It may be due to poverty that the child runs away to the city. He may steal money for food, smoking and drinking. Some are confused by seeing films or reading magazines which show a different way of life than that of the village.</p>
                        <p>With the widening gap between the 'haves and 'have-notes the individual with a hunger for more money or possessions often steals to satisfy that hunger. Later he gets drawn into a criminal group. There are even big crime organizations, which are able to carry on successfully, using bribes and threats to get what they want and escape the law. Anti-social practices of this type are a serious danger to the welfare of society.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prostitution</h4>
                        <p>this is an ancient social evil. It is more common in urban areas. The causes for a girl becoming a prostitute may be similar to those causing boys to become delinquents. Sometimes it is because of shame when she gets pregnant without being married. It may be because she wants money to dress well, or to give financial help to the family.</p>
                        <p>Another reason girls become prostitutes are kidnapping, or someone in the trade promising a job in the city. Soon the unfortunate girl is imprisoned to the men who pay for this.</p>
                        <p>The Government of India has passed 'The Suppression of immoral Traffic Act' to control prostitution. Raids are made on brothels and girls taken to jail, but it is not difficult for the brothel-keeper to pay and get her back. Rehabilitation programmers are needed to help these girls and limit this problem.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Beggary</h4>
                        <p>As in the case of prostitution, in the case of begging also there are organizations in the cities, which kidnap or lure children to make them beg in the streets. Sometimes children are maimed (made into cripples) in order to get more money from the sympathetic public. This kind of beggary brings a lot of money to the organizers.</p>
                        <p>In other cases beggary is a family profession.</p>
                        <p>In general the public think of alms giving as a virtue. The social problem of begging can be ended only when there is a social change n the attitude to begging.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Alcoholism</h4>
                        <p>moderate drinking is not a problem, but excessive drinking and addiction to alcohol is a social problem. The person who is addicted may do harm to his family, and leave them without money. His Work suffers or his job is lost. He may harm others also when drunk.</p>
                        <p>Because of the harmful results of drinking alcohol to the individual to his family and to the society. Gandhi promoted prohibition, but for various reason this is now dropped by most of the states of India.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Social stratification:</h3>
                        <p>It is the horizontal division of society into higher and lower social units. These divisions called social strata include the caster and class groups. It is the division of society into permanent groups or categories Linked with each other by the relationship of superiority and subordination. Some individuals and groups are rated higher than other on the basis of opportunities and privileges that they enjoy.</p>
                        <p>For eg In India doctor and engineers are rated higher than teachers. Status and role, economic and political groups are also factors in social stratification.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Caste:</h3>
                        <p>It is a collection of families or group of families bearing a common name, membership of which is hereditary, imposing on its members certain restriction in matter of social interaction. It is a hereditary type of social group. The Hindus social order is based on the caste system. Membership is by birth. The group or caste has a common name and traditional occupation. The members have to marry with in their own group, or else be treated as outcaste. The rules about food and drink are very strict.</p>
                        <p>The society is divided into various caste with a well developed life of their own. The status of a person does not depend on his wealth but on the traditional importance of the caste in which he had born. Status is determined not by vocation but by birth.</p>
                        <p>There are regular caste councils to regulate and control the conduct of all caste members. Their rules over all caste members work powerfully which keeps the people in their proper places.</p>
                        <p>In our society, the classes are divided from high, low. Thus Brahmins in India stand at the apex of the social ladder. Because they are produced from the purest pant of the the supreme i.e. from the mouth. So a Brahmin is entitled to whatever exists in the world. The whole world is his property. Others live on his charity. The speech uttered by Brahmins never fails to come true. In contrast high position enjoyed by Brahmins the sudras was subject to lowest they are untouchables with they could not use the public roads or public well.</p>
                        <p>Member of the first these classes must not travel the company of sudras. If sudras violate the rules, they may under in go sever punishments. Ever the well is polluted if a low Carte man draws water from them. The public schools did not admit impure caste. Sudan could not study the scared literature.</p>
                        <p>A person born in a Caste remains in it for life and dies in it. Members of a particular caste are expected to follow the caste occupation. They can't change to other occupation. Generally the impure castes are made to live on the outskirts of the city.</p>
                        <p>The lowest and most depressed groups are known as " scheduled castes". To help them up the social ladder, they are given opportunities and reservations in education and jobs. There is an "unsociability offences Act" to control the ill- treatment of untouchables.,</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Social class:</h3>
                        <p>It is one or two or more broad groups of individuals who are ranked by the members of the community, in socially, superior an inferno position. The members of the upper class are master and their made of dress typing way of recreation with expenditure are high</p>
                        <p>Where as the members of lower class are servants and mode of lining is manual labor.</p>
                        <p>In modern communities wealth is the primary determinant of social stratification there is an intimate relating between the social close and the occupation, which indicates the mode of life and general social standing. The members of class poser's common interests, they're brought into consciousness by the need of defense against the common enemy.</p>
                        <p>Social class a social class is a section of a community different from other sections because of social status. Social status may be because of birth (e.g. royalty in U.K. or Nepal) or race. In the modern society social status may be related to an of the following: income, occupation, education, political power, economic power, or religious power. Those who share a common status unite in a social class, and they feel belong in that class.</p>
                        <p>The 'upper class' includes those with greater wealth and property. Besides status, they often have power over the 'lower' class, and power may be mis-used. The poor are exploited and become still poorer. There is a gap between the rich and the poor, which is becoming wider.</p>
                        <p>The 'middle class' in Indian society is growing in size and strength. This is a strata between the upper and lower classes. It is based on economic factors and includes doctors, college professors, business managers, office workers and factory workers. A middle-class consciousness and culture is developing in modern India.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mobility:</h3>
                        <p>People in society continue to move up and down the status scale is called social mobility. It is to be distinguished from migration which is movement in geographical space.</p>
                        <p>Mobility has been classified as Horizontal mobility, Vertical mobility. Horizontal mobility's refers to change of residence or job with out status change. E.g. transfer of teacher from one school to another.</p>
                        <p>Vertical mobility refers to movement in any or all of the three areas of living class occupation and power. Mobility may be down ward or upward.</p>
                        <p>This term can mean a change in social status, or a change of place, e.g. from rural to urban area. In India today, large numbers of rural people migrate to the cities. They go in search of work, or to beg in order to live. If an 'untouchable' goes to live in the city, he gets away from the depressed social status he had in the village. If he finds a way to earn money he may move up from 'low class' to' middle classes.</p>
                        <p>Suppose a Brahmin moves from his village to the city. He will probably lose the superior social status he had before. In the urban community there is much more social mobility than in the rural community.</p>
                        <p>Independent India has adopted the principles of equality, freedom and justice. The Government planning and legislation are slowly bringing about social change. Education and the influence of foreign cultures, also politics and inter-group conflicts are other reasons for social change and social mobility.</p>
                        <p>For example, when a certain social group accepts Family Planning the smaller number of children get a better education, and later some may get top positions in society. In this way a whole group may move up in social status.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Social Status:</h3>
                        <p>It is a social position that determines for its possessor, apart from his personal and social services, a degree of respect, prestige and influence. It refers to individuals. Total standing in society the individuals ones respect by virtue of his social status.</p>
                        <p>Status means the position of an individual in the group, or community. Status may be because of age, sex, caste, class, occupation, marriage or achievements. For example, the elders in the family and in the community are usually respected. By his own ability and efforts, a person may achieve status and respect.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Patterns of leadership</h3>
                        <p>Leadership is found in every society. The society can be divide into (a) the leaders and (b) the followers.</p>
                        <p>A leader is one who leads a group of people. The leader has influence or power over the group.</p>
                        <p>It is said that leaders are 'born'. Heredity does seem to be one factor, but there are others such as development of character and good personality. Socialization is important in development of leaders.</p>
                        <p>Effective leadership depends partly on the people who are the followers. Some want strong leaders who dominate (authoritarian type). Others want leaders who allow for independence (democratic type). The Health Worker should realize that the power of leaders may be used for good or for evil. The leader can use power based on love and good relationships, or based on fear.</p>
                        <p>A really good leader identifies (is one with) the group., and enables them to plan and take group action to bring about change for the better. Thus he heaps to make the followers also into leaders.</p>
                        <p>In a community we find the following kinds of leaders:</p>
                        
                        <h5>1 Formal Leaders</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>i Official-</strong> those employed by Government, including the village Sarpanch, schoolteachers, post-masters, tax-collector etc. Their leadership goes with the post, and may be only temporary (they may be transferred). These leaders may or may not enjoy the respect of the community.</li>
                            <li><strong>i Functional -</strong> those elected or appointed to be leaders of non-Governmental organizations such as co-operative societies, Youth Clubs and Mahila Mandals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>2 Informal Leaders</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>i Natural leaders -</strong> those with influence in the village, who may be housewives, dais, or shop-keepers etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>i Status leaders -</strong> those who are respected and have the confidence of the people because of age, caste, religion, wealth or education.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>3. Opinion leaders</h5>
                        <p>Opinion leaders are those who would be able to help in promoting and supporting community health and development programmers. We need leaders who are convinced about the need and the valued of the programmers, and who also have qualities of leadership which can be developed. Some of the formal and informal leaders may have the right qualities and motivation and could be used. Other people too, such as those who have accepted family planning methods and are satisfied, may make good leaders for promoting the F.P. programmed.</p>
                        <p>The opinion leaders should be identified by health Workers, and training camps arranged for orientation in health and family welfare programmes.</p>
                        <p>It is important for success of community health and development programmes, for the team (including FHWs and MHWS) to get the confidence of the community leaders from the start. These leaders can help a great deal to bring about the needed changes. On the other hand, if they are not convinced about a programmed they can cause ittofail.</p>
                        <p>Community leaders should be involved in the planning, implementing and evaluating of programmers for health and family welfare in their villages. This is vital for the programmed to be effective, and to be ' of the people, by the people, and for the people'.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Regionalism:</h3>
                        <p>This refers to different areas where the population has a distinct culture, or a common language, or political outlook. For example, within India some neighboring states may join together in presenting their needs and demands to the central government. Countries of South Asia may unite in order to voice the opinion of the region at meetings of the united Nations Organization. Regionalism can be harmful and lessen unity if the people of one state or language try to control an area and refuse rights to others.</p>
                        <p>The community feeling with in a region is called regionalism. It gives man a feeling of others with his fellows and with the earth they share. It involves a cultural wholeness. The fundamental aim of regionalism is the closer integration of the rural civilization and urban civilization. It is the development of an integrated large community with in the city and country.</p>

                        <p>The community is a territorial group with shares a common soil as well as shared way of life. People living in the same locality come to have a distinctive community life. The community is more than the locality it occupies. It is also sentiment. The people living at a common place and leading their levies in one another's company come to develop " we - feeling". They share common memories and traditions, customs and institutions. Today none of us belong to one inclusive community. Under modern conditions attachment to local community is decreasing.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Changes in the Village:</h5>
                        <p>Ancient village community was a very small group of ten or twenty families.</p>
                        <p>The feeling of familiarity was so great that if a child wandered of from the home. The parents had nothing to worry because there are numerous relatives in the village. They laid a common property. Due to lack of communication and transport the members of the community were separated due to distance.</p>
                        <p>In the medieval village community so many changes. The keen ship did not played for a long time to bend people. The land is belongs to king and the slave with masters.</p>
                        <p>The modern village community, there is a rise of industrialism. Now urban group began to dominate civilization. Urbanization is increased with dominant rural social forms have been changing. Rural people follow the urban forms of life. Kinship bond is broken due to increased size and mobility of population.</p>
                        <p>Land is no longer cultivated jointly. They continue to work the land but then try to live in the mode of the city. Rural social forms are changed due to urbanization. By the large the rural way of life has been writhing away.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Development of Rural community:</h4>
                        <p>The nation's Five Year Plans for development are mainly for improving life in rural communities. Development of the people themselves is most important for success. There needs to be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a Social preparation of the community. The health and development personnel will need to get know, understand, and work with the people. The people need to feel it is their own programme for their own better way of life</li>
                            <li>b Co-operation between B.D.O. staff, the health team, community leaders and the people themselves, to find out the community problems and needs. If possible, community members should be used for data collection (survey).</li>
                            <li>c Planning with the community. It is best to select first programme which will cost little and bring quick results, e.g. kitchen gardens for better nutrition, or an anti-fly campaign to lessen the problem of diarrhea and dysentery.</li>
                            <li>d. On-going Community leaders' meeting, for further planning, implementing (carrying out the programmers) and evaluating (how useful is the programme?).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For health programmers, the role of the Health Worker is to assist the committee, provide technical information and training, and stimulate to action.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3.Major Rural Problem:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>a. Health problems,</strong> the most common being: Malnutrition, especially in under - five year children. Cormunicable diseases and infection. Too many child deaths and maternal deaths. A home accident especially burns and scalds.</li>
                            <li><strong>b Education -</strong> the problems of illiteracy, child labor, school dropouts, too few teachers ( one teacher schools), also lack of equipment, buildings too small or in need of repair etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>c. Transport and communications -</strong> lack of good roads, especially in rainy season, causes problems of supplies, marketing and taking the sick to hospital etc. The problem of villages being cut off from other communities and urban facilities, results in slow progress and development.</li>
                            <li><strong>d. Agriculture -</strong> the farmer may have problems such as insufficient water supply, especially in failure of monsoon, electricity cuts, and repair of pump-sets, tractors etc. Delay in getting supplies of seed, fertilizers, especially if he has n capital reserves. Labor problems - laborers may not be available when needed, or coolly demands are high. Procurement price given by Government may be too low, or demand for products is low. Sickness and death of flocks and herds (sheep and cattle).</li>
                            <li><strong>e. Population and employment -</strong> Agriculture can no longer provide enough for the growing population in rural areas. Some rural communities have taken up handloom weaving or other small industries, but these are not without many problems. Young men leave the village for urban areas in search of jobs. Sometimes whole groups of families migrate to a distant place to work for a contractor (building, mining and other project). They get advances from the contractor to buy food, and soon may become 'bonded laborers' and never get bat to their own village.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Urban Community:</h3>
                        <p>It is indicates fashionable living, wide acquaintance with things and people and political manner of speech. It limited note only to urban, slowly extended to rural people also. Every village possesses some elements of the city while every city carries some features of the village.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Development of Urban Community:</h4>
                        <p>City develops according to whatever resources available there. In ancient times these resources were available by the people. Slavery forced labor, taxation by the ruling are main factors for development of urban community. The extension of mans power over nature is a primary condition of the modern growth of cities and city population.</p>
                        <p>Industrialization and urbanization has also been greatly stimulated by the new techniques of production associated with industrial revolution. The invention of production associated with industrial revolution. The invention of machinery the department of steam power and to work in the factories, many people from village are abandoned to urban. Industrialization has stimulated city development, trade and commerce. Ancient civilizations cities grew wherever goods were good and commercial transactions were carried. Due to development of transport with communications, the facilities can be transported and develop urban community.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Economic pull of the cities:</h4>
                        <p>Cities can provide more opportunity for personal advancement than rural areas. Employment opportunism are more in the city. Even businessman comes to the city from the village to avail of better opportunities for making higher profits. Education and recreational facilities and amusement theatres are available in cities which contribute the urban community growth.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Characteristics of Urban community:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Home lessens are a disturbing feature of city community.</li>
                            <li>Energy and speed are the traits of a city. The people work at a speed, day and night which stimulate other to work.</li>
                            <li>People indulge in too many activities. Cities are consumers of population.</li>
                            <li>Facilities for preserving health such as hospitals and medical specialist are many and excellent.</li>
                            <li>City has more heterogeneous than the village. It is most favorable breeding ground of new biological and cultural hybrids. The personal traits, the occupations, the cultural and the ideas of the members of the urban community vary widely. Class extremes characterize urban community. In a city, the people rolling in luxury and living, in grand mansion as well as people live in pavements. The best forms of ethical behavior and the worst racketeering are both to be bound in cities.</li>

                        <p>Life is quite different in towns and cities than in the village. Traditions, customs and modes do not have much influence over those living in urban areas. Family life is less disciplined, and there is no camunity support. There is much more mixing among people of very different backgrounds. This brings about changes in habits and attitudes. Family conflicts are common.</p>
                        <p>For the individual's, and for families coming to live in the urban area, conscious efforts need to be made to form good friendships and to live in harmony with others. There are many opportunities for joining social groups for various activities.</p>
                        <p>People need to take up the challenge for forming a new 'community' even in the city, for mutual help and action to solve problems.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE IN COMMUNITIES</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">What influence change?</h4>
                        <p>The following are some causes for change in communities:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Industry and technology of modern life. New machines and new methods of doing things are continually being introduced.</li>
                            <li>Introduction of different cultures and new attitudes and values e.g. because of rural - urban interaction.</li>
                            <li>Population growth: This brings the need for more food production, schools, houses and jobs, and leads to struggle and corruption in the keen competition.</li>
                            <li>Inter-group conflicts, e.g. between labor and owner, between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' (class conflicts) between tribal and not-tribal populations, between low castes and upper castes and between youth and the elders of society. Such conflicts sooner or later bring about change.</li>
                            <li>women's movements: Greater freedom of women and more equality of sexes, leads to changes in family life and norms of society.</li>
                            <li>Political forces: The desire of people to share in deci-sion- making is growing. Political power can bring changes in laws.</li>
                            <li>Government plans and programmers for health and development. Planning is directed towards social change.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Organizing the Community for Change</h4>
                        <p>An important task of the Health Worker is to assist the community in organizing itself for change.</p>
                        <p>Inspire of 30 years of planned development, the rural poor are still poor. Most of the babies are born into a world of hunger, illiteracy, disease, oppression injustices and a struggle for existence. This section of the community needs out special attention. They need to be helped:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To benefit from employment or to be trained for self - employment in the rural community itself.</li>
                            <li>To get useful employment or to be trained for self- employment in the rural community itself.</li>
                            <li>To develop leadership, in order to fight for justice.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The section of the community whose needs are less basic, also need to be helped to adjust to the changes of the modern age. This section needs to be made more aware of the injustices and struggles of the poor. Migration to the cities should be stopped, by introducing more variety of occupations in the rural areas. Simple technologies for processing of crops, milk and meat production, and small- scale manufacturing, would provide work for more people. Help is needed to form co-operative.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">How change affects community development and health?</h4>
                        <p><strong>a Political Forces</strong> Through political struggles, the oppressed sections of society strive to bring a change in their situation. If these forces become violent, development is hindered. There is much destruction of properties, injuries and perhaps loss of life. Bitter feelings may continue for a long time, and there is suffering for many. Such things are a set-back to health and development programmes.</p>
                        <p>There needs to be change, but we should strive for peaceful change by democratic means and not by violent revolution.</p>
                        <p><strong>b. Socio-economic Forces</strong> The modern world is full of a variety of material things, and the changing culture has a deep effect on people. There is confusion and conflict. Often there is a break -down of former traditions and values, of family life and caste. Poor health both mental and physical, result.</p>
                        <p>Poor people are tempted to buy things like transistor radio, or Tinned baby foods, when they do not have enough to eat. They get things on credit and cannot pay back. The little bit of land they may have inherited has to be sold, debs pile up to the pint of despair, and sometimes suicide.</p>
                        <p>In spite of land reforms and movements, even more land has gone into the hands of the few landlords. Rural development programmers seem to help these landlords more than they help the landless poor. The poorest section seems unable to benefit from schemes such as cottage industries. The free medicines of the health services are not much help to poor people who have no money even for food.</p>
                        <p>Health workers need to be a bridge to link these helpless poor with sources of development and welfare programmers so that their basic needs can be met. There needs to be much more education of the people in making better use of their resources, e.g. simple nutritious diet, use of simple remedies in sickness, and avoiding debts due to spending on family functions and religious festivals.</p>
                        <p>Both in the urban and in rural communities, people need help in adjusting to the changes of modern life. People need to understand what will really help to bring to birth a happy, healthy way of life for all. The Health worker in community has a vital role to play in bringing about these changes for the better.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">HEALTH STATISTICS</h4>
                        <p>Health statistics are facts and figures which reveal the state of health of the community. Sickness and death, population, housing, lands, nutrition, social and economic factors, environment etc. are all important in measure g the health of the community.</p>
                        <p>Health statistics are collected by means of the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Census:</strong> Every 10 years this is taken. Each person's age, sex, marital status, birth place, religion, literacy, occupation and other information are collected on national level.</li>
                            <li><strong>Registration of births, deaths and marriages.</strong> These are called vital statistics, or vital events (see chapter 2).</li>

                        <p>The registration of vital statistics is not satisfactory at present. Many births and deaths are not reported, and there are often mistakes in the data. The system of collection of vital statistics needs to be improved.</p>
                        <p>The Health worker can influence the community to bring about some improvements as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Educating the community about the importance of registration and getting correct certificates of births, deaths and marriage.</li>
                            <li>Parents should produce a certificate of birth before a child is admitted to school.</li>
                            <li>Appointment of the secretary of the Gram Panchayat as the local Registrar.</li>
                            <li>The Registrar should send the data on to the proper authority without delay, and records kept up-to-date. A village record should show family wise records of vital evens.</li>
                            <li>Officers of the Health Department may be encouraged to inspect the records.</li>
                        </ol>
