                        <p>Man kind eats to satisfy the feeling of hunger. Nutrition plays an important role in the promotion and maintenance of health and in the prevention of disease in order to keep well our bodies, need nourishment.</p>
                        <p>Just as a plant will not grow without water sun shine and proper manure, human beings also need food stuffs of different kinds of nourish to the body. Malnutrition and under nutrution are the greatest international health problems of the present day. A sound knowledge of nutrition is therefore essential for all community health workers. Nutrition deals with the way in which the human body receives and uses all the substances or materials necessary for its growth and devlopment and for keeping it is good condition.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">DEFINITION: -</h3>
                        <p>Nutrition may be defiend as the Science of food and its relation ship to health. It is concerned primarily with the part played by nutrients in body growth and development and maintenance.</p>
                        <p>The word nutrient or "food factor" is used for specific dietary constituents such as protiens, Vitamins and minerals. Dietics is the practical application of the principles of nutritution, it includes the planning of meals for the well and sick.</p>
                        <p>Good nutrition means "maintaining a nutritional status that enables us to grow well and enjoy good health.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Relation of Nutrition to Health: -</h3>
                        <p>A person who does not eats the right foods or does not eat enough is malnourished and we call this s malnutrition also means that a child is less clever than he should be. The trouble may start even before birth if his mother does not have the right foods when she is pregnant. The malnouished child does not play but sits doing nothing. He is slow in learning to walk and talk. At school he is hungry, sleepy, dull and very slow to learn The children are slow in passing mile stones.</p>
                        <p>Good nutrition is a basic component of health. The relation of nutrition to health may be seen from the follwoing view points.:</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Growth and development :-</h4>
                        <p>Good nutrition is essential for the attainment of normal growth and development. Not only physical growth and development, but also the intellectual development, learning and behaviour are affected by malnutrition. Mal nutrition during pregnancy may affect the foetus resutling in still birth, premature birth and small for the dates babies. He is under weight because of not haiving enough of the kind of foods needed for growth. Good nutritions is also essential in adult life for the maintanance of optimum health & afficiency. So nutrition affects the individuals health from birth to death.</p>
                        
                        <h4>2. Specific deficiency :-</h4>
                        <p>Malnutrition is directly reasponsible for certain specific nutritional defeciency diseases. The commonly reported ones in India are Kwashiorkar, marasmus, blindness due to Vitamine A deficiency anaemia, beri-beri, goitre etc., Good nutrition therefore is essential for the prevention of specific nutritional defeciency diseases and promotion of health.</p>

                        <h4>3. Resistance to infection :</h4>
                        <p>Malnutrition predisposes to infections like tuberculosis. It also influences the course and out come of many clinical disorders. Infection, in turn, may aggravate malnutrition by affecting the food intake.</p>

                        <h4>4. Mortality and Morbidity :-</h4>
                        <p>The Indirect effects of Malnutrition on the community are even more striking a high general death rate, high infant mortality rate, high sickness rate and a lower expectation of life. Over nutrition, which is another form of malnutrition is responsible for obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular and renal diseases, disorders of liver and gall bladdar.</p>
                        <p>More recent reports suggests that diet perhaps plays an important role in certain types of gasto intestinal cancers. It is now quite well acceptable that diet and certain diseases are interrelated.</p>
                        <p>Here is a comparision of the effects on people of good nutrition and malnutrition:</p>

                        <p>There are many other factos which affect the nutritional status of the health of the individual. The most important of which are:-</p>
                        
                        <h4>1. Surface area of the body :-</h4>
                        <p>The larger the surface area of the body in relation to bulk, the greater the use of (Nutrition) diet. Eg. : - A tall man lost his energy more when compare to short man with same weight. So the tall need and should eat more compare to short fat man of the same weight.</p>

                        <h4>2. Sex:-</h4>
                        <p>Energy using by the body surface area in men is more compare to the women. So the calory requirement is also more in men than women.</p>
                        <p>40 calories per Sq. Metre per hour for men.<br>37 calories per sq. metre per hour for women.</p>

                        <h4>3. Age:-</h4>
                        <p>Growing children and adolescents need more diet than adults.</p>
                        
                        <h4>4. Diseases :-</h4>
                        <p>Some diseases, especially thyriod gland, may increase or decrease the basal metebolic rate. So the intake of food also increases or decreases in thyriod problem cases.</p>
                        
                        <h4>5. Under Prolonged or Chronic under nutrition the diet intake is decreased.</h4>
                        
                        <h4>6. Psychological or emotional tension caused by worries or stress will increase the intake of diet.</h4>

                            <li><strong>Ptotective Foods:</strong> - These are foods rich is Vitamins and minerals and protiens, eg: - Milk, green leafy vegetables. Protective foods are so called because they protect the body against infection, disease and ill health. It may be mentioned that diets in India are generally poor in protective foods.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>Nutrients are organic and inorganic complexes contained in food. There are about 50 different nutrients which are normally supplied through the foods we eat. Each nutrient has specific functions in the body. Most natural foods contain more than one nutrient. These may be devided into</p>

                        <h4>Energy foods and calories:-</h4>
                        <p>Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. A continued need of the body is for energy foods are fuel for the body to work rather like diesel is fuel for a bus to run. The harder you work, the more energy food you need, but evenat rest. The bodystill uses fuel for breathing and for the heart beating. By burning fuel foods for energy, heat is also produced. In cold weather you can keep warm by exercise and eating more energy foods.</p>
                        <p>They are cheapest sources of energy and are the basis of our diet Indian diets are characterised by excessive amounts of Carbohydrates, providing as much an 90% of the required calories. In balanced diet, carbohydrates provide 50-60% of total calories taken in excess, the carbohydrates are converted into body fat.</p>
                        <p>The kind of staple food we eat depends on our habits and what is available, staple foods includes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Proteins</h3>
                        <p>The word "Protein" means that which are essential for growth; for making different kinds of cells, tissues and organs of the human body. Proteins are composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur in varying amounts. From this we can understand why pregnant women, nourishing mothers, babies and children all needs to have a lot of proteins in their diet. Those who are injured or have same disease which attacks body cells, need extra protien for repair of tissues that have been harmed. Every one needs protein because our bodies are made up of living cells whcih wear out and need replacing.</p>
                        <p>For Eg. :- The life of red blood cells is only about 120 days. New red blood cells need to be produced constantly.</p>
                        <p>Proteins differ from carbohydrates and fat in the respect that they contain nitrogen . Proteins are made up of simple substances called amino acids. These are building blocks of proteins.</p>
                        
                        <h4>AMINO ACIDS: -</h4>
                        <p>There are many different proteins and each one is made up of a group of about 100 amino acids. There are about 20 different kinds of aminoacids. we can think of them as beads of different colours joined together to make a chain or necklace (a protein). A protein is like a necklace rolled into a ball, but so small we cannot sœit.</p>
                        <p>When we swallow a protein food, first the proteins seperate, then the protein chain is broken and amino acids sepereated. Inside the body the new proteins are formed by joining up the amioacids in a different order, accoridng to needs of the body.</p>
                        <p>The body can make some amoniacids out of others, and these are called "non essential" amino acids. About 8 aminoacids cannot made by the body and must be taken in our food. These 8 are the essential aminoacids.</p>

                        <h4>Protein requirements: -</h4>
                        <p>The requirements of proteins as per body weight. The Indain Council of Medical Research in 1981, recommended 1.0 g protien 1 kg . body weight for an Indian adult.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fats:</h3>
                        <p>Fats are composed of Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They are composed of smaller units called fatty acids. Some fats such as ground nut oil, gingerly oil are liquid at room tempertaure.</p>

                        <h4>Classification of Fats</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Saturated fats.</strong> Eg. Animal Fats.</li>
                            <li><strong>Un saturated fats.</strong> Eg. Vegetable oils and fats.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Current research indicate that excessive intake of saturated fat is harmful to the body.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Functions:-</h4>
                        <p>Fats Serve the following functions.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Fats provide energy. A grame of fat provide 9 calories of energy i.e., twice the number of calories from carbohydrates and proteins.</li>
                            <li>Fats are carries of fat soluable vitamins. Eg. : Vitamine A, D, E, and K .</li>
                            <li>Dietary fats supplies essential fatty acids are needed for growth and maintenance of the integrity of the skin.</li>
                            <li>They maintain our body termparature.</li>
                            <li>Fats provide support for many organs in our body such as heart, kidneys, intestive etc.</li>
                            <li>Foods containing fats are tasty.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Sources</h4>
                        <p>Dietary fats are derived from 2 main sources.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Animal sources :-</strong> These are Ghee, butter, fat of meat, fish oilsetc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vegetable sources : -</strong> Various vegetable oils such as ground nut oil, ginger oil , mustard oil, cotton seed oil and coconut oil.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Fat requirments:-</h4>
                        <p>Adult requires 20-60 grams 1 day.</p>
                        
                        <p>Calories are used to measure energy. We use calories to measure how much energy is there in certain foods. We use calories also to measure how much energy a person needs(energy requirements)</p>
                        <p>Nutrients that provide calories, and the amounts are as follows:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One Gram of Carbohydrate provides 4 calories.</li>
                            <li>One Gram of proteins provides 4 calories.</li>
                            <li>One Gram of fats provides 9 calories.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that proteins are not including in "energy foods" because their main use is for body - building; what is left over from requirements for body building and repair can be used as fuel for energy.</p>
                        <p>Here are some foods, and the caloreis provided per 100 gms.</p>
