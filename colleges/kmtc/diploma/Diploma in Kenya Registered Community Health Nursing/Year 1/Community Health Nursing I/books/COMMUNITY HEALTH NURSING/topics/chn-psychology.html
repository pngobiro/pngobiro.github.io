She come and contact with people of all ages in the community. A knowledge of Psychology is essential for a nurse to know her self and others to differentiate between the normal and abnormal and to help promote mental behavior and to help promote mental health in individual & families.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors influencing Human Behavior</h3>
                        <p>The main factors influencing human behavior are knowledge, beliefs, values, attitudes, skills, finance, and materials.</p>
                        <p>Time and the influence of family members, friends & coworkers, opinion leaders and even health workers themselves. Some of the other factors influencing human behavior are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Envirommental stimuli:</strong> sight, smell, stumuli etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Needs:</strong> Behavior influenced by his needs, wants</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotions Feelings:</strong> These arises from with in the body Eg: Anger, joy, hunger . Behavior is also dependent on our feelings and emotions</li>
                            <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> With out Motivation behavioral changes commit take place. Motivation is an force which achieves an individual to a contain action.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intellectual Perception:</strong> A persons intellectual Perception thinking and reasoning can influence his behavior in a given stimulation that is why each individual behavior in ways which make sense to him</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Heredity and Environment:</h3>
                        <p>Heredity seems to contribute to behavior development. Heredity always contribute to behavior with in context of particular Environment circumstances monozygotic twins are more similar to dizotic twins.</p>
                        <p>Environmental is also seems to contribute the behavioral development when identical twins that is same heredity and the same environmental reared together posses same Intelligent Quotient. The fraterntal twins that is dissimilar heredity the same environment will shows the different twins dissimilar degree of Intelligent Quotient.</p>
                        <p>Characteristics like short temper ness, musical and artistic skills are passed genetically passed. Then parents provide the Environment for department in the early years.</p>
                        <p>Any behavioral Characteristics is determined by genetic factors Eg ; Intelligence, perception, evaluation, reasoning etc other factors like blood group is totally determined by the genes.</p>
                        <p>Any amount of environmental modification cannot change such Characteristics. Some of the genetically determined Characteristics which are modified by Environment are phencyeketonuria which leads to MR. The dietary and other treatment procedures the disease can be treated. The factors like intelligence, stress tolerance are not traceable to any genes but indirectly affected by heredity. These factors are highly modifiable by Environmental influences.</p>
                        <p>The modern science has advanced that inherited characters like facial features can be changed by plastic surgery. A person who is undergone such change would naturally develop positive self image and his behavior will be different. This illustrate that the deliberate influence of Environment and more recent research shows that neither is heredity inflexible nor in Environment, all that effectie.</p>

                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Personality:</h3>
                        <p>Personality is a dynamic organization with in individual of those physiological system that determine his unique adjustments to his environment.</p>
                        <p>Personality is total pattern of characteristic ways of thinking, feeling and behaving that constitute the individual relating to this environment</p>
                        <p>Personality implied certain physical and mental traits, which are characteristic of a given individual. The individual's behavior on adjustment to his surroundings.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Personality and self-concept:</h3>
                        <p>Personality means being a person, unique and different from every other person. Personality is related to</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Goals and desires</li>
                            <li>Values, attitudes and interests.</li>
                            <li>Habits of thinking</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>As the infant grows and learns to distinguish between himself and other people and things and understand the concept or meaning of the word me or self-structure develops, it becomes the important meaning of personality. In this the individual experiences and coping patterns are organized. We may consider the self as the third and final determinant of personality.</p>
                        <p>A child at an early age begins to be aware of himself as a person. His personality develops by social interaction. Thus every person in some respects is like all other human beings, like some human beings and like no other human beings. Personality is not the experiences of life.</p>
                        <p>Some of the experiences may harm the personality. They are fears, doubts, guilt feelings that may have started in childhood makes us afraid to show our real selves. The act of role-plays 'games' and hide behind different masks in our relations with other.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps we can become free from our fears and negative attitudes and begin to grow into what we can become.</p>
                        <p>Thus each person evaluate himself and develop adopting system in his or her own right way of life and may consider the self as the third and final determinant of personality.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Self - awareness and acceptance:</h3>
                        <p>In order to function well in the community the health worker needs to develop personally and be able to help others grow.</p>
                        <p>Here are some suggestions for personal growing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be aware of your psychological position.</li>
                            <li>Begin to analysis your transitions.</li>
                            <li>Be aware of your responses to stress, to frustrations and if you are feeling not ok, what can you do?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors that influence personality:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Heredity:</strong> genetic factors influence growth and development especially height, weight, mental and social development and personality. From our parents we receive certain qualities like temperament and intelligence. Marriage of close relatives adds to this danger i.e. some mental disorders arise.</li>
                            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> this is the most important factor influencing the personality.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>a Physical environment:</strong> This affects both body and mind of the growing child. A child must grow up in a decent home and locality for good mental health and out look on life criminals often come from a poor home.</li>
                                    <li><strong>b. The social environment:</strong> it means the people with whom we live, play and work that influence the personality in all aspects, knowledge and skill, habits, attitude and interests, values and goals. Most important of the social factors are the home, the school and the community.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Children from well to do families have better heights and weight and personality. This is because the economic factor is connected with the nutrition and level of living of the people.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Basic needs, drives or urges:</strong>
                                <p>Every individual has some basic needs or wants which drive or urge the person to some activity or behavir.</p>
                                <p>There are priorities in these needs, and it is usually only when more basic needs are satisfied that a person will feel the urge to try to satisfy other needs. Basic needs in order of priority are as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a. Physiological needs: such as food, air and water, rest and sleep.</li>
                                    <li>b Safety and security needs like shelter, home and family, income and job security.</li>
                                    <li>c. Love and belongings needs, such as family, good friends, belonging to one or more group.</li>
                                    <li>d. Recognition needs like appreciation and approval.</li>
                                    <li>e Achievement needs, to have a sense of victory, such as fulfilling goals and ambitions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Early learning:</strong> is conditional learning. At first the child sleeps most of the time when not feeding. Gradually when awake he begins to discover the world around him, through his senses of the mothers voice and her touch long before he can really see her. When she comes to pick him up he knows she is going to feed him. So he stops crying to anticipate what his mother will do. This is conditioned learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Value systems, attitudes and beliefs:</strong>
                                <p>These are learned mainly in the family and in early social environment. They help to regulate behavior and help us to adjust in the social set up where we live.</p>
                                <p>A set of values or a value system, is required into the personality as the child develops. Values may be helpful in building characters, such as value for life i.e. not to do anyone harm and respect for the property of others. Other positive values achild may learn are, the value of education, of self-discipline, of family unity, and the value of sharing with others. A child whose parents have habits such as theft, lying, cruelty and revenge may acquire negative values.</p>
                                <p><strong>Attitudes:</strong> are acquired characteristics of individual. They are more or less permanent ways of behavior. That is the way we usually react, or see and feel in certain situations.</p>
                                <p>For eg. Having an attitude of respect for our elder is a positive attitude. To feel hatred for the people of a certain community is a negative attitude. Attitude affects our behavior and is not easily changed. An attitude includes three components.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a. Knowledge</li>
                                    <li>b Feeling element</li>
                                    <li>c. A tendency to action</li>
                                    <li>d. Social interaction eg. Attitude toward persons, things, situations and issues.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It is said that attitudes are caught and not taught. Once form, attitude is difficult to change. They affect our behavior. The attitude should be developed cultivated in children or going people by their parents, teachers religious leaders and older to develop a good y character and harmony in society. In recent years the attitude surveys psychologists and health professionals.</p>
                                <p><strong>Beliefs:</strong> the other hand they are permanent, stable, almost unchanging. It is thus caries to give up ones opinions. When faced with the facts, attitudes and beliefs do not change early. Beliefs may, however, be introduced to an individual from some source outside.

                        <p>In this unit we can discuss about the mental health aspects through various Life Stages</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">1) Infancy</h4>
                        <p>Infancy or the period of a new born the word infancy means extreme helplessness this may be limited to the first few weeks of life that is gradually increasing independence.</p>
                        <p>First the infant is completely dependent on others for all of his needs. Physical needs are to feel wanted and love the health & happiness of mother plays an important role & effect on the development of fetus during pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>If the mother is happy during her antenatal period she may be free from fears & worries & the child become mentally health.</p>
                        <p>During the time of birth the child may be experienced a great anxiety, fear & tension. At the time of delivery the child mental health is very likely to suffer. Even though the childbirth is normal, after the birth the child has to make big adjustments. That means separation from mother causes anxiety in the child.</p>
                        <p>To help child to adjust the environment should be as clean as possible to that experienced during fetal life that is keeping child warm, comfortable, clean, well nourished & protected. In addition parents should try to avoid quarrels and keep the emotional atmosphere calm & happy.</p>
                        <p>The infant also needs to be constantly loved & recognized. Mother's love makes child to develop a foundation for his future healthy growth & department. If the child is not reared properly, child may grow up unable to receive love & to love other people. If the child cry is ignored & who is often left wet, cold & along for long periods even if he is fed, will come to feel that the world is hostile or enemy & every one is against him.</p>
                        <p>The infant will begin to show independence & trying to have his own way during time of weaning when he is denied breast feeding, the child may be refuse food. If the artificial feeding is giving to child for his sucking satisfaction, child may develop thumb sucking.</p>
                        <p>Thumb sucking is a habit of child gradually grows out of especially if he feels lack of love & security.</p>
                        <p>Toilet training is usually not possible completely in first year. Due to the reflex action urine & motion are passed.</p>
                        <p>With weaning the motions are frequent if mother shows dislike of having to clean up the child, the child may feel & develop guilty feelings, if mother is anxious, when child fail to pass motion, child gets to realize power he has to influence his mothers reactions & may keep stool back by his own will. Too much stress on elimination may cause child to develop stubbornness of character and this may continue through out life.</p>
                        <p>So the health worker should encourage mother and guide her and not expecting too much of such a small child, but at the same time begin the training process.</p>
                        <p>The health worker should give health education to mother about importance of child's early life experiences & avoiding of emotional hurts. And also, the mother should know that if child develop a psychological scan, the infant might suffer life long adjustment problems.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2 Early Childhood</h4>
                        <p>It is a true foundation period of life because at this time many behavioral patterns, many attitudes, and many patterns of emotional expressions are being established. It is an age of decreasing dependency due to rapid development of body control.</p>
                        <p>These children find out their sex and tend to feel their genitals and find pleasure. This is normal at their stage and the child should not be scolded. The health worker should tell the parents to divert child's attention. This habit may be disappearing when the child starts school.</p>
                        <p>A girl of this stage shows intense love for her father, and needs affectionate response from him for proper personality growth.</p>
                        <p>Parents need to discipline children but punishment should be gentle. They should explain to child what he may do or not do, but never threaten nor make him afraid. At this age children usually have a strong love for parents but at the same time hate them for discipline. The child needs to know he is loved even while being punished. At this age child is very active and trying into every thing. He should be given space and materials for playing safely and always be supervised but not over protected. Little tasks the child can do may be given, together with engagement, to give him a sense of achievement.</p>
                        <p>The child will imitate the attitude and behavior of a person when they admire and want to be like and its is important that they watch their own behavior. Religious educations should be given to the child in a way he can understand, using pictures, stories and parents own example.</p>
                        <p>The practice of above principles in home will ensure mental health of less than five children. However there will be homes where there are problems and the health worker should do all she can to help parents and children's is overcoming them.</p>
                        <p>Common behavioral problems at this stage include the following</p>
                        
                        <h5>1 Negativism and Temper tantrums</h5>
                        <p>Physical resistance gradually given away to verbal resistance and pretending not to hear has understood requests. A child who is frustrated and discouraged, treated unfairly or who has too much of his own way, may react with stubborn disobedience, defense and temper tantrums. Parents need to be helped to understand the real needs of the child.</p>
                        <p>They should not over react to the child's behavior but realize that he has strong emotions and cannot control them. If he is understood and loved, he will gradually learn self control and obedience.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2 Sleep disturbances and Bed wetting</h5>
                        <p>If the child feels insecure, fears and anxieties these disturbances may be arise. So at that times the children may have might makes and wake up screaming and full of fear. If this is a only occasional, parent may be reassured that it is not serious. They should avoid situations that the child doesn't water terrific seems in the TV nor see frightening pictures at bedtime. If the problem continues a doctor should be consulted.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bed wetting-</strong> It is normal for sometime after the child is toilet trained in daytime. If child is in very deep sleep (may prevent the child from walking) though the bladder is full the child may not get up for urination. So far wetting bed, the parents should never scold the children. Before going to bed & in late night they may lift the child to empty the bladder. Later if the child did not do bed wetting the parent should appreciate. They may develop the child proud and selfconfidence. If the enuresis continues to be a problem the parents should consult the doctor.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3 Fears and Anxieties</h5>
                        <p>Some of experiences like thunder and lightening, a barking dog, getting lost or if he has some accident these situations makes the child very frightened. The child needs to be immediately reassured by presence of a parent or fears may continue and be a handicap in his future life.</p>
                        <p>When parents are inconsistent, reacting to a child behavior in different ways at different times, the child is confused and feels a lack of security. This result in tension or Anxiety State, which may be lasting, and lead to mental or physical illness later.</p>
                        
                        <h5>4 Aggressive and Destructiveness</h5>
                        <p>Frustrations create such anger and hate in child that it may result in aggressive and even destructive or cruel behavior. At this time child needs more love and understanding and to be quickly forgiven. It is only gradually that young child learns to control his emotions and behavior. Being given opportunity for active exercise may help him.</p>
                        <p>A common accompaniment of temper out bursts in young children is destroying any thing with their reach whether they're own or some one else.</p>
                        <p>Aggressive behavior may be because off jealousy when a new baby has arrived. The child needs to be given some attention also and helped to enjoy being with baby.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Over - submissiveness :</h5>
                        <p>f a young child is made to be ashamed and feel guilty for his behavior, he may try to hide his feelings and may get the habit of himself away . he may seem to be a godchild, submitting to the parents , but his suppressed emotions and habit of withdrawal are likely to cause emotional problems later in his life. Parents need to be warned not to punish a young child to the extent that his feelings are suppressed. The child's behavior improves more by praise then by punishment.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">LATER CHILDHOOD :</h4>
                        <p>Children of 6 to 12 years who go to school may for the first time experience real authority and discipline. The child enters a new world of ideas and experiences, and meets new people . On first going to school the child should be suitable encouraged and not have the feeling he is being sent because he is not wanted at home.</p>
                        <p>Children need to be told what to do . most of them want to do as they are told, but some time children enjoy being naughty. They feel secure when the teacher is firm and consistent in controlling behavior .</p>
                        <p>A good teacher will respect each child as an individual . He will encourage their efforts and not expect too much of dull once. Children learn best by doing things. They should not be expected to sit still for long periods. they like to work or play in groups. Team games and group activities help children to keep to rule , to develop co-operation , team spirit , and leadership , also to experience failure and victory . deprived children need special care and encouragement, as they often have feelings of inferiority and in security . they should be helped to do well in some area of school life, and to have physical needs met, e.g. school meals, uniform and books .</p>
                        <p>Emotional conflicts may arise because of the dual authority , at home and at school. Parents- teacher associations are to be encouraged as these help to bring understanding and to solve problems for helping the children. Religious training need to be continued in the stage.</p>
                        <p>Stuttering, or stammering, is a common problem of the school child. There is difficulty in getting the work out when trying to speak. It is because of in security, often when a child starts school and has been over protected at home.</p>
                        <p>These children need more firm handling at home, and to be treated with kind ness and sympathy at school. As they get adjusted to school life, children usually grow out of stuttering if not, they may be referred for speech therapy .</p>
                        
                        <h5>Reading difficulties</h5>
                        <p>The ability to read is essential for normal mental development and for acquiring knowledge . children who have difficulty in reading needs special attention . the reason may be defect of the eyes or of the brain, and if either of these are suspected the child should be referred.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Learning problems</h5>
                        <p>If a child is not making progress at school , teacher should try to find the reason. Is it because of hearing or sight defect? Is he being forced to attend the school with no motivation? Is there lack of security and affection at home? Is the learning problems in all subjects or only a certain subject?</p>
                        <p>The teacher should make every effect to see that the child is given help in needs so that he develops mentally and makes the best use of the learning opportunities.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Day dreaming (fantasy )</h5>
                        <p>This is a way of escaping from the world around into a world of once own imagination . young children often enjoyed their own world of making believe. If the day dreaming is only occasional , it is normal and there is no harm . if the habit develops so that the child day dreams instead of attending to studies and duties, the child needs to be helpe!d to break the habit . he may need help in facing up to problems at home or at school.</p>
                        <p>If a child does not break the habit of day dreaming, it may lead to a type of mental illness called schizophrenia.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Adolescence</h4>
                        <p>This is the period between child hood and adulthood, from 13 to 18 or even up to 20 years. It need not be a period of storm and stress, difficult for parents, teachers and the young people themselves . of certain principles are followed.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Principles of ensuing mental health in adolescence</h5>
                        
                        <h5>1.Emotional satisfaction in earlier stages</h5>
                        <p>The difficult period of adolescence is passed through with far less problems when the basic emotional needs have been satisfied in earlier stages, especially in fancy and early child hood. The health worker should help parents of young children to realize the importance of the child's mental health and emotional development from birth onwards.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2. SEX EDUCATION :</h5>
                        <p>Puberty and the physical changes in boys and in girls has been explained. Parents and teachers need to be understanding when adolescents are clumsy because of rapid physical growth, self- conscious about their appearance, confused and moody with maturing of sex organs, sex sensations and urges.</p>
                        <p>Sex education should begin early in the Childs life, by parents giving reply to questions in a way. The child can understand sex education should be given in schools in a scientific way. In addition, the adolescents should have the chance of discussion in small groups, with a wise leader. They need to be reassured about what is natural and normal, eg. In regard to menstruation and seminal emissions.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. Independence and protection</h5>
                        <p>Parents should try to understand the moods of adolescents - at one time wanting to be treated as adult and at another time wanting to still be a baby, wanting protection. Parents often find it difficult to loosen the hold on their sons, and more so perhaps, on their daughters, but it is necessary to let them have independence as they become ready for this.</p>
                        <p>Adolescents need the security of a home base and understanding parents, but they also want adventure and freedom.</p>
                        
                        <h5>4. Parents should never fail to love, trust and appreciate their teen age children.</h5>
                        <p>At this stage intelligence reaches maximum, and the adolescent tends to argue strongly on some point and irritate parents and teachers. Also the adolescent is trying to find truth and a set of values and ethics with may not be those of the parents. Conflicts arise. Parents need to have patience, they should disagree but with gentleness. They should allow the teenager to have his/her own opinion, and at the same time to feel assured of the parent's love and respect.</p>
                        
                        <h5>5. A rich social life,</h5>
                        <p>with opportunity to meet many types of people, will help the teenager his/her own place. He feels he has no status, being neither a child nor an adult. He joints a group or gang of his own sex and age. He wants to be like them in fashions, opinions and activities. The group the adolescent joins may help or hinder the development of character.</p>
                        <p>For healthy mental, social and spiritual development, the adolescent needs to meet, hear, and read about mature personalities whom he can admire and follow.</p>
                        
                        <h5>6. An outlet for energies, and self - expression is needed activities</h5>
                        <p>Activities such as organized games, cams, and adventures, hobbies, and competitions of various types, should me encouraged. Sports and drama, whether taking part or watching help in release of emotions. The teenager may find expression and release through art or music, scouting or debts and discussions. These activities also give the teenager a chance to find out what he can do well , to develop talents, and to have a sense of achievement.</p>
                        
                        <h5>7. Vocation guidance</h5>
                        <p>is needed in schools, for guiding children into careers for which they are suited. When they are given no such guidance adolescents feel confused and fearful of the future. They see many young people, educated and uneducated, without jobs. They need guidance about the subjects they should study. They should find purpose in their studies and a goal to work for.</p>
                        <p>Parents may want their child to carry on the traditional job of the family where as the teenager may have other plans. They should co- operate with the occasional guidance teacher and try to come to agreement with the teenager also, so that he will find satisfaction and enjoyment in work.</p>
                        
                        <p>Problems in the behavior of adolescents include depression truancy ( absence from school ), rebellion, aggressive and destructive ways, lying, and bad habits such as smoking, gambling, drug taking. Causes of behavior problems include the following :</p>

                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>Truancy :</h5>
                        <p>When an adolescent feels he is 'no good' at school and is given no encouragement, he may give up trying. He gets to the stage of hating school ( school phobia ) and so stays away and may get into bad company, leading to delinquency.</p>
                        <p>Some times truancy is because parents have no interest in education of their children, and their encourage truancy, perhaps sending them for work instead.</p>
                        <p>It may be that the adolescent hates one particular subject, or has a strong dislike for one teacher, so finds a way to be absent from that class.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Rebellious behavior:</h5>
                        <p>This is refusing to obey rules and those in authority. The adolescent insists on having his /her own way and does not adjust to situations, not co-operate with others. This results in frequent conflicts at home and at school</p>
                        <p>The reason for this type of behavior may be over - protection by parents, and lack of independence. Too strict discipline at home or at school may be the cause.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Aggression</h5>
                        <p>The adolescent seems often to be the one to state quarrel or attack some one.</p>
                        <p>Aggression in the adolescent may be due to self - consciousness about his/her appearance e.g. a girl may be self - conscious about being too tall. Any feeling of inferiority or of being odd or foolish, may produce aggressive behavior.</p>
                        <p>Another reason is that aggressive parents tend to produce aggressive children. Aggression is often caused by social attitudes or to feelings of neglect, lack of status, and frustrations. Aggression is often against a certain person because of some hurtful word or action.</p>
                        <p>The adolescent needs to be helped to develop self-control and a more tolerant attitude.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Group delinquency</h5>
                        <p>Adolescent boys often with nothing else to do join a street gang. The gang may have a leader who has failed in life and wants status. He is ready to do anything to make his mark, and may lead the others into delinquency.</p>
                        <p>The gang may be angry for some reason against a section of society, or it may be to meet their wants, or just for excitement, that they plot some misdeed. It may be harassing a passer - by, robbing some one, breaking into a building to steal, or setting fire to buildings or buses.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Prevention of behavior problems :</h5>
                        <p>The health workers should work with families and the community to prevent behavior problems, e.g. by a helpful word of advice to parents, and by promoting healthy activities for the youth.</p>
                        <p>If the health worker discovers an adolescent with such behavior problems, she should repot to her super visor, who can investigate and work with the school and the family in trying to help the young person and over come the problem.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Adulthood :</h4>
                        <p>The young adult ( aged 18 to 35 ) often has to take on new and heavy responsibilities connected with work and money, children and home. If in previous life stages, this person had emotional needs satisfied, and learned to adjust to changes, then he/ she will probably be a mentally healthy adult.</p>
                        <p>The mentally healthy adult's behavior shows that he/she is using intelligence and is not ruled by emotions as is a young child. He/she is able to enjoy life and cope in times of crises connected with work, marriage, birth of children, illness etc.</p>
                        <p>The young adult still needs security, not only financially but with good friends and happiness at home. There is need for job satisfaction and recognition. The young father should be able to take the main responsibility for the family. It will be helpful if bride has pre - marital tanning in her role as a wife and mother. It is good if the couple have some similar interests, and that they do things together and with friends. Adults are capable of wide social relationships. They should be encouraged to get involved in social service and removal of injustices.</p>
                        <p>Marriage is a union of two very different persons. There will be differences if opinion, likes and dislikes, habits and customs. One partner should not dominate the other, through the wise wife will submit to her husbands wishes as far as possible. They each need to learn to give and take, adjust with each other. It is a good rule to take together about any problem between them, the same day that it arises, and come to agreement before going to bed. By facing up to disagreements, a man and his wife draw closer together.</p>
                        <p>Conflicts between a couple which are not resolved, or suspicion of unfaithfulness, may cause the couple to stop speaking to each other. The marriage is in danger of breaking down, and the dildrenwill suffer.</p>
                        <p>Above all, to put into practice their religious beliefs will help them to have peace and happiness, and strength to cope with the disappointments and crises that may occur.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Marital problems :</h5>
                        <p>Mother- in- law dominance may be a problem and lead to quarrels and unhappiness. The young parents may need help to get free from control by their parents.</p>
                        <p>The health worker as she visits homes, should do all she can to preserve the family unity. Couples who are unable to solve their relationship problems may be referred to a marriage guidance clinic, or they may get help from priest or some mature person whom their whom they respect.</p>
                        <p>In problems such as infertility, pain or difficulty with sexual intercourse the couple should be referred to a doctor or family planning clinic.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Failure in achievement :</h5>
                        <p>The young man without a job, or who has a job which does not satisfy and suite his capabilities and interests, will be frustrated, insecure and unhappy. Some a young man may aim too high, beyond his ability, and so be disappointed. Another man may feel it is below his dignity to do a job with his hands, but he should realize that there is dignity in working with the hands, and that any job is better than no job.</p>
                        <p>The health workers should try to help by referring to some one who can give guidance or help with suitable employment.</p>
                        <p>The middle - aged adult is faced with situation such as marriage of children, children leaving home. Their may be sickness, chronic ill - health or death of the partner. The man has to face retirement, with all that this means in change of routine, loss of income and of social contacts. Middle aged people may fear the future, the prospect of loneliness, ill- health and other things.</p>
                        <p>The health worker can try to help these adults by suggesting they start some new hobby, and join in social and religious activates. These help the person to feel he/she can still be a worthy person in society and have some thing to live for.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Old age and dying :</h4>
                        <p>The custom in India of keeping grant parents with a family is good. These old people are usually well cared for and live happily.</p>
                        <p>There problems may be because of loss of independence and status. They may becomes critical, blaming son or daughter for not caring for them. They may interfere in discipline of grand dhildren. The health worker may help as follows ;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Advise the family to allow the old person to have financial independence. If they have no pension and are in need of financial help, suggest applying for help from the state.</li>
                            <li>help the old person to adjust with the family, to appreciate their care, and allow them to bring up the children in their own way.</li>
                            <li>Help them to find suitable ways of being occupied during the day, e.g. to join an old peoples club, a library, and get involved in religious activities.</li>
                            <li>if it is not possible for an old person to live with a family, the health worker may help to get him/her into a home for the aged. Such an institution should be a real home where the old people are given good physical care, and opportunity to be occupied in some worthy way.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>Dying :</h5>
                        <p>Fear of death is natural. We love life and have an instinct for self - preservation, to escape death and go on living. How ever, we need to face the fact that death comes, to us all sooner or later, and we do well to be prepared, and to help others, especially the aged to be prepared.</p>
                        <p>Death may be sudden, or a person may lie dying for some hours or days. If you as a health worker are with a dying person and sorrowing relatives, what should you do?</p>
                        <p>There are the physical aspects - you need to know the progressive signs such as weak pulse, change in breathing and color, the skin cold and damp. The patient may lie still or be restless and struggling. A dying person may still be able to hear, so be careful of your conversation.</p>
                        <p>Besides giving physical comfort, you should be prepared to give spiritual comfort also, or invites some one who can do this. The fears of the patient, and sorrow of the relatives, may be relived by your tender loving care, and more so if you can bring hope and the love of God into the situation.</p>
                        <p>Death is like the opening of a door to a new life. Christ has promised eternal life for those who believe in him. We read in the bible that nothing. Not even death. Can separate us from the love of god.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Vocal qualities</strong> When we speak our voice as well as our words convey emotions we can use the same words to express different emotions by simply altering the vocal qualities (i.e. ) rate, pitch & loudness of our speech EG; when we are happy our voice will show an iœ in pitch.</li>
                            <li><strong>Body movements</strong> If we observed the gestures of important drives in heavy traffic on a hot summer day, we know that body movements may convey emotions. Even movements of whole body may do so. The body movements of dancers, players & others are especially appealing because their movements convey emotions.</li>

A small child is unable to control emotions. We see Facial Expressions of anger in temper tantrums & Expressions of joy in jumping up & down & squealing children should be shown love appreciation to grow emotional maturity trained by good parents and teachers. A child gradually leans to keep emotions under control. A mature person is aware of his other own emotions, but doesn't give into them. It isn't necessary to away act on them.

                        <p><strong>Negative emotions</strong> Negative emotions are those that give us an unpleasant feeling positive emotions are give pleasant feeling to the individual.</p>
                        <p><strong>(a) Anger</strong> Its Negative emotions most often caused by some kind of frustrations. It is a reaction of offensive type. It is a destructive force. If it is not controlled it may impulse a person even to communicate murder or there is a quarrel, which may result in violence.</p>
                        <p>For peace & harmony in relation with others we need to use self-control & find acceptable ways of solving inter personal problems.</p>
                        <p>The emotion of anger is accepted by society when it is raised & expressed against normal wrongs. If you see a child being cruelly treated it would be natural & socially accepted for you to be raised & to express your anger. Besides the feelings & changes in body already mentioned your face will flush with anger & eyes flash. Unless you can control yourself you may strike in your part would be going too far & you may find you self in trouble.</p>

                        <p>On the other hand if we are to be able to give first to injured people its necessary to control our own fear</p>
                        <p>A healthy fear is fear of God & of people of authority a feeling of self worth and knowing your basic rights as an individual should balance this. The emotion of fear is regard to authority should be well under control in a mature person. In many of life's situations we need to use intelligence & good judgment in place of fear.</p>
                        <p><strong>(c) Sorrow</strong> It is an unpleasant emotion. This feeling shows in face, the eyes & mouth turn down at corners. A tremor or a break comes in voice & very often tears will flow when the reason for sorrows is void such as a hearing of the death of someone you know its is good to let tears flow for a while release the emotion. To control the tears in this case may lead to personality problems.</p>
                        <p>The emotion of sorrow may rise for yourself EG when scolded or punished for some error you should learn to control yourself accept your fault , ask excuse, & resolve to do better never give away to self pity.</p>
                        <p><strong>(d)Anxiety</strong> In this a rapid pulse & breathing, flushing, sweating, dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, raised B.P etc. Patients admitted to hospitals are anxious.

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Positive Emotions</h4>
                        <p>These are emotions that give us a pleasant feeling. These emotions are expressed freely in a happy young child. We adults also, whatever our age, need occasionally to act and feel as we did in childhood- to be free to laugh, play and have fun, to love and to show tenderness and affection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Joy</strong> The emotion of joy is aroused when you receive good news, such as a pass in the examination. Your face lights up with an expression of pleasure. Your voice reveals excitement, and for a while you may laugh happily, and perhaps hug your classmates. However, if one or more of your classmates have failed, you will need to control your emotion of joy, and express sympathy.</p>
                        <p>As a child delights in simple pleasure such as a plucked flower, we all need to aware of things in nature or created art or in our religion, which can arouse within us joy. There is so much sorrow in the world - let us express joy and share it with others.</p>
                        <p><strong>Love:</strong> It is a feeling of attachment to some person. It is a basic emotion of man.</p>
                        <p>Love is more important than anything else in the world. Infants will not grow and may even die if love is not given to them. Everyone needs to love and be loved.</p>
                        <p>The emotion of love brings with it a feeling of affection. For good mental health of individuals and families, love needs to be kept alive by thoughtful acts of kindness, by understanding and trust. Selfishness, jealousy and suspicion can spoil the love between people.</p>
                        <p>Love of the highest kind is sacrificial, a giving of oneself without expecting reward. We see this in the work of Mother Theresa of calcutta, who is filled with the love of God and expresses it in tender care of destitute and dying people.</p>
                        <p>The best health workers will be those who can offer this kind of loving, caring service to the community.</p>
                        <p><strong>1 Emotion and health:</strong> Emotional status determines human behavior. Anger can cause a person to be rude and sarcastic. Disorders of emotion interfere with human efficiency. Lack of concentration, lack of appetite, increased risk of accidents, lack of sleep, palpitation etc. emotional disorders in children appear in the form of temper tantrums, abdominal pain, spasms, tics and antisocial behavior such as aggressiveness.</p>
                        <p><strong>2 These are a group diseases called as psychological diseases</strong> that is mind acting on body e.g. essential HTN, peptic ulcer, asthma, ulcerative colitis which are attributed to disturbed emotional status.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Frustrations and Conflicts</h3>
                        <p>Frustration is a condition of tension, because of something that stops us from satisfying our needs or desires.</p>
                        <p>Causes of frustration include the following</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Annoying things in daily life, such as electricity failure when we are reading or writing at night.</li>
                            <li>When plans cannot be carried out because of heavy rain, or being let down by someone.</li>
                            <li>When our income is not enough to meet our needs.</li>
                            <li>When family or social customs prevent us from doing something we had set our heart on doing.</li>
                            <li>When physical weakness or handicap hinders a person's desire and ambitions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Frustrations are a necessary part of growing up. They should not be in excess and we should gradually learn to tolerate them, with the help of feelings of security and personal worth.</p>
                        <p>Frustration tolerance means being able to meet frustrating situation without being too upset. Continual frustrations of basic needs may lead to adjustment problems and mentalillness.</p>
                        <p>Conflicts are related to frustration. Types of conflicts are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Conflict with another person of group. The reason may be different ideals, attitudes, loyalties or standards of conduct, or it may be a clash of temperament.</li>
                            <li>Conflict with the environment, as when disaster such as fire affects someone personally.</li>
                            <li>Conflict inside a person. For example you have a question you would like to ask the tutor, but are afraid of being thought foolish and ignorant. Or it may be you hate to do some assignment but you are afraid of being punished if you fail to do it. Or you would like to go to see picture but you know your parents would not approve.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Conflicts may be conscious or unconscious. There are times when we are not aware of the real motives causing the conflict, but we feel some anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Conflicts cause tension, and should be ended as soon as possible, for which the help of a mature person may be needed. If conflicts continue, they are repressed or pushed down into the unconscious part of the mind, when they remain active.</p>
                        <p>Internal conflict is dangerous. It can cause emotional disorder and mental illness.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Defense mechanism and behavior:</h3>
                        <p>Defense mechanism is different ways in which people may adjust to emotional conflicts and frustrations. The person using the defense mechanism may not be aware of them as they usually come from the unconscious part of the mind. We like to think we are in complete control of our behavior, but this is not so.</p>
                        <p>Defense mechanism are affected by experience and feelings of long ago in our childhood, and forgotten.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Purpose of defense mechanism:</h4>
                        <p>When germs attack our bodies, there are several lines of defense to fight the germs and protect us from infection.</p>
                        <p>In a similar way, defense mechanism are deices of the mind for protecting us against frustration or stress situation we feel unable to cope with.</p>
                        <p>The main purpose, then, of defense mechanism is to protect our ego. Other purposes are to relive tension, to overcome feelings of failure, and to maintain inner harmony.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Common defense mechanism:</h4>
                        <p>The stresses and strain caused by frustration and conflicts are uncomfortable, even painful. The following are common defense mechanisms used whether consciously or unconsciously to get relief.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Compensation</strong> When in spite of all efforts, a person fails in something and the ego is threatened, the person may look for some other area in which to succeed. If a health worker student feels frustrated by her tutor but cannot say anything, she may compensate by an out burst among classmates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Negativism</strong> A person, who has been used to having his/her own way, may react to frustration by defiance, doing the opposite of what is expected. By resisting other suggestion the person keeps up his own ego.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sympathism</strong> Instead of facing a problem, we may turn to others for sympathy. A health worker student who is not doing well in studies, instead of seeking the cause and trying harder, may get sympathy by telling of various personal difficulties or by suggesting she is just unlucky.</li>
                            <li><strong>Projection</strong> we all tend to blame others or circumstances instead of admitting our own failure. It is common for people to criticize others and not see those same faults in themselves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identification</strong> If you cannot achieve some goal, you may identify yourself with those who have achieved it. This may help at the time, but if this defense mechanism becomes a habit, you may be continued to feel satisfied with achievement of the group, and make no effort on your own.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sublimation</strong> Great works of art, music, or science are often due to sublimation because of frustrated love. An unmarried woman can sublimate her material urge by finding some job of working with children. If you should feel angry and want to attack someone, but you know this would be wrong, it is good if you can play some vigorous game to work off the tension.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rationalization</strong> is a popular mechanism. we excuse our failings by giving several other reasons, which seem to justify our action. We hide the real and true reasons. We may not realize that we are twisting truth and deceiving ourselves. If we use this mechanism often, we may lose all sense of what is true.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regression</strong> is returning to a childish level of behavior instead of facing up to problems. A student who is not making progress may cry or sulk, or plead that she has a headache, when told to do an assignment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Withdrawal</strong> Failure and criticism cause some people to become timid and withdrawn. They fear failure so much that they refuse to face problems and bear responsibilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repression</strong> This is an unconscious way of forgetting. Emotions, which do not fit in with social values and norms, such as hatred for parents, are dealt with by our ego forcing them down in to the unconscious mind. Many unpleasant experiences of early childhood are repressed. We are not aware of these, but repressed emotions may come to the surface in the form of antisocial behavior.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">ADJUSTMENT:</h3>
                        <p>By means of defense mechanism, we are able to make adjustment to stresses and strains and keep mentally healthy. Many of our adjustments make use of several of these mechanisms at one time. We are usually not aware of how our ego is making adjustment, as these go on in our unconscious minds. We only realize that we feel more comfortable with ourselves as a result.</p>
                        <p>When there is steady development from infancy, adjustments are made in a simple way and the ego does not need to depend much on defense mechanisms.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a maladjusted person uses them a great deal and may develop mental illness in which such defense mechanisms are constantly being used.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Stress, illness and behavior:</h3>
                        <p>Stress includes anything, which produces alarm reactions in our bodies, to give energy for fight or flight. Adrenaline is released and in small does this is helpful. It gives energy for activities, also helps to train us in facing frustration and in solving problem. Stress in too large a dose, or in continuous small doses is harmful and result in physical and mental illness.</p>
                        <p>Stress comes to everyone, but affects people in different ways. Our mental and physical health depends on how we react to the stress. n a busy life we need to take time off for relaxation, and time to be alone, to pray and meditate, so as to be renewed with strength and power to overcome, to react in a positive way to the stresses and strains of life.</p>
                        <p>Illness is very often caused or made worse by stress. Illness upsets a person in every way. Besides changes in the body, illness affects mind and emotions, producing changes in behavior.</p>
                        <p>Behavior in illness varies a great deal, according to the patient's personality and previous experience of illness.</p>
                        
                        <h5>1 The complaining patient</h5>
                        <p>Illness causes a person to feel inadequate and that he has lost his self -esteem. He may react by finding fault, blaming others, resenting hospital restrictions. He may lose his usual emotional control and be very difficult. You will need to have much patience with this type of patient.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2 The dependent, childish patient</h5>
                        <p>Some patients react to illness with dependence like a child, demanding a lot of attention and sympathy. Without getting irritate, the health worker will need to combine patience, tact and firmness in dealing with this type of patient. Avoid creating him/her as a child. By maintaining an attitude of respect for the patient as a person, the patient may be gradually helped to give up the childish behavior and move on to independence as he/she recovers from the illness.</p>
                        
                        <h5>3. The silent patient</h5>
                        <p>Another patient may react to illness by being withdrawn and silent, asking no questions and making no demands. Inside, the patient may be full of fears and worries. There may be a sense of guilt. The health worker needs to show affection, sympathy, kindness and interest, which will help to give confidence to the patient to respond and get release by talking about his feelings.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">RECOVERY</h4>
                        <p>Stress may also prevent a patient from recovering.</p>
                        <p>The health worker should prove a restful environment and try to help the patient to understand and resolved both health and emotional problems, and start life a fresh.</p>

                        <p>Duties of the health worker include working individual, families and various groups in the community, and working with others in the health team. For this work she needs the following skills.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Inter-personal skills</li>

                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Inter personal skills :</h4>
                        <p>When you have started understanding yourself (self- awareness) and when you feel ok, comfortable with your self, accepting your self, then you are ready to develop good relations with others. This is most important for the health worker who needs to work with people, each of them a person with thoughts, feelings and potential to grow.</p>
                        
                        <h5>(1)Appreciation</h5>
                        <p>This is a basic need, a hunger of every person. When someone makes a remark to you of appreciation or praise, such as "You spoke so well at the meeting", how could you feel ! when you stroke a pet cat it will purr with pleasure. In psychology we use the word 'stroking' to mean taking notice of another person. You should practice giving strokes to other people and see the effect on them. Don't flatter and overdo it however. Be sincere when you praise.</p>
                        
                        <h5>(2) Recognition</h5>
                        <p>This is another hunger. Speaking to a person, looking into his/her face, and listening to what is said all help a person to feel important, a person of worth.</p>
                        
                        <h5>(3) Approval</h5>
                        <p>You can 'stroke' a person by your facial or other expression showing your approval. When behavior is approved, a person gains more confidence. He /she is encouraged to develop talents, or is motivated to greater effort. When you disapprove, you need to be aware that what you say or do may bring harm to that persons ego if it is not done with care. Before you criticize, always give a positive stroke</p>
                        
                        <h5>(4) Receiving Negative strokes</h5>
                        <p>To be ignored, ridiculed or criticized, is usually painful. Emotions of anger or shame may arise in you. What should you do?</p>
                        <p>When you receive a negative stroke, be aware of how you feel, but take control of yourself. If you know the person well, you may express your feelings of hurt without emotion and without blaming the other persons. The person then might say ' I'm sorry', and you both grow as persons and in relating to one another. If there is no good response from the other person, you could keep quiet and later find outlet for your feelings by some vigorous exercise, or by praying about it.</p>
                        
                        <h5>(5) Acceptance</h5>
                        <p>Just as we have seen the importance of self acceptance . we need to accept other also as individuals in this world for a purpose. Acceptance means that we do not judge their behavior or appearance . we have no prejudice on account of caste , class, or where they come from. Acceptance means we allow other people to be themselves, and respect each as an individual with right and freedom</p>
                        
                        <h5>(6) Under standing</h5>
                        <p>For good understanding, we need to get to know people . We need to be interested in them and sensitive to their attitudes, values, aspirations and needs . We should observe and listen carefully, then respond in a helpful way.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Teamwork and leadership</h4>
                        <p>A team is a group with a certain task, which requires that members of the group help, support and understand each other. A team can be permanent e.g. the health team, in which the health worker function as a member, or it may be a temporary group set up for a special purpose or project.</p>
                        <p>For good teamwork the members need to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Feel they each belong to team spirit.</li>
                            <li>Grow in understanding of each other, and knowledge of each person's role.</li>
                            <li>Be able to contribute to the achieving of common goals.</li>
                            <li>Participate freely and openly in face - to - face discussion.</li>
                            <li>Co - operate and co - ordinate activities.</li>
                            <li>Accept one another, support one another, and trust one another.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The basic tasks of a team are to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Decide on policy, set goals, and plan.</li>
                            <li>Solve problems.</li>
                            <li>Evaluate progress and goal achievements.</li>
                            <li>Resolve conflicts among themselves. Conflicts of ideas and views can be used for better results if all have the will to work together. The health worker should be able to manage, or lead a team such as the VHGs, Dais, Depot holders and other volunteers in a village or group of villages.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The leader of a team should try to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Make sure the goals are clear to everyone.</li>
                            <li>Make sure that each one knows what others are doing.</li>
                            <li>Find out the talents of members.</li>
                            <li>Promote a good team sprit. Avoid domination by one person. The leader should set an example in listening and working together step by step. Everyone should contribute.</li>
                            <li>Be sensitive to tension, and encourage members to share feelings and to accept one another even if opinions differ.</li>
                            <li>Be sensitive to time, and see that useful work is done.</li>
                            <li>Be prepared to accept mistakes, learn from them, and try again.</li>
                            <li>Be flexible, prepared to make changes, but keeping the goals in mind.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">OBTAINING INFORMATION</h3>
                        <p>The health worker works with the community with the goal of promoting health and wholeness. She needs to be well informed, and aware of various ways of obtaining information. Here are some guides - lines:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take note of instruction from your authorities.</li>
                            <li>Keep up to date with trends and new discoveries.</li>
                            <li>Add to your knowledge and experience by meeting and mixing with people, by attending conferences, seminars and workshops, by listening to radio etc.</li>
                            <li>Get to know your community. Student health workers may discover a great deal about the community by making weekly visits to 8 or 10 families in different locations and getting to know these families. Observe, listen and try to find out the following:</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What groups and social activities are there? Who are leaders? Who has power, and why?</li>
                            <li>Altitudes of people towards other groups. How far do different groups understand each other / Are they prepared to work together for the benefit of the whole community?</li>
                            <li>Resources of the community; land (whose is it?) and food sources, animals and poultry, water supply, buildings, schools, roads, and transport, people with skills, health care resources, work opportunities, and earnings in relation to cost of living. What rate of interest to poor people have to give for loans?</li>
                            <li>Family nutrition and health, beliefs, customs and habits related to health and family welfare.</li>
                            <li>What do people feel are their priority needs?</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MOTIVATING THE COMMUNITY FOR CHANGE</h3>
                        <p>The health worker will find that differences of caste, education customs, values and attitudes cause conflicts so that people will not work together easily. The main causes of conflict may be identified as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h5>1) Power, control and Attitudes of the Rich</h5>
                        <p>The rich own the land, decide how much (or how little) wages will be paid, control the water supply (often denying use of wells by Harijans). They may not realize how the poor are suffering, why they get more and more into debt and into a worse state of poverty and poor health.</p>
                        <p>The motives of the rich are usually related to looking after their own interests, and so it is best to keep things as they are and not to bring changes.</p>
                        <p>A few of the rich do care about the poor. They are fair, generous and sympathetic. The health worker should stimulate such persons to find out causes of poverty and poor health, and raise questions to motivate others too in this interest and concern.</p>
                        <p>Rich people too, should be made aware that for better health and well being of the whole community, the poor need to be well represented in committees and encouragement to participatefully.</p>
                        <p>They should realize the right to dignity and self-respect of poor people, and that they need encouragement to find the way to freedom and self-reliance. Then their children will become well-adjusted and useful members of the society.</p>
                        
                        <h5>2) The Condition and Attitudes of the Poor</h5>
                        <p>Poor people are used to hunger, sickness, and deaths in their families. They struggle to survive, and become more and more dependent on aid such as free food supplies. The women work hard in the fields for much less than men receive. For months there may be no work. Loans are taken at a high rate of interest, which they can never repay, so they lose their property.</p>
                        <p>The poor usually have a low self-image. Their attitude may be one of apathy or despair. They have no hope that things will improve for them. Some may become angry and join a political party, or become delinquent.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Role of the Health Worker</h4>
                        <p>The health worker must try by all means, to motivate individuals (especially community leaders), families and groups, to change unhelpful attitudes and habits, also to work together for the health and well -being of all. The basic need is to work towards social equality, and unity.</p>
                        <p>The health workers main goal should be to enable people to self- reliant and have control over their health and their lives.</p>
                        <p>Motivation may be by means of -</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Good communications, using all different methods</li>
                            <li>Example, e.g. a community near by where changes are seen.</li>
                            <li>Rewards and incentives. These give pleasure and encouragement.</li>
                            <li>Aspiration and goal achievement.</li>
                            <li>Satisfactory results.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The community should never feel entirely satisfied however, but go on changing and moving on to achieve new goals.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">GROUP DYNAMICS</h3>
                        <p>When people come together for a meeting or group discussion, it can be very helpful or not, depending on how the group functions. It is helpful when it functions as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The group is not too large and everyone sits in a circle including the leader.</li>
                            <li>Everyone is welcomed and introduced.</li>
                            <li>The group elects a leader or chairman. Also if required a recorder.</li>
                            <li>The leader introduces the subject with few words and starts the discussion, then lets others talk.</li>
                            <li>Every one is encouraged to ask questions, share thoughts and experiences, and make suggestions.</li>
                            <li>No one dominates the discussion. The leader controls those who talk too much and encourages the silent ones to contribute.</li>
                            <li>The leader tries to keep a calm and friendly atmosphere, using interpersonal skills and humor if this will help (but never laugh at people, only with them).</li>
                            <li>If visual aids are used this often helps to make the issues clear, e.g. ideas can be noted down on a blackboard.</li>
                            <li>When there has been enough discussion, the leader asks the group to drop conclusion or to make a discussion on the action to me taken- what action by whom, where, and how.</li>
                            <li>After the meeting, what has been decided on is carried out and reported on at the next meeting of the group.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The health worker should try to sensitive to the needs of each member of the group. If there are some who seen afraid to speak, it ma be better to divide up into smaller groups, then come together again to share in the big group.</p>
                        <p>Whatever activities have been decided upon, the health worker should try to see that facilities are provided for carrying them out, and that group members take up their responsibilities.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PROMOTING LEADERSHIP:</h3>
                        <p>There are three kinds of leadership:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>When the leader is boss?</strong> The leader plans, decides, direct and controls the program of action. The group submits and carries out order but with not much interest. The work output is very low. The program is only supporting the leaders ego.</li>
                            <li><strong>When the leader is guide?</strong> The leader asks the group question, and may accept some of their suggestion. The group has some influence and makes minor decisions, but is up to the level of the leader's ability.</li>
                            <li><strong>When the leader is stimulator?</strong> The leader educates the group for active participation and control. The role of leader rotates as members of the group show ability. The group controls and evaluates the program, and becomes responsible. The work output is well above what the leader expected.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If the health worker has a superior attitude and is always telling people what to do, no leadership will be developed. The health worker should not always lead. She should be prepared to follow the lead of others. The aim of good leader is to promote leadership qualities so that the program will be carried on when she is not there, and the community becomes selfreliant.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Helping in Times of Stress</h3>
                        <p>The health worker may frequently be required to help an individual or a family in coping with stress. This too is a health care activity for which the health worker student needs to acquire qualities and skills, which she can use herself and develop in other in the community. It can be called psychological support, emotional support, a helping relationship, or counseling.</p>
                        <p>The health worker needs to realize that 'being a helper in times of stress' is not the same as psychotherapy. Psychotherapy is long- term treatment of those with severe emotional problems or mental illness, by a psychotherapist. Counseling is also not giving guidance, but is helping normal people to adjust better to stress, in a shorter times than psychotherapy.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">IDENTIFYING STRESS SITUATIONS</h4>
                        <p>The health worker should visit as early as possible any family in her area in which there is a stress or crisis situation. Do not wait to be called, as these families are at high risk for mental health.</p>
                        <p>Examples of stress situation are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Where a person is dying or has died, especially if the person is father or mother of young children, or a previous baby.</li>
                            <li>Suicide or attempted suicide.</li>
                            <li>Where a newborn baby has some abnormality or a girl when a boy was wanted.</li>
                            <li>Wife or husband had deserted the family, or a girl has eloped (run away with her lover).</li>
                            <li>A person has had an accident or operation involving loss of a limb, breast or genital organs.</li>
                            <li>A person has been diagnosed as having disease such as leprosy, or cancer.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">BASIC APPROACHES</h4>
                        <p>Fr. Joe currie in the barefoot counselor describes two different approaches of the helper.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Dispensary (directive) Approach</strong> This kind of helper feels he knows what the problem is and know how to deal with it. He dispenses what he thinks is the cure, but those with emotional hurts are not cured in the way that those with physical ailments may be .he will find that it is not so easy, and that different skills are needed in order to help the person with mental stress.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non-directive Approach</strong> This kind of helper knows that he should be a listener. The one in need of help is relieved that someone is willing to listen while he tells of his difficulties. This helper is trying to really understand the person and to know how he feels. He accepts him and cares about him. He does not counsel nor offer a solution. He may come to accept himself and gain confidence to go on and find his way through hisdiffiallty.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>It has been found that counseling helps some people, and some are harmed. Success seems to depend on the qualities and behavior of consoler (helper).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">CONDITIONS FOR A HELPING REALTIONSHIP</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Person to person deep relationship,</strong> and sharing of feelings is necessary between helper and helpee (the one needing help). They are two people at work. They should meet each other at eye level, linked by the fact that both are persons. Status in life does not matter at this time. It is essential that what be said is kept confidential.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of integration of the helpee</strong> The helpee is unhappy, defensive, anxious and confused. He is not able to accept himself, not accepting others, and not accepting his present situation. He feels uncomfortable, not ok. He finds it difficult to think of other things and to make decisions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Better integrations of the helper</strong> The helper feels OK, and in better. Control of his feelings than the helpee. He is aware of his feelings, accepts them, and can reveal them to other if and when it is appropriate.</li>
                            <li><strong>Listening and Responding</strong> These are the two most basic skills required by the helper. It is not easy to listen with full attention and awareness. Not only that, but the helper should take note of how it is said -what feelings go with what is said? Watch for non -verbal message - facial expression and gestures, and tone of voice. Responding should relate to the full message given by the helpee, both the words and the mood or emotions. The helpers listen and respond to reach understanding. Further the helper has empathy. He is willing to set aside his own self temporarily to enter into the experience of the helpee . This does not mean that the helper has to feel the same way as the helpee, but he should understand how the helpee is feeling . An important question to keep to the present is How do feel now?</li>
                            <li><strong>Acceptance</strong> The helper has deep respect for the helpee as a person of value, without regard to his behavior, thoughts and feelings. Acceptance does not mean agreement. The helper does not ask the helpee to be like him, but to be his own true self. With this kind of acceptance, personal growth of the helpee can be expected.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communicating</strong> The helper communicates to the helpee his warmth and concern, by means of his attitude, concentration and verbal responses. The message he conveys is I am with you -may be I can help you.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">THE HELPING PROCESS</h4>
                        <p>The helpee needs to be able to change in two directions.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>To wards Greater Confidence</strong> He should move from negative to positive feelings. He needs to re-discover himself as a person of worth and of abilities, even with his limitations. He needs to regain self-acceptance, tolerance o others, and hope that something can be done.</li>
                            <li><strong>Towards seeing a way forward,</strong> from a position of conflict and confusion to insight and decision.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The first direction is concerned with his feelings, and the second with his understanding. The directions the helpee takes during the interview will depend much on the helper's sensitivity to his needs.</p>
                        <p>The helpee may feel as though he is in a dark tunnel with no way out. His negative feelings, of being 'not ok' are a block to his understanding.</p>
                        <p>The helper should try to communicate to the helpee that he accepts him, to go along with him to find that way.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Stages of the Helping Process</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Rapport -</strong> forming a close relationship by means of recognition, acceptance and warmth on the part of the helper. The helper should put aside his own problems and needs for this time, and concentrate on the other's needs in a relaxed way.</li>
                            <li><strong>Un folding of the Problem</strong> The helpee, knowing he has the full attention of the helper, feels secure ding, the helper concentrates on the person, as being more important than the problem. As the helper tries to understand his feelings, the helpee is encouraged to make efforts to understand him and to get to the root of his problem.</li>
                            <li><strong>Release of Negative Feelings</strong> At first the helpee was full of negative feeling such as inadequacy, anxiety, anger or resentment. The helper respects all of the feelings of the helpee and helps him to express them. The helper accepts the helpee as he is with all his negative feelings. As he beings to accept him, the helpee loses most if not all of those feelings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Encouragement of Positive Feelings</strong> The helpee begins to see a more positive self, reflected in the helper's respect for him. Having regained his self - esteem, he feels more comfortable with himself and with the helper.</li>
                            <li><strong>Growing Confidence to Explore New Ways</strong> The helpee, by now feeling in a closer relationship with the helper develops hope that may be there is a way forward. They now work together on a search for root causes and new directians.</li>
                            <li><strong>Confrontation and Sorting out</strong> At this stage, when the helpee has full confidence in his genuine concern, the helper may point out something he seems to be hiding or avoiding. He asks the helpee to explore this, and together they sort it out.</li>
                            <li><strong>Insight and Decision</strong> Gradually new insight and possibilities emerge as the helper and helpee work together. The helpee may by now have a clear idea of what action he can take, and confidence to carry out the plan. He knows too, that he can come again to the helper for evaluation and if necessary to renew their search for a better way.</li>

                        <p>Envtal stimuli like sight, smell, touch reach the cerebral cortex Through home impulses. The information received in assembled And evaluated . by a set of another impulses the cerebral Cortex orders the behavior of the individual. this is known as conscious Behavior. It is the behavior determined by the standards or expectations Of the society.</p>

                        <p>Goals are the same as aims in life. People who do not have an aim or goal in life do not feel inclined or motivated to do anything. Some people are very ambition provide a strong motive for action. There is a difference between an incentive and motives.</p>
                        <p>Incentive exists out side the individual e.g. food is an incentive for a hungry man. Prize is an incentive for a scholar. Incentives are among the factors that stimulate motivation and encourage specific behaviors.

Extensic incentives are rewards that do not relate directly to the goal towards which the desired behavior is aimed, for e.g. financial compensation of individuals undergoing stylization operations for family planning. Material incentives are tangible goods or services, psychological incentives include the satisfaction, self-esteem, or enhanced capabilities gained through a proposed course of action.</p>

A health worker student who has this kind of aspiration will be highly motivated to learn, to develop her talents and the skills shewill need. In additions in fulfilling the aim of service, she will find an inner peace and satisfaction which is the best reward for such service</p>

                        <p>Attitudes are not learnt from text books, they are acquired by social interaction, e.g. attitude towards person, things, situations allissues (e.g. government policies, program all administrative measures). It has been truly said that attitudes are caught, and not taught. Once formed attitudes are difficult to change.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Habits:</h3>

                            <li>(c) They can be performed only under similar circumstances. Habits once formed persist and influence human behavior.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Habit formation :</h4>

                            <li>Good habits kill bad habits the best way to brake bad habits in to cultivate good habits</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Habits build up human personality. Man should not become a slave to his habits, he should remain a master. It is the job of the psychological to find out how good habits can be developed and bad one eliminated.</p>

The mental faculty is related to heredity, nutrition and I Q. children with low IQ are poor learners, they may not learn at all</li>
                            <li><strong>Age :-</strong> The curve of learning reaches its peak between 22to25years of age. After the age of 30, there is short delaine. It has been appropriately said one can not teach to an old person with new learning abilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning situations: -</strong> Physical facilities for learning or institutions, teachers, text books, audio visual aids promote learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Motivation: -</strong> In order to learn effectively, there must be adequate motivation. Some of the powerful motives are encouragement, praise, reward and success. These are stimulate learning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical health: -</strong> A physically handicapped person e.g. deaf, dumb, chronically sick can not learn properly.</li>

                        <p>there are three types of learning's</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cognitive learning (knowledge)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Psychological have experimented a good deal with anials and man to find out how learning takes place. They have a proposes a number of theories</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Learning by conditioned reflex: -</strong> It is well known that when dogs see food the being to salivate this an in born reflex Pavlov, the ussian physiologist discovered that is a bell was rung when the dgs were fed, eventually sanitation could be induced by the ring of the bell above. This is called conditioned reflex. The psychologist proposed that learning takes place partly by the mechanisms.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">2. Trial and error :</h4>
                        <p>The ideal approaches, becomes obvious. This method of learning is very slow, laboriones and premature.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">3. Learning by observation and imitation :</h4>
                        <p>we learn a good deal by observation and imitation. A child copies or imitates gestenes, facial expression and moments such as walking . he learns language by observation and imitation. Observation is an important element in medical exam. Observation promotes attention dissemination and recognition. It was by observation , Hippoerates father of medicine separated medicine from magic. Part of the doctor's and nurses education has always been to observe the points condition, you to make decision based on these observation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">4. Learning by doing :</h4>
                        <p>In this type of learning there is co - ordination of muscular responses with sensory impulses. Nursing skills leg, bed making, applying bandages, giving both are leant by doing, learning to type write or learning a game are a musical instrument are all examples of learning by doing.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">5. Learning by remembering:</h4>
