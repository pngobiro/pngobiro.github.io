                        <p>After 6 months output of breast milk decreases while the nutritional requirements increases to the child.</p>
                        <p>The best indicator of infant nutriton is its body weigth weaning means not sudden with-drawal of child from the breast. It is a gradual process starting around the age of 4 months.</p>

                        <p>Fruit juice, barley water, tea, egg flip, boiled egg, pouched egg, albumin water, whey.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Fruit juice:-</strong> It is prepared from fresh fruit. Remove the juice from citrus fruit by means of squeezeer, strain, dilute, with water and add sugar or glucose to taste. Fruits which stew well, eg: apples and tomatoes may be stewed with a little water until pulpy, then strained through muslin. Add water and sugar or glucose to taste.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Barley Water:-</strong> 1 table spoon of barley flour. 2 table spoon of cold water. 500 ml of boiling water - salt. Mix the flour to a smooth paste with cold water and gradually add the boilding water, stirring all the time, boil about 30 mts add salt and 1 table spoon of lime juice, and strain before use.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Tea:-</strong> Boil clean water, pour a little amount of water into the tea pot to warm it, and pour this way. Put some tea leaves into tea pot (about 1 tea spoon) ful and pour on boiling water. Cover the teapot and leave it to stand for about 2 mts before seerving. Add a little milk and sugar or lime juice.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Egg flip :-</strong> Break an egg thoroughly (yolks not used, in albumin water may be used) and add 250 ml of milk. Stir well and strain before serving. This may be flavoured with sugar, cinnamon or lemon juice. If desired, it may be added to coffee, tea or cocoa.</p>
                        <p><strong>5. Boiled Egg:-</strong> A lightly boiled egg, cooked but still soft, is easily degiested and suitable for the sick and for infants. The egg in its shall is placed into a pan of boiling water and kept boiling for 3 to 4 mts .</p>
                        <p><strong>6. Pouched Egg: -</strong> This is suitable for those who are on light diet. Break the shell, taking care not to break the egg yolk and pour the egg into a shallow pan of boiling water. Cook gently until the white part is opaque. Take it out with a fish slice or flat spoon. It is usually served on a slice of toast with or with out butter, and a little salt.</p>
                        <p><strong>7. Albumin water:-</strong> 1. Press the whites of two eggs through gauze into a glass, and without beating add lime juice, water and sugar, . For some persons with out sugar added beef juice or to any beverage to the albumin water. Albumin water: - 2. Take the whites of two fresh egg. Add one cup of water put into a wide neck bottle. Cork it and shake thoroughly. Add a little lime juice and sugar. If preferred orange juice may be substituted for the lime juice.</p>
                        <p><strong>8. Whey:-</strong> To 500 ml . of fresh milk warmed to blood heat ( 37° C) add 1-2 teaspoons of rennet. Set it aside in a warm place for a water of an hour. Then break up the curd thoroughly by stirring with a fork. Let it stand for 15 mts , then strain the whey through muslin and bring it to the boiling point. Curds may be used in place of renner.</p>

                        <p><strong>1. SELECTION:-</strong> The health worker should help family to plan the diet selecting foods for a mixed, well balanced diet:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Select more than one kind of cereal grain. Raw milled rice and white flour should be avoided. Select paraboiled milled rice and whole wheat flour which are much more nutritious.</li>
                            <li>Select different kinds of pulses and nuts.</li>
                            <li>Buy grains and pulses in fairly large quantities if possible, if necessary going to some place where they are cheaper.</li>
                            <li>Select foods that are inseason, plentiful and cheap.</li>
                            <li>Select a different kind of vegetables for each day as far as possible. Buy fresh and make sure they are of good quality. Inlude some vegetables or fruit that can be eaten raw.</li>
                            <li>Try to produce foods at home: Vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs etc.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>STORAGE:-</strong> Teaching points are :</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>All foods should be kept in clean conditions safe from rats and other pests.</li>
                            <li>Vegetables and fruits lose their nutrient value if kept too long. Try to buy frequently. Keep them cool, away from sunlight and where there is plenty of fresh air. Use while fresh.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE PURPOSE OF COOKING</h3>
                        <p>cooking is an art. It is linked with dietary habits and cultural pattern of people.</p>
                        <p>Different methods are used in different types of diets.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To soften and break down the cellulose of plant foods and the connecitve tissue and fibres of animal foods, to make them more digestable.</li>
                            <li>To develop new flavours in food, either by the method of cooking or by adding spices other flavouring substances.</li>
                            <li>To destroy the harmful bacteria, worm eggs and parasites. So that the food is safe for human use.</li>
                            <li>It stimulates the duigestive juices.</li>
                            <li>It introduces veriety, i.e, many different types of dishes can be prepared with the same ingradients.</li>
                            <li>Good cooking increases the acceptability of food, where as bad cooking may lead to rejection of foods.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">METHODS OF COOKING:-</h3>
                        <p>During the process of cooking, heat is applied to food in some way or other. The amount of heat and the form of heat depends upon the food to be cooked.</p>
                        <p>Methods which may be used are boiling, simmering , stewing, steaming, frying, grilling, baking and roasting.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Boiling:-</strong> Cooking in water at 100° C (212° F) is called boiling. For this the water must be bubbling freely, but steadily, all over the surface. Rice, dhal, pulses, roots, tubers and other vegetabes arre cooked in this way. Boiling in excess of water may result in loss of Vitamins and minerals. So minimum wate should be used.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Simmering:-</strong> It is a modification of boiling. Being to cook food in water just under boiling point. The temperature should be about 84° C. Meat and fish are best cooked by simmering because at high temperature, the fibres of meat are hardend.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Steaming :-</strong> It is cooking food in the vapour which rises from boiling water. This may be done by placing the food container in a staemer above a pan of boiling water or pressure cookers. Beacause of increased pressure of steam, the termperature attained is higher than 100° C. This process is best to save nutrients, food and time.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Stewing :</strong> This is method differs from boiling, in that (a) comparitively smaller amounts of liquid is used. (b) prolonged low degrees of heat is applied, usually about 200° F i.e., simmer food slowly with only a little liquid in a covered pan on top of the stove. The addition of onions, tomatoes or small cutted vegetables and some condiments and herbs can make a meat stew appetising. In this method the nutrients are not lost. Stewing is used for cooking meat.</p>
                        <p><strong>5.Frying :</strong> It is cooking food in very hot fat or oil. This is one of the quickest methods of cooking and should be done in an open pan. These are 2 types (1) Shallow frying (2) Deep frying</p>
                        <p><strong>(1) Shallow Frying:</strong> Shallow frying is suitable for cooking foods like eggs, sausages, dosai and pre-cooked foods.</p>
                        <p><strong>(2) Deep frying ;</strong> Food is completely immersed in large quantity of hotoil. Eg. : Puri, pakoda, Vadai, cutlets etc. In deep frying oil should be sufficiently hot, otherwise food will absorb lot of oil and oil is free from moisture.</p>
                        <p><strong>6. Roasting:</strong> Food is smeared with a little fat and exposed directly to heat or flame. Chicken or tender mutton may be cooked by this method and also large joints of meat and for root vegetables dry roasting. Eg. Ground nuts. This causes only slight loss of nutrients.</p>
                        <p><strong>7.Baking:</strong> It is cooking food by dry heat. It is done in a hot air oven. Food is enclosed by hot air, so that it gets heat from all sides. The cooking temperature may be vary from 250° F to 500° F. Baking is an expensive and slow method of cooking. In this Biscuits, Cakes, Bread are usually cooked.</p>
                        <p><strong>8.Puffing:</strong> This is applying heat for a few seconds. It causes slight loss of thiamine only. Puffed rice, . Bengal gram and peas are commonly used for snaks.</p>
                        <p><strong>9.Grilling:</strong> It is cooking food by exposing it directly to very great heat either infront of a bright, hot fire or a special grilling plate. It is very quick method of cookig. Only tender foods can be cycilled eg: Meat and fish, kabab, cheese, tomatoes, , brinjal etc. Stoves heated by gas and electricity are usually fitted with plates which can be heated for grilling.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">General Principles of cooking: -</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Vitamin C is mostly lost in any kind of cooking especially by cooking for a long time. So you should not cook for a long time.</li>
                            <li>Adding cooking soda to dhal to hasten or to greens cause heavy loss of vitamin C. Therefore soda should not be used.</li>
                            <li>Greenleafy vegetables should be cooked in covered, quickly in a little boiled and salted water. Other vegetables should be covered.</li>
                            <li>Vegetables should be eat after thorough wash with salt water and clean water. Cut in to large pieces to prevent loss of vitamins.</li>
                            <li>Add tamarind or other acids only at the end of cooking or vegetables become hard.</li>
                            <li>Should not open the coveings while cooking food. Too much of opening may cause loss of vitamins.</li>
                            <li>Should not wash the rice somany times before cooking, this may cause loss of vitamin B which is theouer layer of rice.</li>
                            <li>Should not pour too much water and remove conjee, it may cause loss of nutrients.</li>
                            <li>Use fresh vegetables for cooking to save nutrients.</li>
                            <li>Using too much of oil also dangerous to health. Oil should be heated well before using.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preservation of foods:</h3>
                        <p>While fresh foods usually have a better taste, appearance and colour, it is useful to be able preserve foods and keep them longer. By preservation methods, growth of bactaria is showed down. (-Freezing is the best way to pressure foods at home but a refrigerator is costly)</p>
                        <p><strong>House hold methods: -</strong> It is the best way but it is costly to preserve foods at a low temperature if possible.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Cold storage: -</strong> The home regrigerator has now made to store and preserve a variety of foods. Fruits and vegetables should be kept just above the freezing point i.e, 0° C or 31-33° F, meat and butter are kept at much lower temperature. There is no growth of food poisoning organs at this low temperature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Drying or Dehydratation: -</strong> Drying removes water and with out moiture micro-organisms can not grow. Vitamin C is destroyed but other nutrients are preserved. Milk, fruits, vegetables fish and meast may preserved by drying. Preserved fruits and vegetables can be used when out of season to supply nutrients such as iron and carotene. A simple dryer has been invented which could provided the basis for a cottage industry for preserved food.</li>
                            <li><strong>Smoking:-</strong> Meat may be preserve with smoke. Smoke contains phenols which help in preservation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Salting and pickling :-</strong> Salt is a preservative. By adding certain condiments mangoes, vegetables meat and fish may be preserved.</li>
                            <li><strong>Making Jam:-</strong> By boiling fruits and adding equalant of sugar, jam is made which the housewife can keep for some time.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Commercial Methods:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Canning:-</strong> Various foods (Eg. fruit juices, milk, baby foods, soups, fish) are preserved by canning. The food is first sterilized at high temeperature i.e., 275-3508 for a short time i.e., a matter of a few seconds, then cooled and filled in presterilized containers in a sterile atmosphere. There is some loss of meat labile vitamins drying the process of canning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Freezing :-</strong> A number of foods ( fruits, vegetables, meat, fish) are preserved by the freezing techniques. At 0° F vegetables can be preserved for 8-10 months and meat for about 3 months.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemicals:-</strong> Certain chemicals (eg: benzoic acid, sodium benzoate) may be used for preservation but their use is strictly limited by governament regulations and prohibit the use of chemicals for preserving food.</li>
                            <li><strong>Irradiation :-</strong> Micro Organisms. are destroyed by gamma rays. Wheat, potatoes and onions may be preserved by irradiation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Milk preperations: -</h3>
                        <p>Milk is high in nutrients, but quickly spoils. It keeps longer in the following preperations which can be made at home:</p>
                        <p><strong>Curds :</strong> Add about 1/4 teasponful of 'starter' for each cup of barely warm milk, and let it stand at room termperature for twelve hours or more undisturbed. Lime juice can be used for starter if old curds from the pay before is not available.</p>
                        <p><strong>cottage cheese:</strong> Set the curds. After it has well set, drain off the whey by straining through a clean cotton cloth. When dry, remove the cheese from the cloth, add salt, and cream also if possible.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ghee :</strong> Set of curds. After it has set, beat it up until butter forms. Then mix in cold drinking water and seperate off the butter. Drop the ball of butter into a pan, and boil gently till all the white disappears and a good smell comes from the boiling butter. Then store in a covered pot.</p>
                        <p><strong>Khoya</strong> which can be used to make milk-sweets, is made by boiling milk on a slow fire for some hours.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">OTHER METHODS OF ENRICHING THE FAMILY DIET:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Sprouting gram,</strong> increases the vitamin B and C content of the gram. Green gram is best. Soak it in water for 24 hours, then spread it out on a damp cloth and keep the cloth damp for one or two days, until there is a half inch sprout. It may be eaten raw or after cooking for a shorter.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fermenting Cereals and dhals</strong> increses the Vitamin B content. This is done in making the popular S. Indian idli and dosa.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cereal-millet mixture :</strong> Using a millet such as ragi or bajra or jowar together will the staple cereal, adds extra nutrients to the dosa.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cereal-Pulse mixture:</strong> The protein value of a meal is incresed by adding dhal or groundnuts to rice, roti, or chappati.</p>
                        <p><strong>Milk Porridge :</strong> If instead of using water, milk is used to make the poridge out of any cereal flour, an imfant gets more protein and calories in his diet.</p>
                        <p><strong>Powdered protein foods</strong> can be prepared at home or in a mill. Foods rich in plant proteins such as groundnuts, grams and dhals, beens, are pounded or ground into prowder. Dried fish can also be powdered. The protein rich powders can be kept n tins. They need to be cooked and should therefore be added to the cereeal flour before cooking. This makes a very nutritious meal for achild.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pounded Dark Green Leaves:</strong> The leaves may be pounded either fresh or dreid. Dried leaves make a green powder which can also be used to enrich a child's porridge. It can also be added to the dough for making roti or chappati, to enrich the family diet. It is rich in protein and iron.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">EFFECTS OF COOKING</h3>
                        <p><strong>(1) Digestability :</strong> The first and most important purposes of cooking food is to increase digestability. The starch granules absorb water, swell up and burst; the connective tissue of meat and fish is softend which helps in digestion.</p>
                        <p><strong>(2) Distruction of microorganisms and parasites:</strong> Cooking renders the food safe for human consumption by distroying microorganism like the typhoid bacilli and also the eggs and ova of intestinal parasites. Special mention must be made of the cysticerci of tapeworms which are destroyed.</p>
                        <p><strong>(3) Vitamins:</strong> The vitamins that are effected by cooking are vitamin B and vitamin C . The other vitamins are not destroyed.</p>
                        <p><strong>(4) Protiens:</strong> Protiens are coagulated by heat. This helps in digestion.</p>
                        <p><strong>(5) Colour and texture changes:</strong> Foods undergo colour and texture changes during cooking. The palatability of food is increased.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Effects of cooking on food constituents:</h3>
                        <p><strong>(1)Carbohydrates:</strong> As a result of heating in water, the starch granules absorb water, swell up and eventually burst. This is known as " gelatinization" of starch. Maximum gelatinization occurs at boiling point temperature. There is also a large increase in volume as for example, rice when it is cooked increases greatly in bulk.</p>
                        <p><strong>(2) Protiens:</strong> Protiens coagulate at 60° C, boiling hardens albumin and globulin. This can best seen in the case of egg, if the egg is boiled for a long time, the albumin becomes very tough.</p>
                        <p><strong>(3) Fats:</strong> These are not effected much by heat.</p>
                        <p><strong>(4) Vitamins;</strong> There is some unavoidable loss of vitamins during cooking. The loss is considerable in respect of thiamine and vitamin C . The use of baking soda in cooking causes further distruction of vitamins.</p>
                        <p><strong>(5) Minerals:</strong> These are not effected by cooking.</p>

                        <p><strong>(1) Cereals:</strong> Rice is washed before cooking. Excessive washing removes the water soluble vitamins and minerals. The practice ofcooking rice in large quanitities of water and draining away the excess of water at the end of cooking leads to further loss of B group vitamins and minerals.Rice, Therefore must be cooked with just enough water so that all the water is absorbed at the end of cooking. This is usually 2 or 21/2 times the volume of rice. All cereals (Eg. wheat flour ) absorb water and during cooking starch granules swell up and burst. This renders the digestion of starch rapid and complete.</p>
                        <p><strong>(2)Pulses:</strong> Pulses are rich in protiens (20% to 25%) . They alsocontain small quantities of starch. It is very important to boil pulses very thoroughly, this destroyes antitrypsin substance present in them.</p>
                        <p><strong>(3) Greenleafy vegetables:</strong> Greenleafy vegetables are prized for vitamins and minerals. The vitamin A which occurs in the form of carotene is not affected by cooking, but other vitamins thiamine and vitamin C are partially destroyed by cooking. If the cooking water is drained away, there will be loss of not only vitamins but also minerals. It is therefore recommended that greenleafy vegetables should be cooked in a small amount of water and for the proper lenght of time. Baking soda should not be used to hasten cooking.</p>
                        <p><strong>(4)Other vegetables:</strong> Other vegetables like potatoes should be cooked with their ourte intact this retains all the vitamins and minerals contained in them. As a rule, vegetables should be cooked in a small amount of water to prevent loss of vitamins and minerals. They can also be cooked by steaming.</p>
                        <p><strong>(5) Fruits:</strong> Most fruits are eaten fresh and raw. This makes the vitamins present in the fruits easily available. Fruits can also be cooked by stewing, this will result in loss of some vitamins, particularly vitamin C.</p>
                        <p><strong>(6) Meat:</strong> Meat is cooked in a number of ways i.e., boiling, roasting, stewing, frying. The following changes takes place in meat during cooking:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(a) Coagulation of protien at 60° C.</li>
                            <li>(b) There is reduction in water content.</li>
                            <li>(c) Collagen which is a protien of the connective tissue is changed in togelatin.</li>
                            <li>(d) Elastin, whicih is alsocomponent of connective tissue is not affected.</li>
                            <li>(e) The fat of meat melts.</li>
                            <li>(f) There is loss of mineral salts in cooking water but this water can be used as a soup or gravy.</li>
                            <li>(g) The loss of B group vitamins especially thiamine.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>(7) Fish:</strong> Fish contains so little connective tissue, so the cooking time is very short. The protiens coagulate at 60° C in fish.</p>
                        <p><strong>(8)Milk:</strong> When the milk is heated, scum consisting of fat, forms on the surface. This makes it difficult for steam to escape, hence milk boils over easily. Some of the lactalbumin sticks to the sides and bottom. Prolonged boiling may altered the taste of milk. The cooked flavour is due to burning or caramelization of milk sugar. There is distruction of thiamine and vitamin C during boiling. Milk, which is already a poor source of vitamin C becomes poorest at the end of the boiling. Boiling destroys enzymes and the useful lactic acid bacteria present in milk.</p>
                        <p><strong>(9) Egg:</strong> The albumin of the egg begins to coagulate at 60° , and solidifies at 64° to 65° C. At boiling point i.e. 100° C the albumin becomes tough. However there is little change in the nutrients present in the egg.</p>

                        <p>Food is a potential source of infection. It can be cotaminated by backteria and other microenamisms and parasites at any point during its jouney from the producer to the consumer.</p>
                        <p>Food hygiene implies hygiene in the production, handling distribution and sewing of all types of food. Food hygiene is an important aspect of community health.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Boiling of Milk:</h5>
                        <p>Boiling is an ancient method of rendering the milk safe for human consumption. In fact much of the milk produced in India is treated by boiling. The Disadvantages of boiling the milk are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>. Boiling kills all organisms present in the milk, including the useful lactic acid bacteria.</li>
                            <li>It destroys vitamin C and B mostly.</li>
                            <li>Boiling gives a "cooked" taste to the milk, due to the burning of lactose during boiling.</li>
                            <li>Proteins in the milk are coagulated.</li>
                            <li>The engymes are destoyed.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Pasteurization: -</h5>
                        <p>Posteurization has been defined by an expert committee of WHO (1970) as "The heating of milk to such temparatures and for such periods of time as are required to destroy any pathogens that may be present while causing minimal changes in the composition, flavour and nutritive value".</p>
                        <p>Pasteurization differ from boiling in the following re-spects:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pasteurization destroys only the harmful pathogenic bacteria, but not the useful lactic acid bacteria.</li>
                            <li>The vitamins are not destroyed by pasteurization.</li>
                            <li>Pasteurization causes only minimal changes in protein and sugar.</li>
                            <li>Pasteurization is the simplest, safest and the cheapest method of rendering milk safe.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Methods of pasteurization: -</h5>
                        <p>Three methods of pasteurization are widely used:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Holder or vat method.</li>
                            <li>HTST or high temperature and short time method.</li>
                            <li>UHT or ultra high temperature method.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>1. Holder (Vat) method:-</strong> In this method milk is heated and kept at 63-66° C for 30 mts and the quickly cooled to below 5 degree Centigrade.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. HTST method:-</strong> Milk is heated rapidly to a temperature of 72° C and then quickly cooled to below 5° C.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. UHT method:-</strong> The temperature of milk is raised to 125-150° C for a few seconds only and then rapidly cooled.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Phosphatase Test:-</h5>
                        <p>This test is employed to final out if the milk has been properly pasteurizaed or not. The test is based on the principle that the enzyme phosphatase which is present in raw milk is destroyed during pasteurization. If the phosphotase enzyme is present after pasteurization, it indicates that the milk has not been properly pasteurized.</p>

                        <p>Since meat is consumed by a large number of people, it is a responsibility of the community to ensure that the meat sold in the market is fit for human consumption. This responsibility rests on municipalities, corporations and other local bodies. The animals to be slaughtered and are first examined by a qualified veterinary surgeon. This is called "antemortem examination". The diseased and sick animals are excluded, and only healthy animals are passed for slaughter. The main causes of antemortem rejection are emaciation, tuberculosis, pregnancy, diarrhoea, febrile conditions, sheep - pox, foot rot, blucellosis. A second examination is carried out soon after slaughter: This is called "Postmortem inspection" . If any disease condition (Eg: cysticercus boris, liver fluke, hydatidosis, tuberculosis, infections of liver and lungs) is found, the meat is rejected.</p>

                        <p>Fruits and vegetables, especiall those which are eaten raw (i.e., tomatoes, radish, carrot) can be a source of infection. Those which are grown in sewage -irrigated land, are particularly dangerous, if eaten raw and unwashed. They can transmit pathogenic bacteria like the typhiod bacilli and worm infestations. Vegetables which are cooked and eaten are free from this danger. Vegetables which are to be eaten raw are best treated in a weak solution of potassium permanganate, and later washed in running water.</p>

                        <p>Normally the iron in our bodies is used over and over again and we need little extra from our diet, but in the following circumastances iron is lost and anaemia is caused unless more iron is taken into the body,</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bleeding of any kind, including menstruration, piles trouble and dysentry.</li>

                            <li>In pregnancy because the foetus takes iron from the mother.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Growing children need extra iron to make blood, and anaemia is common especially after the age of 3 or 4 months when the iron stored in the liver is used up. There is very little iron in milk and other foods must be given to these young children.</p>

                        <p>Many women are anaemic. The condition is usually connected with pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
                        <p>Besides menstruation, blood may be lost due to abortions or delivery and not made up. The growing foetus and breast feed child also takes nutrients from the mother.</p>
                        <p>To detect anaemia in women:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Notice if she looks pale, gets tired easily and has little energy.</li>
                            <li>Examine the conjunctiva by pulling down the lower eyelid (with clean hands).</li>
                            <li>Examine the mucous membrane of the mouth by pulling down the lover lip.</li>
                            <li>Find out the haemoglobin percentage by using a Talquist colour scale.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Iron Deficiency Anaemia is the most common type. Iron and protein are both necessary for the formation of haemoglobin.</p>
                        <p>Folic Acid is used vitaminc necessary for the formation of red lood cells. Pregnant women need extra Folic acid as well as iron to meet the needs of the foetus for its blood.</p>
                        <p>Vitamin B12 deficiency causes the disease called Pernicious anaemia. This vitamin is also important for making red blood cells. The richest source is liver, because vitamin B12 is stored in the liver.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Pregnant and nursing mothers, also family planning acceptors who have below 12 gm (80%) haemoglobin are eligible for free iron and folic acid tablets.</p>
                        <p>If the haemoglobin is below 10 gm (70%) refer to the health centre or hospital. Those suffering from pernicious anaemia need regular injections of vitamin B12</p>

                            <li>The tablets must be taken daily, and because they may irritate the stomach they should be taken at meal times with food.</li>
                            <li>The tablets will make the faeces black, but there is no harm in this.</li>
                            <li>The tablets are harmful to small children and so must be kept out of their reach.</li>
                            <li>In addition to the tablets, foods rich in iron such as dark green leafy vegetables should be eaten daily.</li>
                            <li>Continue the treatment for three months, when the blood test for haemoglobin is to be repaeated.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CULTURAL FACTORS, FOOD FADS AND HABITS</h3>
                        <p>The foods eatten by a family depend a great deal on their religion, social customs, traditional beliefs, family habits and and food fads. Some traditional food habits are good, but others are not so good and may be harmful. We have to understand the customs and beliefs of families before starting nutrition education. Religion has a great influence on food habits in all parts of India. Hindus do not eat beef, and Muslims have no pork. Fasting at certain times is a practice in some religions. Muslims consider that eating and drinking from a common dish or cup is a sign of brotherhood. Vegetarianism is honoured among Hindus.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Vegetarian and Non-vegetarian Deits:</h4>
                        <p>Some families are pure vegetarians, taking no milk, eggs, meat, fish, poultry etc. Such families have a balanced diet only if they eat a good mixture of foods containing plant proteins at every meal. If enough pulses and nuts, especially soyabean or groundnuts, are added to the staple food, the deit can be a balanced one.</p>
                        <p>Vegetarains who include milk, and more so those who include eggs, can more easily have a balanced diet.</p>
                        <p>Non vegetarians may include as much as they can get of milk, eggs meat, chicken and fish.</p>
                        <p>In developed countries, non vegetarians sometimes eat too much of the animal protein foods, and may become sick with hypertension, heart disease or gout.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Food Habits and Customs:</h4>
                        <p>It is common in India for the men to eat first, next the children, and last the women. This means that even when pregnant or lactating, many women have a very poor diet.</p>
                        <p>During pregnancy, it is thought that the women needs to eat less so that the baby will not grow too big and cause a difficult delivery. In some societies foods such as eggs, fish, meat, milk and leafy vegetables are not allowed during pregnancy. Papaya fruit is thought to produce abortion and should not be eaten by pregnant women.</p>
                        <p>After giving birth, the mother may be given a diet of only bread and coffee or chappati with a watery curry.</p>
                        <p>There are harmful practices also related to the feeding of infants and children. Some families believe that the baby needs nothing more than breast milk for the first year of life. If the mother becomes pregnant breast feeding is stopped suddenly, and the child is expected to eat the same meals as the family.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that a sick child should not be fed if he refuses food, and that a child with diarrhoea should be given liquids as it will make the diarrhoea worse.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Food Fads:-</h4>
                        <p>In selecting foods, people are influenced by personal likes and dislikes, and fear of eating certain foods. Food fads often prevent people from having a balanced diet.</p>
                        <p>In some places there is fear that fish and milk taken together will cause leprosy or white patches (leucoderma). Others think that drinking a lot of water makes a person fat. Many people eat only white polished rice as staple food, and refuse other staple foods.</p>
                        <p>There are different beliefs about ' hot' foods and 'cold' foods. Hot foods may include wheat, meat, eggs., nuts, and oilseeds, and are thought to increase body heat and cause boils and fever. Cold foods include fruits, vegetalbes and milk, and these are thought to reduce body heat and cause cold, sore throat or cough.</p>
                        <p>There is not scientific basis for these beliefsand fears, but they add to the problem of malnutrition. They can only be overcome by nutrition education. For example without condemning the belief in 'hot' and 'cold' foods, we can tell people about another way of grouping foods: body building, energy, and protective foods.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Food Adulteration:</h3>
                        <p>Food adulteration means any practice by which the quality of food sold is changed, or is given a false lable so that the person buying the food is decieved.</p>
                        <p>The prevention of Food Adulteration Act lays down certain minimum stasndards, and any food that does not meet the standard is said to be adulterated, The persons responsible can be brought to trial and punished severely. The aim of this is to try to ensure that people get proper nutritive value in the value in the foods they buy, and to avoid danger to health.</p>
                        <p>The Health Worker should be alert to local food adulteration practices. This subject should be included in health education of the community, with the following points:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Type of foods which may be adulterated and in what way?</li>
                            <li>Simple methods of finding out the adulteration.</li>
                            <li>The action to be taken:

                                    <li>b. A sample may be shown to the Health worker or village head.</li>
                                    <li>c. The village council members should gather evidence from more families, and make a report to the health inspector.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Food adulteration practices vary in different areas. Here are a few examples and hints on detection:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Milk is often watered and may have powder of some kind added to it. When it is boiled, it will appear different from pure milk.</li>
                            <li>Rice or wehat often has stone chips and soil added. This can be found out when washing and cleaning the grain.</li>
                            <li>Chilly poder may have powdered brick added. When it is mised in water the brick powder does not dissolve.</li>
                            <li>Ghee is adulterated by adding pork fat or dalda. On heating, the smell and taste will be different.</li>
                            <li>Coffee may be moxed with the skins of tamarind seeds, because it causes paralysis if taken for a long period.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nutrition Education</h3>
                        <p>Nutrition education is of prime importance in improving the health of families and of the communities.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED:</h4>
                        <p>The Health Worker will need to keep in mind the following factors in relation to nutrition education.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Culture, religion, food habits and fads.</li>
                            <li>Foods available locally, and water supply.</li>
                            <li>Educational level of the groups.</li>
                            <li>Economic status of the families.</li>
                            <li>Land available for food production.</li>
                            <li>Housing and environmental sanitation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">PRINCIPLES OF NUTRITION EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITIES:</h4>
                        <p>Priciples include the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>First observe and ask questions to learn about the culture and food habits of the people, and what food are available?</li>
                            <li>Do not expect people to change food habits easily. New ideas should be introdued gradually, and only one thing taught at a time. Any suggested changes should be acceptable, and integrated into the present cultural practices.</li>
                            <li>Help people to see that good nutrition is important for them, eg. if they want their children to grow strong and do well at school, enough of the right kinds of foods must given to them.</li>
                            <li>Find out the local food words so that there will be good communication.</li>
                            <li>In teaching, use actual foods whenever possible, especially home produced foods. Teach also with nutrition posters, flip charts, puppets role play etc.</li>
                            <li>Always encourage questions and discussions, to clear doubts. Ask those who have tried out something new to tell others about士</li>
                            <li>Link your teaching on nutrition with MCH activities and with other health education.</li>
                            <li>. Do not teach people things it is not possible for them to do, nor about foods they cannot afford to buy or cannot get.</li>
                            <li>Follow up and find out if families are making the needed changes in food practices. Use the information to modify your teaching.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Opportunities for nutrition education are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When visiting families for any reason, the Health Worker may help them in learning better budgeting selection, sorage, preperation and cooking of foods. VHGs and Dias who have been specially trained in nutrition can help the mother in practical ways.</li>
                            <li>In the antenatal clinic and at the preschool clinic, there will be opportunities for both group and individual nutrition education.</li>
                            <li>A nutrition education programme for mothers, including cooking demostrations, can be arranged at the sub centre, Mahila Mandal, or other centre.</li>
                            <li>Nutrition education is an important part of the school health programme. It may be linked with a school midday meals programme.</li>
                            <li>On village visits, the Health worker should visit any Balwadis or Anganwadis, see what diet is being served, and give teaching as needed.</li>
                            <li>If there is nutrition Rehabilitation Centre, this gives opportunity for intensive teaching and supervision of mothers in feeding her child in a better way.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">METHODS AND MEDIA</h4>
                        <p>As we have seen is very difficult to get people to change their dietary habits. Therefore the methods and media used for health education need to be selected and used with great care. As far as possible it is best to get people involved in discussing the issues and in practical activities.</p>
                        <p>In a class of mothers, most of them will have similar problems, perhaps connected with water supply, or fuel, or high price of foods. Some mothers may have some special problems.</p>
                        <p>Individual teaching is very useful to help mothers to solve some special problem, such as worry that her child is not growing well. for pregnant and nursing mothers, and those with children who are often sick, and likely to be malnourished, individual nutrition education is most important.</p>
                        <p>Individual nutrtion education is best done in the home, where you may find various factors in the problem such as poor environmental sanitation, or no place to store food.</p>
                        <p>Cooking demonstrations are very useful for a group of mothers.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Have the class in a place where mothers can sit comfortabily. It may be under a tree in the village.</li>
                            <li>Cooking utensils and fuel should be familiar to them, perhaps borrowed from a nearby home.</li>
                            <li>Select a recipe using foods that are locally available, in season and not costly.</li>
                            <li>Select a preperation the mothers are interested to learn to do, and which will help them to feed a small child or the family in a better way.</li>
                            <li>On a clean surface place the foods to be used and the utensils so that everyone can see clearly.</li>
                            <li>Make sure you wash your hands before starting the preperation, so that the mothers learn to practice clean cooking.</li>
                            <li>Keep foods covered to protect from flies and dust.</li>
                            <li>. When the cooking is over, taste some and invite the mothers also to taste it.</li>
                            <li>If possible let one or more of the mothers also demonstrate the preperation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>KIthen Gardens:</strong> Have a model kitchen garden at the sub centre if possible. Encourage village leaders to organise a kitchen Garden competition and give prizes.</p>
                        <p>Other methods of nutrition education which are useful and interesting for groups such as mothers or school children include puppet shows, role plays and folk dances with songs.</p>
                        <p><strong>Classess for Fathers:</strong> Fathers also need to know what foods are best for infatns, children, pregnant and nursing mothers. They also need to understand the need for mothers to be given enough money to buy foods in adequate amounts, for everyone in the family to have a good balanced diet. Perhaps the men will like to come to a special meeting where they can learn these thins. This will go a long way in improving family nutrition.</p>
