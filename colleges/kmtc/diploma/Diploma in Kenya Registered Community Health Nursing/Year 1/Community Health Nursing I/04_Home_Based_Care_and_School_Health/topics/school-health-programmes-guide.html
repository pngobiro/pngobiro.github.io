                        <p>When a child reaches school going age, it is necessary that, the health care that was provided when they were under five years is continued. School health focuses on ensuring health promotion, conservation, protection and correction of abnormalities of the school population.</p>
                        <p>A school health programme is an integral part of community health. A school health approach is advocated in the provision of health services as school children are easy to reach, they also disseminate health messages to the larger population. It is therefore important to consider school health programmes as a priority need of the community.</p>

                        <p>In Kenya, it is your responsibility as a community health nurse to design school health programmes. In order to organise a practical school health programme you need to involve the rest of the health team members, the school administration and the community.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Members of the school health team:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teachers</li>
                            <li>Pupils and students</li>
                            <li>Parents</li>
                            <li>Community formal and informal leaders</li>
                            <li>Community health nurse</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>To organize a good school health programme, you need to do the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess the problems of school children</li>
                            <li>Establish practical goals for the school population</li>
                            <li>Carry out the needed activities</li>
                            <li>Evaluate the process and results of the programs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The whole idea behind a school health programme is to ensure that the needs of the school child are met.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Needs of school child</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">A Stable Home</h4>
                        <p>The home should provide basic needs especially shelter and security.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Proper Nutrition</h4>
                        <p>The child needs to grow well physically and mentally. It is therefore important for the child to take adequate nutrition at least three times a day. The diet should have extra proteins and vitamins to meet there nutritional needs. This will help the child to cope with demands of school life. The meals may be provided at home, school, or may be packed.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Freedom from Fatigue</h4>
                        <p>The child needs to have enough rest at home from school activities. The evening meal should be taken early so that the child will have enough sleep and rest.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clothing</h4>
                        <p>This is normally provided as school uniform, which should be clean and tidy. The child needs to wear shoes to prevent injuries and hookworm infestation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Good Sight, Hearing and Speech</h4>
                        <p>Defects of sight, hearing and speech interfere with the learning process of a child. Early detection of all disabilities and referral to appropriate specialist is a very important activity of a school health programme.</p>
                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Freedom from Infection</h4>
                        <p>All school children should be immunized against childhood diseases. Treatment of common conditions, for example colds, skin rashes, sore throat and cuts should also be given. The treatment could take place in the school clinic or in the local health care facility.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pure and Safe Water</h4>
                        <p>This should be provided in the school and at home to prevent water related diseases. Adequate sanitation, proper excreta and refuse disposal is important at home and in school.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clean Buildings</h4>
                        <p>The home and school environment should be kept clean.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">1. ASSESSING HEALTH NEEDS</h3>
                        <p>Where can you source information about school health needs in your catchment area?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clinic records</li>
                            <li>Report</li>
                            <li>Health workers</li>
                            <li>Teachers, students and parents</li>
                            <li>Personal observation and expireience</li>
                            <li>Formal and informal records</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2. PLANNING</h3>
                        <p>Once you gather the information regarding the health needs of school children in your catchment area, you then need to discuss your findings, and plan your programme with stakeholders from the Ministry of Health.</p>
                        <p>These include the:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>District/sub-county medical officers of health</li>
                            <li>District/sub-county public health nurse</li>
                            <li>Transport officers</li>
                            <li>District/sub- county health administrative officer</li>
                            <li>District/sub-county health education officer</li>
                            <li>District/ sub-county public health officer</li>
                            <li>District/sub-county medical records officer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Implementing a school health programme requires quite a lot of resources. You will require funds for equipment, drugs, supplies, fuel and staff. You will also need cooperation from your team members. It is therefore very important for you to carefully identify each member of the team, and discuss with them their roles during the school health services.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Resources Required for School Health Programmes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Money</li>
                            <li>Manpower</li>
                            <li>Material</li>
                            <li>Time</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During the planning phase you also need to consider the following supporting activities.</p>
                        <p>Effective partnerships between teachers and health workers and between the education and health sectors.</p>
                        <p>The success of school health programmes demands an effective partnership between ministries of education and health, and teachers and health workers. The health sector retains the responsibility for the health of children, but the education sector is responsible for implementing, and often funding the school based programmes. These sectors need to identify responsibilities and present a coordinated action, to improve health and learning outcomes from children.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pupil Awareness and Participation</h4>
                        <p>Children must be important participants in all aspects of school health programmes, and not simply the beneficiaries. Children should participate in health policy development and implementation efforts, to create a safer and more sanitary environment.</p>
                        <p>Health promotion aimed at their parents, other children, community members is taught during school health services. Children in turn disseminate. This is an effective way to help young people and the community to acquire the knowledge, attitudes, values and skills needed to adopt healthy lifestyles, and to support health and education for all.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
                        <p>You should start by preparing a work plan together with members of your health facility team. Make sure you allow enough time, depending on the number of schools to be covered and their health needs.</p>
                        <p>You should also organize the resources you will need to perform the tasks at hand, so that you and your team can be punctual on the day of the service. Since some of the resources at your disposal will be teachers, pupils and community leaders, remember to promote teamwork during implementation.</p>
                        <p>Their morale and enthusiasm should be kept high as they participate.</p>

This examination should be done systematically from head to toe for every child. A cumulative record of a child's history, medical examination and immunizations should be kept for each child.</p>

                        <p>Since the children spend a lot of the time in school, it is important to ensure that their environment is safe and clean. The following aspects are inspected:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Location of the School</strong><br>Surroundings should be clean, free from noise pollution, away from industrial and other waste or swampy area.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sanitation</strong><br>The school should have a good water supply, clean and enough latrines, and solid waste disposal systems. There should be separate toilets for female and male students. The environment should be clean and well maintained.</li>
                            <li><strong>Playground</strong><br>It should be dry with no potholes or stones to prevent accidents.</li>
                            <li><strong>Classroom</strong><br>This should be clean, well ventilated with adequate lighting. It should not be overcrowded and the students should be able to hear the teacher and see the black board from where they sit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Furniture</strong><br>The seats should be simple and not attached to each other so that the pupils can move them. The children's feet should be able to touch the floor when they are seated.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Promotion of Proper Nutrition</h3>
                        <p>This consists of the importance of eating a balanced diet and good feeding habits. If there is a feeding programme observe the following:</p>
