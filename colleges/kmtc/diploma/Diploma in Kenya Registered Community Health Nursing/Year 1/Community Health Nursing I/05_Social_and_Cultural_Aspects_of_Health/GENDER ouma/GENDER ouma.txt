BASIC GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \\ CONCEPTS
}
$\checkmark$ Division of labour
$\checkmark$ Inequality and Equality
$\checkmark$ Equity
$\checkmark$ Gender awareness

\section*{COST OF GENDER DISCRIMINATION}
$\square$ Gender inequalities:
Dreduce program effectiveness and waste resources
$\square$ inhibit country's growth and development
limit opportunities and potential

\section*{HOW TO FIGHT GENDER DISCRIVINATION}
*Name it
* Change it
- Take legal action
- Advocate for temporary special measures or other policies/legislation
- Advocate for new laws
*Ignore it...but it won't go away

\section*{CONT'}
*Engage men!
*Men also affected - directly and indirectly
*Gender inequality and discrimination impact society as a whole
- Very little that women can't do based on sex
- Gender roles impact political participation... but can change
- Women are a diverse group
- ALL issues are women's issues
- Discrimination is costly... name it and change it!

\section*{GENDER ANALYSIS}
- Gender analysis is a tool to better understand the different social, economic, cultural and political realities of women and men, girls and boys
- Its core is to understand culture( underlying values, norms and beliefs), expressed in the construction of gender identities and inequalities

\section*{GOALS OF GENDER ANALYSIS}
*Better understanding of the community (women, men, girls and boys)
*Get better results from development programs

\section*{PURPOSE OF GENDER ANALYSIS}
- Provide a review of women's priorities, women's practical needs and strategic interests and ways to address them
- Provide specific gender aggregate statistics
- Is a review of social, economic, political and power dynamics
- Gives understanding of gender inequalities and their implications for development policy
- Increases access and control of resources

\section*{REASONS FOR GENDER ANALYSIS}
- Helps ensure that both men and women participate in and benefit from development
- Looks for the root cause of gender inequality and enables us to address them
- Looks at equity of impact
- Focuses at transforming attitudes and practices to bring about change
- Helps ensure that traditional imbalances do not work against women and men
- Enhances effectiveness of reproductive health services
- Ensure long-term sustainability by addressing underlying obstacles to development

\section*{EXAMMPLES}
*A gender analysis of health programs will inform you of how inequalities disadvantage women's health, the constraints women face, and ways to overcome the constraints
*A gender analysis of women worker's situations, their needs, work places, wages, market trends will provide practical information to advocate for all (women and men)
*A gender analysis of water projects will inform you where women collect water, what should be done to increase women's access to safe water

\section*{WHEN TO CONDUCT GENDER ANALYSIS}
* Gender analysis should/ can be undertaken at all/any stages of a program/project cycles, including:
- Identification of the projects
- Planning or design of the activity
- Implementation
- Monitoring and evaluation of program

\section*{WHO SHOULD DO GENDER ANALYSIS}
- Government
*Policy makers
*Donors
*Program managers
*Development staff
*Field workers etc.

\section*{HOW TO DO GENDER ANALYSIS}
*Collect relevant data
*Identify gender issues
*Understand the institutional, economic, social and political context
*Understand the priorities and needs of both men and women affected by the project

\section*{GENDER ANALYSIS FRAMEWORKS/TOOLS}
* Gender roles framework (Harvard)
- Triple role framework
- Web of institutionalization framework
* Gender Analysis Matrix
- Equality and empowerment framework
- Capacity and vulnerabilities framework
- People oriented planning framework
- Social relations framework

\section*{HARVARD IRAMEWORK}
$\square$ Can help planners design efficient projects
$\square$ Improves visibility of women in target area
$\square$ Three main tools:
$\square$ The socio-economic activity profile
I. The access and control of resources profile
II. Influencing factors ( identify factors that determine gender differences)

\section*{GENDER ANALYSIS MATRIX}
*The tool uses participatory approach to facilitate the definition and analysis of gender differences by the community
*It articulates unique issues as well as gender analysis capacity from the grass root level up
*All the requisite knowledge for gender analysis exists among the people who are the subject of analysis

\section*{GENDER MAINSTREAMING}
- Gender Mainstreaming: is a strategy of developing policies, legislation, programs, project, society and community's development plans from gender equality perspective in order to benefit both women and men.
*Means making women's as well as men's concerns, needs and experiences an integral part of policies, programs and projects so that women and men can benefit equally.
*In practice, it means systematically identifying gaps in gender equality and consequently addressing them.
*Source of gaps: rights, control, ownership, power, opportunities, etc.

\section*{GENDER MAINSTREAMING PROCESS}

Gender Analysis - Program cycle Analysis - Implementation Monitoring \& Evaluation

\section*{PURPOSE OF GENDER MAINSTREAMING}
- Reduce gender inequalities that may exist in a given project area;
- Ensure women and men's specific needs are satisfied, that they benefit from the project and that the project impacts positively on their lives;
- Create the conditions for the equitable access of men and women to project resources and benefits;
- Create the conditions for the equitable participation in project implementation and decision making processes.

\section*{LEVELS OF GENDER MAINSTREAMING}
*At legislation, policies, strategies level
*At organization, department level
*At household, family level

\section*{Law of Gender Equity}
* Gender equity is achieved when women and men have equal roles and positions, are provided equal conditions, opportunities in developing their abilities for the development of community, family, and equally benefit from development's achievement

\section*{SUCCESSFUL GENDER MAINSTREAMING}
- Equal participation by men and women in the decision-making processes for setting priorities and allocating resources
- Equal access to and control over society's opportunities, resources and development outcomes by women and men
- Equal recognition and status for men and women
- Women and men enjoy equal human rights
- Equal improvements in and standards of quality of life for women and men

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF GENDER}

\section*{MAINSTREAMING}
- Adequate accountability mechanisms for monitoring progress need to be established.
- The initial identification of issues and problems across all area(s) of activity should be such that gender differences and disparities can be diagnosed.
- Assumptions that issues or problems are neutral from a genderequality perspective should never be made.
- Gender analysis should always be carried out.
- Clear political will and allocation of adequate resources for mainstreaming, including additional financial and human resources if necessary, are important for translation of the concept into practice.
- Gender mainstreaming requires that efforts be made to broaden women's equitable participation at all levels of decision-making.
- Mainstreaming does not replace the need for targeted, womenspecific policies and programmes, and positive legislation; nor does it do away with the need for gender units or focal points
