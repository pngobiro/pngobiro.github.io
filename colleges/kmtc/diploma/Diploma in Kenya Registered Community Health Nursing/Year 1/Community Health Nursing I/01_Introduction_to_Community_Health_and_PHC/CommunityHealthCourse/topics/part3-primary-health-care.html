                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 1978, the Alma Ata international conference on PHC defined primary health care as:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>'Essential health care based on practical, scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology, made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation, and at a cost that the community and country can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination. In addition, it forms an integral part both of the country’s health system, of which it is the central function and main focus, and of the overall social and economic development of the community. It is the first level of contact of individuals, the family and the community with the national health system, bringing health care as close as possible to where people live and work'.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>From the definition, you need to note the following key statements which identify PHC as essential health care. These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>PHC is universally accessible to individuals and families in the community.</li>
                            <li>PHC is socially acceptable to all, meaning that the health care is appropriate and adequate in quality to satisfy the health needs of people, and is provided by methods acceptable to them within their social cultural norms.</li>
                            <li>PHC is affordable, that is, whatever methods of payment used, the services should be at a price the community can afford.</li>
                            <li>PHC promotes full participation of individual, families and communities.</li>
                            <li>PHC is appropriate technology that is, the use of methods and technology which use locally available supplies and equipments.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>PHC is a strategy of health care delivery which creates a partnership between the consumer of the health services and health care professionals. They both actively participate in the achievement of the common goal of improved health.</p>
                        <p>Key players include the government, non-governmental organizations, Primary Health Care workers and community members, amongst others.</p>

                        <p>Fundamentals of PHC are basic rules or beliefs that are essential to the existence, development or success of Primary Health Care.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>PHC reflects and evolves from the economic conditions and socio-cultural and political characteristics of the country and the communities, and is based on the application of the relevant results of social, biomedical and health services research and public health experience.</li>
                            <li>PHC addresses the main health problems in the community, providing promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services accordingly.</li>
                            <li>PHC includes, at least: education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of preventing and controlling them; an adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation; maternal and child care including family planning; immunisation against the major infectious diseases; prevention and control of locally endemic diseases; appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries and provision of essential drugs.</li>
                            <li>PHC involves, in addition to the health sector, other sectors such as agriculture, animal husbandry, food industry, education, housing, public works, communication and other sectors. It demands the coordinated efforts of all these sectors.</li>
                            <li>PHC requires and promotes maximum community and individual self-reliance and participation in the planning, organization, operation and control of health services, making fullest use of local, national and other available resources. Through appropriate education the communities themselves are empowered to participate.</li>
                            <li>PHC should be sustained by integral, functional and mutually supportive referral systems leading to the progressive improvement of comprehensive health care for all, and giving priority to those most in need.</li>
                            <li>At local and referral levels, PHC relies on health workers, including physicians, nurses, midwives, auxiliaries and community workers, as well as traditional practitioners who are suitably trained both socially and technically, to work as a health team and to respond to the expressed health needs of the community.</li>

                        <p>In the Alma Ata conference of 1978, eight essential elements of PHC were identified. However, individual countries were given the liberty to add any other elements they felt were relevant to their own country. Kenya has added other elements.</p>
                        <p>The PHC elements listed at the Alma Ata Declaration were as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Education concerning prevailing health problems and the methods of preventing and controlling them</li>
                            <li>Local disease control</li>
                            <li>Expanded programme of immunisation</li>
                            <li>Maternal and child health care and family planning</li>
                            <li>Essential drug supply</li>
                            <li>Nutrition and adequate food supply</li>
                            <li>Treatment and prevention of common diseases and injuries</li>
                            <li>Safe water supply and good sanitation</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Use the acronym 'ELEMENTS' to help you remember these eight elements.</p>
                        <p>The Kenyan government has added additional PHC elements to the ones identified at the Alma Ata conference These are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mental health</li>
                            <li>Dental health</li>
                            <li>Community based rehabilitation</li>
                            <li>Malaria control</li>
                            <li>STI and HIV/AIDS prevention and control</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Health Education</h4>
                        <p>Health education is education that is intended to have a positive impact on health. It is a process of dialogue with community members to find out appropriate responses to health problems, as well as to empower them with the knowledge and insight they need, to understand how their behaviour affects their health.</p>
                        <p>Health education today has extended its scope beyond disease prevention and control to health promotion. It gives individuals and communities the incentive to promote the conditions that maintain good health.</p>
                        <p>You can see that health education is an integral part of all health services, all health personnel including yourself have an important role to play in organising appropriate health educational programmes at all levels in the community.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Promotion of Food Supply and Proper Nutrition</h4>
                        <p>Nutritional deficiency states are particularly noticeable among pregnant and lactating mothers, infants and children. This may be due to the prevailing cultural or economic factors in the community.</p>
                        <p>As a community health nurse, it is your responsibility to take suitable measures to prevent and treat diarrhoea diseases, intestinal parasites and other diseases, which lead to nutritional deficiency states. It is also your responsibility to support health promotional measures such as child spacing, nutrition education, kitchen garden and food hygiene. In coordination with other sectors, you should also encourage community members to grow more foods, prevent post harvest spoilage through construction of simple food stores, and to keep poultry and dairy cattle.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Water Supply and Basic Sanitation</h4>
                        <p>Safe water and sanitation is not available to a major section of our population, yet, it is essential for life. Many water borne diseases which are prevalent in the community can be prevented if ommunities gain access to safe water and adopt proper refuse and faecal disposal.</p>
                        <p>So under this element, effort is being made to bring together the different factors from related sectors to survey and identify sources of safe water and carry out proper analysis of the water. At the same time, community health workers should educate community members on how to protect wells and springs from contamination, how to construct latrines, compositing facilities and soakage pits.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning</h4>
                        <p>Children make up one-half of the community and their mothers another fifth. On numbers alone, health care for mothers and children forms the greater part of community health. Mothers and children also run a great risk of injury and disease because their lives are concerned with beginnings and growth. MCH/FP services are therefore aimed at promoting the health of mothers and children, by reducing the maternal and child mortality rates, and enabling women of childbearing age to have the desired number of pregnancies and at the right interval. MCH/FP care has the following four main functions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Antenatal care / Prenatal care</li>
                            <li>Perinatal care</li>
                            <li>Postnatal care</li>
                            <li>Family planning</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Immunisation</h4>
                        <p>Kenya has for some time now implemented immunisation activities through the Kenya Expanded Programme on Immunisation (KEPI).</p>
                        <p>Immunisation is a very effective means of primary prevention against certain endemic and epidemic diseases. Kenya has a long history of immunisation programmes.</p>
                        <p>Health workers have been trained on how to motivate and encourage mothers to bring their children for immunisation, as well as how to identify suspected cases of immunisable diseases such as, measles, poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus, using standardised case definition (disease surveillance).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Local Disease Control</h4>
                        <p>There are many endemic diseases in this country, some of which are confined to particular areas. Can you remember what an endemic disease is?</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Treatment and Prevention of Common Diseases and Injuries</h4>
                        <p>Curative care is important in its own right as it provides a powerful mechanism for teaching preventive and promotive care.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Supply of Essential Drugs</h4>
                        <p>Essential drugs are basic drugs used to treat minor ailments or conditions at the dispensary and health centre levels.</p>
                        <p>As a community health nurse you have a major responsibility in ensuring that patients have access to essential drugs and know how to manage their drug regimens for optimal effect.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Principles of PHC</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Equitable Distribution:</strong> Equity is the fair and reasonable distribution of available resources to all individuals and families so that they can meet their fundamental and basic needs. Services should be physically, socially and financially accessible to everyone. People with similar needs should have equal access to similar health services. To ensure equal access, the distribution of resources and coverage of Primary Health Care services should be greatest in those areas with the greatest need. This principle should be taken into account when deciding on the location of new health facilities, outreach services points, or during introduction of new health programmes, especially those that require payment for services.</p>
                        <p><strong>Manpower Development:</strong> Primary Health Care aims at mobilising the human potential of the entire community by making use of available resources. This principle facilitates the identification and deployment of the necessary health personnel as well as the training and development of new categories of health workers to serve the community. Comprehensive PHC requires health workers to identify solutions that involve the community, as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It is not enough to provide oral rehydration solution and medical treatment to a sick child with diarrhoea. Maintaining the health of the child also requires providing family education on child care and environmental hygiene, as well as improving access to food.</li>
                            <li>In addition to counselling on breast feeding, growth monitoring, nutrition rehabilitation, and child care, a nutrition program should promote weaning foods that are available locally.</li>
                            <li>PHC services for healthy people (prenatal care, immunisation, health education) should be established as soon as possible through community based health interventions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Community Participation:</strong> Community participation is the process by which individuals, families and communities assume responsibility in promoting their own health and welfare. The PHC strategy underlines the importance of full community participation, especially in health decision making. Community members and health providers need to work together in partnership to seek solutions to the complex health problems facing communities today. In addition to the health sector, families and communities need to get actively involved in taking care of their own health. Communities should participate in the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating and preserving a healthy environment</li>
                            <li>Maintaining preventive and promotive health activities</li>
                            <li>Sharing information about their needs and wants with higher authorities</li>
                            <li>Implementing health care priorities and managing clinics and hospitals</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Appropriate technology:</strong> Appropriate technology is the kind of technology that is scientifically or technically sound and adaptable to local needs, and which the community can afford to maintain at every stage of their development in the spirit of self-reliance and self-determination. It includes issues of costs and affordability of services, type of equipment and their pattern of distribution throughout the community. An increasing complexity in health care methods should be observed upward in the PHC pyramid. Care givers should be trained to deliver services using the most appropriate and cost effective methods and equipment for their level of care.</p>
                        <p><strong>Multi-Sectoral or Intersectoral Approach:</strong> PHC requires a coordinated effort with other health related sectors whose activities impact on health. For example, agriculture, water and sanitation, transportation, education, etc. This is necessary to achieve social and economic development of a population. The health sector should lead this effort. The commitment of all sectors may increase if the purpose for joint action and the role of each sector is made clear to all concerned. Lessons drawn from past experience clearly indicate that the health sector cannot achieve much in isolation. It must work in close collaboration with other sectors in the community in order to succeed in promoting the community’s health and self-reliance.</p>
