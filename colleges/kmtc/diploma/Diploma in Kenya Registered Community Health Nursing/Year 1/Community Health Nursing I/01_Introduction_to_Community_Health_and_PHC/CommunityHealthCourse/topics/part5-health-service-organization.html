                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Ministry of Health operates at four main levels, which are based on our country's administrative setup. The four levels are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>National (Central)</li>
                            <li>County</li>
                            <li>District</li>
                            <li>Community (Peripheral)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">National (Central Level)</h3>
                        <p>The national (central) level is the headquarters where political, professional and administrative matters are coordinated and policy decisions made. It is headed by a minister, assistant minister and a permanent secretary, in that order of seniority. These leaders are politically appointed and need not be health professionals.</p>
                        <p>Next in this hierarchy comes the technical leader of health services, that is, the Director of Medical Services (DMS). The Director of Medical Services supervises all matters pertaining to preventive, promotive and curative health services. They are assisted by Deputy Directors, who are responsible for the various divisions which deal with the different responsibilities, such as mental health, communicable diseases and health planning, among others.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">County Level</h3>
                        <p>The Ministry of Health is represented at the county level by the County Medical Officer, who is a senior medical officer in charge of organisation and administration of health services within the province.</p>
                        <p>The County Medical Officer is answerable to the Director of Medical Services at the Ministry of Health headquarters. At the county level, they are assisted by other health officers responsible for various county health care departments, for example, county matron. At the county level, there is usually a county hospital.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">District Level</h3>
                        <p>The district is the basic organisational unit of the government health services. It is a key level in the health sector administrative setup because the government decentralised almost all of its activities and made the district the focus for rural development. The government delivers health care to the district population through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A district or sub-district hospital</li>
                            <li>Health centres</li>
                            <li>Dispensaries</li>
                            <li>Mobile (outreach) units</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The district health service is headed by a District Medical Officer of Health (DMOH) also refered to as Medical Officer of Health (MOH). The administrative headquarters of the district health services are usually at the district or sub-district hospital, where the DMOH is in most cases also the medical superintendent of the hospital.</p>
                        <p>The district hospital provides limited specialised medical services and also logistic and technical support to the health centres and dispensaries in the periphery. It is a crucial link in the administrative support and referral chain of health services being provided to the population in the communities.</p>
                        <p>The duties of the MOH include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Administration of the district health services</li>
                            <li>Hospital work and other clinical duties</li>
                            <li>Training of staff in the district</li>
                            <li>Planning and coordinating all health activities in the district</li>
                            <li>Supervision of health care delivery in the district</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The MOH does not work in isolation. They head a team of health professionals who form the District Health Management Team (DHMT).</p>
                        <p>The DHMT is charged with the responsibility of monitoring and supervising all health care services in the district. Most of the members of the DHMT are found at the district hospital. The other key members of the DHMT are found at the district administrative headquarters.</p>
                        <p>The members of the DHMT include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The District Medical Officer of Health (Chairman)</li>
                            <li>The District Public Health Nurse</li>
                            <li>The District Hospital Nursing officer incharge</li>
                            <li>The District Public Health Officer</li>
                            <li>The District Public Health Education Officer</li>
                            <li>The District Health Administrative Officer</li>
                            <li>The District Health Information Officer</li>
                            <li>The District Pharmacist</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The DHMT has other co-opted members who include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>District HIV/AIDS/STD Coordinator</li>
                            <li>District Physiotherapist</li>
                            <li>District Clinical Officer</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Important functions of the DHMT include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Formulating relevant health objectives for the district in keeping with the county and national health policies.</li>
                            <li>Identifying health problems and needs in the district.</li>
                            <li>Training and deployment of staff to health facilities.</li>
                            <li>Planning and coordinating health activities for optimal utilisation of district resources.</li>
                            <li>Supervising all health care activities and services within the district.</li>

                            <li>Licensing health facilities/clinics</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The District Public Health Nurse</h4>
                        <p>The District Public Health Nurse (DPHN), also known as the District Community Health Nurse, is an important member of the DHMT and is responsible to the DMOH (is supervised by the DMOH).</p>
                        <p>The main duties and responsibilities of the DPHN are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Planning, organising and supervising all community health activities in the district.</li>
                            <li>Deploying nursing staff to community/rural health facilities.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Community/Peripheral Level</h3>
                        <p>The last level in this hierarchy is the community/peripheral level. This is really at the community level where there are divisions, locations and sub-locations. Here health centres, dispensaries and in some places, community based health workers provide basic curative, promotive and preventive services. They may be augmented by the activities of special programmes, such as KEPI, or various mobile services. These health services together form the backbone of rural health service where about 80% of the population live.</p>
                        <p>Not everyone gets all their medical care from government facilities. People are also treated by other health institutions supported by private and religious organisations.</p>
