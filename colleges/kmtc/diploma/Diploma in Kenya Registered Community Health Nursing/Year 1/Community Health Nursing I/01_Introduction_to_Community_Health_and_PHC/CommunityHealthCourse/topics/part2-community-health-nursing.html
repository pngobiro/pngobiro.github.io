                        <p>Community health nursing is a synthesis of nursing and public health practice applied to promoting and preserving the health of populations. The practice is general and comprehensive. It is not limited to a particular age group or diagnosis and is continuing, not episodic. The dominant responsibility is to the population as a whole; nursing care is directed to individuals, families, or groups. This contributes to the health of the total population. Health promotion, health maintenance, health education, and management, coordination, and continuity of care are utilized in a holistic approach to the management of the health care of individuals, families, and groups in a community. The community health nurse is a member of a team of health professionals working to promote the health of a community.</p>
                        <p>The community health nurse is responsible for identifying high-risk aggregates in the community and working with the community to develop acceptable, resourceful, and realistic health programs that will meet their needs. The community health nurse is a health planner, an educator and a direct care provider. The community health nurse is a client advocate and a catalyst for change.</p>
                        <p>The community health nurse is a generalist in terms of practice. The knowledge base for community health nursing is the nursing process, epidemiology, and interpersonal and group process. The community health nurse must have knowledge of the community and its resources, an understanding of the political structure, and the ability to work within it. The community health nurse must be able to assess the health status of the community and to plan, implement, and evaluate community health programs.</p>

                            <li>A community health nursing programme must have clearly defined objectives and purposes for its services.</li>
                            <li>Community health nursing should not be a vertical programme. A community health nurse must work with other stakeholders in the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the community health programme.</li>
                            <li>Community health nursing should involve the community right through the planning implementation and evaluation of the programme.</li>
                            <li>The community health service should build the capacity of the community to run their own health programme for the purpose of sustainability. These include training of the Communities Own Resource Persons (CORPs).</li>
                            <li>Health education and counselling for the individual, family and community are integral parts of community health nursing.</li>
                            <li>Community health nursing services should be based on the identified needs of the patient and there should be continuity of services to the patient.</li>
                            <li>Community health nursing should work within the community’s culture and norms without compromising professionalism.</li>
                            <li>Community health nursing is a service and there should therefore be no room to demand favours, gifts or bribes from clients.</li>
                            <li>Community health nursing is dynamic and the nurses should therefore actively participate in continuing professional development so as to keep abreast with new developments.</li>
                            <li>Community health nursing services should develop proper guidelines and maintain proper records and reports.</li>
