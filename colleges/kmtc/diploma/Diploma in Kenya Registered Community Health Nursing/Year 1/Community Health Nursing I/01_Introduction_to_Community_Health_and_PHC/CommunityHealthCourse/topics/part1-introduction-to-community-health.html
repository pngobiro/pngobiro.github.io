                        <p>Determinants are defined as those predisposing factor, which influence the health of a particular community.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Host factor (intrinsic):</strong> Host is ‘soil’ and disease agent is ‘seed’. Host predisposing factors are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It includes age, sex, ethnicity, biological characteristics such as genetic factors, blood groups, etc,</li>

Environment of man is divided into three components – physical, biological and psychological.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk factors:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Defined as an attribute or exposure that is significantly associated with the development of the disease.</li>
                                    <li>Risk factors are often suggestive, i.e. presence of a risk factor does not imply that the disease will occur, and in its absence diseases will not occur.</li>
                                    <li>Risk factors may be causative (e.g. smoking for CA lung), contributory (lack of physical exercise for CHD) or predictive (e.g. illiteracy for prenatal mortality).</li>

                        <p>Agent, Host, Environment.</p>
                        <p>The concept of disease is based on the concept of fire. Fire occurs when there is an interaction between factors: Oxygen, Fuel and Ignition. Similarly disease process starts, when there is an interaction between ‘Agents’, Hosts and Environment.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">What is a Community?</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A community is a group of people (a large or small group) living in a certain geographical area and working together for a common goal. They share the same resources such as water, climatic and geographic conditions, health services, administration and leadership, as well as disadvantages such as shortages, risks and dangers.</p>
                        <p>The community is made up of individual persons and each of these individuals belongs to a family all of whom are a part of the larger community.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Individual</h3>
                        <p>Each individual you know is different and unique. Each has a mixture of characteristics, some of which they share with others and some of which are part of a particular culture. Culture is all those things which people learn, share and pass on to later generations. One of the most important of these things is language, for it is the means by which people communicate with one another.</p>
                        <p>As a health worker you must be able to communicate with individuals in the community where you work and acquire some knowledge of the language they speak. It is important to be able to show respect and understanding for other people and their culture as well as knowing their local practices like greetings.</p>
                        <p>Individuals learn beliefs and customs about right and wrong behaviour as they grow up. For example, in some areas, young people are taught that dead ancestors can influence the lives of living people. If the ancestors become angry they can cause disease and misfortune. Therefore, when you teach such individuals about the effects of germs on their health status, they may not be convinced and may opt to follow their traditional beliefs.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, people follow both sets of ideas – traditional and modern, whereby they consult the dispensary for treatment of the symptoms and return to the traditional healer to get rid of what they think is the ‘real’ cause of the illness. As a community health worker you need to understand human behaviour and the factors that influence their behaviour in order to be effective in your community health activities.</p>
                        <p>An individual can only attain full health if they have wholesome growth. The place where this wholesome growth can best be cultivated is the family.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Family</h3>
                        <p>The family is the smallest recognised group of individuals in a community. It begins with a marriage union in which husbands and wives have certain rights and obligations. It is one of the oldest institutions that mankind has known. It defies time, boundaries, cultures and human understanding. It is therefore not surprising that scholars from all over the world who have studied the family of mankind do not agree on one single definition of the family. Rather than look at every available definition of the family, you will consider one which tends to agree on many aspects of the family.</p>
                        <p>The family is a group of two or more persons, who share emotional bonds and material things, usually live in the same household, are related by blood, marriage or adoption, and sexual relationship is socially approved for the parents.</p>
                        <p>The family is a very important social group in community health. The family provides love, security and a sense of belonging for individuals from the time they are born. Many of a person’s characteristics are influenced by their family. For example, a child learns from their family what behaviour is acceptable in the community and the language its parents speak. Families have a strong influence on what each member does.</p>
                        <p>Often there is an important figure in the family who makes the decisions or whose opinions are highly valued. The opinion of people in the family may be more important to a person than the opinion of a health worker. This has important effects on health behaviour and the use of health services. For example, in some communities women may not be free to go to or take their children to a health centre, even if they want to, because their husbands do not allow them. These are important things to remember when you advise individuals about a health problem.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of Families</h4>
                        <p>There are different types of families in a community</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Nuclear Family:</strong> This consists of a husband and a wife with or without children. This type of family brings forth children (family of procreation). Children born in this family consider it to be the family of their origin.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Extended Family:</strong> This is also called a joint extended family. This family includes members of nuclear families and other relatives, aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews and grandparents.</li>
                            <li><strong>Single Parent Family:</strong> This is formed when one parent brings up children alone either because of divorce, separation, death or desertion of their spouse.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Blended Family:</strong> This type of family is formed when husband and wife bring into the new marriage unrelated children from their previous marriages. Cohabitation and homosexual marriages are also referred to as blended families.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Functions of the Family</h4>
                        <p>The family has many important functions, these include:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Factors Affecting Family Health</h4>
                        <p><strong>Internal Factors</strong></p>
                        <p>The internal factors that influence the health of the family include:</p>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Functions of a Community</h3>
                        <p>Having seen the different components that make up a community, now look at the functions of the community.</p>
                        <p>The functions of a community include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transmitting and sharing information, ideas and beliefs</li>
                            <li>Educating its children about their culture (socialising) and welcoming newcomers into the group’s culture (acculturation)</li>
                            <li>Producing and distributing services and goods</li>
                            <li>Providing companionship and support to individual members and smaller groups</li>
                            <li>Sharing and utilising space for living, schools, health facilities, fields, roads etc.</li>
                            <li>Protecting individual and group rights and welfare</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>From the previous page, you can see that a community functions as a medium for the growth and development of its individual members. It imposes the standards by which the individuals are evaluated, if the community has high expectations of its members, their performance also tends to be high. A good community is judged by the kind of people it produces.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Characteristics of a healthy community</h3>
                        <ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Problems affecting the community</h3>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Community Sub-systems</h3>
                        <p>A community has eight essential sub-systems, which interact and interrelate continuously.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Socio-cultural System:</strong> This system is made up of all the customs and beliefs, family and kinships, leadership and power structures in society. This sub-system exerts a powerful influence on the lifestyles of the community members, their priorities and their attitudes and values towards health and illness. For example some cultural factors promote either acceptance or stigma towards a certain illness. High-risk behaviour may be a result of cultural traditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Political System:</strong> This sub-system is made up of the government and its development policies as well as political organisations. If there is political support towards improving health care delivery, the government provides the mechanism and structure for the planning, implementation and evaluation of the health care delivery system. The constitution of Kenya contains a declaration for the elimination of poverty, ignorance and disease; hence the establishment of the Ministry of Health and several other ministries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Economic System:</strong> The government’s ability to provide health and other services to its citizens depends on the state of the economy. The poorer the economy of the country, the more disadvantaged its people will be. Low economic status is highly associated with malnutrition and communicable diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Education System:</strong> Education is the main tool of changing behaviour and improving individual and community health. Low educational status perpetuates under-development, harmful traditions and superstitions. The educational system can be effectively used to pass health related information and messages that could significantly transform the perception of the communities on healthy living and prevention of illnesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Religious System:</strong> The religious system may be a source of health promotion when its values and teachings positively influence lifestyles and healthy behaviour, for example, forbidding smoking, alcohol consumption, pre-marital and extra-marital sex. On the other hand, religious teachings may promote ill health, for example, by forbidding the followers from seeking treatment in hospitals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Environmental System:</strong> Environmental sanitation is one of the leading promoters of individual and community health. Clean water supply, proper disposal of waste and adequate housing are key to community wellness. Environmental pollution is a cause of various illnesses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication and Transport System:</strong> Communication includes all the means of contacting and exchanging information with one another such as roads, bridges, railroad, telephone, television, radio, computers, internet, fax, and postal services. The communication system is important in spreading health messages. Transport aids in communication by moving people from place to place.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health Care system:</strong> The health care system exists to provide promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative services in hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, health centres, dispensaries, and through special health projects and programs. The health care system is enhanced through linkages that bring together the government, non-governmental organisations, private institutions and individuals in providing continuous and comprehensive health services. These linkages strengthen the multi-sectoral approach of achieving health for all.</li>
