Concepts of health and disease, with respect to community.

Health:

1. Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing
and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity.(WHO 1948)
2. Operational definition of Health by WHO – a condition or quality of
the human organism expressing the adequate functioning of the organism
in given conditions, genetic or environmental.

Health and wellbeing
Positive health – it implies the notion of perfect health in body and
mind. It cannot become a reality, it always remain a dream because
everything in our life is subject to change.
“Wellness is a multidimensional state of being describing the existence
of positive health in an individual as exemplified by quality of life
and a sense of well-being.”

Good health triad

Involves: physical status, social and mental status.

The combination of these three defines what good health is.

Determinants of health

Determinants are defined as those predisposing factor, which influence
the health of a particular community.
1. Host factor (intrinsic)- 
Host is ‘soil’ and disease agent is ‘seed’. Host predisposing factors
are:-
i)It includes age, sex, ethnicity, biological characteristics such as
genetic factors, blood groups, etc,
ii)Socio-economic factors such as status, education, occupation, stress,
etc.
iii)Life style such as personality traits, drugs, alcohol, smoking,
behavior patterns.

2. Environmental factors (extrinsic)- 
It is complex and defined as all that which is external to individual
human host, may be living or non living and with which he is in constant
interaction. Environment of man is divided into three components –
physical, biological and psychological.

3.Risk factors-

-   Defined as an attribute or exposure that is significantly associated
    with the development of the disease.

-   Risk factors are often suggestive, i.e. presence of a risk factor
    does not imply that the disease will occur, and in its absence
    diseases will not occur.

-   Risk factors may be causative (e.g. smoking for CA lung),
    contributory (lack of physical exercise for CHD) or predictive (e.g.
    illiteracy for prenatal mortality).

DIMENSIONS OF GOOD HEALTH & WELL BEING
1.Physical
A healthy body maintained by good nutrition, regular exercise, avoiding
harmful habits, making informed decisions about health and seeking
medical assistance when necessary.
2.Emotional
The ability to understand your own feelings, accept your limitations,
achieve emotional stability and become comfortable with your emotions.
3.Spiritual
The sense that life is meaningful and has a purpose; the ethics, values
and morals that guide us and give meaning and direction to life. (also
included here is the sense that there exists a supernatural being whom
we must all account).
4.Intellectual
A state in which your mind is engaged in lively interaction with the
world around you. It involves continued learning, problem solving and
creativity.
5.Environmental
It reflects the fact that personal health depends on the health of the
planet. Environmental wellness also requires learning about and
protecting yourself against environmental hazards.
6.Social
The ability to relate well to others, both within and outside the family
unit. It encourages contributing to a healthy community by supporting a
healthy living environment and initiating better communication with

WHO Dimensions of Health And Wellness
1.Overall good health and wellness are inter-dependent on five
dimensions, namely physical, intellectual, emotional, social and
spiritual.
These good health parameters have been set by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in 1948.
Our body and mind are tuned to send us signals for any non functional
activity, generally referred to as symptoms.
It is important to read and understand them in time, to ensure balance
of mind, spirit and body.

Concept of Disease
Sickness: is a state of social dysfunction. Likes/ desire to remain away
from social activities.
Illness: is a subjective state of person who feels aware of not being
well with evident signs and symptoms.
Disease process
Disease: is maladjustment (Physiological/ Psychological of the human
being to its environment.)

Epidemiological Triad of disease
Agent, Host, Environment.
-(Stage of Equilibrium)
The concept of disease is based on the concept of fire. Fire occurs when
there is an interaction between factors: Oxygen, Fuel and Ignition.
Similarly disease process starts, when there is an interaction between
‘Agents’, Hosts and Environment.

  Classification of factors of triad of epidemiology

  Agent factors

  ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  Biological    Bacterium, virus, fungi, protozoa etc

  nutritional   Iron deficiency, Iodine deficiency, high fluoride- etc
                cholesterol.

  Physical      Heat, Frost, Humidity, Altitude, sound, electricity.

  Chemical      Endogenous- lime acid, calcium, oxalates.

                Exogenous- Allergens, insecticide.

  mechanical    Friction, accident, trauma.

  hereditary    Polycystic disease, sickle cell, thallacesemia.

  social        Poverty. Illiteracy, alcohol /drug abuse.
  ------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

Host Factor: Age, sex, race, religion, behavior, believes and
practices. 
Environmental Factor: Physical, Social, Climatic, Economic, Biological.

-   Concept of Prevention
    Prevention is always better than cure. As per the natural history of
    disease, epidemiology has derived 4 levels of prevention of Disease.
    Level of prevention

  Disease Prevention
  Primordial Prevention: It is a new concept emerging out, where efforts
  are made to prevent emergence development of risk factor, through
  change of food habits, smoking, exercise, naturopathy and yoga.
  Health Promotion: Through Health education, nutritional intervention,
  life style behavioral changes, regular exercises
  Specific Protection: Through Immunization, Chemo-prophylosis,
  Nutritional Supplements, Pollution free environment carcinogen noise
  control and standardization of consumer product control accident
  Early diagnosis and Prompt treatment: Regular Health Checkup of
  community, check up of children pregnant mothers and elder people.
  Health checkup of high risk groups like smokers, obese alcoholic
  sedentary worker and factory worker.
  Disability Limitation: Through proper exercise physio and occupation
  therapy. Corrective, plastic surgery to improve mobility.
  Rehabilitation: - Mental and Physical makeup to become productive.
  Occupational therapy depending on the nature and extend of disability.
  Establishing independence and status in the society

-   Preventive medicine strategies are classified into the primary,
    secondary, tertiary and quaternary prevention levels. In addition,
    the term "primal prevention" has been used to describe all measures
    taken to ensure fetal well-being and prevent risk factors in any
    long-term health consequences.

  Summary of concept of Disease prevention

  Epidemiology has derived 4 concept of disease prevention.
