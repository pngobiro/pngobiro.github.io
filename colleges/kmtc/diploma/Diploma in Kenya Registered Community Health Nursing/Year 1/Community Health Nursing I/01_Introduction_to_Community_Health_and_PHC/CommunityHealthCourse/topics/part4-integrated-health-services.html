                        <p>In Kenya, it is your responsibility as a community health nurse to design school health programmes. In order to organise a practical school health programme you need to involve the rest of the health team members, the school administration and the community.</p>
                        <p>The following are members of the school health team:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Teachers</li>
                            <li>Pupils and students</li>
                            <li>Parents</li>
                            <li>Community formal and informal leaders</li>
                            <li>Community health nurse</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>To organise a good school health programme, you need to do the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess the problems of school children</li>
                            <li>Establish practical goals for the school population</li>

                            <li>Evaluate the process and results of the programs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The whole idea behind a school health programme, is to ensure that the needs of the school child are met.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Needs of the School Child</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>A Stable Home:</strong> The home should provide basic needs especially shelter and security.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proper Nutrition:</strong> The child needs to grow well physically and mentally. It is therefore important for the child to take adequate nutrition at least three times a day. The diet should have extra proteins and vitamins to meet there nutritional needs.

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Objectives of School Health</h3>
                        <p>The health programmes aim at:</p>

                            <li>Ensuring general community health by using the child as a channel for health messages to the family.</li>
                            <li>Improving the physical and social environment of the school.</li>
                            <li>Providing the following aspects of prevention of disease; Primary prevention, for example eating diets rich in vitamins A and C, iron and protein; Secondary prevention, that is, early diagnosis and treatment; Tertiary prevention which includes rehabilitation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">School Health Activities</h3>
                        <p>The following activities are undertaken to achieve the objectives of the school health programme:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Carrying out observation, screening, physical examination and epidemiological investigations.</li>
                            <li>Rendering emergency services and care of a continuing illness.</li>
                            <li>Counselling or arranging for counselling of pupils, teachers and other persons in the school population.</li>
                            <li>Involving parents, pupils and teachers in planning and conducting health care activities.</li>
                            <li>Contributing to the development of a curriculum in health related matters, through clubs such as, biology, mathematics, scout association, Red Cross, social clubs and home science.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Planning School Health Program</h3>
                        <p>The first step in organising a school health programme is to assess the health problems. One way of doing this is by conducting a survey.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Assessing Health Needs /Source of information</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The Clinic Records:</strong> Clinic records from the health care facility near the school. This will provide information about the health problems that are commonly seen among school children who attend the centre.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reports:</strong> Previous reports on school health services at the health centre and at the district level. These reports are given monthly and quarterly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health Team Workers:</strong> You can hold discussions with the health care teams in your catchment area, to find out health problems of school children and their possible solutions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Teachers, Students and Parents:</strong> Discussions with teachers, students and parents will yield useful information about their problems, and will also give you a chance to explain the importance of school health services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal Observations and Experiences:</strong> You can gather a lot of information merely by observing and listening to people, as you make contact and interact with them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Formal and Informal Leaders:</strong> Village leaders usually have a repertoire about the most disturbing health care problems, and can assist you to plan school health services.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once you gather the information regarding the health needs of school children in your catchment area, you then need to discuss your findings, and plan your programme with stakeholders from the Ministry of Health.</p>
                        <p>These include the:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>District medical officers of health</li>
                            <li>District public health nurse</li>
                            <li>Transport officers</li>
                            <li>District health administrative officer</li>
                            <li>District health education officer</li>
                            <li>District public health officer</li>
                            <li>District medical records officer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Implementing a school health programme requires quite a lot of resources. You will require funds for equipment, drugs, supplies, fuel and staff. You will also need cooperation from your team members. It is therefore very important for you to carefully identify each member of the team, and discuss with them their roles during the school health services.</p>
                        <p>During the planning phase you also need to consider the following supporting activities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Effective partnerships between teachers and health workers, and between the education and health sectors.</strong> The success of school health programmes demands an effective partnership between ministries of education and health, and teachers and health workers.</p>
                        <p>The health sector retains the responsibility for the health of children, but the education sector is responsible for implementing, and often funding the school based programmes. These sectors need to identify responsibilities and present a coordinated action, to improve health and learning outcomes from children.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pupil Awareness and Participation</strong></p>
                        <p>Children must be important participants in all aspects of school health programmes, and not simply the beneficiaries.</p>
                        <p>Children should participate in health policy development and implementation efforts, to create a safer and more sanitary environment.</p>
                        <p>Health promotion aimed at their parents, other children, community members is taught during school health services. Children in turn disseminate. This is an effective way to help young people and the community acquire the knowledge, attitudes, values and skills needed to adopt healthy lifestyles, and to support health and education for all.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Implementing School Health Services</h3>
                        <p>You should start by preparing a work plan together with members of your health facility team. Make sure you allow enough time, depending on the number of schools to be covered and their health needs.</p>
                        <p>You should also organise the resources you will need to perform the tasks at hand, so that you and your team can be punctual on the day of the service. Since some of the resources at your disposal will be teachers, pupils and community leaders, remember to promote teamwork during implementation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Activities during School Health</h4>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Home visits are an important part of your work as a community health nurse as they allow you to see families and their needs in their own homes.</p>
                        <p>Home visiting is one of the essential community health services that you should provide. It has two main purposes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It allows you to follow up individual families at home to find out why some health problems persist in the community despite efforts to prevent or control them, for example malnutrition, communicable diseases, or repeated failure to attend clinics, especially if the family is at risk.</li>
                            <li>It keeps you aware of what is going on in your catchment area.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In order for you to conduct home visiting successfully, you need to have the following skills:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Good communication skills and teaching ability</li>
                            <li>Good leadership skills and rational thinking to make sound judgments</li>
                            <li>Good counselling skills and an understanding of human relations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During home visits you act on your own, making decisions on the spot and carrying them out. You need to be prepared. When planning and implementing home visits, you should be guided by some basic principles in order to make a success of it.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Principles of Home Visiting</h3>
                        <p>Home visits should be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Planned and of benefit to the patient</li>
                            <li>Purposeful, clear and meet the patient‘s needs</li>

                            <li>Used to demonstrate principles of health</li>
                            <li>Convenient and acceptable to the patient</li>
                            <li>Respectful of the patient‘s right to refuse care</li>
                            <li>Recorded in the appropriate case file</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you follow these basic principles when planning your home visits, you will find your home visits fun and productive.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Process of Home Visiting</h3>
                        <p>The process of home visiting is carried out in five phases.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Entry or Initiation Phase:</strong> The community health nurse shares information with the patient on the reason and purposes for home visits. This interaction may occur in a hospital ward or at a clinic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pre-visit Activities:</strong> Before the actual home visit, you have to look for information regarding the patient and the family. You also need to gather information regarding the location of the house, distance from your health facility and the physical address. During pre-visit activities, you should investigate the community resources, assemble supplies and prepare for the first contact with the patient at their doorstep.</li>
                            <li><strong>Activities During Home Visiting:</strong> This is the working phase during which you put into action your planned health activities. During this phase you must establish trust and rapport with the patient and the family so that there can be a a positive interpersonal relationship (a professional nurse-patient relationship). This relationship will enhance the achievement of the mutually determined health-oriented goals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Termination Phase of Visit:</strong> This occurs when the health oriented goals have been met. Termination of home visits can occur due to any of the following reasons:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The patients’ health has been restored and the patient can function without the nurse</li>
                                    <li>The patient has changed their residence</li>
                                    <li>The community health nurse has transferred the patients’ care to another nurse or agency.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Post-visit Activities:</strong> Post-visit activities include recording and reporting important events of the home visits, and sharing the reports with the appropriate authorities and individuals about the patient family.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Advantages of Home Visiting</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Home visiting gives a more accurate assessment of the family structure and behaviour in their natural environment.</li>
                            <li>Home visits provide an opportunity to observe the physical environment of the home and identify barriers to, and resources for achieving family health.</li>
                            <li>At home, the nurse works with the patient first hand to implement health action using realistic resources.</li>
                            <li>By meeting the family on its home ground the nurse will be enhancing the family’s sense of control and active participation in meeting its health needs.</li>
                            <li>It provides an excellent opportunity to implement planned health care.</li>
                            <li>It provides an opportunity to learn about the home and family situation.</li>

                            <li>It creates a good understanding between the nurse and the patient and builds a good image of nurses.</li>
                            <li>It provides an opportunity to clarify the doubts and misconceptions raised by family members.</li>
                            <li>It provides an opportunity to observe and appreciate family practices and progress of care given by the nurse and others.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Disadvantages of Home Visiting</h3>
                        <p>The disadvantages of home visiting include the following:</p>

                            <li>Home visits consume a lot the nurse's time and energy as well as transport fuel (petrol or diesel) or bus fare.</li>
                            <li>Unforeseen events may occur during home visits, which will interfere with planned activities.</li>
                            <li>The patient’s family may not accept the nurse due to various factors such as cultural or religious differences, personal characteristics of the nurse and the patient or to some extent, socio-economic status of the nurse and the patient.</li>
                            <li>Confusion of the nurse’s role in a community where there may be a lack of knowledge and understanding of the role of the community health nurse.</li>
                        </ul>
