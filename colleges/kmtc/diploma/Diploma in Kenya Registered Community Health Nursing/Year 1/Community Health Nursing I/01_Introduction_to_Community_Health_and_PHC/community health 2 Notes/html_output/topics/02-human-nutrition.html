                        <p>Nutrition is the sum of all processes involved in how organisms obtain nutrients, metabolize them, and use them to support all of life's processes.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Includes food ingestion, food and nutrient digestion, nutrient metabolism and nutrient utilization by body cells and tissues to support growth, repair and maintenance of body tissue</li>
                            <li>Nourishment that sustains life</li>
                            <li>Its the sum of the processes involved in taking in food nutrients, assimilation and using them to maintain body tissue and provide energy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nutrients are compounds in foods that are needed by human body for energy to work, for growth of body tissue, for repair and maintenance of body tissues and also to support body's immune function all that works towards a healthy living. Basically nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chemical substances in food that are essential for energy, growth, normal functioning of the body, and maintenance of life.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therefore, Human Nutrition is the study of food in relation to health of individual and groups of people particularly the infants, adolescents, pregnant and lactating mothers(vulnerable groups) and functioning of the body organs and provide the energy the body requires.</p>

                            <li>A family of organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They are insoluble in water. The three main types of lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols</li>
                            <li>Lipids are found predominately in butter, oils, meats, dairy products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods</li>
                            <li>Fats may either be saturated or unsaturated according to the carbon and hydrogen atoms are arranged</li>
                            <li>Saturated fatty acids -all carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen atoms and cannot accept any more</li>
                            <li>These are mostly solid at room temperature</li>
                            <li>Examples- butyric acid - milk, butter; palmitic acid - animal fats; lauric acid - dairy foods, coconut oil; searic acid - beef fat</li>
                            <li>Unsaturated fatty acids-some of the carbon atoms are joined to others by a double bond and so are not completely saturated with hydrogen atoms. They can therefore accept more hydrogen atoms.</li>
                            <li>Monounsaturated fats have one double bond in the molecule e.g. Oleic acid found in most animal and plant fats and oils e.g. Olive oil</li>
                            <li>Poly unsaturated fats have more than one double bond in the molecule e.g. Linoleic acid both found mainly in vegetable oils</li>
                            <li>Unsaturated fatty acids may either be cis or trans depending on how the atoms are arranged at the double bonds. Cis are thought to be more better for us.</li>

                        <p>Anaemias can be classified in numerous ways,</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>some based on the cause of the disease</li>
                           <li>others based on the appearance of the red blood cells</li>
                           <li>Some anaemias are caused by congenital abnormalities or inherited characteristics; such anaemias, which include sickle cell diseas</li>
                           <li>Based on the characteristics of the blood cells or other features, such as
                              <ul>
                                 <li>microcytic (having small red blood cells),</li>

                                 <li>haemolytic (having many ruptured red blood cells)</li>

                           <li>Macrocytic anaemias are often caused by folate or vitamin B12 deficiencies.</li>
                           <li>In anaemia the blood has less haemoglobin than normal.</li>
                           <li>Does not necessarily occur due to lack of iron in the diet</li>
                           <li>Diet could be rich of iron but factors that inhibit absorption could be present</li>
                           <li>Other forms of iron are more absorbable than others</li>
                           <li>Iron could be lost due to hookworm infection, bleeding ulcers etc.</li>

                           <li>During pregnancy there is an increase in the weight of the woman and the basal metabolic rate also increases.</li>
                           <li>Hence the increase requires extra food to provide extra energy, proteins and other nutrients</li>
                           <li>Anaemia is common among pregnant women hence need to give iron supplements routinely to expectant mothers in form of ferrous sulphate. Ferrous one of the vitamin B is also required for making red blood cells is also given together with iron.</li>
                           <li>Vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy is bad for the baby hence multivitamin tablets should be given during pregnancy and encourage pregnant women to eat foods rich in Vitamin A.</li>
