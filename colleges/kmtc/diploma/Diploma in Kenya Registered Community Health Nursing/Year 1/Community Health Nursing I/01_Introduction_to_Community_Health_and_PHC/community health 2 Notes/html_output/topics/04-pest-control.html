                            <li>Insects and pests can cause a great deal of damage to objects. Damage may be caused by the insects or pests eating materials, marking them by leaving droppings and regurgitated matter, boring into organic matter, making nests and so on.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pest control:</strong> implies a two-strand approach, which combines the use of technology (such as use of pesticides, and pesticide application equipment) with biological knowledge (informing where, when and how to apply the technology) to reduce pest impact (by killing the pest).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Pest management:</strong> - aims to reduce pest impact and injury levels to a tolerable level through multiple tactics, which are not solely dependent on killing the pest.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>While Pest control seeks to eliminate a pest organism from an area by a single - often chemical control - strategy, pest management seeks to utilize various strategies in a sustainable manner to suppress the population of the pest below the impact level.</li>

                        <p><strong>Pest:</strong> any unwanted and destructive insect or other animal that attacks food or crops or livestock, etc.<br>
                        - Pest is an organism (virus, bacteria, fungus, plant or animal) that injures or spreads disease to humans, domestic animals or plants of aesthetic or economic value, or damages structures and products of economic value.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vector:</strong> is any agent (person, animal microorganism) that carries and transmits a disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vermin:</strong> any of various small animals or insects that are pests e.g. cockroaches, rats</p>
                        <p><strong>Vector control</strong> is any method to limit or eradicate the mammals, birds, insects or other arthropods (here collectively called "vectors") which transmit disease pathogens. The most frequent type of vector control is mosquito control using a variety of strategies. Several of the "neglected tropical diseases" are spread by such vectors.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pesticide:</strong> A substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating pests, or intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant.</p>
                        <p><strong>Insecticides:</strong> are substances or an agent that kill insects or other arthropods.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rodents:</strong> Comprise a great number of mammals, ranging in size from the rats and mice to as large as the Porcupines and which belong to the order rodentia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Insect:</strong> is an arthropod with 3 pairs of legs. It belongs to the phylum arthropoda and the class insecta.<br>
                        - Any of a group of small and often winged animals that are arthropods having six jointed legs and a body formed of a head, thorax, and abdomen. Flies, bees, and lice are true insects</p>

                                <ul><li>Early days cats were being used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. In 1939/40 a survey discovered that cats could keep a farm's population of rats down to a low level, but could not eliminate them completely.</li><li>However, if the rats were cleared by trapping or poisoning, farm cats could stop them returning.</li></ul>

                            <li><strong>Biological pest control.</strong>
                                <ul><li>Involves the control and management of natural predators and parasites. For example: mosquitoes are often controlled by putting a bacterium that infects and kills mosquito larvae, in local water sources.</li><li>The point of biological pest control, or any natural pest control, is to eliminate a pest with minimal harm to the ecological balance of the environment in its present form.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Mechanical pest control.</strong>
                                <ul><li>This is the use of hands-on techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between human beings and insects, like nets.</li></ul>

                            <li><strong>Physical pest control.</strong>
                                <ul><li>This is a method of getting rid of insects and small rodents by removing, attacking, setting up barriers that will prevent further insect infestations to become visual.</li></ul>

                            <li><strong>Elimination of breeding grounds.</strong>
                                <ul><li>Proper waste management and drainage of still water, eliminates the breeding ground of many pests.</li><li>Garbage provides food and shelter for many unwanted organisms, as well as an area where still water might collect and be used as a breeding ground by mosquitoes.</li><li>Communities that have proper garbage collection and disposal, have far less of a problem with rats, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies and other pests than those that don't.</li></ul>

                                <ul><li>This is a common method for controlling rat populations, however is not as effective when there are other food sources around, such as garbage.</li><li>Poisoned meats have been used for centuries for killing off wolves, birds that were seen to threaten crops, and against other creatures.</li><li>This can be a problem, since a carcass which has been poisoned will kill not only the targeted animal, but also every other animal which feeds on the carcass.</li></ul>

                            <li><strong>Hunting.</strong>
                                <ul><li>In some nations, teams of rat-catchers work at chasing rats from the field, and killing them with dogs and simple hand tools. Some communities have in the past employed a bounty system, where a town clerk will pay a set fee for every rat head brought in as proof of a rat killing.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Traps.</strong>
                                <ul><li>Unlike trap crops, most traps used to control pests are man-made, and used by rat catchers.</li><li>A variety of mouse traps and rat traps are available for mice and rats, including snap traps, glue traps and live catch traps.</li><li>Sticky traps are used to attract the pest.</li></ul>

                            <li><strong>Space fumigation.</strong>
                                <ul><li>A project that involves a structure be covered or sealed airtight followed by the introduction of a penetrating, deadly gas at a killing concentration a long period of time (24-72hrs.). Although expensive, space fumigation targets all life stages of pests.</li></ul>

                                <ul><li>Research into sterilization bait is ongoing. The sterilization method doesn't poison the rats or humans. The product ContraPest was approved for the sterilization of rodents by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in August 2016.</li></ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vector Control.</h3>
                        <p>Vector control is any method to limit or eradicate the mammals, birds, insects or other arthropods (here collectively called "vectors") which transmit disease pathogens. The most frequent type of vector control is mosquito control using a variety of strategies. Several of the "neglected tropical diseases" are spread by such vectors.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Methods of Vector Control.</h4>
                        <p>Vector control focuses on utilizing preventative methods to control or eliminate vector populations. Common preventative measures include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Habitat / Environmental Control.</strong>
                                <ul><li>Removing or reducing areas where vectors can easily breed helps to limit population growth. For example, stagnant water removal, destruction of old tires and cans which serve as mosquito breeding environments and good management of used water can reduce areas of excessive vector incidence.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Reducing Contact.</strong>
                                <ul><li>Limiting exposure to insects or animals that are known disease vectors can reduce infection risks significantly. For example, bed nets, window screens on homes, or protective clothing can help reduce the likelihood contact with vectors. To be effective this requires education and promotion of methods among the population to raise the awareness of vector threats.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Chemical Control.</strong>
                                <ul><li>Insecticides, larvicides, rodenticides, traps and repellents can be used to control vectors. For example, larvicides can be used in mosquito breeding zones; insecticides can be applied to house walls or bed nets, and use of personal repellents can reduce incidence of insect bites and thus infection. The use of pesticides for vector control is promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and has proven to be highly effective.</li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Biological Control.</strong>
                                <ul><li>The use of natural vector predators, such as bacterial toxins or botanical compounds, can help control vector populations. Using fish that eat mosquito larvae or reducing breeding rates by introducing sterilized male tsetse flies have been shown to control vector populations and reduce infection risks.</li></ul>

                            <li>Some disasters give rise to increases in the populations of vector species, usually insects or rodents.</li>
                            <li>Floods may create new mosquito breeding sites in disaster rubble and stagnant pools.</li>
                            <li>A general breakdown of sanitation may favour the multiplication of houseflies and rodents.</li>
                            <li>People living in partially destroyed houses or primitive shelters may have lost the normal protection afforded by screened windows or mosquito nets.</li>
                            <li>Serious infection hazards may arise when massive migrations bring people of different origins together in temporary camps infested with disease vectors. Under such conditions, people who are relatively immune carriers of parasites can set off a disease transmission cycle to which weaker people who are not immune fall victim.</li>
                            <li>Fly control is likely to have a positive impact on health in most post disaster situations, particularly when sanitary conditions are poor and diarrhoea, dysentery, or typhoid prevalence are high.</li>
                            <li>Other vectors may be important in specific locations, depending on the prevalence of the vector and the disease before the disaster, and the susceptibility of the population.</li>
                            <li>Standing water rich in organic matter can produce massive numbers of biting midges which do not transmit any disease, but cause extreme nuisance and often trigger allergic reactions in sensitive people. Several mosquito species can also be a great nuisance without presenting a direct risk to health.</li>
                            <li>Some of the most serious disease vectors are hardly considered a nuisance in many areas as their bites are almost painless (e.g. Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors of malaria).</li>
                            <li>When wild or domestic host animals have been killed or driven away by disaster, ectoparasites, such as ticks, bugs, lice and fleas, may invade a community and produce a serious additional risk of zoonotic vector-borne disease.</li>
                            <li>Another, related, vector-borne disease risk may arise when refugees enter territory formerly occupied only by wildlife and accompanying parasites. Examples of diseases that may then emerge include plague (from rats) and Lyme disease (from ticks)</li>
