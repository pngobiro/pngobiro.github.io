                        <p>Storage will depend on the type and packaging of the food.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dry staples:</strong> Dry staples are the base necessities of your food storage. These consist of things like flour, sugar, rice, beans, coffee, pancake mix, or even instant potato flakes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Freeze dried:</strong> Freeze dried rations are prepared by freezing the food, placing it in a vacuum chamber, and then drying off any excess moisture. They are often sold in nitrogen sealed cans</li>
                            <li><strong>Dehydrated:</strong> Dehydrated food shares many of the same characteristics as freeze dried, and is lightweight and long lasting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Canned:</strong> Canned food is a durable and cheap type of storage. Canned foods are not only the most readily available, but they are easy to use and rotate out, and they often require no water, heat, or preparation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Food Handling.</strong> Any aspect of the operations in the preparation, transport, storage, packaging, wrapping, exposure for sale, service, or delivery of food.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A safe handling practice refers to the handling guidelines and accessing processes of food product in order to prevent and rescue them from all the unwanted and unhealthy factors. These practices and actions can minimize risk from potential hazards and will enhance the quality and productivity of food.</li>
                            <li>Proper food handling, storage, and heating is the mainstay in preventing food poisoning.</li>
                            <li>Four issues / steps to keep food safe:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Clean</strong> — Wash hands and surfaces often.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Separate</strong> - Don't cross-contaminate.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Cook</strong> - Cook to the right temperature.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Chill</strong> — Refrigerate promptly.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>Spoilage is the process in which food deteriorates to the point in which it is not edible to humans or its quality of edibility becomes reduced. OR</li>
                            <li>Means the original nutritional value, texture, flavour of the food are damaged, the food become harmful to people and unsuitable to eat. OR</li>
                            <li>Food spoilage is a change in a food that makes it unfit or undesirable for consumption.</li>
                            <li>Food spoilage occurs when a contaminant or naturally occurring enzymes cause the food to deteriorate or change in undesirable ways.</li>
                            <li>Various external forces are responsible for the spoilage of food</li>
                            <li>For instance, fruits are often contaminated with yeasts because yeasts ferment the carbohydrates in fruits.</li>
                            <li>Most of the time, food is described as spoiled when its appearance, texture, flavor, or odor has changed</li>
                            <li>Food that is capable of spoiling is referred to as perishable food.</li>
                            <li>Artificial contamination occurs when food is handled or processed, such as when fecal bacteria enter food through improper handling procedures.</li>
                            <li>Natural contamination occurs when microorganisms attach themselves to foods while the foods are in their growing stages</li>

                            <li><strong>Microbial Spoilage:</strong> Three types of microorganisms that cause food spoilage are yeasts, moulds and bacteria.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enzymic and Chemical Spoilage:</strong> Also referred to as autolysis. Autolysis is self-digestion emanating from factors within the food tissues themselves.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>These factors are mainly enzymes and chemical compounds.</li>
                                    <li>Enzymes are proteins found in all plants and animals.</li>
                                    <li>Examples of such spoilage are:

                        <p><strong>Food - poisoning</strong> is an acute gastro-enteritis caused by the ingestion of the food or drink contaminated with either living bacteria or their toxins or inorganic chemical substances and poison delivered from the plant and animals</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Potato</strong> -a potato turned into green becomes a toxic food that can kill. Well, apparently potatoes contain a poisonous alkaloid named solanine which leads to headache, fatigue, nausea and stomach problems if consumed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Almonds</strong> - Also known as bitter almonds, raw almonds contain major portions of hydrogen cyanide, which makes it a toxic food that can kill.</li>
                            <li><strong>Apple and Stone Fruit Seeds</strong> - Apples and other stone fruits including cherries, plums, peaches and apricots have seeds that contain amygdalin, a substance which transforms into hydrogen cyanide when consumed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rhubarb</strong> - Most of the times, we consume Rhubarb in the form of jams, drinks and pies. However, what brings it into the category of deadly foods we eat is a chemical compound oxalate present in the plant. If consumed, oxalate may lead to illness or death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tomato:</strong> Leaves, stem or green fruits in tomato plants contain a poisonous chemical named glycoalkaloid which leads to extreme nervousness and stomach infections.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lima Beans:</strong> contain a good amount of cyanide that diminishes only after cooking.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nutmeg:</strong> is hallucinogenic. It can incur many discomforting symptoms which include vomiting, headache and hallucinations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tuna:</strong> What brings tuna into the category of foods not to eat is the mercury that fish absorbs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cassava:</strong> tapioca, Cassava contains high levels of cyanide which is a lethal compound to consume. Two cassava roots turns into a fatal dose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ackee:</strong> It is unsafe to consume unripe Ackee as it contains hypoglycin, which in turn leads to severe vomiting, coma or death</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>PASTEURIZATION</strong> - It is the process of heating liquids to a particular temperature for given time to destroy disease-producing bacteria as well as yeasts, molds, viruses, and less harmful bacteria.</li>
                            <li><strong>Homogenization</strong> - is the process by which whole pasteurized milk is treated so that the fat globules are decreased in size to the extent that there is no separation of fat from the milk serum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fortification</strong> - milk is fortified to increase its nutritional value or to replace nutrients lost during processing. Vitamin A and D is added to the most milk. The purpose of homogenisation is to disintegrate or finely distribute the fat globules in the milk in order to reduce creaming.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Stassanisation</strong> - This is a method of treating milk by heat which was introduced by Dr. STASSANO of Strasbourg</li>
                            <li><strong>Irradiation</strong> - is the process by which an milk is exposed to radiation.</li>
                            <li>Sterilization</li>
                            <li>Boiling</li>
