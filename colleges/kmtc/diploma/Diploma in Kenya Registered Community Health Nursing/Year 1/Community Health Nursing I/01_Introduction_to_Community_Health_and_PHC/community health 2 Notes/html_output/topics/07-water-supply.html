                            <li>Pure water should be, odourless, colourless, tasteless, and neutral ( PH7).</li>
                            <li>Water freezes at OC or 320 F and boils at 100 C or 212 F.</li>
                            <li>Density of water is I gm/cc at 40 c ( max density)</li>
                            <li>Water is the greatest solvent known to science and due to this, it is never found pure in nature.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Temperature</strong> - the higher the temperature of water the more it dissolves.</li>
                                    <li><strong>softness</strong> - the softer water is, the more soluble it becomes.</li>

                            <li>As water passes through the atmosphere, it absorbs CO2, forming carbonic acid which increases the solubility and enables water to dissolve lime and magnesium to form bicarbonates. Referred to as hard water.</li>
                            <li>Water is found in three forms in nature.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Solid - when frozen</li>

                            <li><strong>Taste and odour:</strong> Should be odourless and tasteless. But due to fact that, it dissolves impurities, organic in nature e.g. phenols and chloraphenols it may not be so.</li>
                            <li><strong>Colour:</strong> Even pure water is not colorless. It has a pale green - blue tint in large volumes. It is necessary to differentiate between true color due to material in solution and apparent color due to the suspended matter.</li>
                            <li><strong>Turbidity</strong> - the presence of colloidal solids gives water cloud appearance which aesthetically unattractive and may be harmful.</li>
                            <li><strong>Solids</strong> - these may be present in suspension or dissolved.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electrical conductivity</strong> - the conductivity of solutions depends with TDS.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>PH:</strong> this measures the hydrogen ion concentration in water. Ranges in scale of 0-14 with 7 being neutral.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hardness:</strong> this is the property of water being unable to form lather easily with soap and produces scale in hot water system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oxygen demand (OD):</strong> organic compounds are generally unstable and may be oxidised biologically or chemically to stable ,inert end product eg CO2, NO3, H2O.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dissolved oxygen</strong> - this is most important element in water quality control. Its presence is essential to maintain the higher forms of biological life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biological oxygen Demand</strong> - this is the amount of water required by micro organisms to break down ( oxidize ) organic matter in given sample of water.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemical oxygen demand</strong> - sometimes chemical oxidizing agents are added to samples in attempt to oxidize chemically the material contained in the sample.</li>
                            <li><strong>Total organic carbon (TOC)</strong> - this is equivalent to the total organic matter contend in water.</li>
                            <li><strong>Total oxygen demand</strong> - this is amount of oxygen required to oxidize fully a sample of water.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nitrogen</strong> - it has to be present for biological treatment of water to proceed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chlorides</strong> - they make water blackish and are an indication of sewage pollution because of the chloride content of urine.</li>

                            <li>Filtration is any of various mechanical, physical or biological operations that separates solids from fluids by adding a medium through which only the fluid can pass.</li>
                            <li>Can be done on small scale & large scale</li>
                            <li>Small scale -water filters can be used at home</li>
                            <li>In a large scale, sand filters are used</li>

                        <p><strong>Water sampling,</strong> the process of taking a portion of water for analysis or other testing</p>
                        <p><strong>Water testing</strong> is a broad description for various procedures used to analyze water quality.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used for large scale supplies of water</li>
                            <li>Mainly 2 methods
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Bacteriological analysis</li>
                                    <li>Chemical analysis</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Bacteriological water analysis is a method of analysing water to estimate the numbers of bacteria present and, if needed, to find out what sort of bacteria they are</li>
                            <li>Water sample collected in 500 ml flask</li>
                            <li>Must be kept cold(4 C to 10 C )</li>
                            <li>Must be analysed in 30 minutes</li>
                            <li>Mainly done to detect E. Coli</li>
                            <li>Presence of E. Coli in large amounts indicates contamination by excreta</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Chemical analysis:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Water chemistry analyses are carried out to identify and quantify the chemical components and properties of water samples</li>
                            <li>5 litres collected in a clean container</li>
                            <li>Water tested for various substances</li>
                            <li>Including
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Ammonia</li>
                                    <li>Softness & or hardness of water</li>
                                    <li>Examination for cyanide & pesticides normally done within 24 hours</li>
                                </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pollution types (water)</h3>
                        <p>These include point and non- point source</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Point source</strong> - from recognizable point e.g. effluent from industries</li>
                            <li><strong>Non point source</strong> - pollutants diffusing to water sources from unidentified sources. E.g. agricultural sources.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Some water pollutants</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Heavy metals</strong> - include lead, cadmium, manganese, copper, mercury etc. they have a tendency of being deposited on the surface of some soft and bone tissues and organs such as liver, kidney, lings etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Persistent organic pollutants</strong> - including poly - chloro biphenyls ( PCBs) and organic pesticides such as chlorinated hydrocarbons e.g. dieldrins, DDT. They are cumulative in nature and can be passed from herbivores to secondary consumers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pathogens</strong> - biological pollutants e.g. E-coli counts exceeding WHO ranges. Others include streptococci, pseudomonas etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decomposable organic matter</strong> - food remains and food processing effluents, rich in carbohydrates, as they decompose, they use dissolved oxygen from the water, causing a deficit in for the aquatic organisms hence creating oxygen demand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Thermal pollutants</strong> - introduction to hot or cold effluents into a system causes changes in composition of aquatic organisms hence mesophils dominating.</li>
                            <li><strong>Suspended matters</strong> - clay silt from soil erosion cause turbidity, reduce depth of sunlight penetration and thus affect photosynthesis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acids and bases</strong> - change the PH of the water body, thereby shifting the species composition within the system.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oil pollution</strong> - block the air - water interaction hence interfering with gaseous exchange, reducing the amount of dissolved oxygen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nutrients</strong> - includes nitrates and phosphates which cause eutrophia.</li>
                            <li><strong>helminthes/ worms</strong> - the infective stages of many parasitic roundworms and flat worms can be transmitted to man through drinking water.</li>
