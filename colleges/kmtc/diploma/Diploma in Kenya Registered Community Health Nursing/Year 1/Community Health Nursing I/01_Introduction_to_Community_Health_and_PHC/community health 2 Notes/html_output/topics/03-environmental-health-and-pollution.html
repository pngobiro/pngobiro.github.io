                            <li>It influences vectors, humans and plants serving as reservoirs of infection. It is the interaction of the agent, the host and the environment which determines whether or not a disease develops, and this can be illustrated using the epidemiologic triangle.</li>
                            <li>The epidemiologic triangle depicts the relationship among three key factors in the occurrence of disease or injury - agent, environment and host.</li>
                            <li>An agent is a factor whose presence or absence, excess or deficit is necessary for a particular disease to occur. The agents comprises of the disease causing organisms like bacteria, viruses, parasites, protozoa, fungi etc.</li>
                            <li>Plants provide vegetables, fruits, tubers and seeds as food. Trees act as windbreakers, provide firewood, charcoal, timber and paper among others. They also influence weather patterns.</li>
                            <li>Human beings (people) and their activities can be a big source of infection. For example, overcrowding and slum settlements brought about by urbanisation, can promote the transmission of diseases, especially those diseases that are spread through droplets and contact.</li>
                            <li>Animals: Domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats and poultry provide meat, milk and eggs for consumption. Cats and dogs are kept as pets, but they can also transmit diseases such as cat scratch fever and rabies, respectively. Other hazards include snakebites, which can be fatal and insect bites, which may act as vectors of various diseases.</li>

                            <li>Some development projects may make the environment healthier, while others make it a suitable habitat for diseases.</li>
                            <li>The government involves political influences into development policies.</li>
                            <li>The government develops policies, which enforce environmental health. It also plays a great part in influencing the implementation of health activities. Political instability causes unrest, insecurity and psychological problems. Management of disease outbreaks may be lacking as health facilities may be destroyed.</li>

                            <li>Less developed countries - Early stages of industrialization, growing domestic market, mature product markets, increasing competitive threat.</li>
                            <li>Developing countries - Decrease in percentage of agricultural workers, industrialization, rising wages, high literacy rates, lower wage rates than developed countries, formidable competitors.</li>
                            <li>Industrialized countries - Moving towards post industrialization, high standard of living.</li>
                            <li>Advanced countries - Post industrialization, information processors, knowledge based, less machine based. Product opportunities are in new products, innovations and raw materials plus fresh foods.</li>

                        <p>(How technological environment is affecting health positively and negatively)</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Technology can have a large impact on users' mental and physical health.</li>
                            <li>Being overly connected can cause psychological issues such as distraction, narcissism, expectation of instant gratification, and even depression.</li>
                            <li>Besides affecting users' mental health, use of technology can also have negative repercussions on physical health causing vision problems, hearing loss, and neck strain. Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to help alleviate these health issues.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Technology and psychological issues</h4>
                        <p>Digital technology can be harmful to your health.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Digital eyestrain.</strong> - When we gaze at a screen for long periods of time, we often forget to blink. In fact, research has shown we blink 10 times less than usual, which means the tears that protect our eyes evaporate without being replaced. Additionally, reading the smaller fonts on a smartphone or other portable device can intensify the strain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sleep disorders.</strong> - We love our devices so much that many of us even sleep with them. It might seem like a harmless habit, but late-night technology use can interfere with your ability to sleep. "Artificial light exposure between dusk and the time we go to bed at night suppresses release of the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, enhances alertness and shifts circadian rhythms to a later hour, making it more difficult to fall asleep. To avoid sleep disruption, try replacing late-night technology use with sleep-conducive activities such as taking a bath or reading.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical inactivity</strong> - When we're using technology, we generally aren't exercising. That's why there's an increasing body of research linking overuse of digital devices to a drop in exercise and fitness levels.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neck and back problems</strong> - According to research, smartphones are responsible for the rise in the number of young people with back and neck problems, as the amount of time spent leaning over small phone screens can put spinal discs under pressure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tunes tinnitus.</strong> - Unfortunately, most hearing loss or tinnitus caused by noise exposure is permanent. Listening to any sound at a high volume, more than 89 decibels for more than five hours a week can damage hearing permanently over time. Listening to music at a loud volume is a common risk factor yet research has found that 39 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds listen to their favourite tunes at a dangerously loud volume.</li>
                            <li><strong>E-mentia.</strong> - Our ability to read a map and even remember phone numbers faces extinction due to our reliance on modern technology. Overreliance on computer aids of all kinds may rob our brains of the stimulation they need to stay healthy. Research suggests that people who don't regularly challenge themselves intellectually through work or learning are more likely to suffer from dementia (insanity) in later life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Laptop laziness.</strong> - While fitness trackers and running apps can encourage exercise, the chances are that modern technology is only contributing to your sedentary lifestyle. Gaming, online shopping and mindless eating in front of laptops and tablets mean that you're probably moving about less. Studies shows that physical inactivity causes twice as many deaths as obesity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Screen strain.</strong> - We spend nearly 50 hours a week looking at computer screens, according to research conducted by the College of Optometrists. But prolonged use can result in what has been dubbed "computer vision syndrome", with symptoms including eye strain, double vision and temporary shortsightedness.</li>

                                    <li>Examples: more buildings, road system, drought, more rain, factories, physical insecurity, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Factors that can affects air, water, soil, housing, climate, geography, heat, light, noise, debris, radiation, etc.</li>

                            <li><strong>Social Environmental Factors</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Factors in the social environment that are important to health include those related to safety, violence, and social disorder in general, and more specific factors related to the type, quality, and stability of social connections.</li>
                                    <li>Social participation and integration in the immediate social environment (e.g., school, work, neighborhood) appear to be important to both mental and physical health</li>
                                    <li>This including social participation, social cohesion, social capital, and the collective efficacy of the neighborhood, environment Social participation and integration in the immediate social environment (e.g., school, work, neighbourhood).These appears to be important to both mental and physical health.</li>
                                    <li>Example: increase in the availability of professional expertise in different occupations; women present in every sector of the government, appreciation and enjoyment once again of music and the arts. People are exposed to more of what's going on through TV and mobile communications</li>
                                    <li>Can include: cultural values, customs, beliefs, habits, attitudes, morals, religion, education, lifestyles, community life, health services, social and political organization.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Biological factors are microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi and microscopic parasites), cell cultures, human endoparasites and components from microorganisms that can cause damage to health in humans.</li>
                                    <li>Factors that affect man, microbial agents, insects, rodents, animals and plants, etc.</li>
                                    <li>Organic objects such as timber, paper, textiles, bone in response to relative humidity (RH) is an indication of how much water vapour is in the air at a particular temperature.</li>
                                    <li>Ideally the RH reading should be between 40-60%. High RH (above 65%) can encourage the growth of moulds and other fungi, cause swelling of moisture-absorbent materials and corrosion in metals, whereas low RH (below 40%) can lead to some organic materials drying out and becoming brittle.</li>
                                    <li>Examples: growth of fungi, moulds, etc.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The environment is composed of four basic components:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Atmosphere.</li>
                            <li>Hydrosphere.</li>
                            <li>Lithosphere.</li>
                            <li>Biosphere.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There is a continuous interaction among the various components of the environment and ultimately, it is the biosphere that gets influenced by the other components.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The atmosphere consists of a blanket of gases, suspended liquids and solids that envelope the earth. The atmosphere is basically derived from the earth itself by various chemical and biochemical reactions. The major components of the atmosphere include the gases nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, water vapour and suspended particulates (dust, soot). The composition of the atmosphere depends on time and space, and is highly variable. A litre of air weights around 1.3 g . The atmosphere is vertically divided into four layers - troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere. This division is mainly based on the increase in the temperature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hydrosphere:</strong> The hydrosphere primarily consists of the water on the earth's surface. Thus, the hydrosphere includes oceans, seas, rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs and polar ice caps. Water is the most abundant substance on the earth's surface, which may be present as ice, liquid and vapour. The actual water available for human consumption is around 1% of the total earth's water. This includes the ground water, water from lakes and rivers and soil moisture. Human uses water in the homes, industries, agriculture and recreation. There is a continuous decrease in the consumable global water. Therefore, there is a need for precious use of water, and its conservation</li>
                            <li><strong>Lithosphere:</strong> The outer boundary layer of the solid earth on which the continents and the ocean basins rest constitutes the lithosphere. In a broad sense, lithosphere includes the land mass and the ocean floor. However, in a general usage, the term lithosphere refers to the land surface which is approximately 3/10th of the total surface of the earth. The soil is the most important part of the lithosphere because it contains the organic matter and supports growth of plants and microorganisms. Lithosphere is involved in the production of food for human and animals, besides the decomposition of organic wastes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biosphere:</strong> The biosphere comprises of all the zones on earth in which life is present. Biosphere is spread over the lower part of the atmosphere, the top of the lithosphere and the entire hydrosphere. In other words, the broad spectrum of bio resources of the earth, supporting life constitutes the biosphere. The biosphere provides the essential requisites (water, light, heat, air, food, space etc.) for the existence of life. The biosphere is very vast, and for the sake of understanding, it is divided into smaller units namely ecosystems. An ecosystem may be considered as the smallest unit of biosphere that possesses the requisite characteristics to sustain life e.g., ponds, seas, deserts, cities.</li>

                            <li>This is the introduction of contaminants into the environment in such amount and duration that affect health or adverse change.</li>
                            <li>Can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light.</li>
                            <li><strong>Environmental pollution:</strong> The introduction of different harmful pollutants into certain environment that make the environment unhealthy to live in.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pollutants:</strong> These are the components of pollution. They can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.</li>
                            <li>Is a waste material that pollutes air, water or soil.</li>
                            <li><strong>Contaminants:</strong> Biological, chemical, physical, or radiological substance (normally absent in the environment) which, in sufficient concentration, can adversely affect living organisms through air, water, soil, and/or food.</li>
                            <li>Pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Point source Pollution</strong> - any single identifiable source of pollution from which pollutants are discharged, such as a pipe, ditch, ship or factory smokestack.</li>
                            <li>Factories and sewage treatment plants are two common types of point sources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Non point source (NPS) pollution</strong> - this is pollution caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground.</li>
                            <li>As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters, and even our underground sources of drinking water.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nature of Pollutants:</h3>
                        <p>The pollutants that occur in the environment may be chemical, biological and physical in their nature.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Chemical pollutants:</strong> Gaseous pollutants (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide), toxic metals, pesticides, herbicides, hydrocarbons, toxins, acidic substances, carcinogens.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biological pollutants:</strong> Pathogenic organisms, products of biological origin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical pollutants:</strong> Heat (thermal), sound, odours, radiation and radioactive substances.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>NB: Three factors that determine the severity of a pollutant:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Its chemical nature,</li>
                            <li>The concentration.</li>
                            <li>The persistence.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of pollutants:</h3>
                        <p>Ecologically, pollutants can be divided into three types</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Degradable or non - persistent pollutants</li>
                            <li>Slowly degradable or persistent pollutants</li>
                            <li>Non - degradable pollutants.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Degradable or non - persistent pollutants:</strong> Pollutants that can be rapidly decomposed by natural processes. Example - domestic sewage, discarded vegetable.</p>
                        <p><strong>Slowly degradable pollutants:</strong> Pollutants that remain in environment for longer time because they decompose very slowly by the natural processes. Example: plastics, pesticides, etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-degradable pollutants:</strong> Pollutants that cannot be decomposed by natural processes. Example - Lead, mercury, nuclear wastes etc.</p>
                        <p>Pollutants can also be broadly classified into two categories particulate and gaseous. Particulate pollutants (such as dust, dirt and fluff) can form an unsightly surface film and encourage fungal growth and insect attack. Gaseous pollutants include many of the woods, glues, paints and other materials often used in the construction of buildings, cases, frames and in the objects themselves.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE CONCEPT OF POLLUTION.</h3>
                        <p>The concept of environmental pollution is any change in the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of the air, water, or soil that can affect the health, survival or activities of humans or other forms of life in an undesirable way.</p>
                        <p><strong>Terms:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Biodegradable</strong> - to break down some types of pollution to acceptable forms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acute</strong> - occurs shortly after exposure, such as a burn, illness or death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic</strong>- a condition that lasts a long time and takes a long time to appear.</li>
                            <li><strong>Synergistic</strong>- pollutants, acting together, produce a harmful effect greater than the sum of their individual effects. (e.g. asbestos workers who smoke).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sources of Pollution:</h3>
                        <p>Environmental pollution is mostly due to direct or indirect human activities, arising out of the built-world created by him. There are six major sources of environmental pollution:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Industrial sources</li>
                            <li>Agricultural sources</li>
                            <li><strong>Biogenic sources:</strong> Produced or brought about by living organisms. Emissions from natural sources, such as plants and trees. Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) from vegetation for natural areas, crops, and urban vegetation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anthropogenic sources:</strong> Resulting from human activities. Emissions that are produced as a result of human activities. e.g. transportation, fuel combustion</li>
                            <li><strong>Unnatural sources:</strong> Not made or caused by humankind. Such unnatural ingredients may be gases (causing air pollution), solids / liquids (causing water, food and land pollution) or sound (causing sound pollution).</li>
                            <li><strong>Extra-terrestrial sources:</strong> Refers to natural objects now on Earth that originated in outer space. Such materials include cosmic dust and meteorites, as well as samples brought to Earth by sample return missions from the Moon, asteroids and comets, as well as solar wind particles.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">GENERAL EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Acidification:</strong> Chemical reactions involving air pollutants can create acidic compounds which can cause harm to vegetation and buildings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eutrophication:</strong> Rain can carry and deposit the Nitrogen in some pollutants on rivers and soils. This will adversely affect the nutrients in the soil and water bodies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ground-level Ozone:</strong> Chemical reactions involving air pollutants create a poisonous gas ozone (O3). Gas Ozone can affect people's health and can damage vegetation types and some animal life too.</li>
                            <li><strong>Particulate Matter:</strong> Air pollutants can be in the form of particulate matter which can be very harmful to our health. Short-term effects include irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, and upper respiratory infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Others include headaches, nausea, and allergic reactions. Long-term health effects can include chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys.</li>
                            <li><strong>Economic Effects:</strong> Damage to properties, equipment's and facilities. Affects zinc coatings. Steel corrodes 2-3times faster. Paints pigments are destroyed. Building materials, surfaces and arts works corrodes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Effects on plants:</strong> Plants could be used as good indicators of air pollution since they are very sensitive. Sulphur dioxide, hydrogen sulphide, harm plants. Crops and vegetations are affected.</li>
                            <li><strong>EFFECTS ON ANIMALS:</strong> Lead and arsenic affects sheep and cattle. Flouride may lead skeletal flourisis to animals</li>
                            <li><strong>Aesthetic and Climatic effects:</strong> Smog and dusts cause reduced visibility causing accidents. Carbon dioxide causes the green house effects by forming a blanket in the atmosphere, thus reducing radiation and causing increase in temperature resulting to global warming which affects ecosystems in many ways.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Global Pollution Concerns:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Global Warming:</strong> Climate changes like global warming is the result of human practices like emission of Greenhouse gases. Global warming leads to rising temperatures of the oceans and the earth' surface causing melting of polar ice caps, rise in sea levels and also unnatural patterns of precipitation such as flash floods, excessive snow or desertification.
                                <p>We must help fight Global Warming by doing the following steps:-</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Plant more trees.</li>
                                    <li>Don't waste water.</li>
                                    <li>Use cloth bag and don't burn plastic.</li>
                                    <li>Observe environmental pollution problems and control measures.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Natural Resource Depletion:</strong> Fossil fuel consumption results in emission of Greenhouse gases, which is responsible for global warming and climate change. Globally, people are taking efforts to shift to renewable sources of energy like solar, wind, biogas and geothermal energy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Waste Disposal:</strong> The over consumption of resources and creation of plastics are creating a global crisis of waste disposal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> this is yet another environmental problem that has surfaced in last couple of decades. It occurs due to rise in global warming which occurs due to increase in temperature of atmosphere by burning of fossil fuels and release of harmful gases by industries. It has various harmful effects but not limited to melting of polar ice, change in seasons, occurrence of new diseases, frequent occurrence of floods and change in overall weather scenario.</li>
                            <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> Human activity is leading to the extinction of species and habitats and loss of bio-diversity. Eco systems, which took millions of years to perfect, are in danger when any species population is decimating. Balance of natural processes like pollination is crucial to the survival of the eco-system and human activity threatens the same. There is also destruction of coral reefs in the various oceans, which support the rich marine life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Our forests are natural sinks of carbon dioxide and produce fresh oxygen as well as helps in regulating temperature and rainfall. At present forests cover 30% of the land but every year tree cover is lost due to growing population demand for more food, shelter and cloth</li>
                            <li><strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong> It is a direct impact of excessive production of CO2. 25% of CO2 produced by humans. The main impact is on shellfish and plankton in the same way as human osteoporosis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ozone Layer Depletion:</strong> The ozone layer is an invisible layer of protection around the planet that protects us from the sun's harmful rays. Depletion of the crucial Ozone layer of the atmosphere is attributed to pollution caused by Chlorine and Bromide found in Chloro-floro carbons (CFC's).</li>
                            <li><strong>Acid Rain:</strong> It occurs due to the presence of certain pollutants in the atmosphere. Acid rain can be caused due to combustion of fossil fuels or erupting volcanoes or rotting vegetation which release sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere.</li>
                            <li><strong>Urban Sprawl:</strong> Refers to migration of population from high density urban areas to low density rural areas which results in spreading of city over more and more rural land. Results in land degradation, increased traffic, environmental & health issues</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetic Engineering:</strong> This is genetic modification of food using biotechnology. Genetic modification of food results in increased toxins and diseases as genes from an allergic plant can transfer to target plant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Public Health Issues:</strong> The current environmental problems pose a lot of risk to health of humans, and animals. Dirty water is the biggest health risk of the world and poses threat to the quality of life and public health.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Clean drinking water is becoming a rare commodity. Water is becoming an economic and political issue as the human population fights for this resource.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overpopulation:</strong> The population of the planet is reaching unsustainable levels as it faces shortage of resources like water, fuel and food.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Pollution of air, water and soil require millions of years to recoup. Industry and motor vehicle exhaust are the number one pollutants. Heavy metals, nitrates and plastic are toxins responsible for pollution.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Other Issues in Pollution</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cost of pollution.</h4>
                        <p>Pollution has cost. Manufacturing activities that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs.</p>
