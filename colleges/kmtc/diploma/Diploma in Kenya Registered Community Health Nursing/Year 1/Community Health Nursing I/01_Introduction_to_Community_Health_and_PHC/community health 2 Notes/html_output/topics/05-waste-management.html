                            <li>Classified as hazardous and Non-hazardous waste depending on the toxicity of the waste.</li>
                            <li>Non-Hazardous solid waste can also be classified as organic or non-organic depending on the composition</li>

                            <li><strong>Solid waste:</strong> These are useless and unwanted substances discarded by human society. These include urban wastes, industrial wastes, agricultural wastes, biomedical wastes and radioactive wastes. The term refuse is also used for solid waste.</li>
                            <li><strong>Liquid waste:</strong> Wastes generated from washing, flushing or manufacturing processes of industries are called liquid wastes. Such a waste is called sewage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Gaseous waste:</strong> These wastes are released in the form of gases from automobiles, factories, burning of fossil fuels etc. and get mixed in the atmosphere. These gases include carbon monoxide, CO2, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, methane, etc</li>

                        <p>In all cases the following sources of solid wastes are universal:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Residential waste:</strong> generated from living households (domestic), generally contain non-hazardous solid wastes; kitchen waste, and ash are common in Kenya.</li>
                            <li><strong>Agricultural waste:</strong> solid wastes due to agricultural activities: food residues, animal dung, crop residues, etc. Such wastes are usually non-hazardous and negligible in rural parts of Kenya. These wastes are usually reused as livestock feeds, fuels, manures and hence pose minimal risk to the environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Commercial waste:</strong> wastes generated from business establishments: food establishments, shops, etc., that generate generally non-hazardous waste such as paper, cardboard, wood, metals and plastic.</li>
                            <li><strong>Industrial wastes:</strong> from various types of industrial processes. The nature of the waste depends on the type of industry and kind of raw material involved. There may be toxic and hazardous wastes that have adverse effects to the environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Institutional solid waste:</strong> generating from public and government institutions: offices, religious institutes, schools, universities, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hospital solid wastes:</strong> Also referred biomedical wastes as discarded, unwanted solid wastes from hospitals. Consists of both non-hazardous and hazardous waste. It helps to identify whether the waste is hazardous or not.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electronic waste, e-waste:</strong> Fastest growing solid waste problem arising from disposal of used electronic gadgets e.g. used computers, batteries etc.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For solid waste to be produced, it depends on:</p>

                        <p>Disposal of solid waste has to be accomplished without the creation of nuisance and health hazards</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Solid waste disposal methods:</h4>
                        <p>Generally there are several methods of solid waste disposal that can be utilized. These methods are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Ordinary open dumping</li>
                            <li>controlled tipping/burial</li>
                            <li>Hog feeding</li>
                            <li>Incineration</li>
                            <li>Sanitary landfill</li>
                            <li>Composting</li>
                            <li>Grinding and discharge in to sewer</li>
                            <li>Dumping into water bodies</li>
                            <li>Disposal of corpus</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Open dumping:</strong> Is the indiscriminate disposal of waste</p>
                        <p><strong>Controlled tipping/burial:</strong> It is a sanitary disposal process of solid waste entailing hygienic placement, deposition on land in an environmentally acceptable and protective to health. It involves compacting the waste manually or mechanically and covering with adequate depth of earth or ash at the end of each day's work.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hog feeding:</strong> The feeding of garbage to hogs has been practiced for many years in different parts of the world.</p>
                        <p><strong>Incineration:</strong> Incineration is a process of burning the combustible components of garbage and refuse.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sanitary landfill:</strong> Involves the methods of land filling and designing the landfill interface (soil foundation, liners), leachate collection and treatment systems, and gas collection and venting system. When the landfill has exhausted its life, a final cover is placed on top of the landfill; topsoil is replaced on the site and the site is landscaped; groundwater is continuously monitored; leachate is continuously collected and treated; and, gases are continuously collected and vented</p>
                        <p><strong>Composting:</strong> biodegradable materials break down through natural processes and produce humus. It involves the aerobic biological decomposition of organic materials to produce a stable humus-like product.</p>
                        <p><strong>Grinding and discharge into sewers lines:</strong> involves Installation of grinders in houses and commercial establishments, municipally operated station and sewage treatment plant to break down waste into very small pieces.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dumping into water bodies:</strong> The dumping of solid waste into water bodies such as streams, rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans was once been one of the means of disposal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disposal of dead bodies:</strong> There are certain methods that can be practiced in relation to disposal of dead bodies (embalming, cremating, disposal into water bodies, burial into the ground).</p>

                            <li><strong>Medical wastes:</strong> These wastes are usually produced in patient rooms, treatment rooms and nursing stations, the operating room may also be a contributor, and items include soiled dressings, bandages, catheters, swabs, plaster casts receptacles, and masks. The hazardous waste is generated from both OPD and inpatient wards as a result of diagnosing, treating, or handling the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Surgical and autopsy (Pathologic wastes)</strong> these wastes may be produced in surgical or autopsy rooms, items that may be included are placenta, tissues and organs, amputated limbs, fetus and similar material.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management of health care solid wastes:</h3>
                        <p><strong>Waste minimization, recycling, and reuse:</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>A. Waste minimization</strong><br>
                        Significant reduction of the waste generated in health-care establishments and research facilities may be encouraged by the implementation of certain policies and practices, including the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Source reduction:</strong> measures such as purchasing restrictions to ensure the selection of methods or supplies that are less wasteful or generate less hazardous waste.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recyclable products:</strong> use of materials that may be recycled, either on-site or off-site.</li>
                            <li><strong>Good management and control practices:</strong> apply particularly to the purchase and use of chemicals and pharmaceuticals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Waste segregation:</strong> careful segregation (separation) of waste matter into different categories helps to minimize the quantities of hazardous waste.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>B. Safe reuse and recycling:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reusable items may include certain sharps, such as scalps and hypodermic needles, syringes, glass bottles and containers, etc. After use, these should be collected separately from non-reusable items, carefully washed and sterilized particularly in the case of hypodermic needles, in which infectious droplets could be trapped.</li>
                            <li>Although reuse of hypodermic needles is not recommended, it may be necessary in establishments that cannot afford disposable syringes and needles.</li>
                            <li>Plastic syringes and catheters should not be thermally or chemically sterilized; they should be discarded.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>C. Reduce, Reuse and Recycling (3R) programme</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reduce</strong> the generation of unnecessary waste, e.g. carry your own shopping bag when you go to the market and put all your purchases directly into it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reuse</strong> - Do not throw away the soft drink cans or the bottles; cover them with homemade paper or paint on them and use them. Reuse the plastic bags for shopping again and again. It is better if you use shopping bags made of cloth or jute, which can be used over and over again.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recycle</strong> - Segregate your wastes so that non-perishable wastes are easily collected and taken for recycling. Dig a small pit to compost your organic wastes like kitchen wastes at your home.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Handling, storage, and transportation of health-care facility waste:</h3>
                        <p>The most appropriate way of identifying the categories of health-care facility waste is by sorting out the waste into color-coded plastic bags or containers.<br>In addition to the color coding of waste containers, the following practices are recommended:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>General health-care facility waste should be part of the stream of domestic refuse for disposal.</li>
                            <li>Sharps should all be collected together, regardless of whether or not they are contaminated. Containers should be puncture-proof (usually made of metal or high density plastic) and fitted with covers. They should be rigid and impermeable so that they safely retain not only the sharps but also any residual liquids from syringes. To discourage abuse, containers should be tamper-proof (difficult to open or break) and needles and syringes should be rendered unusable. Where plastic or metal containers are unavailable or too costly, containers made of dense cardboard are recommended; these folds for ease of transport may be supplied with a plastic lining.</li>
                            <li>Bags and containers for infectious waste should be marked with the international infectious substance symbol.</li>
                            <li>Highly infectious waste should, whenever possible, be sterilized immediately by autoclaving. It therefore needs to be packaged in bags that are compatible with the proposed treatment process: red bags, suitable for autoclaving, are recommended.</li>
                            <li>Small amounts of chemical or pharmaceutical waste may be collected together with infectious waste.</li>
                            <li>Large quantities of obsolete or expired pharmaceuticals stored in hospital wards or departments should be returned to the pharmacy for proper disposal.</li>
                        </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Access to the disposal site should be restricted to authorized personnel only</li>
                                    <li>The pit should be lined with a material of low permeability, such as clay.</li>
                                    <li>Only hazardous health-care facility waste including placenta should be buried</li>
                                    <li>The pit should be managed as a landfill process, with each layer of waste being covered with a layer of earth to prevent odors, as well as to prevent rodents and insects breeding</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Steam Sterilization:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The advantages of steam sterilization, or autoclaving are relatively low capital investment, operating cost, relatively small space requirements, and simplicity of operation.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Disadvantages include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>limited capacity, the requirement of special waste packaging and handling, and odor and drainage problems. Autoclaving is not recommended for pathological wastes, waste with high liquid content, and waste contaminated with volatile chemicals.</li>
                                    <li>After autoclaving, the appearance of waste remains unchanged. Although needles, syringes, blood bags, and the like, are sterilized, they also are recognizable.</li>
                                    <li>This has the effect of making much of the waste unacceptable for disposal in a landfill or other disposal means.</li>
                                    <li>Also, compacting autoclaved waste tends to break open waste bags and other containers, exposing and spilling their contents. Consequently, waste haulers and landfill operators may not be willing to accept</li>
                                    <li>autoclaved waste in spite of its sterile condition</li>

                            <li><strong>Primary treatment</strong><br>The sewerage water is relieved of course materials such as sand, pebbles, organic and inorganic matter and fatty substances that are remaining after pre-treatment. The sewerage is passed through a grit chamber that are used to remove sand and other organic matter.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary treatment</strong><br>This uses aerobic biological process to degrade the biological content of the sewerage such as human waste, food wastes , soaps and detergent. In this process bacteria and Protozoa are used to convert the biodegradable soluble organic contaminants which can be converted into flocs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tertiary treatment</strong><br>Is done to enhance quality before the sewerage is discharged into the environment. It is used to remove nitrogen and phosphorus. Nitrogen is removed through biological oxidation from Ammonia to nitrite</li>

                            <li>Screening can be done mechanically or manually. screeds are buried or burnt. Grit is also removed in a grit chamber</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TYPES OF SEWAGE STABILIZATION PONDS</h4>
                        <p>There are three types of ponds used for sewage treatment especially in tropical countries like East Africa</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Anaerobic ponds (primary digestion ponds)</li>
                            <li>Facultative ponds (secondary treatment ponds)</li>
                            <li>Aerobic(maturation) ponds (tertiary ponds)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Anaerobic ponds:</strong> The ponds are used for the settling down and breaking up of organic matter in the sewage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Facultative ponds:</strong> These ponds are used for the removal of BOD and pathogenic organisms</p>
                        <p><strong>Aerobic ponds</strong> are used mainly for the removal of pathogens. Pathogenic organisms die out with time and therefore they are gradually eliminated as the effluent passes slowly through the maturation ponds</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">3. SEPTIC TANKS:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are rectangular chambers sited just below the ground level and are water tight</li>
                            <li>They receive both excreta and flush water from flush toilets and other wastes from household waste water receptacles</li>
                            <li>The mean hydraulic retention time in the tank is usually 1-3 days</li>
                            <li>Hydraulic retention time means time taken by the waste water received to stay in the septic tank</li>
                            <li>The bio degradable material in the sewage is said to be 0.04 kg/day</li>
                            <li>During this retention time, the solids settle at the bottom and they are digested anaerobically</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A septic tank consists of one or more concrete or plastic tanks of between 4000 and 7500 liters. One end is connected to an inlet waste water pipe and the other to a septic drain field. Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface. The design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers; each equipped with a manhole cover, and separated by a dividing wall with openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.</p>
                        <p>Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested, reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber, where further settlement takes place. The excess liquid, now in a relatively clear condition, then drains from the outlet into the cesspool or septic drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.</p>
