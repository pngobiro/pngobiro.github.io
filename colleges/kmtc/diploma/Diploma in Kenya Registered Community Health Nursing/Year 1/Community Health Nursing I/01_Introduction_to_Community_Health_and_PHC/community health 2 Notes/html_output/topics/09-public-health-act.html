                        <p>The Act establishes the Central Board of Health and a district health management board in each district.</p>

                        <p>Date of Commencement: 6th September, 1921. (Revised 2012)</p>
                        <p>The Public Health Act (PHA), the primary legislation applicable to matters of public health crises, authorizes public health authorities, particularly the Minister of Health, to take various actions during public health crises, including declaring an infectious disease a "notifiable infectious disease" or a "formidable epidemic, endemic or infectious disease," and taking the necessary prevention and suppression measures to fight the disease. Specific powers accorded to health authorities for the purpose of prevention and suppression of an infectious disease include search, seizure, and detention powers; the power to designate any place as a quarantine area, including ships and aircraft; and the power to restrict or ban immigration into the country.</p>
                        <p>Kenyan and international laws impose certain transparency requirements on the country's government. Chief among these are the requirement under the PHA to periodically publish information regarding infectious diseases in Kenya, neighboring countries, and around the world, and the obligation under the International Health Regulations to report any public health emergency to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
                        <p>The Public Health Act (PHA) of 1921, including its subsidiary legislation, is the primary law that governs matters of public health crises in Kenya.</p>
                        <p>The PHA requires that health authorities take all the necessary, lawful actions imposed on them under any law to prevent or deal with an outbreak or the prevalence of "any infectious, communicable or preventable disease, to safeguard and promote the public health and to exercise the powers and perform the duties in respect of the public health.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION.</h3>
                        <p>The supremacy of the Constitution as source of law is manifested in various ways:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>All other laws derive their validity from the Constitution.</li>
                            <li>It proclaims its supremacy. Section 2 of the Constitution provides inter alia (among other things) "The Constitution is the Constitution of the Republic of Kenya and shall take the force of law throughout Kenya, if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution, this Constitution will prevail and the other law shall to the extent of its inconsistency be void".</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The rights Guaranteed by the Constitution</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Right to life.</li>
                            <li>Right to personal liberty.</li>
                            <li>Right to property.</li>
                            <li>Right to protection of law.</li>
                        </ul>
