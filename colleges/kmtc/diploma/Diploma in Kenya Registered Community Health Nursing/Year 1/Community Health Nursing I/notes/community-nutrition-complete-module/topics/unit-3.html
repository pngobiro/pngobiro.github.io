                        <p>A <dfn>24 hr recall</dfn>; the respondents are asked to remember the type and quantity of food consumed in the previous 24 hrs . The value of these measurements are converted into grams or milliliters (for drinks&beverage)</p>
                        <p>The amounts of various nutrients are calculated using the food composition tables and nutritional computer packages designed these particular nutritional methods. One of the advantages of a 24 hr recall is that the method is quick and cheap.</p>
                        <p>The main disadvantage is resnpondents may withhold or alter information about what they due to embarrassment.</p>
