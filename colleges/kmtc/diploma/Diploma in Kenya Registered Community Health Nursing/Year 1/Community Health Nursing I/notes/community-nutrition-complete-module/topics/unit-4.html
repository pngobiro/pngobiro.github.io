                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pregnancy is a time of increased nutrient need and not restriction.The nutritional and health status of each woman is different but there are general principles with regard to increased nutritional need.There is a correlation between maternal nutrient intake during pregnancy and birth weight.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Increased energy need</h3>
                        <p>Normally a pregnant woman requires 300 callories during the $2^{\text {nd }}$ and $3^{\text {rd }}$ trimester. Energy needed the first trimester are essentially the same for a non-pregnant woman, while energy needed during the $2^{\text {nd }}$ and $3^{\text {rd }}$ trimester represents only about $15\%$ increase based on addition of 300 calories.</p>
                        <p>Adequate energy intake is easy to achieve, and can be assessed appropriate weight gain throughhout.If a woman is active during pregnancy, she needs to add to the extra energy she uses to the energy allowances. Her greater body weight requires more energy and activities like walking swimming and light aerobic are generally advised.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Increased protein and carbohydrates needs</h3>
                        <p>The protein RDA for pregnancy is an additional 25 grams per day higher than for non-pregnant women for the fetus, enlargement of the uterus, mammalian glands and the placenta, the increase in blood volume, formation of the amniotic fluid, storage reserves for labour, delivery and lactation.</p>
                        <p>Carbohydrates needs are at least 100 g daily and these amounts per ketosis which can harm the foetus.Most women alreadyconsume these amounts of carbohydrates.<dfn>Ketosis</dfn>- production of ketones.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Increased vitamin needs</h3>
                        <p>Vitamin needs increase by up to $80\%$ for B-vitamins group except vitamin B6 which its needs by $45\%$ and folate which increases by $50\%$. The extra amount of vitaminsB6 and other B vitamins(except folate)needed in the diet is easily met via food dozens. Folate are required in pregnancies for both foetal and maternal growth and red blood cell formation therefore folate requirements increases during pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The RDA for folate increases during pregnancy to 600 micogrammes (mg) per day.<dfn>Folatedeficiency</dfn> at conception and therefore after has been associated with birth defects specifically <dfn>neurotube defects</dfn> e.g. spinal - spina bifida in infants</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Increased mineral needs</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Calcium</h4>
                        <p>The infant is born with approximately 28 grams calcium which must come from the mothers' reserves. If sufficient calcium is not consumed during pregnancy for a minority of women pregnancy may represent a drained of a body store of calcium and subsequently increases susceptibility to osteoporosis. However, in the majority cases if calcium needs are not meet by an increased dietary intake of calcium it's removed from maternal stores either in pregnancy or lactation and the calcium and the bone density are restored by 12 months postpartum.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Iodine</h4>
                        <p>Iodine deficiency during pregnancy remains a major public health issue in many parts of the ,world and this because of its irreversible condition that is known as <dfn>cretinism</dfn>(retarded growth and mental retardation which is caused by severe lack of iodine during foetal development and its characterized by both mental and physical retardation.</p>
                        <p>On the mothers side there is goiter. Pregnant women need extra iodine around 220 mgs per day for prevention of goiter. The use of iodized salt is usually enough to provide the required intake</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Iron</h4>
                        <p>The extra iron( 27 mg per gram) is needed to synthesize the greater amounts of haemoglobin needed during pregnancy and to provide ions stores. All women often need a supplement ion source especially if they start pregnancy with low ion stores. Milk, coffee or tea should not be consumed with iron consumption. Eating that rich in vitamin C helps increase iron absorption.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Zinc</h4>
                        <p>The requirement for zinc is increased during pregnancy and the foods that are rich in zinc are meat and fish,nuts and legumes are also good sources but zinc is less available in strict vegetarians. In strict vegetarians zinc supplements may be recommended.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Lactation should be considered the normal continuation of the reproductive cycle in all nations higher rates of breastfeeding are associated with increased maternal education</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Energy</h3>
                        <p>Energy needs increase significantly during lactation to provide the amount of energy in the breast milk which is approximately 630 kcal in seven and fifty ml of breast milk as well as to allow for the energy to produce the milk. Most authorities suggest that some of the requirements needs of in lactation should come from mobilization of fat stores laid down during pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>Hence the recommended daily intakes are in the range $400+500 \mathrm{Kcal}$ with the additional required energy coming from mobilization fat stores.</p>
                        <p>Requirements for many of nutrients are mostly similar requirements during pregnancy and there is a sustained need for calcium and a lower requirement for folate because breast milk is considered rich in Vitamin A. Vitamin A recommendations are higher during lactation. Vitamin C should provide 95 Mg and 19 mg of zinc per day during the $1^{\text{st}}$ months of lactation.</p>
                        <p>Vegetarians are advised to take vitamin B12 supplement to ensure normal milk levels for the baby which is 1 mm per litre.On the other hand levels of Vitamin D are in milk and infants are given Vitamin D supplements beginning at two weeks after birth in high latitude counties During lactation the lack of normal menstrual flow results in reduced ion needs. Breast milk is low in ion so demands for these nutrients are lower during lactation composed to pregnancy.</p>

                    </h2>
                     <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Energy</h3>
                        <p>Infants needs about 98 to 110 Kcal per kg of body weight daily depending on age. Based on body weight this is 2-4 times more energy than adults need. Either human milk or infant formula is ideal for the first few months both are high in fat and supply about 700 kcal per litre and later human milk or infant formula supplemented by solid foods can provide even more energy. The infants high energy needs are primarily derived by its rapid growth and high metabolic rate.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Proteins</h3>
                        <p>Daily protein needs vary from $0.7-1 \mathrm{~g}$ for each pound of body weight $(1.6-2.2 \mathrm{~kg}$ of body weight)depending on age. About half of total protein intake should come from essential amino acids. Excess nitrogen and minerals supplied by high protein diets of cows milk would exceed the ability of an infancy feeding to excretethe metabolic waste products and therefore adding stress to the infants kidneys function.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fats</h3>
                        <p>Infants and children up to 2years should consume about $40\%$ of the energy from fats. Fats are an important part of an infant's diet because they are energy debts and also to the development of the nervous system. As a source of energy fat helps to resolve the potential problem of the infants high energy needs and small stomach capacity.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vitamins</h3>
                        <p>Breastfed infants of mothers with poor vitamin D statusrequire a vitamin D supplements. Those whose mothers are total vegetarians should receive vitamin B12 supplements. Infants who take goat meat need a dietary supplement of folate because this milk does not supply an efficient amount of this nutrient.Formulae fed infants receive the vitamins they need from the formulas.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Minerals</h3>
                        <p>The iron stores with which infants are born with are generally depleted by the time birth weight doubles in 4-6months. To maintain a desirable iron status formula fed infants should be given an iron fortified formula from birth. The breastfed infants need solid foods to supply extra ion at about 6 months of age. Iron deficiency anaemia can lead to poor cognitive development in infants. They need adequate amounts of zinc and iodine to support growth.</p>
                        <p>Human milk and infant formulas adequately supply these needs as long as they supply energy to meet needs. Fluoride: it's important in aiding tooth development</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Water</h3>
                        <p>An infant needs(over 6months)about 150 ml per kg of body weight. Infants consume enough human milk or formulae to supply this amount.Conditions that leads to water loss e.g. fever, diarrhea,vomiting and too much sun can lead to need for supplement of water. Infants are easily dehydrated a condition that has a serious effect if not looked up. Special fluid replacement formulas containing electrolytes such as sodium and potassium are available to treat dehydration.</p>

                        <p>Children between 1-5years need special attention because they show a good deal of physical activity and growth therefore they need extra protein, vitamin and minerals. The energy requirements of a child aged lyear is about 100kcal daily and after age 1 the energy needs maybe calculated by adding 100 kcal for every year.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Proteins</h3>
                        <p>The total protein increases slightly with age. The RDA for proteins is 1-3 years about 1.05 kg of body weight and $4-10$ years is 0.95 kg .</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vitamins and minerals</h3>
                        <p>They increase with age. A balanced diet of nutrients foods can meet children's needs for those nutrients with the notable exception of iron. Iron deficiency anaemia is a major problem worldwide.During the $2^{\text {nd }}$ year of life toddlers progress from an infant diet rich in iron to adult foods low in iron.To prevent iron deficiency, children's foods must deliver approximately 10 mg of iron per day.</p>
                        <p>To achieve this goal snacks and meals should include ion rich foods and milk intake should be reasonable so that it will not displace lean meat,fish,poultry,eggs, legumes and whole grains or enriched products.</p>

                        <p>The energy of adolescentsis influenced by activity levels. Increased Basal metabolic rates and increased requirements to support growth and development. The RDA of an active boy of 15years may be around 3500 kcal or more a day just to maintain his weight. A sedentary girl may<br>need around 1700 kcal a day and especially if the growth is nearing at a standstill and if she is avoiding excessive weight daily.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Proteins</h3>
                        <p>The RDA for protein intake for females and males aged $10-13$ years is 0.95 kg per day and 0.85 kg per day for 14-18years old.when protein intakes are consistently inadequate delays in sexual malnutrition and reduced accumulation of lean body mass maybe seen.</p>

                        <p>They provide the body primarily source of dietary energy and carbohydrates rich foods as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes are also the main source of dietary fibre. Dietary recommendation suggests that $50\%$ or more of total daily calories delivered from sweetness.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dietary fibre</h3>
                        <p>It's important for normal bowel functions and it may pay a role in prevention of chronic diseases as certain cancers and diabetes. The recommended dietary fibre for adolescents should be 0.5 kg of body weight.</p>

                        <p>The human beings require and essential fatty acids for normal growth and development. Recommendations are adolescents should consume $25-35\%$ of total calories from fats. Children and adolescents should consume as little fats and milk and trans-fat as possible while consuming an adequate diet.it is also suggested that adolescents consume no more than 300 mg of dietary cholesterol/per day.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Calcium</h3>
                        <p>Achieving an adequate intake of calcium in adolescents is crucial to physical growth and development.Calcium is the main constituent of borne mass. Calcium intake is of great importance in developing dense borne mass and reducing the life time risk of fractures and osteoporosis.</p>

                        <p>Its needs decline an estimated $5\%$ per decade and one reason is because people usually reduce their physical activity as they age although they need not to do so.Another reason is that basal metabolic rate declines one to $2\%$ per decade as lean body mass diminishes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Protein</h3>
                        <p>Energy needs decreases and therefore proteins must be obtained from low calories sources of high quality protein an example of high protein calories is lean meat,poultry,fish,eggs,fat free and low fat meals products and legumes.</p>
                        <p>Proteins Is especially important for the elderly to support a healthy immune system and to prevent muscle wasting.</p>

                        <p>Carbohydrates are needed to protect protein from being used as an energy source. Source of complier carbohydrates such as legumes, vegetables, whole grains and fruits are also rich in fibre and essential vitamins and minerals. Eating high fibre foods and taking water can elevate constipation which is common among older adults.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Fats</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Vitamins and minerals</h3>
                        <p>Most people can achieve adequate vitamin and mineral intake simply by including food of all food groups in their diet but older adults often omit fruits and vegetables. Lack of vitamin D is a problem among older adults and many older adults drink little or no milk further compromising the vitamin D status of many older people especially those in nursing homes and have limited exposure to sunlight.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Calcium</h3>
                        <p>It's important especially for women after menopause to protect against osteoporosis. 1200 of calcium daily is recommended.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Water</h3>
                        <p>It's an essential for the older person as it is for the young individuals. The kidney is able to function more adequately with there being sufficient fluid to eliminate wastes and 6-8glasses a day may be healthy.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Iron</h3>
                        <p>Iron needs on men remain unchanged throughout adult while for women the iron needs decrease substantially when blood loss through menstruation ceases.Older people who take iron supplements eat red meat regularly and include vitamin C rich food in their daily diet are likely to have elevated iron stores than a deficiency.</p>
