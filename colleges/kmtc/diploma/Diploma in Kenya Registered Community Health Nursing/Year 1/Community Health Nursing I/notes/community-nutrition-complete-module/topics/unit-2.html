                        <p>This conceptual framework on the causes of malnutrition was developed in 1990 as part of the UNICEF nutrition strategy. The framework shows that causes of malnutrition are multisectoral, embracing food, health and caring practices. They are also classified as immediate, underlying, and basic, whereby factors at one level influence other levels. The framework is used at national, district and local levels, to help plan effective actions to improve nutrition. It serves as a guide in assessing and analysing the causes of the nutrition problem and helps in identifying the most appropriate mixture of actions.</p>

                        <p>They are political, economic and cultural situations, which affect the underlying causes.</p>
                        <p>Political causes include instability, poor system of government, and centralisation of authority. Civil wars can cause malnutrition because often people are displaced and unable to grow or buy food.</p>
                        <p>Economic causes are linked to poverty. Poor people are normally the most malnourished. A minimum income is necessary to get the food, goods and services needed for good nutrition. Alleviation of poverty is essential to the elimination of malnutrition.</p>
                        <p>Culture determines eating, sanitation and health-seeking behaviours, which can have good, neutral or negative impacts on nutrition.</p>
                        <p>Environmental causes: natural disasters such as drought, famine, earthquake can cause malnutrition because of the effects these have effect on growing of crops or harvest.</p>
                        <p>Health workers can help to remove basic causes of malnutrition. For example, they can identify beliefs and habits about feeding children and promote those which improve nutrition.</p>
