                        <p>Public Relations is a broad discipline that can be subdivided into many types of functions. There are primary areas of functional responsibility or different arenas in which we can categorize the profession of public relations, and these are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Corporate public relations.</li>

                        <p>Public Relations helps our company to operate smoothly, to reach decisions, and function more effectively by contributing to mutual understanding among groups and institutions. It serves a wide variety of institutions in society, such as businesses, trade unions, government agencies, voluntary associations, foundations, hospitals, schools, colleges, and religious institutions. To achieve their goals, these institutions must develop effective relationships with many different audiences or publics such as employees, members, customers, local communities, shareholders, and other institutions and with society at large. (Public Relations Society of America, A).</p>
                        <p>The unique management function of public relations is critical to the success of any organization that engages people in its operation, whether they are shareholders, employees, or customers.</p>
                        <p>Public relations is even difficult to define. Is it an art or science? Either way, the public relations function is prevalent and growing. The fragmentation of media and growth of multiple message sources means that public relations is on the ascendant, while traditional forms of mass communication, such as newspapers, are on the decline. You can find public relations in virtually every individual, government, and non-profit organization. Its broad scope makes it impossible to understand without some attention to the anatomy of this diverse and dynamic profession.</p>

                        <p>The sixth phase of Public Relations is communication process to check whether messages reached properly and the expected action or behavior or knowledge has happened.</p>
