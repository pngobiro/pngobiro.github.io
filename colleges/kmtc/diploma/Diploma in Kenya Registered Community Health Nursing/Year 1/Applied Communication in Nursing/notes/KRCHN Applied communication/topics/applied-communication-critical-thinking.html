                        <p>Critical thinking is the process of analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion.</p>
                        <p>This is a disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence.</p>
                        <p>It is a reasonable and reflective thinking focused on deciding what to believe or do. Critical thinking focuses on thought:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It looks at how facts are proven, arguments are formed, conclusions are reached, and not just what the facts, arguments, or conclusions may be.</li>
                            <li>Critical thinking is self-reflective. It involves reflecting on, questioning, and testing your own thinking processes.</li>
                            <li>Critical thinking is discipline-specific. It engages in particular forms of reasoning, such as mathematical reasoning, historical analysis, or literary interpretation, which are specific to a particular discipline.</li>
                            <li>Critical thinking is not "good" thinking, nor is it directed at solving problems other than improving one's own thinking. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems, but one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.</li>
                            <li>Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the reasoning of the thinker.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Critical thinking is also considered important for the integration of education for toleration.</p>

                             <p>The Declaration of Principles on Tolerance, adopted by UNESCO in Oct-Nov 1995 in Paris, affirms that education for tolerance could aim at countering factors that lead to fear and exclusion of others. It could help young people to develop capacities for independent judgement, critical thinking, and ethical reasoning.</p>
                             <p><em>N.B. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was founded in 1945 and its headquarters is in Paris, France.</em></p>

                        <p>Critical thinking skills can benefit the students by increasing their confidence and creating a reflectable thought process to question and confidently approach a solution.</p>
                        <p>It forms a system of related and overlapping modes of thought such as anthropological thinking, sociological thinking, psychological thinking, philosophical thinking, biological thinking, legal thinking, and ethical thinking.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reason:</strong> We base our thinking in logic, not feelings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-Awareness:</strong> We pay attention to our own and others' assumptions, biases, and perspectives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> We care about doing our best work and for sticking to it; for doing our work completely and precisely.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open-mindedness:</strong> We consider alternatives and other points of view.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Look Deeper and Further</h3>
                        <p>There are countless ways in which we look deeper and further when thinking critically. For example, we look deeper when we make inferences about an argument's hidden assumptions and values. We look further when we connect a study to theories in our discipline. We always think about the implications and importance of what we find.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Ask Complex Questions</h3>
                        <p>We develop and pose questions that help us look deeper and more broadly, and that require a variety of thinking processes to answer. We generate specific and complex questions based on what exactly we are thinking about, starting with fact-finding inquiry.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Who is the implied audience?</li>
                            <li>What are the strengths and weaknesses of this?</li>
                            <li>What are the different possible solutions to this problem and which seems most effective?</li>
                            <li>What is the nature of the relationship between this and that?</li>
                            <li>What exactly is the logical flaw in this reasoning?</li>
                            <li>Is this really relevant to that? If not, where does the connection break down?</li>
                            <li>What are the underlying assumptions and values?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Answer Questions using a Variety of Thinking Processes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Breaking something into parts to better understand the parts and the whole. (Identifying, classifying, categorizing, comparing)</li>
                            <li><strong>Synthesis:</strong> Making connections between the parts and the whole to see the pattern of relationships. (Organizing, connecting, designing, predicting)</li>
                            <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Examining the connections between the parts and the whole to make inferences about the implications and meanings of the patterns. (Associating, inferring, decoding)</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Forming judgments about meanings, qualities, and values. (Justifying, critiquing, verifying, deciding)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reflect on how we are answering the questions.</h3>
                        <p>Throughout the process, we ask ourselves questions such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is that clear, or is there something I need to clarify?</li>
                            <li>Is what I am saying true?</li>
                            <li>Do I need to be more specific or detailed? How is that connected to the central focus?</li>
                            <li>Am I thinking about this in a complex enough way, or should I go deeper and further in my thinking? Do I need to consider a bigger framework or a different point of view?</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Truth-seeking</h3>
                        <p>This is a courageous desire for the best possible knowledge in any given situation. A truth seeker asks probing questions and follows reasons and evidence wherever they lead, even if the results are against his or her cherished beliefs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Open-minded</h3>
                        <p>This means that the person is tolerant of divergent views and sensitive to the possibility of his or her own possible biases. An open-minded person respects the right of others to have different opinions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Analytical</h3>
                        <p>This means the person is habitually alert to potential problems and vigilant in anticipating consequences and trying to foresee short-term and long-term outcomes of events, decisions, and actions. Another word to describe this habit of mind might be "foresightful".</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Systematic</h3>
                        <p>This means that the person consistently endeavors to take an organized and thorough approach to identifying and resolving problems. The systematic person is orderly, focused, persistent, and diligent in his or her approach to problem solving, learning, and inquiry.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Confident in reasoning</h3>
                        <p>This is when the person is trustful of his or her own reasoning skills to yield good judgments. A person's or a group's confidence in their own critical thinking may or may not be warranted, which is another matter.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Inquisitive</h3>
                        <p>This means that the person is habitually striving to be well-informed, wants to know how things work, and seeks to learn new things about a wide range of topics, even if the immediate utility of knowing these things is not directly evident. The inquisitive person has a strong sense of intellectual curiosity.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Judicious</h3>
                        <p>Meaning that the person approaches problems with a sense that some are ill-structured and some can have more than one plausible solution. The judicious person has the cognitive maturity to realize that many questions and issues are not black and white and that at times, judgments must be made in contexts of uncertainty.</p>

                        <p>Within the framework of scientific skepticism, the process of critical thinking involves the careful acquisition and interpretation of information and use of it to reach a well-justified conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Critical thinking is significant in the learning process of internalization, in the construction of basic ideas, principles, and theories inherent in content.</p>
                        <p>Good teachers cultivate critical thinking, intellectually engaged thinking at every stage of learning, including initial learning.</p>
                        <p>All students must do their own thinking, their own construction of knowledge, and good teachers recognize this and therefore focus on the questions, readings, and activities that stimulate the mind to take ownership of key concepts and principles underlying the subject.

                        <p>Critical thinking skills through Socratic method (use of a set of questions to lead the students to an idea) serve to produce professionals that are self-governing.</p>
                        <p>Nurses can also engage their critical thinking skills through the Socratic method of dialogue and reflection. It requires nurses to engage in Reflective Practice (ability to reflect on one's actions) and keep records of this continued professional development.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are two main activities people do all the time when they think:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The first activity is gathering information or collecting data. As humans, our minds are constantly observing and collecting information about the world around us. We use our five senses to gather information about the world we live in. For example, we observe the height, size, weight, complexion, texture, and odor of the objects around us, and we are observing these qualities in relation to each other.</li>
                            <li>The second activity we do when we think is drawing a conclusion based on the information we have collected. We may, for example, conclude a building is too high to jump over, or an atom is too small to see with our eyes, or a box is too heavy to lift with our hands.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>However, what separates a critical thinker from a non-critical thinker is how she/he evaluates both the data she/he has collected and the conclusions she/he has drawn.</p>
                        <p>To evaluate both information and conclusions, the critical thinker must use the most important tool in the critical thinking toolbox: questions.</p>
                        <p>To think critically, we must ask questions about the information or data we have collected. E.g.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is it important?</li>
                            <li>Is it relevant?</li>
                            <li>Is it applicable?</li>
                            <li>Is it significant?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>But that's not enough. We must also ask questions about the conclusion we have drawn from the information we have collected. We need to ask the following types of questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the conclusion fair?</li>
                            <li>Is it logical?</li>
                            <li>Is it reasonable?</li>
                            <li>Is it consistent with all the information collected?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are different kinds of questions (critical thinking tools) for different activities. There are tools/questions for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Getting the facts</li>
                            <li>Evaluating the facts</li>
                            <li>Drawing a conclusion</li>
                            <li>Evaluating the conclusion</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tools/Questions for Getting the Facts</h3>
                        <p>When you first hear a statement or an argument, it is important to get the facts. Example: If a police officer has been called to an accident scene, the very first thing he/she does is get the facts.</p>
                        <p>Who was involved? How were they involved? Which car hit first? Which car hit second? Who was driving? Who wasn't driving? Exactly how fast was the first car going?</p>
                        <p>When looking at something critically, it is important to collect as many facts as you can. Tools for getting the facts include questions like "Who?", "What?", "Where?", "When?", and "How?".</p>
                        <p>The facts need to be accurate, clear, and precise. Questions that look for the details of facts with words like "exactly?", "how much?", "what time?", etc., help to clarify the facts.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tools/Questions for Evaluating the Facts</h3>
                        <p>Now that one knows the facts, it is important to evaluate the facts. When the police officer has collected all the facts from the accident, he/she needs to evaluate the facts.</p>
                        <p>Evaluating facts is not as easy as it sounds, because evaluations involve not only facts but also involve opinions and preferences.</p>
                        <p>For example, one driver in the accident may claim that because there was a new moon, the accident was the other driver's fault. It might be a fact that there was a new moon, but is it relevant to the accident? Is it a significant fact concerning the accident?</p>
                        <p>The officer has to evaluate the facts to find out if they are facts that should or should not be used to draw a conclusion.</p>
                        <p>Tools for Evaluating the facts include questions that explore the relevance and significance of the facts and questions that explore whether or not the facts are substantial, crucial, or applicable to the conclusion.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tools/Questions for Drawing a Conclusion Using Logic</h3>
                        <p>Now that we have collected the facts and evaluated the facts, we can "draw a conclusion". A conclusion is a statement that sums up a body of information collected in order to make a point or a decision. But how do you know if the conclusion you've made is valid and consistent or logically flawed?</p>
                        <p>For example, one driver might be like men in flowered shirts. This driver might want to say that it was not the moon that caused the accident, but that it was the man in the flowered shirt that caused the accident because "men in flowered shirts always cause accidents." Is this logical, or is the driver making a logical error?</p>
                        <p>Tools for drawing a conclusion use logic, a method that investigates arguments to help the critical thinker avoid making errors by exploring validity, consistency, and logical flaws.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Tools/Questions for Evaluating a Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes it's not enough to have a logical conclusion. Sometimes it's necessary to evaluate your conclusion. We need to ask the following types of questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is my conclusion fair?</li>
                            <li>Has my conclusion taken into account all the information available?</li>
                            <li>Is my conclusion reasonable?</li>
                            <li>Is there more information that should be considered?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, the officer may conclude that the moon did not cause the accident and that the man in the flowered shirt did not cause the accident, but that instead neither man was watching where he was going. One was looking at the moon and the other was fixing a button on his shirt, so they are both at fault. But does that conclusion take into account all the information available, or is there more information that must be considered before the officer can make a fair conclusion?</p>
                        <p>Tools for evaluating a conclusion include questions that explore the fairness, reasonableness, depth, and breadth of a conclusion.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Putting it All Together: Critical Thinking</h3>
                        <p>In summary, the four main types of critical thinking tools are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Getting the facts</li>
                            <li>Evaluating the facts</li>
                            <li>Drawing a conclusion using logic</li>
                            <li>Evaluating a conclusion</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Asking questions is the key for critical thinking, and it is important to ask questions that incorporate a body of the critical thinking tools. It is important that we ask questions not just of other people's thinking, but that we also challenge and ask questions of our own thinking.</p>
                        <p>The critical thinking tools we've discussed are different kinds of questions that explore different aspects of the information gathered and that explore different aspects of the conclusions drawn from that information.</p>
                        <p>Finally, one of the most important questions one can ask another person is: "Let me understand what you are saying. Are you saying...?" Then, in different words, repeat what you think the other person is saying or repeat what you think you are saying in a different way. To admit you may not understand what someone else is saying is a way to open up more critical thinking questions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Building a Critical Thinking Lens</h3>
                        <p>One way to envision a mental picture and a body of the critical thinking tools is to think about a lens. If our eyes do not function properly, a lens helps us to see objects more clearly. In the same way, a critical thinking lens can help you think through problems more clearly. Constructing a critical thinking lens is not very difficult. It amounts to asking questions using the four critical thinking tools. As you improve your ability to ask good questions, your critical thinking lens will improve.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How Critical Thinking Relates to Student Autonomy</h3>
                        <p><strong>Theory:</strong> If we want to think correctly, we need to follow the correct rules of reasoning. Knowledge of theory includes knowledge of these rules. These are the basic principles of critical thinking, such as the rules of logic and the methods of scientific reasoning, etc. It would be useful to know something about what not to do if we want to reason correctly. This means we should have some basic knowledge of the mistakes that people make, which requires some knowledge of typical fallacies (false ideas) and an awareness of prevalent biases and limitations in human reasoning.</p>
                        <p><strong>Practice:</strong> Knowing the principles that distinguish good and bad reasoning is not enough. For example, we might learn in the classroom about how to swim and learn about the basic theory, such as the fact that one should not breathe under water. But unless we can apply such theoretical knowledge through constant practice, we might not actually be able to swim. To be good at critical thinking skills, it is necessary to internalize the theoretical principles so that we can actually apply them in daily life.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are at least two ways:</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Doing lots of good quality exercises. This includes both the exercises in classrooms and textbooks, but also exercises in the form of discussion and debates with other people in our daily life.</li>
                                <li>Thinking more deeply about the principles that one has acquired. In the human mind, memory and understanding are acquired through making connections between ideas.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Attitudes:</strong> Good critical thinking skills require not just knowledge and practice, but also the right kind of attitude. Persistent practice can bring about improvements only if one has the right kind of motivation and attitude. To improve one's thinking, one must recognize the importance of reflecting on the reasons for belief and action.
