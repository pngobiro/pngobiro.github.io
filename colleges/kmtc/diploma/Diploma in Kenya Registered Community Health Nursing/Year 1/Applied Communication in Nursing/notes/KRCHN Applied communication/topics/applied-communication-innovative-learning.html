                        <p>Innovative learning is a type of learning where learners create new and renewable knowledge and a series of new knowledge. Innovative learning uses innovative strategies which aim to promote learning in communication with new learners and other learners, and takes students as active participants in their own learning, fostering skills like problem solving, critical thinking, and reflective thinking. Nursing requires clinical knowledge and skills to care for patients, the family, and the human relationships. Nursing students should be prepared to practice all competent health care professionally in a highly complex, diverse, and ever-changing environment. Therefore, nurse educators should create learning environments that promote student-centered learning (SCL) as an approach where the focus of instruction is shifted from the teacher to the student, with the end goal of developing students who are autonomous and independent.

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Learners are at the center of learning</h3>
                        <p>This is one of the principles of innovative learning, which requires the students to be at the center of learning activities. For students to be the key beneficiaries of the teacher's efforts, the teaching methodologies and the assessment practices need to be planned in tune with the student's mind. Research has demonstrated that engaging students in the learning process:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increases their attention and focus.</li>
                            <li>Motivates them to practice higher level critical thinking skills.</li>
                            <li>Promotes meaningful learning experiences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The engagement will lead to more success and they achieve the learning objectives. (Berkson)</p>
                        <p>A nurse educator should apply this principle of innovative learning by using strategies that promote student-centered learning. For example, the use of questions and answers strategy to promote active participation, assigning students to groups for discussion, and use of concept maps. A nurse educator also should demonstrate a certain skill for learners and allow learners to do a return demonstration and to identify a learner who has mastered the skill to demonstrate to his/her peers (peer mentoring).</p>
                        <p>The nurse educator also should make use of the available technology that facilitates student-centered learning. E.g., mobile learning, e-learning platforms, and internet to enable students to search for the required information.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Learning is a social practice</h3>
                        <p>Humans are described as social beings, and they learn by interacting. They feed on each other in one way or another, hence the need for cooperation. Cooperative learning is working together to accomplish shared goals and to maximize each other's learning. Within cooperative situations, individual self-outcomes that are beneficial to themselves and beneficial also to other group members. (Raihani)</p>
                        <p>Nurse instructors should understand learners in a perceptive way of social beings and through learners' interaction with peers, learning takes place. Student-centered learning is promoted by exposing nursing students to a variety of models, including peers and other advising models. For example, alumni and student mentors. Through observation of other successful students, they will be encouraged to own their learning and believe that they are capable of accomplishing a task. The educators will promote self-efficacy by having students receive confident-building messages from other successful persons and experience success themselves. In addition, the instructors should set time for continuation to clarify challenges that learners encounter during their own learning. Also encouraging WhatsApp groups and other social media on groups for interaction and learning is important.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Emotions are an essential part of learning</h3>
                        <p>Emotions have the power to switch on or switch off learning. Students understand ideas better when there is interplay between emotions, motivation, and cognition. If students understand why learning matters, it becomes more important to them. (Brandt et al.) argued that human brains store stories because they use logic and emotion together to bring meaning to a set of ideas. When educators relate concepts in an emotional way to what students already know, they make the material even more memorable.</p>
                        <p>Nurse educators should consider learners' emotions as far as student-centered learning is concerned. Education depends upon emotions and the motivation of learning, and for personal development. For instance, a nurse instructor should praise a student showing his/her good performance of an activity assignment, which leads to motivation and working harder in order to get praised. This will promote student-centered learning and encourages the learner to be a lifelong learner.</p>
                        <p>Nurse educators should understand that effective learning in the classrooms can be further facilitated if the learner practices with satisfaction, and if success crowns his/her efforts. However, negative emotions mean a learner feeling sad, angry, and fearful, which may inhibit learning. Therefore, a nurse educator should counsel learners and offer support to help them overcome the challenges that are causing negative emotions. In this way, they will develop emotional stability and own their learning. Nurse educators should use innovative strategies like storytelling, pictures, role play, simulated scenarios, videos, and boards that promote learners' emotions, hence makes lessons interesting and in return improve knowledge retention. (Alhamhand & Feleke)</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Each learner is different</h3>
                        <p>Innovative learning environments reflect various experiences and prior knowledge that each student brings to class. Student-centered strategies emphasize each student's interests, abilities, and learning style. (Morrison) suggested that students develop greater skills for independent problem solving, critical thinking, and reflective thinking when student-centered approach is used.</p>
                        <p>Nursing educators should recognize that there are individual differences, as well as cross-cultural differences in learning and development, and hence should be more sensitive to diversity in learners. For example, when giving an assignment, the instructor should allocate time that learners will be comfortable with and encourage for innovations for the ones that feel assistance.</p>
                        <p>Assessment should be for learning, not of learning.</p>
                        <p>Student assessment is essential to measure the progress and performance of individual students and help to plan future steps for the improvement of learning. Innovative strategies should be used during assessments in order for it to be meaningful, substantial, and shape the learning environment itself. Assessment for learning should be the major focus to ensure that validity and reliability is achieved. (Azer)</p>
                        <p>Nurse educators should understand this principle and assess what students have learned either formative or summative assessment. Applicable instructional methods of assessment should be used. For example, the use of case scenarios/questions when the educator requires students to acquire problem-based skills, which will promote student learning.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Learning needs to be connected across disciplines</h3>
                        <p>Understanding the concepts between subjects and ideas is essential for the implementation of student-centered learning strategies. When learners understand the connection of what they are learning and real-life situation, they will be more motivated to learn. (Brady & Lowe)</p>
                        <p>A nurse educator should guide students and make them aware of the importance of what they are doing. Therefore, this will allow the learners to take an active part in deciding what they learn, how they learn, and how they can evaluate what they have learned. For example, a nurse who knows the importance of practicing a skill in the laboratory will continue practicing without being forced, because he/she knows that it will build confidence that will help him/her when handling cases in clinical areas.</p>
