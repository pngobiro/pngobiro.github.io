                        <p>These are the people who will provide new income and profit and become part of a customer base which the marketing department will want to retain and develop.</p>

                        <p>These are the already existing customers. The organization must make sure that these customers will come back and buy again and buy more. This will lead to increased evaluation and profits.</p>

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Customer Retention</h3>
                        <p>This refers to the ability of a company/organization to retain its customers over some specified period. High customer retention means customers of the product or business tend to return to continue to buy services or products.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why are loyal customers important than satisfied customers?</h4>
                        <p>If customer satisfaction is a short-term win, customer loyalty is the long-term goal. Loyal customers will spend more, stay with your company longer, and will recommend you to family and friends. They will stick with you because they want to, because they have a bond.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why is customer loyalty more important than customer satisfaction?</h4>
                        <p>Customer loyalty measures something more than satisfaction, it measures whether someone is willing to put their name on the line and recommend your product or service to others, or if they are willing to stick with your product/service in spite of an occasional poor experience.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">What is the difference between customer loyalty and customer satisfaction?</h4>
                        <p>Customer satisfaction is a measurement of a customer's attitude towards a product, a service or a brand. Customer loyalty is a set of behaviors and attitudes that a customer exhibits that demonstrate loyalty to a product, service, or brand such as repeat purchases or choosing the brand over competitors.</p>

                        <p>There is only one boss, and whoever that person is who shies away from running or hides their business/corporation into the world, the boss remains the same. It's the customer. The customer is the person who pays everyone's salary and who decides whether a business is going to succeed or fail.</p>
                        <p>In fact, the customer can fire everybody in the organization. From the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) on down, and he can do it simply by spending his money somewhere else.</p>

                        <p>Ask any CEO of a company, president of a bank, manager of an office, or staff person, and they will likely tell you how important the customer is to their operations and success. In meeting after meeting, heads of industry, the service industry, and government try to convince the audience how much they believe in customer service, and they use phrases like "It's our mission, it's our number one priority, it's our goal, it's why we are in business," which often prove to be mere empty forms of words written in memory of a person who has died (e.g., on a grave side). Unfortunately, these same "customer-friendly" executives go back to their offices and fire employees that have initiated a customer service improvement plan and treat memos saying customer complaints are unjustified and overlooked.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Key Elements of Customer Service:</h4>
                        <ol type="a" class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">a)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Expand Your Definition of Service:</strong> How you define service shapes every interaction you have with your customers. Limited definitions of service based on an exchange of money or goods/service misses the overall point of customer service. "Service" should provide the customer with more than a product or an action taken on his behalf. It should provide satisfaction. In essence, the customer should walk away pleased at the result of the transaction, not just content that what actually happened. A happy customer will continue to be a buying customer and a returning customer.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">b)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Customers, buyers, and clients want to pay a fair price for quality service or products and feel that what they have paid for a service/product and received what they have paid for in return. They also want someone to take care of them. They need someone to understand their needs and help answer them. They need someone to hold their hands and walk them through a process. Customer service starts with the ability to listen to the customer and find out through polite questioning what he/she needs or wants. Customer service and personal interaction with a client mean that the customer will be heard and his/her problems will not go unanswered or ignored. It also means getting to know your client, his/her likes or dislikes, ideas, background, etc. The other most important aspect to do is to know what the customer is saying. If people do not understand what is motivating the customer, they will not be successful in handling them. Do research on customers, their habits, and what they want and expect. Most customer service is defined by how a company or organization creates "external customers" but there is also "internal customer service" as well. Remember the internal customer (e.g., a nurse) is just like the external, they are also customers put inside and outside the company/organization. This is because it is said: "Poorly treated employees create customers who are poorly treated."</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">c)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Develop a Customer Friendly Approach:</strong> One commonality among companies or organizations that provide good service is the development of a system and attitude promoting customer friendly service. By "customer friendly" we mean viewing the customer as the most important part of our work. The maxim "The customer is always right" is derived from this customer friendly environment.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">d)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Two Critical Qualities to the "Customer Friendly Approach":</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Communication</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>Relationships</strong></li>
                                </ul>
                                The two main tasks of successful customer relations are: to communicate and to develop relationships. These two do not take a lot of effort, but do happen in an emotional interaction. Positive, amiable communication with your customers and developing ongoing relationships with your customers are perhaps the two most important qualities to strive for in customer service.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">e)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Professional Qualities in Customer Service:</strong> Professionals who constantly deal with customers (inside and outside the company) have to strive for certain qualities to help them answer customer needs. The professional qualities of customer service to be emphasized always relate to what the customer wants. After years of polling and market research, customers are constantly interacting with their customer service experience. This means that customers are grading your customer service during each transaction, but you rarely know it.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">f)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Main Basic Customer Needs:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Friendliness:</strong> The most basic and associated with courtesy and politeness.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> The customer needs to know that the service provider appreciates their wants and circumstances.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> The customer wants to feel they receive adequate attention and reasonable answers.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Control:</strong> The customer wants to feel his/her wants and influence on the outcome.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Information:</strong> Customers want to know about products and services, but in a pertinent and timely manner. It is also very important for customer service employees to have information about their product or service. Service providers who answer "I don't know" or "It is not my department" are automatically demeaned and demoted in the mind of the customer. Hence, these employees can end up feeling frustrated as well as unequipped. Customers want information, and they deserve it from the person who is supposed to have information but does not. Good information is often good service. Employees need to be empowered to satisfy customer service and receive feedback from their managers and supervisors. Internal customer service starts with external customer service. It is often not what you are saying, but how it is presented. What you wear and how you express yourself amounts to how what you say is received.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </span></li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Example:</h4>
                        <p>Have you ever noticed how a person who is dressed up (even in a uniform or suit) always commands more authority and respect? The impression they make and what they have to say is enhanced by their personal presentation (verbal and non-verbal communication), as well as the substance of what they have to say. A suit or substance is only part of the equation of being persuasive and influencing perception. For some reasons, an individual in a more command and intimidating manner often seems more important than an individual who is well-groomed, smiling, and dressed up. Yet, visual perception plays a vital role in human impressions and reactions. For some reasons, another good quality to provide the desired level of customer satisfaction is "smiling." A smile and polite conversation can immediately disarm a disgruntled customer. Facial expression set a positive tone before you even begin speaking. A friendly and inviting facial expression is the ideal to shoot for at all times. Eye contact. Always look into your customer's eyes. Directly address customers. How you look: Personal grooming has a big impact on your customers. Dirty hands, messy hair, and poor dressing can mean the death of an otherwise happy customer. When interacting with customers, dress neatly and in a professional manner so as to command respect and to make customers know you take seriously your position.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Shaking Hands:</h4>
                        <p>When shaking hands with a customer, a firm and professional handshake is expected. This part of the greeting is now common among both men and women in a professional environment.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bearing/Tone:</h4>
                        <p>When listening to a customer, incline towards your customer and nod your head, even slightly, to indicate you are listening.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tone of Voice:</h4>
                        <p>Always convey friendliness and amiability. Do not raise your voice in frustration or anger, no matter how difficult or tiresome a customer may be.
                        </p>

                        <p>Use hand movements to emphasize what you say, even on the phone, and to emphasize your feelings.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Personal Space:</h4>
                        <p>This is the distance that feels comfortable between you and another person. If another person approaches you and invades your personal space, you automatically move back without thought. One feels uncomfortable. Leave adequate distance between you and your customer. Adequate space is important to making customers feel secure and understood.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Posture:</h4>
                        <p>Slouching in a chair or leaning against a wall while interacting with a customer are sure signs you are not interested in the customer. Your posture should express attention, friendliness, and openness. Lean forward towards the customer and nod often to make him/her know you are interested.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Observation:</h4>
                        <p>Note how your customer behaves and what he/she reacts positively to what you are providing.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Level 1: Initial Interactions</h5>
                        <p>At this level, you are focused on polite, initial interactions or basic answers. This is the foundation for every business or organization. Yet we know that more money, time, and energy must involve getting customers to come to you in the first place, the harder it is to get them to keep working at this level. It is not usual for customers to actually cost you money the first time they do business with you. Just consider the acquisition costs for your customers. For profitability, one needs to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify customers at risk of leaving, who may never return, and find how to win them back.</li>
                            <li>Look for ways to acquire new customers, more about what the organization offers, and how it works so that there are fewer avoidable service issues.</li>
                            <li>Give staff tools and training on ways to turn the interaction into revenue generating opportunities, while at the same time making clients feel well-served.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It will be important for the organization to focus on this improvement. When initial interactions run smoothly with the minimum of fuss or error, it provides a strong foundation for the business.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Level 2: Repeat Customers</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At this level, focus on getting customers to return for a second, third, or fourth time. Customers may come back for the same purchase, or the customer may turn to you for a variety of products and services.</li>
                            <li>Repeat customers develop greater economic and emotional ties with organization. They bring with them expectations, and the organization will meet those expectations. For instance, an insurance customer will look for less discount for car, home, and life insurance with the same provider.</li>
                            <li>Loyal customers will spend more, stay with your company or their lifetime. They will recommend you to family and friends. They will stick with you because they want to, because they have a bond.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Phone Etiquette</h3>
                        <p>The phone is one of the most important and commonly used tools in business. Many types of businesses, companies, and departments use phones in their work every day. However, most of us don't think of the phone as a tool and as a result, misuse it. The phone is a link between us and the world outside our business or department. Unfortunately, sometimes we don't pay attention or make a conscious effort to monitor what kind of message we are sending out to customers and the outside world.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Some basic rules of phone etiquette are:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Speak directly into the mouthpiece of the phone or headset when talking.</li>
                            <li>Do NOT eat or chew gum when talking on the phone.</li>
                            <li>Do NOT cover the phone with your hand or cup your hand to avoid the customer hearing you. Chances are, they will still be able to comprehend what you are saying.</li>
                            <li>If you are interrupted or must talk to somebody else in your workplace while you are on the phone, simply ask the customer if they can hold and press the HOLD button.</li>
                            <li>Do NOT put the headset on the desk without putting the customer on HOLD. The customer will hear everything being discussed in your office.</li>
                            <li>Always be courteous.</li>
                            <li>The phone etiquette, unlike many verbal communication, can be uniform and is not culturally biased.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The phone is often the first interaction a customer comes into contact with an organization or company. Being phone friendly is one of the most expressive and cost effective ways to deal with customer service.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Answering the Phone:</h3>
                        <p>How a company answers the phone can tell a whole story of how they treat customers and employees. The correct phrase said in the right order in a positive tone makes a good impression and starts the customer-client relationship off on the right foot.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always try to answer your own phone whenever possible.</li>
                            <li>Always practice answering your phone within 3 rings. More than 3 rings signals chaos in your office or ineffectiveness on the part of your company or organization.</li>
                            <li>Greet the caller, e.g., "Hello," "Good morning," "Good afternoon." Good manners shows you respect the caller.</li>
                            <li>Give your name, e.g., "Hi, my name is..." This is a courtesy that serves to personalize the customer service experience as well as allowing the customer to know how you are accountable for your level of service. He/she now has a point of reference and someone to contact when he/she calls back.</li>
                            <li>Ask the customer how you can help. Asking how to help conveys to the customer you are there to serve his/her needs and to solve his/her problems. This also makes the customer with a positive impression.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">For example:</h4>
                        <p>"Good morning, thanks for calling X Hospital. My name is T. How may I help you?"</p>
                        <p>The greeting is key to the entire interaction.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                             <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">üí°</span> Note</h4>
                             <p>Some things which may upset a customer are simple and avoidable.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Examples of how to handle these situations:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Putting a customer on hold:</strong> Ask the customer if you can put them on hold, wait for them to say "yes" or "no," and then explain it will only be for a short period of time. Thank customers for holding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transferring a call:</strong> Ask the customer if they mind being transferred, wait for them to say "yes" or "no," and then explain why they are being transferred and to whom. If you are not sure to whom a call should be transferred, take the caller's name and phone number and find out where the call needs to be transferred to. Also, give the caller your name and phone number as a reference in case the appropriate party does not contact them. Or, verify that it is okay with the caller for you to transfer them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Call the department or person where you are transferring a call and make sure that they can take the call. If they are able to take the call, give them the person's name, request, and any other relevant information. Return to your caller and give them the name of the person they are being transferred to, the department, and the phone number, if possible.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Taking a message:</strong> Explain to your co-worker (if he/she is in a meeting, conference, or training) that you are taking a message. Do not say, e.g., he/she is gravely ill, having a hangover, or come to work drunk. You can be found that you do not know where he/she is or that he/she "was just there." Give a reasonable estimate of when the co-worker will return. Offer to take a message or transfer to another staff member. If a co-worker is on holiday and will not return to the office for some time, it is permissible to say that he/she is on holiday. However, avoid details such as "Mr. X is at the beach and I am sure he is having a great time!" While such details may seem harmless, innocent, and even humorous, they give the wrong impression of those seeking service.</li>
                            <li><strong>Screening calls:</strong> There is a lot of controversy over whether calls should be screened. It is not recommended to screen calls if you want to enhance or encourage good public relations. You should always aim towards not screening calls, if at all possible. "Yes, he's in. May I feel him who is calling?" is an example of an inappropriate response when you are not screening calls. If someone is unavailable ONLY to certain individuals, and you must screen the call, then do so towards using responses like, "She is away for now. May I take your name and number?" Or, "May I ask who is calling? Thank you. Let me check and see if he is in." If you are required to ask who is calling or what the nature of the call is, be aware of your tone of voice. Screening calls is always a delicate situation, so it is critical not to offend or upset your caller with your tone of voice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ending the call:</strong> This is the final step in phone etiquette. A good customer service representative ends the call on a positive note, repeating actions agreed to be taken, and what is going to be done to help or serve the customer.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">A good phone message includes:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Name of person/for whom the message was left.</li>
                            <li>Caller's name, company/department, and number.</li>
                            <li>Date and time.</li>
                            <li>Message.</li>
                            <li>Action to be taken, e.g., "Please call back," or "URGENT."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is critical to deliver the message to the person it is intended for as soon as possible and to maintain confidentiality with all messages. When delivering a written message, either throw the message away or burn it so as not to allow them to be easily read by other staff members or visitors.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">When returning a phone call:</h3>
                        <p>Returning phone calls can be frustrating, so to avoid returning phone calls to a person who is unavailable, try calling them back asking, "When is the best time for me to call back?" or "When is the best time for them to call me back?"</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">üí°</span> Note</h4>
                            <p>When calling for another individual (e.g., a colleague), return calls during specified times. Example: "I expect him to return by 2 pm. You can reach him between 2 and 5 pm." When placing outbound calls from customers, be sure you have the right phone number before you place an outbound call. Keeping a "frequently called numbers" list within reach can prove to be very helpful.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Try utilizing a few of these suggestions:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prepare yourself. Visualize your caller as a friendly and positive person.</li>
                            <li>Plan the objectives you want to accomplish by putting them down ahead of time.</li>
                            <li>State your concerns up front to identify the information you need to obtain from the conversation. Anticipate what questions or objections you may encounter prior to placing the call and develop answers to them to avoid making additional damages.</li>
                            <li>Take notes during the outbound call.</li>
                            <li>Specify any follow up action to the caller, such as when you will get back to him.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">When you are leaving a message:</h3>
                        <p>When you read an answered device, such as a voicemail or an answering machine, be sure to leave the following information:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your name.</li>

                        <p>Many people dread bringing a telephone conversation to an end. Here are some tips to avoid awkwardness and to make your conversation with professional ease:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Talk into the phone.</li>
                            <li>Try using a "closing phrase" such as "I'm really glad you called" or "I'm glad we resolved this issue."</li>
                            <li>State the action you will take.</li>
                            <li>Affirm any follow up actions such as times, dates or deadlines.</li>
                            <li>Thank them for calling and say "Good bye." Rephrase for using phrases like "bye bye," "cheerio," or "Alright, see you."</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Although we express a lot to our customers through the sound and the one of our voice, what words and phrases we use in a conversation can also convey a significant message. Sometimes people feel frustrated and end up demeaning a negative message to the customer. Pay attention to what type of language you are using. For example, instead of beginning a sentence with phrases like "You have to," "You need to," or "Why didn't you?", try starting with words like "We will," or "Would you please."</p>
                        <p>Never refer to a matter or inquiry as "Your problem," or "Your complaint." Instead, try using softer phrasing and identifying it as something along the lines of "Your question," "Your concern," or "This situation." When you do not have the knowledge or expertise to handle a customer's situation, never reply with remarks like "I can't do that," or "That's not my job." Instead, try a more helpful approach by outlining what actions and steps you are capable of taking to aid their situation.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Example:</h4>
                        <p>"While I'm unable to help you on this matter, I will speak to my manager about your concern."</p>
                        <p>Avoid brushing off as unprofessional by all means, and refrain from using expressions such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Hang on"</li>
                            <li>"Hold on"</li>
                            <li>"Who's calling?"</li>
                            <li>"I can't hear you, speak up."</li>
                            <li>"I can't tell you. You'll have to speak to someone else."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following terms would be more appropriate:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"May I place you on hold?"</li>
                            <li>"May I know who is calling, please?"</li>
                            <li>"I am having a difficult time hearing you."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An inappropriate phone manner includes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using impolite language, regardless of the language being used by the caller.</li>
                            <li>Using inappropriate welcoming or greeting phrases as set by the employer.</li>
                            <li>Applying standards not applicable. The symbol of the greeting should reflect the symbol of business involved. Showing enthusiasm, i.e., positive attitude or approach to the caller, when talking a call to demonstrate the business is happy to welcome the caller and to do business with them. Being friendly is important for anyone who takes the phone calls to understand the need to be friendly in all matters. This friendliness that is shown on the phone has been referred to as "need to please." Go to please in your service when talking on the phone. Some people recommend placing a mirror near the phone or on the desk to remind yourself to smile on the phone, making an offer of help to the caller. A standard requirement when answering a phone call is to either ask the caller a direct question inquiring what assistance the caller wants, or have a positive predisposition towards providing whatever help the caller asks for.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Answer calls as soon as possible, using the business approved greeting.</li>

                            <li>Make sure all messages are recorded accurately and comprehensively, and forwarded to the appropriate person.</li>
                            <li>Follow up on any phone messages taken to ensure they have been received and/or acted upon.</li>
                            <li>Treat abusive or threatening phone calls seriously and report them immediately to your Supervisor.</li>
                            <li>Always use language (tone and volume) appropriate to the nature of the call to demonstrate respect for the other person and to show their call is valued. Rude and aggressive calls.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dealing with a caller who is rude or aggressive does not give you the right to reply in kind and be rude or aggressive in return. This means in these situations you:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Must both wear black when someone swore at you.</li>
                            <li>Must both use the same tone of voice as used by the caller when they are obviously annoyed.</li>
                            <li>Must both use the same type of language.</li>
                            <li>Your responses and the language you use must always remain professional and always reflect the company's image.</li>
                            <li>Must both be rude in return.</li>
                            <li>Whatever work there is, there must be any notification for being rude to any caller, regardless of the circumstances.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Key to dealing with rude and angry people on the phone are:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To remain calm and in control. This may be achieved by:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Taking a deep breath mentally.</li>
                                    <li>Recognizing the caller (what it is). It is an unavoidable call, most calls are not like this.</li>
                                    <li>Do not allow this call to spoil your day or ruin your reputation.</li>
                                    <li>Seeing the caller as a challenge rather than a problem or issue and doing your best to meet the challenge of the caller.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>To respond with fairness regardless of how much you may feel like it is inappropriate or being provoked. You must respond calmly in order to try to calm the other person down.</li>
                            <li>To remain polite in your responses, using words like "Sir," "Madam," "Please," and "Thank you." The key is, the more polite you are, the more you encourage a similar response from the caller.</li>
                            <li>To both believe the caller. Try to remember the caller is not upset with you personally, instead they are angry about something else. You might have happened to be the one who picked up the phone, so never assume their anger or rudeness (sarcasm or tone of voice) is directed at you.</li>
                            <li>To get to the reason for the call as quickly as possible by redirecting their statements, criticisms, negativity back to the real point of the call, i.e., what they want to discuss. You need to cut through their anger as quickly as possible and start addressing their real problem.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">For example:</h4>
                        <p>"Yes, Madam, I can tell you are upset. I apologize. Will you allow me to transfer you to Mr. X, our manager, so he can help you? He has the authority to deal with this kind of issue." Where a phone call is obviously rude, including calls that are obscene, you should simply hang up straight away and report the call to your Supervisor.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Basic Requirements:</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The points to note when taking or making a call include:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always say "Please" when asking for something.</li>
                            <li>Always say "Thank you" when provided with information or assistance that was required.</li>
                            <li>Make mention of your appreciation of any special effort the other person has made on your behalf (e.g., locating a certain person, finding required information, making a sensible suggestion) that may have both solved your problem, but also affirmed you in some way.</li>
                            <li>Always remain professional, even when the other party may be rude, unhelpful, or extremely unprofessional themselves.</li>
                            <li>Never run down a third party to the person you are speaking to. For instance, do not mention to the person on the phone on the switchboard was slow or unhelpful.</li>
                            <li>Ask when a person who is unavailable is likely to be available or ask them when is the best time to call.</li>
                            <li>Use the person's name, if known, or use Sir or Madam, according to business protocol when talking to a Madam or Sir.</li>
                            <li>Speak at a normal volume. Do not whisper and never shout.</li>
                            <li>Talk at a normal pace.</li>
                            <li>Do not cover the phone.</li>
                            <li>Use correct language.</li>
                            <li>Do not use slang expressions, do not take any complaints (have arisen as a result of staff member making what they thought was a funny comment but which the other person did not find at all humorous), do not make racist, sexist, or ageist comments.</li>
                            <li>Avoid using industry terms and/or business-specific terminology when speaking to another industry professional. This can confuse people outside the organization and make them feel they are being excluded from the conversation.</li>
                            <li>Eliminate any background noise as far as possible.</li>
                            <li>Turn off radios or music and close doors and windows to reduce noise from other areas.</li>
                            <li>Talk directly into the phone or headset mouthpiece.</li>
                            <li>Pronounce your words correctly. Slurring words or terms you can scarcely expect the other party will be unimpressed with.</li>
                            <li>Be careful how you put the phone down when you are talking to the customer.</li>
                            <li>Put down gently to avoid noise to the other party.</li>
                            <li>Never talk to a third party while you are on the phone to someone else.</li>
                            <li>Ask customers if you can help them in any other way before hanging up.</li>
                            <li>Thank customers for their call, where appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Let the customer hang up before you do.</li>
                            <li>Calls are dynamic.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of calls are often divided into outbound and inbound.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Inbound calls</strong> are calls that are made by the customer to obtain information, reporting a problem, or asking for help. These calls are substantially different from outbound calls, where employees make calls to potential customers, mostly with intentions of helping or serving the individual.</li>
                            <li>Call center staff are often organized into a multi-tier support system for a more efficient handling of calls. The first tier in such a model consists of operators who direct inquiries to the appropriate department and provide general directory information.</li>
                            <li>If a caller requires more assistance, the call is forwarded to the second tier, where more specific issues can be resolved. In some cases, there may be three or more tiers of support staff.</li>
                            <li>If a caller requires more assistance, the call is forwarded to the third tier of support, typically the third tier of support is formed by product engineers, developers, or highly skilled clinical support staff of the product.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Call Centers:</h4>
                        <p>Management of call centers involves balancing the requirements of cost-effectiveness and service. Call centers do not want to wait in exorbitant long queues until they can be helped, and so management must provide sufficient staff in inbound capacity to ensure that the quality of service is maintained. However, staff costs generally form more than half the cost of running a call center, and so management must minimize the number of agents required on duty at any one time.</p>
                        <p>To perform this balancing act, call center managers make use of demand estimation. Call volumes, forecasting, and demand estimation techniques are used to determine the level of calls required at any time.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Forecasting methods rely on data acquired from various sources, including historical data, queued data, and so on.</h4>
                        <p>Forecasting methods must predict the traffic expected within the call center in quarter hour increments, and these results must be compared to staffing rosters. Special attention must be paid to the busy hour.</p>
                        <p>Forecasting methods must be used to preemptive action to prevent a situation where equipment needs to be upgraded as capacity of the call center is exceeded.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Responding to your business email:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Respond to your business email quickly. Answering your business email promptly should be a priority for your business.</li>
                            <li>Not only is email an important communication channel with your customers, it is often used by them to gauge your trustworthiness.</li>
                            <li>If a customer sends you an email with a simple question and you take forever to answer it, what does that say about the rest of your operation? Even one of the tell-tale signs customers use to separate men from boys, and we all want to deal with the big guys, do we not?</li>
                            <li>Business email should be answered within 24 hours maximum.</li>
                            <li>If you really want your customer service to shine, you should consider answering your business email at least twice a day, e.g., with an hour interval.</li>
                            <li>It's even better to check and answer email hourly. The numbers of emails answered become unusually easy to handle.</li>
                            <li>If you check and answer email regularly, the numbers of emails to answer become unusually easy to handle.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Communicating with an Unhappy Customer:</h3>
                        <p>How many times have you, as a customer, run into the problem of expecting things? There is a problem, and the only person who is representing customer service is making no excuses, namely:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It's the company's fault.</li>
                            <li>It's the fault of other staff.</li>
                            <li>It's the fault of the chief of the department.</li>
                            <li>It's the fault of the system.</li>
                            <li>It's the fault of the government.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is the way it is.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it feels as if nothing is anybody's fault, or is in anybody's department. This is poor customer service. Good customer service means accountability, responsibility, and taking action to satisfy the customer.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">How to "Hook Up" with an Unhappy Customer:</h4>
                        <p>If your customer is unhappy for legitimate or illegitimate reasons, you will have to use some of the many techniques of customer service professional to win their support and continued business. When coming into contact with a customer, communicating with him/her or analyzing a problem, do not forget to use the following methods or qualities of customer service professional:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Listen:</strong> It is of primary importance when dealing with an unhappy or complaining customer. Listen attentively to his/her complaint, frustration, or grievance. Be patient, attentive, and friendly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Express that you are sorry:</strong> "We are sorry for this mistake/problem." "We are terribly sorry for this inconvenience." "How can we work to solve this problem together?" "I can imagine how frustrated you are."</li>
                            <li><strong>Do not argue and do not interrupt:</strong> This will only worsen the situation, especially if the customer is angry. Let him/her speak before you try to discuss with him what has happened.</li>

                            <li><strong>Involve the customer in problem solving:</strong> Suggest to the customer the alternative solutions available. Customers appreciate the opportunity to learn the ways for problem solving.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>People spend up to 17% more for the same product with better service.</li>
                            <li>When people receive good service on average, they tell 9 people.</li>
                            <li>When people receive poor service on average, they tell 16 people.</li>
                            <li>There is a 95% chance that customers will repurchase from a company if their complaints are handled and resolved quickly and amiably.</li>
                            <li>If the service is really poor, 89% of customers won't come back.</li>

                            <p>It is extremely important to make sure that customer service measures that were discussed or promised to customer are in fact taken. It is not enough for the customer to experience a satisfied phone call or face-to-face interaction. If nothing comes of the contact, they will be even more frustrated and unhappy. Make sure you do whatever you have promised in a timely manner.</p>

                        <p>Intangible is the difference between adequate customer service and customer service that wins you a customer for life. Examples of exceptional customer service, i.e., "going above and beyond" initiatives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taxi driver who opens the door for a customer or waits a moment for customer to safely go into the destination.</li>
                            <li>Computer technician who does complex work and then calls back a week after to make sure your computer is running well.</li>
                            <li>Car salesperson who calls a month after you buy a car to make sure it is running well.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The personal attention that makes your product or service stand out. The company who calls the customers and checks to make sure your service is working well and attempts to provide for any "brownouts" or "blackouts." These "good intangible" are beyond the call of duty and make the customer beyond satisfied. They make the customer remember the transaction or occasion.</p>

                        <p>Satisfaction is an attitude, whereas loyalty is described as a behavior. Several studies have proved that satisfaction and loyalty have a direct connection between one another. Satisfied customers are loyal, and dissatisfied customers are a vendor. (Helmut)</p>
                        <p>Customer loyalty can be considered to be a byproduct of customer satisfaction. The satisfaction of business customers leads to customer loyalty. (Kornell)</p>
                        <p>Customer loyalty will increase significantly when satisfaction accomplishes at a certain level, and at the same time, customer loyalty will decline automatically if the satisfaction level drops to a certain point. More over, highly satisfied customers are likely to be more loyal than the customers who are merely satisfied. Overall, it is clear that there is a significant positive relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty.</p>
                        <p>Customer loyalty leads to an increase in both sales and profit ability. (Chi)</p>

The values, perceptions, behaviors, and preferences are the factors typically learned at the very early stages of childhood from the people and the common behaviors of the culture. Norms and values are carried forward by generation from one entity to the other. Cultural factors represent the learned values and assumptions that define consumer wants and behaviors. Consumers are influenced by the groups they belong to and also by the groups (aspirational groups) they wish to belong to.</span></li>

A person's behavior is influenced by many small groups like family, friends, social networks, and surrounding who have different buying behaviors. Hence, the social factor influences the buying behavior of an individual to a great extent.</span></li>

Consumers buy a portion of goods and services with the passage of time. Occupation and the economic situation also have a significant impact on buying behavior. On the other hand, a person with low income chooses to buy inexpensive services. The lifestyle of customers is another crucial factor affecting the consumer buying behavior. Lifestyle refers to the way a person lives in a society and is expressed by the things in the surroundings.</span></li>

To increase sales and encourage the consumer to purchase the service/product, the organization should try to create a conscious feeling in the consumers' mind that develops an interest in buying the service/product. Similarly, depending on the experiences of the customers (past experiences), the consumer develops feelings and personal characteristics of an individual as a different perception from another. Attitudes allow the individual to develop a coherent behavior against the dictates of their personality. Through the experiences that the consumers acquire, the customer develops feelings which will influence the buying behavior.</span></li>

                        <p>There are two types of customer loyalty based on behavioral and emotional loyalty to the goods and services.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Behavioral loyalty</strong> refers to frequency of purchasing in a particular retailer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional loyalty</strong> refers to the customer's concern towards certain retailers on the basis of past buying experience and attitude.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In this, both behavioral and emotional loyalty models, increased satisfaction, should increase customer loyalty. When customers are not satisfied, customers have the option to express their complaints, going to the competitors.</p>

                        <p>Service is one of the most complex factors which do not exist before they are consumed. In order to develop the service management, it is important to understand what customers are really looking for, and what the customers expect. Customers expect quality of service through responsiveness, so the service marketers have to assist, show customers they receive the quality of the services, measured by the perceived service quality framework. Service quality refers to the result of the comparison that the customer makes between their expectation about the service and their perception of the way the service has been performed.

                        <p>When it comes to brand loyalty, we have different customer categories. Each category contains customers with unique characteristics that help you understand these customers and how you can win them to become loyal customers.</p>
                        <p>Some are highly likely to jump ship if a competitor has a better offer, even if in terms of price, while others are your die-hard fans.</p>
                        <ol type="a" class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">a)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Satisfied Customers:</strong> These customers are the ones who you would deem to be happy customers. They do not have anything to complain about, and they actually like your products, services, etc. These ones will likely come back because they like you with their extra inducements. The problem with these customers is that they will very easily jump ship from your competitors if they feel that your competitors have something better to offer. These customers are what one calls fair-weather friends or acquaintances. Despite the fact that they actually buy from you and generate a significant amount of revenue, they simply are not very loyal. They are much changing around, waiting for the next deal.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">b)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Customers who are Price-Focused:</strong> These customers keep buying from you because you are probably offering the best bargain. They will keep researching on the next lower price and will not be moved by brands or loyalty. For as long as you can keep your prices low enough, they will stick around, even if that means using a lower quality product for the time being. When a better deal pops up, they move on. Also, it is worth noting that when you have the better deal again, they will come back.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">c)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Loyalty Program Focused/Loyalty Program Loyal:</strong> These customers are loyal to your brand because of your loyalty program. They are after all the discounts, offers, and whatever benefits that come with being active members of your loyalty program. A good example here is airlines. There are customers who will only use that airline because they can get a free upgrade for even free ones, depending on accumulated loyalty points.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">d)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Convenience Focused/Convenience Loyal:</strong> These customers buy from you because it is convenient for them. E.g., it could be because your store or business is conveniently located. These customers are not usually price sensitive. Convenience is their priority, and will not even mind paying more from it. A great thing about these customers is that they can easily become truly loyal if you find a way to do it. It could be as simple as improving your customer service, saying hello to them, and asking them for feedback. For instance, a simple statement like, "How did you like the coffee today?" could make such a big difference.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">e)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>Benefit Focused/Benefit Loyal:</strong> These customers are loyal to the benefits that they get from your business. They rarely make purchases and will rarely show up at your business. Their revenue will not make any significant contribution to your business. If you sell a lot of coffee, they will probably only buy one cup of coffee. And sometimes, they might not even buy the coffee because they like it, but because they can use your Wi-Fi room.</span></li>

They may not even like your brand, product, service, but they opt to stay because it's the "next worst" on their behavior. E.g., someone who eats from a particular restaurant. He/she has been a customer for several years, but does not like their food, prices, service, etc. of the restaurant. He/she, however, has not found another restaurant that can suit him/her. The day that he/she finds a better option, he/she will simply move.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">g)</span><span class="item-text"><strong>The Truly Loyal Customers:</strong> These customers are loyal to your brand, products, services, and all that you have to offer. They make frequent purchases, making a significant contribution to your business revenue. They will also talk about their great experiences for you, and even bring in new customers. These are the ones who will fill up for your loyalty program. If your company involves few products or services, they will be the first to try them out and give you honest feedback. These ones are usually on your early adopter list. Businesses should strive to have most of their customers in this category. However, some categories may end up being too costly to convince people to stay. For example, the price sensitive ones or those that you are the next worst. It is not possible to keep influencing your price to keep customers around. It may also be difficult to convince the "next worst" category, and sometimes it is better for customers in this category to move. Especially if they are vocal on social media or telling others about their bad experience with your brand.</span></li>

                        <p>Everyday customer service representatives face situations that they say they either make or break a service interaction. Phrases like "NEVER" should not be used because they discourage and anger customers. Others are like:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"No."</li>

                            <li>"That's not my fault."</li>
                            <li>"You need to talk to my supervisor."</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"No":</h4>
                        <p>Everyone hates the word "No." It is demotivating, discouraging, and disinteresting. "No" is easy to keep unmotivated and negative, but it means failure. Unfortunately, "No" is the word we most often hear when a new idea, request, or concept is introduced. Admittedly, there are times when you will have to say "No," but focus on what you can do for the customer to portray a positive attitude and not the negatives of the situation. Better to say, "What I can do is..." and demonstrate that you care and want to provide quality service despite your current limitations.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"I Don't Know":</h4>
                        <p>Good service means never to say, "I don't know." When a customer hears "I don't know," they understand as "I don't feel like finding the information you need." Better to say, "I'll find out for you," or "Let me look into this and get back to you as soon as possible."</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"That's Not My Job," or "That's Not My Department":</h4>
                        <p>When a customer asks you to do something that you do not know how to do or do not have the authority to do, better to make the customer the person or department that can help him/her solve the problem. Better to say, "Let me transfer you to the person who can immediately help you with your problem."</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"You are right. That's bad.":</h4>
                        <p>Many inexperienced customer service representatives respond by sympathizing with the customer, hoping that he/she will win over the customer, rather than actually doing something to solve the customer's problem. If a customer expresses annoyance or frustration, do not make it worse by commiserating, expressing sympathy, or condemning with him/her. Empathize with the customer, but learn to solve the problem.</p>

                            <p>Likewise, it does not do your company or organization any good to criticize co-workers or other departments within the company to the customers. A line of disgruntled staff end up making unprofessional and inept companies. Rather, try your best to accommodate the customer. Do not promise anything you cannot deliver, but do try to serve the customer well. Better to say, "I understand your frustration, and I see how we can solve this problem."</p>

                        <p>When customers are upset or angry, they will eventually calm down. Telling them to "Calm Down!" is belittling and often serves only to irritate them further. Better to say, "I'm sorry." This is one of the ideal phrases for customer service, it helps to placate the anger of customers and allows you to begin the process of solving a customer complaint or request.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"I'm Busy Right Now":</h4>
                        <p>It's not easy to handle customers. You are often handling one customer when another calls or visits your service area. Asking a customer to be patient or polite or asking them to wait is very different from putting them off, saying you are too busy to help. Leaving them standing there or on phone is said to be a great sin of customer service. "Being too busy" is tantamount to saying that you do not care, and they are not important. Let the customer know they are important, and you are aware of their presence. Better to say, "I'll be with you in one moment," or "Please hold, and I'll be right with you."</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"Call Me Back":</h4>
                        <p>You should always call the customer back because you want their business and are responsible for their request. Being proactive is part of good customer service.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"That's Not My Fault":</h4>
                        <p>If an angry customer accuses you of creating a problem (rightly or wrongly), the natural reaction is to defend oneself. However, this is not the effective course of action. The customer has a problem that needs to be solved. By rehashing the need to defend yourself and focusing on the needs of the customer, you can resolve the problem faster and with less stress and confrontation. Better to say, "Let's see what we can do about this problem."</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"You Need to Talk to My Supervisor":</h4>
                        <p>This is a sign of bad customer service that has angered and frustrated many customers for years. Customers often ask for things outside the scope of your work, or authority, or may be even outside the services/products provided by your company. While passing off these requests to your manager is a legitimate option, it is better if you attempt to solve the problem yourself. For example, if you directly go to the supervisor yourself and obtain a solution. You become a service hero for the customer and the supervisor. Better to say, "Let me find out for you."</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">"You Want it by When?":</h4>
                        <p>Customers often make unrealistic demands, especially when it comes to time. Your first reaction may be annoyance, and you may want to make a mocking or sarcastic comment. However, the helpful approach is to avoid displaying a negative attitude and making a poor impression. Better to say, "I will get back to you as soon as I find out."</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">RATER Model of Customer Service</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The RATER model is derived from SERVQUAL (Service Quality), a service quality model developed by Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry.</p>
                        <p>The RATER model was published in their book, "Delivering Quality Service: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations."</p>
                        <p>The RATER model is used to measure customer expectations and the 5 dimensions that customers consider when using a service. It is a condensed version of the original SERVQUAL instrument, which had 10 dimensions, namely: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, competence, courtesy, credibility, security, access, communication, and understanding the customer.</p>
                        <p>According to the RATER framework, your customers evaluate your business based on 5 dimensions (metrics), either conscious or unconscious. These include:</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reliability</h3>
                        <p>This is the ability to provide dependable services accurately, regularly, and on time. Reliability is the most important service dimension in the RATER model.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">For instance:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When you don't offer services to your customers as they expect, your company won't be reliable to them.</li>
                            <li>When you can't deliver products on time, when your product doesn't offer what it claims, etc., this is when your customers will clearly say that your company/organization is not reliable.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The service that your organization delivers should be communicated clearly. You need to create customer expectations based on what service you will offer them.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">How to improve service reliability:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Communicate with your customers. The more you tell them, the better.</li>
                            <li>Be clear and transparent.</li>
                            <li>Take customer feedback and see what they think of your business.</li>
                            <li>Ensure marketing efforts do not create too much hype.</li>
                            <li>Keep expectations low and deliver more. Do not raise the bar too high in terms of building customer expectations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assurance</h3>

                        <p>Meeting customer expectations begins when you can show them that you are trustworthy and know what you are doing.</p>
                        <p>This includes answering customer inquiries and concerns effectively and professionally.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">How to make your customers trust you:</h4>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Tangibles do not always mean something that has a physical appearance. Rather, it refers to the image of your business. For example, if you have an e-commerce store, the tangibles will include your website (online store), product photos, website layout, product descriptions, payment methods that you allow, customer support, etc. If you own a laundromat, tangibles will include your office vehicles, staff uniform, etc.</p>
