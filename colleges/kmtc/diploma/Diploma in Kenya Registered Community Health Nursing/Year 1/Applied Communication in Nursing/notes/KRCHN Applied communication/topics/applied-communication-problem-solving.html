                        <p>Nursing students are generally trained to acquire the knowledge, skills, and approaches required for solving problems and contradictions in life and at the workplace. When employers talk about problem-solving skills, they are often referring to the ability to handle difficult or unexpected situations in the workplace as well as complex business challenges. Organizations rely on people who can assess different kinds of situations and can identify solutions. Problem-solving skills are transferable to many areas of life, e.g., relationship building and day-to-day decision making.</p>
                        <p>A nurse's ability to handle difficult situations depends on their knowledge, skills, and also attitude. In other words, nurses can function creatively in nurse-patient relationships. They can overcome personal and professional restrictions by demonstrating acceptable emotions and thought, probably through emotional intelligence. Nurses with high emotional intelligence can manage their feelings and emotions and make goal-oriented decisions. Low emotional intelligence, on the other hand, reduces the level of happiness and health and problem-solving ability in nurses.</p>

                        <p>A solution is usually defined as the achievement of a specific goal following a series of actions to reach the goal (Wickens, 2004, p. 354).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Problem-solving skills help you determine the source of a problem and find an effective solution. Some key problem-solving skills include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Active listening</li>
                            <li>Analysis</li>
                            <li>Research</li>
                            <li>Creativity</li>
                            <li>Communication</li>
                            <li>Dependability</li>
                            <li>Decision-making</li>
                            <li>Team-building</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Problem-solving skills are important in every career at every level. As a result, effective problem solving may also require industry or job-specific technical skills. For instance, a registered nurse will need active listening and communication skills when interacting with patients but will also need effective technical knowledge skills related to diseases and medications. In many cases, a nurse will need to know when to consult a doctor regarding a patient's medical needs as part of the solution.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Problem-Solving Skills Examples</h3>
                        <p>To solve a problem effectively, you will likely use a few different skills. Here are a few examples of skills you may use when solving a problem:</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Research</h4>
                        <p>Researching is an essential skill related to problem-solving. As a problem solver, you need to be able to identify the cause of the issue and understand it fully. You can begin to gather more information about a problem by brainstorming with other team members, consulting more experienced colleagues, or acquiring knowledge through online research or courses.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Analysis</h4>
                        <p>The first step to solving any problem is to analyze the situation. Your analytical skills will help you understand problems and effectively develop solutions. You will also need analytical skills during research to help distinguish between effective and ineffective solutions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Decision-making</h4>
                        <p>Ultimately, you will need to make a decision about how to solve problems that arise. At times, and with industry experience, you may be able to make a decision quickly. Sound research and analytical skills can help those who have less experience in their field. There may also be times when it is appropriate to take some time to craft a solution or escalate the issue to someone more capable of solving it.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Communication</h4>
                        <p>When identifying possible solutions, you will need to know how to communicate the problem to others. You will also need to know what communication channels are the most appropriate when seeking assistance. Once you find a solution, communicating it clearly will help reduce any confusion and make implementing a solution easier.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dependability</h4>
                        <p>Dependability is one of the most important skills for problem-solvers. Solving problems in a timely manner is essential. Employers highly value individuals they can trust to both identify and then implement solutions as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>In early stages of problem solving, you need to have strong observational skills. Rather than accepting issues at face value, you need to demonstrate lateral thinking and analytical abilities. This will help you to assess what's going on and pinpoint the core cause of the issue.</p>
                        <p>As you explore potential solutions, you must demonstrate persistence, finding the right approach to the issue by innovative critical thinking.</p>
                        <p>You must demonstrate resilience to withstand inevitable pushback from resistance to change.</p>
                        <p>Both communication and negotiation are important at this point.</p>
                        <p>Once you have implemented your solution, you will need to utilize critical thinking and attention to detail skills as you assess the results and ensure that the problem is resolved successfully.</p>
