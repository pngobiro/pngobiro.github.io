\section*{CRITICAL THINKING}

\section*{Introduction}
-Critical thinking refers to the ability to analyse information objectively and make a reasoned judgement .it involves the evaluation of sources, such as data, facts, observable phenomena and research findings.
-ability to think in an organized manner in order to understand connections between ideas and facts.
-Critical thinking is the process that allows nurses to see the big picture (envision the overall perspective) instead of focusing only on details.
-Every day, nurses make decisions that are derived through critical thinking.
-Making clinical judgments relies on critical thinking.

\section*{Skills needed in critical Thinking}

Interpretation - understanding the meaning of information or events.
Analysis -ability to carefully examine something, whether it is a problem or a set of data, understand what it means and properly explain to others the implication of that information based on objective and subjective data.

Evaluation-assessing the value of information and its credibility.
Explanation -translating complicated and often complex medical information to patients and families in a way they can make decision about patient care.

Inference -reach a conclusion or opinion
Self -regulation -avoiding the impact of unconscious bias with cognitive awareness.

\section*{Essential elements of critical thinking}

Keep an open mind
Use rationale to support opinions or decisions
Reflect on thoughts before reaching a conclusion
Use past clinical experience to build knowledge
Gather complete information
Understand and define all terms
Question the methods by which the facts are derived

Question the conclusion
Look for hidden assumptions and biases
Question the source of facts
Examine the big picture

\section*{Components of critical thinking}

Critical thinking is composed of three primary components:
- Mental operations,
- Knowledge,
- Attitudes.

\section*{Mental operations}
- Include activities such as decision making and reasoning that are used to find or create meaning.
- Nurses engage in such activities when they search for solutions based on sound rationale and develop outcomes accordingly.
- The result of these mental operations is creative and appropriate problem solving.

\section*{Knowledge}
- Critical thinking calls for a knowledge base that includes declarative knowledge, (specific facts or information) and operative knowledge (an understanding of the nature of that knowledge).
- Nursing education assists the student in learning specific facts about nursing and the delivery of quality care.
- Students are taught how to examine the beliefs underlying the facts in order to analyze and interpret those facts.

\section*{Attitude}
- Certain attitudes enhance a person's ability to think critically.
- One of the most important attitudes needed by a critical thinker is a sense of curiosity that allows the person to question assumptions upon which decisions are based.
-Analysis of basic assumptions allows the learner to plan and act in a rational manner rather than out of habit or routine

Intellectual humility (knowing that one does not have all the answers)

\section*{Attitude of a critical thinker}
. Tolerance, open-mindedness, nonjudgmental mind-set
- Curiosity
- Persistence, intellectual courage; proactive instead of reactive
- Respect for others' perspectives; flexible
- Comfort dealing with ambiguity, uncertainty
- Self-confidence (belief in own ability to think things through and make appropriate decisions)

\section*{Development of critical thinking}

Identify goals;
Determine what knowledge is required;
Assess the margin for error;
Determine the amount of time available for decision making;
Identify available resources. Interpretation: Categorize, decode sentences, and clarify meanings;

Analysis: Examine ideas, identify and analyze arguments;
Influence: Query evidence, conjecture alternatives, draw conclusions;
Explanation: State results, justify procedures, present arguments;
Evaluation: Assess claims, assess arguments;

\section*{Steps of Critical Thinking}
(i) Identify the problem or question

Be precise as possible, the narrower the issue, the easier it is to find solutions or answers.
(ii) Gather data, opinions and arguments

Try to find several sources that present different ideas and point of view.
(iii) Analyse and evaluate the data

Are the sources reliable?, is there enough information to support given hypothesis
(iv) Identify assumptions

Are you sure the sources you found are unbiased? are your sure you weren't biased in your search for answers?
(v) Establish significance

What piece of information is most important?
Are all opinions and arguments even relevant to the problem you're trying to solve?
(vi) Make a decision /reach a conclusion

Identify various conclusions that are possible and decide which of them are sufficiently supported. weigh strengths and limitations of all possible options.
(vii) Present or communicate

Once you have reached a conclusion, present it to all stakeholders

\section*{Reasons to improve critical thinking.}
-Things aren't what they used to be or what they will be.
-Patients are sicker, with multiple problems.
-More consumer involvement (patients and families).
- Nurses must be able to move from one setting to another.
- Rapid change and information explosion requires us to develop new learning and workplace skills.
-Consumers and payers demand to see evidence of benefits, efficiency, and results.
-Today's progress often creates new problems that can't be solved by old ways of thinking.
- Redesigning care delivery and nursing curricula is useless if students and nurses don't have the thinking skills required to deal with today's world.

\section*{Examples of critical thinking in Nursing}
1. Prioritizing

Nurses decide which patient to see first based on the information gathered, and from there they must prioritize their actions when in a patient's room.
A critical thinking in prioritization create smooth workflow management to set priorities and help nurses manage time.

\section*{2. Patient assessment}

Doing a thorough assessment on patient can help detect that something is wrong. when change is noticed, the nurse uses critical thinking skills to decide what is the next step. critical thinking allows the nurse to provide the best and safest care possible.

\section*{2. Reflection skills}

It is part of the critical thinking process referring specifically to the process of analyzing and making judgements about what has happened. -it is when you look back on something and decide how you are going to change it.
-true reflection involves the process of observing oneself and the behaviors, thoughts and feelings that are involved in an interaction or event and using those observations to inform future practice.

\section*{Reflection involves}
-questioning what, why and how one does things and asking what, why and how others do things.
-keeping an open mind
-comparing and contrasting
-seeking underlying rationale
-viewing from various perspectives
-asking yourself what if?
-asking others for ideas
-considering consequences
-seeking, identifying and resolving problems.

\section*{Reflective questions}
-What prior knowledge did I have?
-how did I act during the event?
-what did I learnt from the event that I did not know before?
-what links can I make between my experience and other ideas from my studies?
- How can I use the knowledge I have gained from this event /experience in the future?
-are there other interpretations of event? do I need to consider them?
-What are the implication of what happened?
-if I distance myself from the event and observe my reactions to it, does it change my perspective?
-Based on what I have learned; how should I act in future?
- what other information do I need in order to understand the implications of the event?
-what is the best way to go forward?
- looking back, would I have done things differently? if so, what and why?

\section*{Reflection model}

It helps to identify what you have learned from the experience and how it relates to the theory that you have been thought or researched.

Gibb's model of reflection (1988)

\section*{Example}

\section*{Introduction}

What the essay about
What you are focusing on
Why this is important
What is the background

\section*{Description}

I moved out of my family home and moved into college accommodation and started my course.

\section*{Feelings}

I was feeling really anxious and worried, lonely and scared. I was worried I would be alone

\section*{Evaluation}

I made a lot friends, developed as a person and a I am very happy. I miss home and I am carried over by assignments and deadlines.

\section*{Analysis}

I realized that I was worrying for no reason and that everyone I have met in my house and on my course are lovely.

\section*{Conclusion}

I should have spoken more in group chat before we enrolled at college for my course

\section*{Action plan}

To be confident, start assignment as soon as it is set and to step out of your comfort zone.

\section*{Challenges in reflective thinking}
-It can be tedious
-can get stuck in the process
-need to be able to remember correctly
-need to have confidence in own views.

\section*{3. Problem solving skills}

Problem solving is a process which involves systemic observation and critical thinking to find an appropriate solution or way to reach the desired goal.

\section*{Skills required to solve a problem}

Observation skills - refers to collecting data, understanding and interpreting the meaning of the information using all the senses.
-critical thinking skills-involves individual's ability to do logical reasoning, analytical thinking, decision making and synthesizing to solve problem.
- decision making skills -help professionals quickly choose between two or more alternatives after evaluating the pros and cons of each.
- communication skills -you must be able to successfully communicate the problem to others as well as your recommendations for a solution. Involves active listening, verbal communication, written communication.
-collaboration -allows one to work well with others towards a common goal.it involves emotional intelligence, curiosity, conflict resolution, respect and sensitivity.
- open mindedness -enables one to look at things from different angles and consider alternatives when necessary .it involves curiosity, acceptance, eagerness to learn and awareness
-analytical skills - allows an individual to better understand an issue and come up with effective solutions based on evidence and facts.

\section*{Problem solving steps}

\section*{1. Identify the problem}

This stage requires analysis of the current situation, identification of the problem, evaluative why the problem is occurring and assessing who the problem is affecting it also involves looking at any contributing factors that are directly influencing the problem and where they are coming from.

\section*{2. look for solutions}

Generate several possible solutions that could remedy the issue. it involves brainstorming, prediction and forecasting.

\section*{3. choose a solution}

Carefully analyse each solution and select the most appropriate one .it requires strong decision making skills, especially when there are multiple solutions on table.

\section*{4. Implementation of the solution}

After one solution has been chosen, it is now time to implement this solution to the problem.
5. monitoring progress -Progress must be monitored to ensure the solution is effective. monitor how well the solution is working as well as ask for feedback from others who are directly affected by the changes that were made.
