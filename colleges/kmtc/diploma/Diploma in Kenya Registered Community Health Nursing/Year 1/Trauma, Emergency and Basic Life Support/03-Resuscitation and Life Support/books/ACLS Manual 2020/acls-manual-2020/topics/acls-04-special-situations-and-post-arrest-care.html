                        <h3>Treating VF/pVT in Accidental Hypothermia</h3>
                        <p>Defibrillation is appropriate for cardiac arrest patients in VF/pVT with severe accidental hypothermia (a body temperature of less than 30°C [86°F]). If a patient does not respond to the initial shock, it is reasonable to perform additional defibrillation attempts by using BLS guidelines while actively rewarming. Hypothermic patients may have a reduced rate of drug metabolism, and drugs may accumulate to toxic levels with standard dosing regimens. It is reasonable to consider administering a vasopressor according to the standard ACLS algorithm while rewarming, although evidence does not support using antiarrhythmic drug therapy for hypothermic patients in cardiac arrest.</p>
                        <p>For patients in cardiac arrest with severe accidental hypothermia in-hospital, aim ACLS treatment at rapid core rewarming.</p>
                        <p>For patients in cardiac arrest with moderate hypothermia (30°C to 34°C [86°F to 93.2°F]), start CPR, attempt defibrillation, give medications according to local protocols, and, if in-hospital, provide active core rewarming.</p>

                        <h3>Respiratory or Cardiac Arrest Associated With Opioid Overdose</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the United States, between 2000 and 2014, there was a 200% increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opioids.<sup>18</sup> In 2018, approximately 46,800 people died of opioid toxicity in the United States.<sup>19</sup> Most of these deaths were associated with prescription opioids. In Canada, more than 12,800 deaths were attributed to opioids between January 2016 and March 2019.<sup>20</sup></li>
                            <li>Isolated opioid toxicity is associated with central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression that can progress to respiratory and cardiac arrest. Most opioid deaths involve ingesting multiple drugs or having medical and mental health comorbidities.<sup>21-23</sup> In addition, methadone and propoxyphene can cause torsades de pointes, and cardiotoxicity has been reported with other opioids.<sup>24-30</sup> Except in specific clinical settings (eg, unintended opioid overdose during a medical procedure), rescuers cannot be certain that the patient's clinical condition is due to opioid-induced CNS and respiratory depression toxicity alone.</li>
                            <li>Naloxone is a potent opioid receptor antagonist in the brain, spinal cord, and GI system. Naloxone has an excellent safety profile and can rapidly reverse CNS and respiratory depression in a patient with an opioid-associated resuscitative emergency. Depending on their training and clinical circumstance, rescuers can administer naloxone intravenously,<sup>31-34</sup> intramuscularly,<sup>31,32,35</sup> intranasally,<sup>33,35-39</sup> or subcutaneously;<sup>40</sup> nebulize it for inhalation;<sup>41,42</sup> or instill it into the bronchial tree via ET tube.<sup>43</sup></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Management of Opioid-Associated Life-Threatening Emergency</h4>
                        <p>Refer to the following steps in the Opioid-Associated Emergency for Healthcare Providers Algorithm (Figure 50) to manage an opioid-associated life-threatening emergency.</p>

                        <h3>ECPR (for VF/pVT/Asystole/PEA)</h3>
                        <p>ECPR refers to venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during cardiac arrest. ECPR techniques require adequate vascular access and specialized equipment (Figure 51). By using ECPR, providers may support vital organs with perfusion and gas exchange while reversible causes of cardiac arrest (eg, acute coronary artery occlusion, PE, refractory VF, profound hypothermia, cardiac injury, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, drug intoxication) are treated. ECPR can also serve as a bridge for LV assist device implantation or cardiac transplantation.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_21_c92b8724167b2e24a5feg-210-1.jpg" alt="Schematic depiction of an ECMO circuit for ECPR, showing a venous cannula, pump, oxygenator, and arterial cannula." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Currently, ECPR requires vascular access with large bore cannulas inserted into the central vasculature, specialized equipment, and expertise in using ECMO, but evidence suggests a benefit to survival and favorable neurologic outcome with the use of ECPR when compared with conventional CPR in patients with refractory cardiac arrest.</p>
                        <p>Consider ECPR in settings where the necessary equipment and trained personnel can be deployed rapidly for select cardiac arrest patients with known or suspected reversible causes of cardiac arrest in whom conventional ACLS has failed.</p>

                        <h3>Cardiac Arrest Associated With Pregnancy</h3>
                        <h4>Background</h4>
                        <p>During attempted resuscitation of a pregnant woman, providers have 2 potential patients: the mother and the fetus. The best hope for fetal survival is maternal survival. For the critically ill pregnant patient, rescuers must provide appropriate resuscitation with consideration of the physiologic changes due to pregnancy.</p>

                        <p>To treat the critically ill pregnant patient:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place the patient in the left-lateral decubitus position to relieve possible compression of the inferior vena cava.</li>
                            <li>Assess for hypotension; maternal hypotension that warrants therapy is defined as an SBP less than 100 mm Hg or less than 80% of baseline.</li>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>ACLS providers increasingly recognize that systematic post-cardiac arrest care after ROSC can improve the likelihood of patient survival with good quality of life. Studies also show that most deaths occur during the first 24 hours after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, so post-cardiac arrest care has a significant potential to reduce early mortality caused by hemodynamic instability as well as later morbidity and mortality caused by multiorgan failure and brain injury.</p>
                        <p>This case focuses on managing and optimizing cardiopulmonary function and perfusing vital organs after ROSC.</p>

                        <h3>Application of the Adult Post-Cardiac Arrest Care Algorithm</h3>
                        <h4>Optimize Ventilation and Oxygenation</h4>
                        <p>Step 2 directs you to ensure an adequate airway and support breathing immediately after ROSC. An unconscious/unresponsive patient requires an advanced airway to mechanically support breathing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use continuous quantitative waveform capnography to confirm and monitor correct placement of the ET tube.</li>
                            <li>Use the lowest inspired oxygen concentration that will maintain arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation 92% to 98%.</li>
                            <li>Avoid excessive ventilation of the patient. You may begin ventilation at 10/min and adjust to achieve a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 35 to 45 mm Hg.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Treat Hypotension (SBP Less Than 90 mm Hg)</h4>
                        <p>Step 2 directs you to treat hypotension when SBP is less than 90 mm Hg. Treat hypotension as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>IV bolus:</strong> 1 to 2 L normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution</li>
                            <li><strong>Norepinephrine:</strong> 0.1 to 0.5 mcg/kg per minute IV infusion</li>
                            <li><strong>Epinephrine:</strong> 2 to 10 mcg per minute IV infusion</li>
                            <li><strong>Dopamine:</strong> 5 to 20 mcg/kg per minute IV infusion</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>STEMI Is Present or High Suspicion of AMI</h4>
                        <p>Both in-hospital and out-of-hospital medical personnel should obtain a 12-lead ECG as soon as possible after ROSC to identify those patients with STEMI or a high suspicion of AMI. Begin aggressive treatment, including coronary reperfusion with PCI, if you detect STEMI after ROSC, regardless of coma or TTM.</p>
                        <h4>Following Commands</h4>
                        <p>Step 5 directs you to examine the patient's ability to follow verbal commands. If the patient does not follow commands, the high-performance team should consider implementing TTM, obtaining a brain CT, performing EEG monitoring, and providing other critical-care management (Step 6). If the patient can follow verbal commands, move to Step 7.</p>
                        <h4>Targeted Temperature Management</h4>
                        <p>TTM is the only intervention demonstrated to improve neurologic recovery after cardiac arrest. To protect the brain and other organs, the high-performance team should start TTM in patients who remain comatose with ROSC after cardiac arrest. For TTM, healthcare providers should select and maintain a constant target temperature between 32°C and 36°C for at least 24 hours.</p>
                        <h3>Neuroprognostication</h3>
                        <p>Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in survivors of OHCA. Accurate neurologic prognostication is important to avoid inappropriate withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients who may otherwise achieve meaningful neurologic recovery. Because any single method of neuroprognostication has an intrinsic error rate, multiple modalities should be used to improve decision-making accuracy.</p>
