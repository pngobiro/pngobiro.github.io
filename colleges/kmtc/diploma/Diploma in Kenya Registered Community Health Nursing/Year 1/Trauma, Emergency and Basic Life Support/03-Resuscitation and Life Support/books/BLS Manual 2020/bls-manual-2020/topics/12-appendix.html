                            <dd>A lifesaving emergency procedure for a victim who has signs of cardiac arrest (ie, unresponsive, no normal breathing, and no pulse). The 2 key components of CPR are chest compressions and breaths.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Chest compression fraction (CCF)</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>The proportion of time that rescuers perform chest compressions during CPR. A CCF of at least 60% increases the likelihood of return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Chest recoil</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>When the chest reexpands and comes back up to its normal position after a chest compression.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Child</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>1 year of age to puberty (signs of puberty are chest or underarm hair in males; any breast development in females).</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Defibrillation</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>Interrupting or stopping an abnormal heart rhythm by using controlled electrical shocks.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Gastric inflation (gastric distention)</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>When the stomach fills with air during CPR; it is more likely to occur when the victim's airway isn't positioned properly, and air from ventilation goes into the stomach instead of the lungs.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Hands-Only CPR</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>Providing chest compressions without rescue breathing during CPR.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Head tilt-chin lift</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>A maneuver used to open a victim's airway before providing rescue breaths during CPR.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Heart attack</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>When a blockage or spasm occurs in a blood vessel and severely restricts or cuts off the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart muscle.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Infant</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>A child younger than 1 year of age (excluding newly born infants in the delivery room).</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Jaw thrust</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>A maneuver used to open a victim's airway before providing rescue breaths during CPR; used when the victim may have a spinal injury or when a head tilt-chin lift doesn't work.</dd>
                             <dt><dfn>Naloxone</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>An antidote that partially or completely reverses the effects of an opioid overdose, including respiratory depression.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Opioids</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>A class of drugs that produces narcotic effects of pain relief; includes prescription drugs (hydrocodone, fentanyl, morphine) and illegal drugs (heroin).</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>When a victim of cardiac arrest resumes a sustained heartbeat that produces palpable pulses. Signs of ROSC include breathing, coughing, or movement and a palpable pulse or measurable blood pressure.</dd>
                            <dt><dfn>Telecommunicator CPR (T-CPR)</dfn></dt>
                            <dd>Live, instant instructions provided over the phone by a telecommunicator (eg, dispatcher or emergency call taker) to a 9-1-1 caller.</dd>
