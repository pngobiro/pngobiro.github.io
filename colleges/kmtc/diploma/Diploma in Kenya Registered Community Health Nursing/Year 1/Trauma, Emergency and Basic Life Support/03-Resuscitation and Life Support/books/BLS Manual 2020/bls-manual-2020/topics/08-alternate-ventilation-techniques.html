                        <p>As a BLS provider, you may be called on to help provide CPR in situations that require alternate ventilation techniques.

If a victim is unresponsive and not breathing but has a pulse, you will need to know how to perform rescue breathing.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Respiratory arrest occurs when normal breathing stops, preventing essential oxygen supply and carbon dioxide exchange. Lack of oxygen to the brain eventually causes a person to become unresponsive.</li>
                            <li>Rescuers can identify respiratory arrest if all of the following signs are present:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The victim is unresponsive</li>
                                    <li>The victim is not breathing or is only gasping</li>
                                    <li>The victim still has a pulse</li>

                            <li>Respiratory arrest is an emergency. Without immediate treatment, it can result in brain injury, cardiac arrest, and death.</li>
                            <li>In certain situations, including opioid-associated life-threatening emergencies, respiratory arrest is potentially reversible if rescuers treat it early. (See Part 9 for more about opioids.)</li>
                            <li>BLS providers must be able to quickly identify respiratory arrest, activate the emergency response system, and begin rescue breathing. Quick action can prevent the development of cardiac arrest.</li>

                        <p>Many cardiac arrests happen in settings where rescue equipment is not available. This section describes techniques for giving breaths when you do not have a barrier device, such as a pocket mask or a bag-mask device.</p>

                        <h3>Mouth-to-Mouth Breathing for Adults and Children</h3>
                        <p>Mouth-to-mouth breathing is a quick, effective technique to provide oxygen to an unresponsive adult or child. Follow these steps to give mouth-to-mouth breaths to adults and children:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hold the victim's airway open with a head tilt-chin lift.</li>
                            <li>Pinch the nose closed with your thumb and index finger (using the hand on the forehead).</li>
                            <li>Take a regular (not deep) breath and seal your lips around the victim's mouth, creating an airtight seal (Figure 36).</li>
                            <li>Deliver 1 breath over 1 second. Watch for the chest to rise as you give the breath.</li>
                            <li>If the chest does not rise, repeat the head tilt-chin lift.</li>
                            <li>Give a second breath (blow for about 1 second). Watch for the chest to rise.</li>
                            <li>If you are unable to ventilate the victim after 2 attempts, promptly return to chest compressions.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Breathing Techniques for Infants</h3>
                        <p>Use one of the following techniques to give breaths in infants:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mouth-to-mouth-and-nose</li>
                            <li>Mouth-to-mouth</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The preferred technique for infants is mouth-to-mouth-and-nose. However, if you cannot cover the infant's nose and mouth with your mouth, use the mouth-to-mouth technique instead.</p>

                        <h4>Mouth-to-Mouth-and-Nose Technique</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Maintain a head tilt-chin lift to keep the airway open.</li>
                            <li>Place your mouth over the infant's mouth and nose and create an airtight seal (Figure 37).</li>
                            <li>Blow into the infant's nose and mouth (pausing to inhale between breaths), just enough to make the chest rise with each breath.</li>
                            <li>If the chest does not rise, repeat the head tilt-chin lift to reopen the airway, and then try again to give a breath that makes the chest rise. It may be necessary to move the infant's head through a range of positions to provide effective breaths. When the airway is open, give breaths that make the chest rise.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Maintain a head tilt-chin lift to keep the airway open.</li>
                            <li>Pinch the victim's nose tightly with your thumb and forefinger.</li>
                            <li>Make a mouth-to-mouth seal.</li>
                            <li>Deliver each mouth-to-mouth breath, making sure the chest rises with each breath.</li>
                            <li>If the chest does not rise, repeat the head tilt-chin lift to reopen the airway. It may be necessary to move the infant's head through a range of positions to provide effective breaths. When the airway is open, give breaths that make the chest rise.</li>

                        <p>If you give breaths too quickly or with too much force, air is likely to enter the stomach rather than the lungs. This can cause gastric inflation (filling of the stomach with air).</p>
                        <p>Gastric inflation frequently develops during mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mask, or bag-mask ventilation. It can result in serious complications. To reduce the risk of gastric inflation, avoid giving breaths too quickly, too forcefully, or with too much volume. But even if you give breaths correctly during high-quality CPR, gastric inflation may still develop.</p>
                        <p>To reduce the risk of gastric inflation:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Deliver each breath over 1 second</li>
                            <li>Deliver just enough air to make the victim's chest rise</li>
