                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Understanding normal cardiac anatomy and physiology is an important component of performing PALS. The heart is a hollow muscle comprised of four chambers surrounded by thick walls of tissue (septum). The atria are the two upper chambers, and the ventricles are the two lower chambers. The left and right halves of the heart work together to pump blood throughout the body. The right atrium (RA) and the right ventricle (RV) pump deoxygenated blood to the lungs where it becomes oxygenated. This oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium (LA) and then enters the left ventricle (LV). The LV is the main pump that delivers the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_22_f18021efac27ef18a30fg-15-1.jpg" alt="Diagram of the human heart showing the four chambers and the path of blood flow." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Blood leaves the heart through a large vessel known as the aorta. Valves between each pair of connected chambers prevent the backflow of blood. The two atria contract simultaneously, as do the ventricles, making the contractions of the heart go from top to bottom. Each beat begins in the RA. The LV is the largest and thickest-walled of the four chambers, as it is responsible for pumping the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body. The sinoatrial (SA) node in the RA creates the electrical activity that acts as the heart's natural pacemaker. This electrical impulse then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, which lies between the atria and ventricles. After pausing there briefly, the electrical impulse moves on to the His-Purkinje system, which acts like wiring to conduct the electrical signal into the LV and RV. This electrical signal causes the heart muscle to contract and pump blood.</p>
                        <p>By understanding the normal electrical function of the heart, it will be easy to understand abnormal functions. When blood enters the atria of the heart, an electrical impulse that is sent out from the SA node conducts through the atria resulting in atrial contraction.</p>
                        <p>This atrial contraction registers on an electrocardiogram (ECG) strip as the P wave. This impulse then travels to the AV node, which in turn conducts the electrical impulse through the Bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers of the ventricles causing ventricular contraction. The time between the start of atrial contraction and the start of ventricular contraction registers on an ECG strip as the PR interval. The ventricular contraction registers on the ECG strip as the QRS complex. Following ventricular contraction, the ventricles rest and repolarize, which is registered on the ECG strip as the T wave. The atria also repolarize, but this coincides with the QRS complex, and therefore, cannot be observed on the ECG strip. Together a P wave, QRS complex, and T wave at proper intervals are indicative of normal sinus rhythm (NSR) (Figure 5). Abnormalities that are in the conduction system can cause delays in the transmission of the electrical impulse and are detected on the ECG. These deviations from normal conduction can result in dysrhythmias such as heart blocks, pauses, tachycardias and bradycardias, blocks, and dropped beats. These rhythm disturbances will be covered in more detail further in the handbook.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>When you find an unresponsive child or infant, it is often not possible to immediately deduce the etiology. You will want to act quickly, decisively, and apply interventions that fit the needs of the individual at that moment. In order to achieve this, PALS was designed for providers to take a comprehensive approach.</p>
                        <p>While there are various causes for a child or an infant to become unresponsive, the central issues that need to be addressed include keeping blood pumping through the vasculature (perfusion) and supplying oxygen to the lungs (oxygenation). When the child or infant is experiencing poor perfusion and oxygenation, CPR manually takes over for the heart and lungs. If they are still adequately maintaining perfusion and oxygenation but are unresponsive, then rapid diagnosis and treatment may be possible without CPR.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_22_f18021efac27ef18a30fg-16-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the Evaluate-Identify-Intervene sequence." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px; margin: auto; display: block;">
                        </figure>
                        <p>It is important to differentiate normal breathing from gasping (agonal breathing). Gasping is considered ineffective breathing.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, not all pulses are adequate. The rule of thumb is that at least 60 beats per minute is required to maintain adequate perfusion in a child or an infant.</p>
                        <p>The assessment must be carried out quickly. There is a low threshold for administering ventilation and/or compressions if there is evidence that the child or infant cannot do either effectively on their own.</p>
                        <p>If the problem is respiratory in nature (ineffective breathing with adequate pulses), then initiation of rescue breathing is warranted. If breathing is ineffective and pulses are inadequate, begin high-quality CPR immediately. It is important to understand that any case can change at any time, so you must reevaluate periodically and adjust the approach to treatment accordingly. Use CPR to support breathing and circulation until the cause has been identified and effectively treated.</p>

Always be vigilant for any indication to initiate high-quality CPR and look for life-threatening events such as respiratory distress, a change in consciousness, or cyanosis.</p>

                        <h3>CIRCULATION</h3>
                        <p>Assessment of circulation in pediatrics involves more than checking the pulse and blood pressure. The color and temperature of the skin and mucous membranes can help to assess effective circulation. Pale or blue skin indicates poor tissue perfusion. Capillary refill time is also a useful assessment in pediatrics. Adequately, perfused skin will rapidly refill with blood after it is squeezed (e.g. by bending the tip of the finger at the nail bed). Inadequately perfused tissues will take longer than two seconds to respond. Abnormally, cool skin can also suggest poor circulation.</p>
                        <p>The normal heart rate and blood pressure in pediatrics are quite different than in adults and change with age. Likewise, heart rates are slower when children and infants are asleep. Most centers will have acceptable ranges that they use for normal and abnormal heart rates for a given age. While you should follow your local guidelines, approximate ranges are listed in (Table 5).</p>

                        <h3>DISABILITY</h3>
                        <p>In PALS, disability refers to performing a rapid neurological assessment. A great deal of information can be gained from determining the level of consciousness on a four-level scale. Pupillary response to light is also a fast and useful way to assess neurological function.</p>

                        <h3>EXPOSURE</h3>
                        <p>Exposure is classically most important when you are responding to a child or infant who may have experienced trauma; however, it has a place in all PALS evaluations. Exposure reminds the provider to look for signs of trauma, burns, fractures, and any other obvious sign that might provide a clue as to the cause of the current problem. Skin temperature and color can provide information about the child or infant's cardiovascular system, tissue perfusion, and mechanism of injury. If time allows, the PALS provider can look for more subtle signs such as petechiae or bruising. Exposure also reminds the provider that children and infants lose core body temperature faster than adults do. Therefore, while it is important to evaluate the entire body, be sure to cover and warm the individual after the diagnostic survey.</p>

                        <p>After you have progressed through the ABCDE method and have discovered a treatable cause, and the child or infant has not deteriorated to a more severe clinical (life-threatening) situation, move on to performing a more thorough survey. This includes a focused history and physical examination involving the individual, family, and any witnesses as relevant. In terms of history, you could follow the acronym SPAM: Signs and symptoms, Past medical history, Allergies, and Medications (Table 8).</p>
                        <p>The focused examination will be guided by the answers to the focused history. For example, a report of difficult breathing will prompt a thorough airway and lung examination. It may also prompt a portable chest x-ray study in a hospital setting. Key point is that it is best to work from head to toe to complete a comprehensive survey. Make use of diagnostic tools when possible to augment the physical examination.</p>

This usually means providing high-quality CPR. While it is important to recognize and respond to the particular cause of the problem, the time required to determine the problem should not interfere with perfusion and oxygenation for the child or the infant. As you maintain breathing and circulation for them, determine if they are primarily experiencing respiratory distress/arrest, bradycardia, tachycardia, shock, or cardiac arrest.
