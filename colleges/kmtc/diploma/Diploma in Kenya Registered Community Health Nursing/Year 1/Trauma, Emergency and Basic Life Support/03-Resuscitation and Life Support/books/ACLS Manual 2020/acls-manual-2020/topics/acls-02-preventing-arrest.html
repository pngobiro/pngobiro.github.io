                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Rapid Response</h3>
                        <p>Often, nurses, physicians, or family members who are concerned that the patient is deteriorating will activate the rapid response system in the hospital. Some rapid response systems weigh, combine, and score specific physiologic criteria to determine when to act. The following list gives examples of such criteria for adult patients:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airway compromise</li>
                            <li>Respiratory rate less than 6/min or more than 30/min</li>
                            <li>Heart rate less than 40/min or greater than 140/min</li>
                            <li>Systolic blood pressure (SBP) less than 90 mm Hg</li>
                            <li>Symptomatic hypertension</li>
                            <li>Unexpected decrease in level of consciousness</li>
                            <li>Unexplained agitation</li>
                            <li>Seizure</li>
                            <li>Significant decrease in urine output</li>
                            <li>Subjective concern about the patient</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The wide variability in incidence and location of IHCA suggests potential areas for standardizing quality and preventing some cardiac arrests. More than half of IHCAs result from respiratory failure or hypovolemic shock, and changes in physiology such as tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypotension foreshadow most of these events. Therefore, IHCA often represents the progression of physiologic instability and a failure to quickly identify and stabilize the patient. This scenario is more common on the general wards—outside of critical care and procedural areas—where patient-to-nurse ratios are higher and monitoring of patients is less intense. In this setting, intermittent manual vital sign monitoring with less frequent direct observation by clinicians may increase the likelihood of delayed recognition.</p>
                        <p>Over the past decade, hospitals in several countries have designed rapid response systems to identify and treat early clinical deterioration in patients, improving patient outcomes through critical care expertise. The rapid response system has several components:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Event detection and response-triggering arm</li>
                            <li>A planned response arm, such as an RRT or MET</li>
                            <li>Quality monitoring</li>
                            <li>Administrative support</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>RRTs and METs</h4>
                        <p>Hospitals established RRTs or METs to provide early intervention in patients whose conditions are deteriorating, with the goal of preventing IHCA.<sup>1,2</sup> These teams can include physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists who have the critical care experience and skills to intervene in life-threatening situations. They are typically asked to see any patient who is identified as deteriorating, no matter who reports that deterioration: staff members, the family, or the patient. These teams bring monitoring and resuscitation equipment to perform a rapid patient assessment, and they initiate appropriate treatment and drug therapies to reverse physiologic deterioration and prevent poor outcomes, much like EMS services intervening when called in the prehospital setting.</p>
                        <h4>Published Studies</h4>
                        <p>Although the ideal composition of METs or RRTs is not known, many published before-and-after studies of METs or RRTs have reported a drop in the rate of cardiac arrests after these teams intervene.<sup>3,4</sup> Although some studies have not reported a decrease in overall mortality with the introduction of these teams,<sup>5</sup> there may be other benefits, such as improved end-of-life care, because these teams may initiate discussions with patients and families before cardiac arrest, preventing unwanted interventions in critically ill patients.</p>
                        <p>Additional documented benefits of these systems include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decreased unplanned emergency transfers to the ICU</li>
                            <li>Decreased ICU and total hospital length of stay</li>
                            <li>Reduced postoperative morbidity and mortality rates</li>
                            <li>Improved rates of survival from cardiac arrest</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Implementing a Rapid Response System</h4>
                        <p>Implementing any type of rapid response system requires a significant cultural change in most hospitals. Those who design and manage the system must pay particular attention to issues that may prevent the hospital from using the system effectively. Examples of such issues are insufficient resources, poor education, fear of calling the team, fear of losing control over patient care, and resistance from team members.</p>
                        <p>Implementing a rapid response system requires ongoing education, impeccable data collection and review, and feedback. Developing and maintaining these programs requires a long-term cultural and financial commitment from the hospital administration. Hospital administrators and healthcare professionals need to reorient their approach to emergency medical events and develop a culture of patient safety with a primary goal of decreasing morbidity and mortality.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The Acute Coronary Syndromes Algorithm (Figure 16) will help guide your clinical strategy when patients have signs and symptoms of ACS, including possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To apply this algorithm effectively, you must have the basic knowledge to assess and stabilize patients with ACS.</p>
                        <p>The initial 12-lead ECG is used to classify patients into 1 of 2 ECG categories of myocardial infarction, with different strategies of care and management needs. These 2 ECG categories are outlined in the Acute Coronary Syndromes Algorithm:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ST-segment elevation (STEMI)</li>
                            <li>Non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, transient STsegment elevation</li>
                                    <li>-Nondiagnostic or normal ECG</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following focuses on the first category: STEMI, with time-sensitive reperfusion strategies.</p>
                        <p><strong>You will</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify, assess, and triage acute ischemic chest discomfort</li>
                            <li>Provide initial treatment of possible ACS</li>
                            <li>Emphasize early reperfusion of the patient with ACS/STEMI</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Goals for ACS Patients</h4>
                        <p>The primary goals are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, nonfatal MI, and the need for urgent postinfarction revascularization</li>
                            <li>Identification of patients with STEMI and triage for early reperfusion therapy</li>
                            <li>Relief of ischemic chest discomfort</li>
                            <li>Treatment of acute, life-threatening complications of ACS, such as VF/pVT, unstable bradycardia, ventricular wall rupture, papillary muscle rupture, decompensated shock, and other unstable tachycardias</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Reperfusion therapy opens an obstructed coronary artery with either mechanical means or drugs. PCI, performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory after coronary angiography, allows for balloon dilation or stent placement—or both—for an obstructed coronary artery.</p>
                        <h4>Rhythms for ACS</h4>
                        <p>Sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardias, and hypotensive bradycardia may occur with acute ischemia. Anticipate these rhythms, and be prepared for immediate interventions, including defibrillation or cardioversion as well as administration of drugs or pacing for stable bradycardias.</p>
                        <h4>Drugs for ACS</h4>
                        <p>Drug therapy and treatment strategies continue to evolve rapidly in the field of ACS, so be sure to keep up with important changes.</p>
                        <p>To treat ACS, you'll initially use these drugs to relieve ischemic discomfort, dissolve clots, and inhibit thrombin and platelets:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oxygen</li>
                            <li>Aspirin</li>
                            <li>Nitroglycerin</li>
                            <li>Opiates (eg, morphine)</li>
                            <li>Fibrinolytic therapy (overview)</li>
                            <li>Heparin (unfractionated, low-molecular-weight)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Additional adjunctive agents that will not be discussed in this course include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>β-Blockers</li>
                            <li>Bivalirudin</li>
                            <li>P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor)</li>
                            <li>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</li>
                            <li>HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statin therapy)</li>
                            <li>Glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa inhibitors</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>STEMI Chain of Survival</h4>
                        <p>The STEMI Chain of Survival (Figure 14) is similar to the Chain of Survival for sudden cardiac arrest. Its links indicate the actions that patients, family members, and healthcare providers can rapidly take to maximize STEMI recovery:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognition and reaction to STEMI warning signs</li>
                            <li>EMS dispatch and rapid EMS system transport and prearrival notification to the receiving hospital</li>
                            <li>Assessment and diagnosis in the ED (or cath lab)</li>
                            <li>Treatment</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_21_c92b8724167b2e24a5feg-046-1.jpg" alt="The STEMI Chain of Survival, showing community recognition, EMS transport, ED assessment, and treatment in the cath lab." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <h4>OHCA Response</h4>
                        <p>Half of ACS deaths occur before the patient reaches the hospital, with VF or pVT as the precipitating rhythm in the majority of cases. VF is most likely to develop during the first 4 hours after onset of symptoms, so communities should develop EMS and prehospital programs to respond quickly to ACS. Such programs should focus on</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognizing symptoms of ACS</li>
                            <li>Activating the EMS system, with EMS providing prehospital notification</li>
                            <li>Providing early CPR if cardiac arrest occurs</li>
                            <li>Providing early defibrillation with AEDs available through publicaccess defibrillation programs and first responders</li>
                            <li>Providing a coordinated system of care among the EMS system, the ED, cath lab, and cardiac specialists</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Pathophysiology of ACS</h4>
                        <p>Patients with coronary atherosclerosis may develop a spectrum of clinical syndromes that represent varying degrees of coronary artery occlusion. These syndromes include NSTE-ACS and STEMI. Sudden cardiac death may occur with any of these syndromes. Figure 15 illustrates the pathophysiology of ACS.</p>

                        <h4>Managing ACS: The Acute Coronary Syndromes Algorithm</h4>
                        <p>The Acute Coronary Syndromes Algorithm (Figure 16) outlines the steps for assessing and managing a patient who has symptoms suggestive of ischemia or infarction (ACS symptoms, Step 1). The EMS assessment and care and hospital preparation should include (Step 2) the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess ABC (airway, breathing, circulation). Be prepared to provide CPR and defibrillation.</li>
                            <li>Administer aspirin and consider oxygen, nitroglycerin, and morphine if needed.</li>
                            <li>Obtain a 12-lead ECG. If there is ST elevation, notify the receiving hospital with a transmission or interpretation; note time of onset and first medical contact.</li>
                            <li>Provide prehospital notification; on arrival, transport to ED/cath lab per protocol.</li>
                            <li>The notified hospital should mobilize hospital resources to respond to STEMI and activate STEMI alert.</li>
                            <li>If considering prehospital fibrinolysis, use a fibrinolytic checklist.</li>
                            <li>If out-of-hospital providers cannot complete these initial steps before the patient arrives at the hospital, the ED provider should do so.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Perform a brief, targeted history and a physical exam.</li>
                            <li>Review and complete the fibrinolytic checklist; check contraindications.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The immediate ED/cath lab general treatment (Step 3) includes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If oxygen saturation is less than 90%: Start oxygen at 4 L/min and titrate</li>
                            <li>Aspirin 162 to 325 mg (if not given by EMS)</li>
                            <li>Nitroglycerin sublingual or translingual</li>
                            <li>Morphine IV if discomfort not relieved by nitroglycerin</li>
                            <li>Consider administration of P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Treatment recommendations are specific to each group:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>STEMI</li>
                            <li>NSTE-ACS
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-High-risk NSTE-ACS</li>
                                    <li>-Low- to intermediate-risk NSTE-ACS</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>ACS management focuses on early reperfusion of the STEMI patient, emphasizing initial care and rapid triage for reperfusion therapy.</p>
                        <h4>Important Considerations</h4>
                        <p>The ACS Algorithm (Figure 16) provides general guidelines, based on patient symptoms and the 12-lead ECG, for the initial triage of patients. Healthcare personnel often obtain serial cardiac markers (CK-MB, cardiac troponins) in patients that allow additional risk stratification and treatment recommendations. Two important points for STEMI need emphasis:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The ECG is central to the initial risk and treatment stratification process.</li>
                            <li>For STEMI patients, you do not need evidence of elevated cardiac markers to decide to administer fibrinolytic therapy or perform diagnostic coronary angiography with coronary intervention (angioplasty/stenting).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Application of the ACS Algorithm</h4>
                        <p>The steps in the algorithm guide assessment and treatment as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Step 1 is to identify symptoms suggestive of ischemia or infarction, such as chest or shoulder pain, dyspnea, or nausea.</li>
                            <li>In Step 2, EMS assesses the patient and provides care, transport, and hospital prearrival notification. Prehospital ECG capture and evaluation is important.</li>
                            <li>In Step 3, the ED/cath lab immediately assesses and treats the patient in less than 10 minutes. Next, the ED/cath lab provides immediate general treatment including oxygen and administration of drugs.</li>
                            <li>After interpreting the ECG in Step 4, use Steps 5 and 9 to classify patients according to ST-segment analysis.</li>
                            <li>If your analysis points to STEMI, use Steps 5 through 8 to treat the patient.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Symptoms Suggestive of Ischemia or Infarction</h4>
                        <p>You should know how to identify symptoms that suggest cardiac ischemia (Step 1). Promptly conduct a targeted evaluation of every patient whose initial symptoms suggest possible ACS.</p>
                        <p>The most common symptom of myocardial ischemia and infarction is retrosternal chest discomfort. The patient may perceive this discomfort more as pressure or tightness than as actual pain.</p>
                        <p>Chest discomfort is the major symptom in most patients (both men and women) with ACS, but patients frequently deny or misinterpret this and other symptoms. The elderly, women, diabetic patients, and hypertensive patients are most likely to delay, in part because they are more likely to have atypical symptoms or presentations. The decision to call for an ambulance may also reduce delays in care. Other factors that can affect the interval between symptom onset and presentation to hospital include time of day, location (eg, work or home), and presence of a family member.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms that suggest ACS may also include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uncomfortable pressure, fullness, squeezing, or pain in the center of the chest lasting several minutes (usually more than a few minutes)</li>
                            <li>Chest discomfort spreading to the shoulders, neck, one or both arms, or jaw</li>
                            <li>Chest discomfort spreading into the back or between the shoulder blades</li>
                            <li>Light-headedness, dizziness, fainting, syncope, sweating, nausea, or vomiting</li>
                            <li>Unexplained, sudden shortness of breath, which may occur with or without chest discomfort</li>
                            <li>Less commonly, the discomfort occurs in the epigastrium and is described as indigestion.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These symptoms may also suggest other life-threatening conditions, including aortic dissection, acute PE, acute pericardial effusion with tamponade, and tension pneumothorax.</p>
                        <h4>Starting With Dispatch</h4>
                        <p>All dispatchers and EMS providers must train to recognize ACS symptoms along with the potential complications. When authorized by medical control or protocol, dispatchers should tell patients with no history of aspirin allergy or signs of active or recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding to chew aspirin (162 to 325 mg) while they wait for EMS providers to arrive.</p>
                        <h4>EMS Assessment, Care, and Hospital Preparation</h4>
                        <p>Step 2 in the algorithm outlines EMS assessment, care, and hospital preparation. EMS responders may perform the following assessments and actions as they stabilize, triage, and transport the patient to an appropriate facility:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess ABCs. Be prepared to provide CPR and defibrillation.</li>
                            <li>Administer aspirin and consider oxygen, nitroglycerin, and morphine if needed.</li>
                            <li>Obtain a 12-lead ECG. If there is ST elevation, notify the receiving hospital with a transmission or an interpretation; note time of onset and first medical contact.</li>
                            <li>Provide prehospital notification; on arrival, transport to ED/cath lab per protocol.</li>
                            <li>The notified hospital should mobilize hospital resources to respond to STEMI and activate STEMI alert.</li>
                            <li>If considering prehospital fibrinolysis, use fibrinolytic checklist.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Assessing ABCs</h5>
                        <p>Assessing ABCs includes</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Monitoring vital signs and cardiac rhythm</li>
                            <li>Being prepared to provide CPR</li>
                            <li>Using a defibrillator if needed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Administering Oxygen and Drugs</h5>
                        <p>You should be familiar with the actions, indications, cautions, and treatment of side effects.</p>
                        <h6>Oxygen</h6>
                        <p>EMS providers should administer oxygen if the patient is dyspneic or hypoxemic, has obvious signs of heart failure, or has an arterial oxygen saturation that is less than 90% or unknown. Providers should adjust oxygen therapy to a noninvasively monitored oxyhemoglobin saturation 90% or greater. The usefulness of supplemental oxygen therapy has not been established in normoxic patients with suspected or confirmed ACS, so providers may consider withholding it in these patients.</p>
                        <h6>Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid)</h6>
                        <p>A dose of 162 to 325 mg of non-enteric-coated or chewed aspirin causes immediate and near-total inhibition of thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> production by inhibiting platelet cyclooxygenase (COX-1). Platelets are one of the principal and earliest participants in thrombus formation. This rapid inhibition also reduces coronary reocclusion and other recurrent events independently and after fibrinolytic therapy.</p>
                        <p>If the patient has not taken aspirin and has no history of true aspirin allergy and no evidence of recent GI bleeding, administer aspirin (162 to 325 mg) to chew. In the initial hours of an ACS, aspirin is absorbed better when chewed than when swallowed, particularly if the patient has received morphine. Use rectal aspirin suppositories (300 mg) for patients with nausea, vomiting, active peptic ulcer disease, or other disorders of the upper GI tract. Aspirin is associated with a reduction in mortality for patients with ACS.</p>
                        <h6>Nitroglycerin (Glyceryl Trinitrate)</h6>
                        <p>Nitroglycerin effectively reduces ischemic chest discomfort, and it has beneficial hemodynamic effects. The physiologic effects of nitrates reduce left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) preload through peripheral arterial and venous dilation.</p>
                        <p>Give the patient 1 sublingual nitroglycerin tablet (or translingual dose) every 3 to 5 minutes for ongoing symptoms if permitted by medical control and no contraindications exist. You may repeat the dose twice (total of 3 doses). Administer nitroglycerin only if the patient remains hemodynamically stable: SBP is greater than 90 mm Hg or no lower than 30 mm Hg below baseline (if known) and the heart rate is 50 to 100/min.</p>
                        <p>Nitroglycerin is a venodilator; use it cautiously or not at all in patients with inadequate ventricular preload. These situations include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inferior wall MI and RV infarction. RV infarction may complicate an inferior wall MI. Patients with acute RV infarction depend on RV filling pressures to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure. If you cannot rule out RV infarction, use caution in administering nitrates to patients with inferior STEMI. If you confirm RV infarction by right-sided precordial leads, or if an experienced provider confirms it through clinical findings, then nitroglycerin and other vasodilators (morphine) or volume-depleting drugs (diuretics) are contraindicated as well.</li>
                            <li>Hypotension, bradycardia, or tachycardia. Avoid using nitroglycerin in patients with hypotension (SBP less than 90 mm Hg), marked bradycardia (heart rate less than 50/min), or marked tachycardia.</li>
                            <li>Recent phosphodiesterase inhibitor use. Avoid using nitroglycerin if you suspect or know that the patient has taken sildenafil or vardenafil within the previous 24 hours or tadalafil within 48 hours. These agents are generally used for erectile dysfunction or in cases of pulmonary hypertension, and in combination with nitrates, they may cause severe hypotension refractory to vasopressor agents.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There appears to be no association between nitroglycerin therapy and survival in patients with ACS.</p>
                        <h6>Opiates (eg, Morphine)</h6>
                        <p>Consider administering morphine for severe chest discomfort that does not respond to sublingual or translingual nitroglycerin if authorized by protocol or medical control. Morphine is indicated in STEMI when chest discomfort does not respond to nitrates. Use morphine with caution in NSTE-ACS because of an association with increased mortality. In addition, morphine may mask symptoms of myocardial ischemia and decrease absorption of important orally administered drugs, such as antiplatelets (P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors). Currently there are no data to suggest an association between morphine and survival advantages in patients with ACS.</p>
                        <p>Morphine may be used to manage ACS because it</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Produces central nervous system analgesia, which reduces the adverse effects of neurohumoral activation, catecholamine release, and heightened myocardial oxygen demand</li>
                            <li>Alleviates dyspnea</li>
                            <li>Produces venodilation, which reduces LV preload and oxygen requirement</li>
                            <li>Decreases systemic vascular resistance, which reduces LV afterload</li>
                            <li>Helps redistribute blood volume in patients with acute pulmonary edema</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Remember, morphine is a venodilator. As with nitroglycerin, use smaller doses and carefully monitor physiologic response before administering additional doses in patients who may be preload dependent. If hypotension develops, administer fluids as a first line of therapy.</p>

The high-performance team should quickly evaluate the patient with potential ACS on the patient's arrival and obtain a 12-lead ECG (if not already performed before arrival) and assess the patient.</p>
                        <p>The 12-lead ECG (example in Figure 17) is at the center of the decision pathway in managing ischemic chest discomfort and is the only way to identify STEMI.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Critical Concepts: Oxygen, Aspirin, Nitrates, and Opiates</h4>
                            <p>Unless contraindicated, initial therapy with aspirin, nitrates, and, if indicated, oxygen is recommended for all patients suspected of having severe ischemic chest discomfort. If pain is not controlled, consider morphine to minimize pain and the associated catecholamine release. However, morphine can decrease absorption of oral antiplatelet medications.</p>
                            <p>The major contraindication to nitroglycerin and morphine is hypotension, including from an RV infarction. The major contraindications to aspirin are true aspirin allergy and active or recent GI bleeding.</p>

                        <h4>Classifying Patients by ST-Segment Deviation</h4>
                        <p>Review the initial 12-lead ECG (Step 4) and classify patients into 1 of 2 following major clinical groups (Steps 5 and 9):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>STEMI is characterized by ST-segment elevation in 2 or more contiguous leads or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). Threshold values for ST-segment elevation consistent with STEMI are J-point elevation greater than 2 mm (0.2 mV) in leads V<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>3</sub> (2.5 mm in men younger than 40 years; 1.5 mm in all women) and 1 mm or more in all other leads or by new or presumed new LBBB.</li>
                            <li>NSTE-ACS (Step 9):
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-High-risk NSTE-ACS (Step 10) is characterized by ischemic ST-segment depression 0.5 mm (0.05 mV) or greater or dynamic T-wave inversion with pain or discomfort. Nonpersistent or transient ST-segment elevation 0.5 mm or greater for less than 20 minutes is also included in this category. If troponin is elevated or if this is a high-risk patient, consider early invasive strategy if (Step 11)
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Refractory ischemic chest discomfort</li>
                                            <li>Recurrent/persistent ST-segment deviation</li>
                                            <li>Ventricular tachycardia</li>
                                            <li>Hemodynamic instability</li>
                                            <li>Signs of heart failure</li>
                                            <li>Start adjunctive therapies (eg, nitroglycerin, heparin) as indicated. Please refer to the "2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines" for more information.<sup>6</sup></li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>-Low- to intermediate-risk NSTE-ACS (Step 12) is characterized by normal or nondiagnostic changes in the ST segment or T wave that are inconclusive and require further risk stratification. This classification includes patients with normal ECGs and those with ST-segment deviation in either direction of less than 0.5 mm (0.05 mV) or T-wave inversion of 2 mm (0.2 mV) or less. Serial cardiac studies and functional testing are appropriate. Note that additional information (troponin) may place the patient into a higher risk classification after initial classification. Consider admission to the ED chest pain unit or to an appropriate bed for further monitoring and possible intervention (Step 13).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The ECG classification of ischemic syndromes is not exclusive—for example, a small percentage of patients with normal ECGs may have MI. If the initial ECG is nondiagnostic and clinical circumstances indicate (eg, ongoing chest discomfort), repeat the ECG. The use of a single ECG to classify patients with suspected ACS is not sufficient. Assessment of cardiac enzymes and serial ECGs in patients with ongoing symptoms is necessary to complete the acute assessment of patients suspected of having this condition.</p>
                        <h4>STEMI</h4>
                        <p>Patients with STEMI usually have complete occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery.</p>
                        <p><strong>Treat STEMI by providing early reperfusion therapy achieved with primary PCI or fibrinolytics.</strong></p>
                        <p>Reperfusion therapy for STEMI is perhaps the most important advancement for treating cardiovascular disease in recent years. Early fibrinolytic therapy or direct catheter-based reperfusion is an established standard of care for patients with STEMI who present within 12 hours after symptom onset with no contraindications. Reperfusion therapy reduces mortality and saves heart muscle; the shorter the time to reperfusion, the greater the benefit. In fact, providing fibrinolytic therapy in the first hour after symptom onset reduces mortality by 47%.</p>

                             <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Critical Concepts: Delay of Therapy</h4>
                             <ul>
                                 <li>Do not delay diagnosis and treatment to consult with a cardiologist or another physician except in equivocal or uncertain cases because delays are associated with increased hospital mortality rates.</li>
                                 <li>Potential delay during in-hospital evaluation may occur from door to data (ECG), from data to decision, and from decision to drug (or PCI). These 4 major points of in-hospital therapy are commonly referred to as the 4 D's.</li>

                        </aside>
                        <h5>Early Reperfusion Therapy</h5>
                        <p>Rapidly identify patients with STEMI and use a fibrinolytic checklist to screen for indications and contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy, if appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The first qualified physician who encounters a patient with STEMI should interpret or confirm the 12-lead ECG, determine the risk/benefit of reperfusion therapy, and direct administration of fibrinolytic therapy or activation of the PCI team. Early activation of PCI may occur with established protocols. Use these recommended time frames:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For PCI, the goal is first medical contact-to-balloon inflation time of 90 minutes or less. For patients at a non-PCI-capable hospital, time from first medical contact to device should be less than 120 minutes when considering primary PCI, but systems should strive to achieve the shortest time possible.</li>
                            <li>If fibrinolysis is the intended reperfusion, the longest acceptable ED door-to-needle time (needle time is the beginning of infusion of a fibrinolytic agent) is 30 minutes, but systems should strive to achieve the shortest time possible.</li>
                            <li>Consider patients who are ineligible for fibrinolytic therapy for transfer to a PCI facility, regardless of delay, but prepare for a door-to-departure time of 30 minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Adjunctive treatments may also be indicated.</p>
                        <h5>Choosing Primary PCI</h5>
                        <p>The most common form of PCI is coronary angioplasty with stent placement, and primary PCI is preferred over fibrinolytic administration. Many studies have shown PCI to be superior to fibrinolysis in the combined end points of death, stroke, and reinfarction for patients presenting between 3 and 12 hours after onset.</p>
                        <p>Interventional strategies for the management of STEMI are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Primary PCI: The patient is taken to the catheterization laboratory for PCI immediately after hospital presentation.</li>
                            <li>Rescue PCI: The patient is initially treated with fibrinolytic therapy. The patient does not show signs of reperfusion (lack of ST resolution more than 50% after 1 hour of fibrinolytic therapy administration) and therefore is referred for rescue PCI.</li>
                            <li>Pharmacoinvasive strategy: The patient is initially treated with fibrinolytic therapy with the intention to perform coronary angiography and PCI, if appropriate.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Considerations for the use of primary PCI include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>PCI is the treatment of choice for the management of STEMI when it can be performed effectively with first medical contact-to-balloon inflation time of 90 minutes or less by a skilled provider at a skilled PCI facility.</li>
                            <li>Primary PCI may also be offered to patients presenting to non-PCI-capable centers if PCI can be initiated promptly within 120 minutes after first medical contact.</li>
                            <li>For patients admitted to a non-PCI center, transferring for PCI vs administering on-site fibrinolytics may have some benefit in terms of reinfarction, stroke, and a trend to lower mortality when PCI is performed within 120 minutes after first medical contact.</li>
                            <li>PCI is also preferred in patients with contraindications to fibrinolytics and is indicated in patients with high-risk features, heart failure complicating MI, or cardiogenic shock.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Using Fibrinolytic Therapy</h5>
                        <p>Administer a fibrinolytic agent or "clot-buster" to patients with ST-segment elevation greater than 2 mm (0.2 mV) in leads V<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>3</sub> and 1 mm or more in all other leads or by new or presumed new LBBB (eg, leads III, aVF; leads V<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>4</sub>; leads I and aVL) without contraindications. Fibrin-specific agents achieve normal flow in about 50% of patients given these drugs. Examples of fibrin-specific drugs are alteplase, reteplase, and tenecteplase. Streptokinase was the first fibrinolytic used widely, but it is not fibrin specific.</p>
                        <p>Considerations for the use of fibrinolytic therapy are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In the absence of contraindications and in the presence of a favorable risk-benefit ratio, fibrinolytic therapy is one option for reperfusion in patients with STEMI and onset of symptoms within 12 hours after presentation with qualifying ECG findings and if PCI is not available within 90 minutes after first medical contact.</li>
                            <li>In the absence of contraindications, it is also reasonable to give fibrinolytics to patients with onset of symptoms within the prior 12 hours and ECG findings consistent with true posterior MI. Experienced providers will recognize this as a condition where ST-segment depression in the early precordial leads is equivalent to ST-segment elevation in others. When these changes are associated with other ECG findings, it suggests a "STEMI" on the posterior wall of the heart.</li>
                            <li>Fibrinolytics are generally not recommended for patients presenting more than 12 hours after onset of symptoms. But they may be considered if ischemic chest discomfort continues with persistent ST-segment elevation.</li>
                            <li>Do not give fibrinolytics to the following patients:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-Those who present more than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms</li>
                                    <li>-Those with ST-segment depression, unless a true posterior MI is suspected</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Adjunctive Treatments</h5>
                        <p>Other drugs are useful when indicated in addition to oxygen, sublingual or translingual nitroglycerin, aspirin, morphine, and fibrinolytic therapy. These include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin</li>
                            <li>Bivalirudin</li>
                            <li>P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-Clopidogrel and prasugrel are thienopyridines that require liver biotransformation into active metabolites. Ticagrelor does not require liver biotransformation and is a reversible P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor. The timing of administration of P2Y<sub>12</sub> should be at the discretion of local site practices.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>IV nitroglycerin</li>
                            <li>β-Blockers</li>
                            <li>Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>IV nitroglycerin and heparin are common for early management of patients with STEMI. We briefly discuss heparin and IV nitroglycerin, but we do not review bivalirudin, P2Y12 inhibitors, β-blockers, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. These agents require additional risk stratification skills and a detailed knowledge of the spectrum of ACS and, in some instances, continuing knowledge of the results of clinical trials.</p>
                        <h6>Heparin (Unfractionated or Low-Molecular-Weight)</h6>
                        <p>Heparin is a routine adjunct for PCI and fibrinolytic therapy with fibrinspecific agents (alteplase, reteplase, tenecteplase). If you use these drugs, you must be familiar with dosing schedules for specific clinical strategies.</p>
                        <p>Inappropriate dosing and monitoring of heparin therapy have caused excess intracerebral bleeding and major hemorrhage in STEMI patients. Providers using heparin must know the indications, dosing, and use in the specific ACS categories.</p>
                        <p>The dosing, use, and duration are derived from use in clinical trials. Specific patients may require dose modification. See the ECC Handbook for weight-based dosing guidelines, intervals of administration, and adjustment of low-molecular-weight heparin in renal function. See the American College of Cardiology/AHA guidelines for detailed discussion in specific categories.</p>
                        <h6>IV Nitroglycerin</h6>
                        <p>Routine use of IV nitroglycerin is not indicated and has not been shown to significantly reduce mortality in STEMI. However, IV nitroglycerin is indicated and used widely in ischemic syndromes and is preferred over topical or long-acting forms because it can be adjusted in a patient with potentially unstable hemodynamics and clinical condition. Indications for initiating IV nitroglycerin in STEMI are</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recurrent or continuing chest discomfort unresponsive to sublingual or translingual nitroglycerin</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary edema complicating STEMI</li>
                            <li>Hypertension complicating STEMI</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Treatment goals using IV nitroglycerin are as follows:</p>
                        <p>For relief of ischemic chest discomfort,</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Titrate to effect</li>
                            <li>Keep SBP greater than 90 mm Hg</li>
                            <li>Limit drop in SBP to 30 mm Hg below baseline in hypertensive patients</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For improvement in pulmonary edema and hypertension,</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Titrate to effect</li>
                            <li>Limit drop in SBP to 10% of baseline in normotensive patients</li>
                            <li>Limit drop in SBP to 30 mm Hg below baseline in hypertensive patients</li>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>The identification and initial management of patients with acute stroke is within the scope of an ACLS provider.</p>
                        <p>Out-of-hospital acute stroke care focuses on critical EMS assessments and actions (Step 2):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess ABCs; give oxygen if needed.</li>
                            <li>Initiate stroke protocol.</li>
                            <li>Perform physical exam.</li>
                            <li>Perform validated prehospital stroke screen and stroke severity tool.</li>
                            <li>Establish time of symptom onset (last known normal).</li>
                            <li>Triage to most appropriate stroke center.</li>
                            <li>Check glucose; treat if indicated.</li>
                            <li>Provide prehospital notification; on arrival, transport to brain imaging suite.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note: Refer to the Emergency Medical Services Acute Stroke Routing later in this section.</p>
                        <p>In-hospital acute stroke care occurs in the ED or brain imaging suite. It is best practice to bypass the ED and go straight to the brain imaging suite. The immediate general and neurologic assessment by the hospital or stroke team (Step 3) includes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Activate stroke team upon EMS notification.</li>
                            <li>Prepare for emergent CT scan or MRI of brain upon arrival.</li>
                            <li>Stroke team meets EMS on arrival.</li>
                            <li>Assess ABCs; give oxygen if needed.</li>
                            <li>Obtain IV access and perform laboratory assessments.</li>
                            <li>Check glucose and treat if indicated.</li>
                            <li>Review patient history, medications, and procedures.</li>
                            <li>Establish time of symptom onset or last known normal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Perform a physical exam and neurologic examination, including the NIH Stroke Scale or Canadian Neurological Scale. In 2010, the AHA/ASA launched Target: Stroke, a national quality improvement initiative with the goal of reducing door-to-needle times for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke. The most recent implementation of current best practices, Target Stroke: III, has established new, more aggressive target goals to give patients the best chance for a good recovery. Target Stroke: III time target goals for reperfusion strategies include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Achieve door-to-needle times within 60 minutes in 85% or more of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with IV thrombolytics.</li>
                            <li>Achieve door-to-device times (arrival to first pass with thrombectomy device) within 90 minutes for direct-arriving patients and within 60 minutes for transfer patients in 50% or more of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with endovascular therapy (EVT).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Drugs for Stroke</h4>
                        <p>Drugs for stroke include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Approved fibrinolytic agent (alteplase)</li>
                            <li>Glucose (D<sub>10</sub>/D<sub>50</sub>)</li>
                            <li>Labetalol</li>

                        <h3>Major Types of Stroke</h3>
                        <p>Stroke is a general term. It refers to an acute neurologic impairment that follows interruption in blood supply to a specific area of the brain. Although expeditious stroke care is important for all patients, this section emphasizes reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke.</p>
                        <p>The major types of stroke are</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ischemic stroke: accounts for 87% of all strokes and is usually caused by an occlusion of an artery to a region of the brain (Figure 19)</li>
                            <li>Hemorrhagic stroke: accounts for 13% of all strokes and occurs when a blood vessel in the brain suddenly ruptures into the surrounding tissue. Fibrinolytic therapy is contraindicated in this type of stroke. Avoid anticoagulants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_21_c92b8724167b2e24a5feg-069-1.jpg" alt="Illustration of the two major types of stroke: ischemic (blockage) and hemorrhagic (bleeding). Ischemic strokes are shown to be 87% of cases." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 19. Types of stroke. Eighty-seven percent of strokes are ischemic and potentially eligible for reperfusion therapy if patients otherwise qualify. Thirteen percent of strokes are hemorrhagic, and the majority of these are intracerebral.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The male-to-female incidence ratio is 1.25 in persons 55 to 64 years of age, 1.50 in those 65 to 74, 1.07 in those 75 to 84, and 0.76 in those 85 and older. Blacks have almost twice the risk of first-ever stroke compared with Whites.</p>
                        <h3>Approach to Stroke Care</h3>
                        <p>Each year in the United States, about 795,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke. Stroke remains a leading cause of death as well as disability in the United States. Stroke risk increases with age, but approximately one third of people hospitalized for stroke are under age 65.<sup>7</sup></p>
                        <p>Early recognition of acute ischemic stroke is critically important because time from symptom onset to reperfusion is key. IV fibrinolytic treatment should be provided as early as possible, generally within 3 hours after onset of symptoms, or within 4.5 hours after onset of symptoms for selected patients. EVT may be given within 24 hours after onset of symptoms in appropriately selected patients, but better outcomes are associated with shorter times to treatment. Although most strokes occur at home, only half of acute stroke patients use EMS for transport to the hospital, which delays time to evaluation and therapeutic interventions. Stroke patients often deny or try to rationalize their symptoms. Even high-risk patients, such as those with atrial fibrillation or hypertension, fail to recognize the signs of stroke. This delays activation of EMS and treatment, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.</p>
                        <p>Community and professional education is essential, and it has been successful in increasing the proportion of eligible stroke patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Healthcare providers, hospitals, and communities must continue to develop regional stroke systems of care to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of stroke care.</p>
                        <h4>Stroke Chain of Survival</h4>
                        <p>The goal of stroke care is to minimize brain injury and maximize the patient's recovery. The Stroke Chain of Survival (Figure 20) described by the AHA and the American Stroke Association (ASA) is similar to the Chain of Survival for sudden cardiac arrest. It links the actions that patients, family members, and healthcare providers should take to maximize stroke recovery. These links are</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rapid recognition of and reaction to stroke warning signs and symptoms</li>
                            <li>Rapid use of 9-1-1 and EMS dispatch</li>
                            <li>Rapid EMS recognition of stroke, triage, transport, and prehospital notification to the receiving hospital</li>
                            <li>Rapid diagnosis and treatment in the hospital</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The 8 D's of Stroke Care highlight the major steps in diagnosis and treatment of stroke and key points at which delays can occur:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Detection:</strong> rapid recognition of stroke signs and symptoms</li>
                            <li><strong>Dispatch:</strong> early activation and dispatch of EMS by phoning 9-1-1</li>
                            <li><strong>Delivery:</strong> rapid EMS stroke identification, management, triage, transport, and prehospital notification</li>
                            <li><strong>Door:</strong> emergent ED/imaging suite triage and immediate assessment by the stroke team</li>
                            <li><strong>Data:</strong> rapid clinical evaluation, laboratory testing, and brain imaging</li>
                            <li><strong>Decision:</strong> establishing stroke diagnosis and determining optimal therapy selection</li>
                            <li><strong>Drug/Device:</strong> administration of fibrinolytic and/or EVT if eligible</li>
                            <li><strong>Disposition:</strong> rapid admission to the stroke unit or critical care unit, or emergent interfacility transfer for EVT</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Goals of Stroke Care</h3>
                        <p>Initial time goals were based on the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke consensus conference held in 1997, shortly after the approval of alteplase. Over the past 2 decades, AHA process improvement projects have led to new and updated goals. Each stroke center should adopt the best practices identified in the Target: Stroke programs as they apply to that center's unique settings. The overall goal remains to minimize delays to reperfusion. The Adult Suspected Stroke Algorithm reviews the critical in-hospital time periods for patient assessment and treatment:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Immediate general and neurologic assessment by the hospital or stroke team, emergency physician, or another expert, ideally upon arrival and within 10 minutes after arrival; activate stroke team upon EMS notification; prepare for emergent CT scan or MRI of brain upon arrival; stroke team meets EMS on arrival; assess ABCs and give oxygen if needed; obtain IV access and perform laboratory assessments; check glucose and treat if indicated; review patient history, medications, and procedures; establish time of symptom onset or last known normal; perform physical exam and neurologic examination, including NIH Stroke Scale or Canadian Neurological Scale (Step 3).</li>
                            <li>Neurologic assessment by the stroke team or designee and noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan or MRI performed within 20 minutes after hospital arrival (ideally EMS goes directly to computed tomography (CT)/MRI suite from the field) (Step 3)</li>
                            <li>Interpretation of the NCCT/MRI within 45 minutes after ED/brain imaging suite arrival (box 4)</li>
                            <li>Initiation of fibrinolytic therapy in appropriate patients (those without contraindications) within 45 minutes after hospital arrival (Steps 6 through 8)</li>
                            <li>Door-to-device times within 90 minutes for direct arriving patients and 60 minutes for transfer patients (Step 9)</li>
                            <li>Door-in to door-out times for patients being transferred for possible EVT within 60 minutes (Steps 9 through 11)</li>
                            <li>Door-to-admission (stroke unit or neurocritical care unit) time of 3 hours (Steps 12 and 13)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Critical Time Periods</h3>
                        <p>Patients with acute ischemic stroke have a time-dependent benefit for reperfusion therapy similar to that of patients with STEMI, but this time-dependent benefit is much shorter. The critical time period for administration of reperfusion therapies begin with the onset of symptoms. Critical time periods from hospital arrival are summarized here and represent maximum times:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immediate general assessment: within <strong>10 minutes</strong></li>
                            <li>Immediate neurologic assessment: within <strong>20 minutes</strong></li>
                            <li>Acquisition of CT/MRI of the head: within <strong>20 minutes</strong></li>
                            <li>Interpretation of the CT/MRI scan: within <strong>45 minutes</strong></li>
                            <li>Administration of fibrinolytic therapy, timed from ED/brain imaging suite arrival: within <strong>60 minutes</strong></li>
                            <li>Administration of fibrinolytic therapy, timed from onset of symptoms: within <strong>3 hours, or 4.5 hours in selected patients</strong></li>
                            <li>Administration of EVT, timed from onset of symptoms: up to <strong>24 hours</strong> for patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO): 0 to 6 hours requires eligible NCCT scan; 6 to 24 hours requires eligible penumbral imaging</li>
                            <li>Admission to a monitored bed: <strong>3 hours</strong></li>
                            <li>Interfacility transfers for EVT (door-in-door-out): <strong>1 hour</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Adult Suspected Stroke Algorithm (Figure 21) emphasizes important elements of out-of-hospital and in-hospital care for patients with possible stroke. In addition, the Emergency Medical Services Acute Stroke Routing (Figure 22) emphasizes an important evaluation to determine the best hospital to take the patient with a suspected stroke to. These actions include using a stroke screen and severity tool, and rapid transport to the hospital. As with ACS, notifying the receiving hospital in advance speeds the care of the stroke patient upon arrival.</p>

                        <h3>Application of the Adult Suspected Stroke Algorithm</h3>
                        <p>We will now discuss the steps in the algorithm (as well as other related topics):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identification of signs and symptoms of possible stroke and activation of emergency response (Step 1)</li>
                            <li>Critical EMS assessments and actions (Step 2)</li>
                            <li>Immediate general and neurologic assessment by hospital or stroke team (ED or brain imaging suite) (Step 3)</li>
                            <li>Brain imaging (CT/MRI scan) (Step 4): Does brain imaging show hemorrhage?</li>
                            <li>Alteplase candidate? (Fibrinolytic therapy risk stratification of candidate) (Step 7)</li>
                            <li>Considering EVT and patient's qualification as a candidate (Steps 9 and 10)</li>
                            <li>Rapid transport to cath lab or transfer to EVT-capable center (Step 11)</li>
                            <li>Admittance to neurologic ICU or stroke unit, or transfer to higher level of care (Steps 12 and 13)</li>
                            <li>Additional imaging for presence of LVO and penumbra when indicated (Steps 9 and 10)</li>
                            <li>General stroke care (Steps 12 and 13)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Identify Signs of Possible Stroke and Activate Emergency Response</h4>
                        <h5>Warning Signs and Symptoms</h5>
                        <p>The signs and symptoms of a stroke may be subtle. They include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body</li>
                            <li>Trouble speaking or understanding</li>
                            <li>Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes</li>
                            <li>Sudden trouble walking</li>
                            <li>Dizziness or loss of balance or coordination</li>
                            <li>Sudden severe headache with no known cause</li>
                            <li>Sudden confusion</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Activate EMS System Immediately</h5>
                        <p>Currently half of all stroke patients are driven to the ED by family or friends. Thus, stroke patients and their families must be educated on potential signs or symptoms of stroke and the need to phone 9-1-1 and activate EMS as soon as they detect a possible stroke.</p>
                        <p>EMS provides the safest and most efficient method of emergency transport to the most appropriate stroke hospital. The advantages of EMS transport include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Emergency medical dispatchers play a critical role in timely treatment of potential stroke by
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-Identifying possible stroke patients</li>

                            <li>EMS can triage to the most appropriate stroke center on the basis of a validated prehospital stroke screen and a stroke severity tool and on patient characteristics following regional destination protocols.</li>
                            <li>EMS can provide prehospital notification, enabling the hospital to prepare to evaluate and manage the patient more efficiently, and on arrival transport to the brain imaging suite.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Provide Critical EMS Assessments and Actions</h4>
                        <p>Prehospital EMS providers must minimize the interval between the onset of symptoms and patient arrival in the ED/brain imaging suite. Specific stroke therapy can be provided only in the appropriate receiving hospital ED, so time in the field only delays (and may prevent) definitive therapy. More extensive assessments and initiation of supportive therapies can continue en route to the hospital or in the ED/brain imaging suite.</p>
                        <h5>Critical EMS Assessments and Actions</h5>
                        <p>To provide the best outcome for the patient with potential stroke, EMS providers should identify the signs and symptoms of possible stroke (Step 1). These include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess ABCs and give oxygen if needed to hypoxemic stroke patients (ie, whose oxygen saturation is 94% or less) or to those patients with unknown oxygen saturation.</li>
                            <li>Initiate stroke protocol.</li>
                            <li>Perform physical exam.</li>
                            <li>Perform validated prehospital stroke severity tool. Perform a rapid prehospital stroke screen (eg, CPSS) and stroke severity assessment for possible large vessel occlusion (eg, Los Angeles Motor Scale [LAMS], Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation [RACE], Cincinnati Stroke Triage Assessment Tool [CSTAT], Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency Destination [FAST-ED]).</li>
                            <li>Establish time of symptom onset (last known normal). Determine the time of symptom onset or when the patient was last known normal or at neurologic baseline. This represents time zero. If the patient wakes from sleep with symptoms of stroke, time zero is the last time the patient was seen to be normal.</li>
                            <li>Triage to most appropriate stroke center. Transport the patient rapidly and triage to an appropriate stroke center based on last known well, stroke severity tool, and regional stroke destination protocol. Support cardiopulmonary function during transport. If possible, bring a witness, family member, or caregiver with the patient to confirm time of onset of stroke symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Check glucose if indicated. During transport, check blood glucose if protocols or medical control allows.</li>
                            <li>Provide prehospital notification to the receiving hospital, and on arrival, transport to the brain imaging suite.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The patient with acute stroke is at risk for respiratory compromise from aspiration, upper airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and (rarely) neurogenic pulmonary edema. The combination of poor perfusion and hypoxemia will exacerbate and extend ischemic brain injury, and it has been associated with worse outcome from stroke.</p>
                        <p>Both out-of-hospital and in-hospital medical personnel should provide supplemental oxygen to hypoxemic stroke patients (ie, those whose oxygen saturation is 94% or less) or patients for whom oxygen saturation is unknown.</p>
                        <h5>Stroke Assessment Tools</h5>
                        <p>The AHA recommends that all EMS personnel be trained to recognize stroke by using a validated, abbreviated out-of-hospital neurologic evaluation tool such as the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS) (Table 5) or the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen.

                        <p>The CPSS identifies stroke on the basis of 3 physical findings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Facial droop (have the patient smile or try to show teeth)</li>

                        <p>By using the CPSS, medical personnel can evaluate the patient in less than 1 minute. The presence of 1 finding on the CPSS has an estimated probability of stroke of 72% when scored by prehospital providers.</p>

                        <p>Evidence indicates a benefit from triage of stroke patients directly to designated certified stroke centers. Local stakeholders should create a stroke destination protocol based on regional stroke resources.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the "Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: 2019 Update to the 2018 Guidelines for the Early Management of Acute Ischemic Stroke," "Certification of stroke centers by an independent external body, such as Center for Improvement in Healthcare Quality, Det Norske Veritas, Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program, and The Joint Commission, or a state health department, is recommended." This recommendation is supported by data that demonstrate that the development of stroke centers improves patient care and clinical outcomes. Table 6 shows the different levels and capabilities of hospital stroke designation. Currently, 4 levels of stroke certification exist, and certification is given on the basis of a hospital's specific capabilities.</p>

                        <h4>Acute Stroke Ready Hospital</h4>
                        <p>Acute Stroke Ready Hospitals typically serve rural and under-resourced areas. Emergent identification and treatment of patients with alteplase, when indicated, is typically facilitated by telemedicine to provide access to acute neurologic expertise. Typically, patients are later transferred for admission to a stroke unit or for a higher level of care, as indicated.</p>
                        <h4>Primary Stroke Center</h4>
                        <p>The Primary Stroke Center is the cornerstone of stroke systems of care. These centers comprise a wide range of hospitals able to quickly identify stroke patients, provide alteplase therapy if indicated, and admit patients to a dedicated stroke unit. Roughly half of all stroke patients in the United States receive care in a Primary Stroke Center.</p>
                        <h4>Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center</h4>
                        <p>The Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center certification was jointly created by the AHA and the Joint Commission to recognize stroke centers that meet the same high-quality standards as a primary stroke center but are also capable of providing EVT for patients with LVO. The Thrombectomy-Capable Stroke Center designation was created to recognize these EVT-capable facilities in areas where a Comprehensive Stroke Center was not available.</p>
                        <h4>Comprehensive Stroke Center</h4>
                        <p>Hospitals achieving Comprehensive Stroke Center certification are capable of managing all forms and severities of stroke, both ischemic and hemorrhagic, and can provide 24/7 access to specialty care, such as neurosurgery, EVT, and neurocritical care. A Comprehensive Stroke Center typically serves as the hub of a regional stroke system of care, providing receiving capabilities for transferred patients and providing feedback and education for transferring sites.</p>
                        <p>Hospitals in a region should achieve stroke center certification to the highest level possible, and then use these levels of capabilities to design a regional stroke system of care. The hospitals' capabilities should be communicated to the regional EMS system and the community.</p>
                        <p>Once a patient arrives in the ED, a number of assessments and management activities must occur quickly. Protocols should be used to minimize delay in definitive diagnosis and therapy. Incorporating best practices from the Target Stroke programs has been shown to reduce overall door-to-needle times and improve clinical outcomes while maintaining overall safety. These practices have also been shown to decrease the various interval times first established by the 1997 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke consensus conference.</p>
                        <p>The goal of the stroke team, emergency physician, or other experts should be to assess the patient with suspected stroke within 10 minutes after arrival in the ED/brain imaging suite (Step 3): "time is brain."</p>
                        <h4>Target: Stroke II Best-Practice Strategies</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>EMS Prenotification: EMS providers should provide early prenotification to the receiving hospital when stroke is recognized in the field.</li>
                            <li>Use stroke tools: A stroke toolkit containing rapid triage protocol, clinical decision support, stroke-specific order sets, guidelines, hospital-specific algorithms, critical pathways, NIH Stroke Scale, and other stroke tools should be available and used for each patient.</li>
                            <li>Employ rapid triage protocol and stroke team notification: Acute triage protocols facilitate the timely recognition of stroke and reduce time to treatment. Acute stroke teams enhance stroke care and should be activated as soon as there is hospital prenotification from EMS personnel of a stroke patient or the stroke patient is identified in the ED.</li>
                            <li>Use a single-call activation system: A single call should activate the entire stroke team.</li>
                            <li>Attach a timer or clock to chart, clipboard, or patient bed: Acute ischemic stroke care requires an accurate, timely, coordinated, and systematic evaluation of the patient. A universal clock visible to the healthcare providers is an enabling tool for improving the quality of care.</li>
                            <li>Ensure EMS transfer directly to CT or MRI scanner: Guided by prespecified protocols, providers can transport eligible stroke patients, if appropriate, from the ED triage area directly to the CT/MRI scanner for initial neurologic examination and brain imaging to determine tissue plasminogen activator eligibility, bypassing the ED bed.</li>
                            <li>Rapidly acquire and interpret brain imaging: It is essential to initiate a brain CT scan (or MRI) as soon as possible after patient arrival. Consider initial CT interpretation by a stroke neurologist, reserving advanced imaging for unclear cases only. Additional brain imaging may be acquired after alteplase consideration to determine the presence of an LVO and salvageable penumbra.</li>
                            <li>Conduct rapid laboratory testing (including point-of-care testing if indicated): When indicated, order laboratory tests such as glucose and testing for patients in whom coagulation parameters should be assessed because of suspicion of coagulopathy or warfarin treatment. International normalized ratio (prothrombin time)/partial thromboplastin time results should be available as quickly as possible and no later than 30 minutes after ED arrival.</li>
                            <li>Prepare alteplase in advance: Mix the drug and set up the bolus dose and 1-hour infusion pump as soon as a patient is recognized as a possible alteplase candidate, even before brain imaging.</li>
                            <li>Provide rapid access and administration of intravenous alteplase: Once eligibility has been determined and intracranial hemorrhage has been excluded, intravenous alteplase should be promptly administered without delay.</li>
                            <li>Use a team-based approach: The team approach based on standardized stroke pathways and protocols has proven to be effective in enhancing the number of eligible patients treated and reducing time to treatment in stroke.</li>
                            <li>Provide prompt data feedback: Accurately measuring and tracking prehospital times, door-to-needle times, IV alteplase and EVT treatment rates in eligible patients, other time intervals, and performance on other stroke performance/quality measures equip the stroke team to identify areas for improvement. A data monitoring and feedback system includes the use of the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Patient Management Tool.</li>

Do not delay the CT/MRI scan to obtain the ECG.</p>
                        <h4>Immediate Neurologic Assessment by Hospital or Stroke Team</h4>
                        <p>The stroke team, neurovascular consultant, or emergency physician does the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reviews the patient's history, medications, and procedures and establishes time of symptom onset or last known normal</li>
                            <li>Performs a physical and neurologic examination, including the NIH Stroke Scale or Canadian Neurological Scale</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>The goal for neurologic assessment is within 20 minutes after the patient's arrival in the ED/brain imaging suite: "time is brain."</strong></p>
                        <h5>Establish Symptom Onset</h5>
                        <p>Establishing the time of symptom onset or last known well may require interviewing out-of-hospital providers, witnesses, and family members.</p>
                        <h5>Conduct Neurologic Examination</h5>
                        <p>Assess the patient's neurologic deficits by using an established stroke scale, preferably the NIH Stroke Scale or Canadian Neurological Scale. The NIH Stroke Scale uses 15 items to assess and quantify neurologic deficits of a stroke patient. This is a validated measure of stroke severity based on a detailed neurologic examination.</p>
                        <h4>Perform Brain Imaging (CT/MRI): Does Brain Imaging Show Hemorrhage?</h4>
                        <p>A critical decision point in the assessment of the patient with acute stroke is the performance and interpretation of an NCCT/MRI to differentiate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. Assessment also includes identifying other structural abnormalities that may be responsible for the patient's symptoms or that represent contraindication to fibrinolytic therapy. The initial NCCT/MRI scan is the most important test for a patient with acute stroke.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If an NCCT/MRI scan is not readily available, stabilize and promptly transfer the patient to a facility with this capability.</li>
                            <li>The presence of intracranial hemorrhage is an absolute contraindication to alteplase and EVT.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Systems should be established so that brain-imaging studies can be performed within 20 minutes after the patient arrives in the ED or brain imaging suite.</p>
                        <h5>Decision Point: Hemorrhage or No Hemorrhage</h5>
                        <p>Additional imaging techniques such as CT perfusion, CT angiography, or MRI scans of patients with suspected stroke should be promptly interpreted by a physician skilled in neuroimaging interpretation. Obtaining these additional studies should not delay initiation of IV alteplase in eligible patients. The presence of hemorrhage vs no hemorrhage determines the next steps in treatment.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Hemorrhage is present (Steps 5 and 13). If hemorrhage is noted on the NCCT/MRI scan, the patient is not a candidate for fibrinolytics. Initiate intracranial hemorrhage protocol. Admit to the stroke unit or neurologic ICU, or transfer to a higher level of care.</p>
                        <p>Hemorrhage is not present (Step 6 and 8). If the NCCT/MRI scan shows no evidence of hemorrhage and no sign of other abnormality (eg, tumor, recent stroke), the patient may be a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy.</p>
                        <p>For patients with a suspected LVO, additional imaging is required. CT angiography will determine if an LVO is present. Less than 6 hours from symptom onset, penumbral imaging is not required. More than 6 hours from symptom onset, penumbral imaging (CT perfusion or multimodal MRI) is required to identify patients with salvageable penumbra. Advanced imaging, including perfusion imaging, should not delay administration of IV alteplase.</p>
                        <p>Figures 25 A and B show an ischemic penumbra that is alive but dysfunctional because of altered membrane potentials. The dysfunction is potentially reversible. The goal of current stroke reperfusion treatments is to minimize the area of permanent brain infarction by preventing the areas of reversible brain ischemia in the penumbra from transforming into larger areas of irreversible brain infarction.</p>
                        <h4>Fibrinolytic Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Studies have demonstrated that there is a higher likelihood of good to excellent functional outcome when alteplase is given to adults with acute ischemic stroke within 3 hours after onset of symptoms, or within 4.5 hours after onset of symptoms for selected patients. Evidence from prospective randomized studies in adults also documents a greater likelihood of benefit the earlier treatment begins.</p>

                        <h5>Alteplase Eligibility Criteria</h5>
                        <div class="content-card">
                            <p><strong>Indications (Within 3 Hours):</strong> IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, max 90mg) is recommended for eligible patients treated within 3 hours of symptom onset. This applies to patients ≥18 years, including those >80 years, and those with severe or mild but disabling stroke symptoms. Blood pressure must be <185/110 mm Hg. Early ischemic changes on NCCT (other than frank hypodensity) are not a contraindication.</p>
                            <p><strong>Extended Window (3 to 4.5 Hours):</strong> IV alteplase is also recommended for select patients in the 3 to 4.5-hour window, typically those ≤80 years, without a history of both diabetes and prior stroke, NIHSS score ≤25, not on anticoagulants, and with ischemic injury involving less than one-third of the MCA territory.</p>
                            <p><strong>Wake-up/Unknown Onset:</strong> IV alteplase may be beneficial for wake-up strokes within 4.5 hours of recognition if specific MRI criteria are met (small DWI lesion, no FLAIR change).</p>
                            <p><strong>Contraindications (Harm/No Benefit):</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>IV alteplase is NOT recommended for mild, nondisabling strokes.</li>
                                <li>Do not administer if CT shows acute intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).</li>
                                <li>Contraindicated with significant head trauma or intracranial/spinal surgery within 3 months.</li>
                                <li>Potentially harmful with prior ischemic stroke within 3 months, history of ICH, or recent GI malignancy/bleed (within 21 days).</li>
                                <li>Do not administer with coagulopathy (platelets &lt;100,000, INR >1.7, elevated aPTT/PT) or recent full-dose LMWH (within 24 hrs).</li>
                                <li>Use with direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors may be harmful unless specific lab tests are normal or the last dose was >48 hours prior.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><em>This is a summary. For a full list of criteria, refer to the "2019 Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke."</em></p>
                        </div>

                        <h5>Potential Adverse Effects</h5>
                        <p>As with all drugs, fibrinolytics have potential adverse effects. At this point, weigh the patient's risk for adverse events against the potential benefit and discuss with the patient and family.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confirm that no exclusion criteria are present (Table 8).</li>
                            <li>Consider risks and benefits.</li>
                            <li>Be prepared to monitor and treat any potential complications.</li>
                            <li>The major complication of IV alteplase for stroke is intracranial hemorrhage. Other bleeding complications may occur and may range from minor to major. Angioedema and transient hypotension may occur.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Patient Is a Candidate for Fibrinolytic Therapy</h5>
                        <p>If the patient remains a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy (Step 8), discuss the risks and potential benefits with the patient or family if available. After this discussion, if the patient or family members decide to proceed with fibrinolytic therapy, give the patient alteplase. Begin your institution's stroke alteplase protocol, often called a postalteplase pathway of care.</p>
                        <p>Alteplase is considered the standard of care for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke. Because of this treatment's proven benefit and the need to expedite it, healthcare providers are justified to proceed with IV thrombolysis in an otherwise eligible adult patient with a disabling acute ischemic stroke in situations where that patient cannot provide consent (eg, due to aphasia or confusion) and a legally authorized representative is not immediately available to provide proxy consent.</p>
                        <p>> Do not administer anticoagulants or antiplatelet treatment for 24 hours after administration of alteplase, typically until a follow-up CT scan at 24 hours shows no intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Endovascular Therapy</h4>
                        <p>Substantial new high-quality research on the clinical efficacy of endovascular treatments of acute ischemic stroke was published in 2015. In light of that research, although IV alteplase remains as a first-line treatment, the AHA now recommends EVT for select patients with acute ischemic stroke due to an LVO.</p>
                        <p>As with fibrinolytic therapy, patients must meet inclusion criteria to be considered for this treatment. Similarly, better clinical outcomes are associated with reduced times from symptom onset to reperfusion, but these new treatment options offer the added benefit of expanding the treatment window up to 24 hours from the onset of symptoms. Once you determine the patient is an EVT candidate, rapidly transport to cath lab or transfer to an EVT-capable center, followed by admittance to a neurologic ICU.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Mechanical Thrombectomy With Stent Retrievers</h5>
                        <p>Mechanical thrombectomy has been demonstrated to provide clinical benefit in selected patients with acute ischemic stroke.</p>
                        <p>Patients arriving within 6 hours after symptom onset should receive EVT with a stent retriever if they meet all of the following criteria:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prestroke modified Rankin Score of 0 to 1</li>
                            <li>Causative LVO of the internal carotid artery or proximal middle cerebral artery demonstrated on cerebrovascular imaging</li>
                            <li>Age 18 years or older</li>
                            <li>NIH Stroke Scale score of 6 or greater</li>
                            <li>Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of 6 or greater (ASPECTS is an early, reliable tool that uses a 10-point quantitative topographic CT scan score to determine early ischemic changes.)</li>
                            <li>Treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours after symptom onset or last known normal</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In selected patients with acute ischemic stroke within 6 to 16 hours after last known normal who have LVO in the anterior circulation and meet other DAWN or DEFUSE 3 eligibility criteria, mechanical thrombectomy is recommended.</p>
                        <p>In selected patients with acute ischemic stroke within 16 to 24 hours after last known normal who have LVO in the anterior circulation and meet other DAWN eligibility criteria, mechanical thrombectomy is reasonable.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Intra-Arterial Alteplase</h5>
                        <p>Initial treatment with intra-arterial thrombolysis is beneficial for carefully selected patients with major ischemic strokes of less than 6 hours' duration caused by occlusions of the middle cerebral artery. Regarding the previous recommendations for intra-arterial thrombolysis, those data were derived from clinical trials that no longer reflect current practice, including the use of fibrinolytic drugs that are not available. A clinically beneficial dose of intra-arterial alteplase is not established, and alteplase does not have FDA approval for intra-arterial use. As a consequence, mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers is recommended over intra-arterial thrombolysis as first-line therapy. Intra-arterial thrombolysis initiated within 6 hours after stroke onset in carefully selected patients who have contraindications to the use of IV alteplase might be considered, but the consequences are unknown.</p>

                        <h4>Begin General Stroke Care</h4>
                        <p>After being considered for reperfusion strategies, all patients should be placed on an acute stroke pathway. The general care of all patients with stroke includes the following actions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Begin acute stroke pathway.</li>
                            <li>Assess ABCs, and give oxygen if needed.</li>
                            <li>Monitor blood glucose.</li>
                            <li>Monitor blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Monitor temperature.</li>
                            <li>Perform dysphagia screening.</li>
                            <li>Monitor for complications of stroke and fibrinolytic therapy.</li>
                            <li>Transfer to a higher level of care (EVT, neurological ICU) if indicated.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Rhythms for Bradycardia</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sinus bradycardia</li>
                            <li>First-degree AV block</li>
                            <li>Second-degree AV block: block of some, but not all, atrial impulses before they reach the ventricles. This block can be further classified as Mobitz type I or Mobitz type II second-degree AV block.</li>
                            <li>-Mobitz type I AV block: Also known as Wenckebach phenomenon, typically occurs at the AV node. It is characterized by successive prolongation of the PR interval until an atrial impulse is not conducted to the ventricles (Figure 26B). The P wave corresponding to that atrial impulse is not followed by a QRS complex. The cycle of progressive lengthening of the PR interval until failure of conduction of the atrial impulse to the ventricles often repeats.</li>
                            <li>-Mobitz type II second-degree AV block (Figure 26C): Occurs below the level of the AV node. It is characterized by intermittent nonconduction of P waves (atrial impulses to the ventricle) with a constant PR interval on conducted beats. There can be a consistent ratio of atrial to ventricular depolarizations, eg, 2 P waves to 1 QRS complex.</li>
                            <li>Third-degree AV block</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should know the major AV blocks because important treatment decisions are based on the type of block (Figure 26). Complete (or third-degree) AV block is generally the most clinically significant block because it is most likely to cause cardiovascular collapse and require immediate pacing. Recognizing a stable bradycardia due to AV block is a primary goal, and recognizing the type of AV block is secondary.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Atropine</li>
                            <li>Dopamine (infusion)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Symptomatic Bradycardia</h3>
                        <p>Bradycardia may have multiple causes, including some that are physiologic and require no assessment or therapy. For example, a healthy, well-trained athlete may have a resting heart rate less than 50/min.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, some patients have heart rates in the normal range, but these rates are inappropriate or insufficient for them. This is called a functional or relative bradycardia. For example, a heart rate of 70/min may be relatively too slow for a patient in cardiogenic or septic shock.</p>
                        <p>The key to managing symptomatic bradycardia is determining which signs or symptoms are due to the decreased heart rate. An unstable bradycardia exists clinically when 3 criteria are present:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The heart rate is slow.</li>
                            <li>The patient has symptoms.</li>
                            <li>The symptoms are due to the slow heart rate.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>Unstable bradycardia leads to serious signs and symptoms that include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hypotension</li>
                            <li>Acutely altered mental status</li>
                            <li>Signs of shock</li>
                            <li>Ischemic chest discomfort</li>
                            <li>Acute heart failure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Managing Bradycardia: The Bradycardia Algorithm</h3>
                        <p>The Adult Bradycardia Algorithm (Figure 27) outlines the steps for assessing and managing a patient who presents with unstable bradycardia with a pulse. Implementing this algorithm begins with identifying bradycardia (Step 1), which is typically when the heart rate is less than 50/min. First steps include the components of the BLS Assessment and the Primary Assessment.</p>

                        <p>Identify and treat underlying causes (Step 2):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintain patent airway; assist breathing as necessary.</li>
                            <li>Give oxygen (if hypoxemic).</li>
                            <li>Use a cardiac monitor to identify rhythm. Monitor blood pressure and oximetry.</li>
                            <li>Establish IV access.</li>
                            <li>Obtain a 12-lead ECG if available (Step 2).</li>
                            <li>Consider possible hypoxic and toxicologic causes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the differential diagnosis, the primary decision point in the algorithm is to determine if the patient has signs or symptoms of poor perfusion and if these are caused by the bradycardia (Step 3). If there are no signs of poor perfusion, monitor and observe (Step 4). If there are signs of poor perfusion, administer atropine (Step 5). If atropine is ineffective, prepare for TCP and/or consider dopamine or epinephrine infusion (Step 5). If indicated, seek expert consultation and consider transvenous pacing (Step 6). The severity of the patient's condition determines the treatment sequence in the algorithm, and you may need to implement multiple interventions simultaneously. If cardiac arrest develops, go to the Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm.</p>
                        <h4>Applying the Adult Bradycardia Algorithm</h4>
                        <p>In this case, a patient presents with symptoms of bradycardia. You conduct appropriate assessment and interventions as outlined in the Adult Bradycardia Algorithm while searching for and treating possible contributing factors.</p>

                        <p>The Team Leader in this case will assess and manage a patient with a rapid, unstable heart rate.

                        <h4>Rhythms for Unstable Tachycardia</h4>
                        <p>This case involves these ECG rhythms (examples in Figure 29):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sinus tachycardia</li>

                        <h4>Drugs for Unstable Tachycardia</h4>
                        <p>Drugs are generally not used to manage patients with unstable tachycardia; rather, immediate cardioversion is recommended. Consider administering sedative drugs in conscious patients, but do not delay immediate cardioversion in unstable patients.</p>
                        <h3>Approach to Unstable Tachycardia</h3>
                        <p>A tachycardia—that is, a heart rate greater than 100/min—has many potential causes and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. The key to managing a patient with any tachycardia is to assess the appropriateness for the clinical condition and determine whether pulses are present. If pulses are present, determine whether the patient is stable or unstable, and then provide treatment based on the patient's condition and rhythm.</p>
                        <p>If the tachycardia is sinus tachycardia, conduct a diligent search for the cause of the tachycardia. Treating and correcting this cause will improve the patient's signs and symptoms. Cardioversion is not indicated for tachycardia.</p>
                        <h4>Definitions</h4>
                        <p>Definitions used in this case are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tachycardia:</strong> defined as an arrhythmia with a heart rate typically 100/min or greater</li>
                            <li><strong>Symptomatic tachycardia:</strong> signs and symptoms due to the rapid heart rate</li>
                            <li>The rate takes on clinical significance at its extremes and is more likely attributable to an arrhythmia if the heart rate is 150/min or greater.</li>
                            <li>It is unlikely that symptoms of instability are caused primarily by the tachycardia when the heart rate is less than 150/min unless the patient has impaired ventricular function.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Pathophysiology of Unstable Tachycardia</h4>
                        <p>Unstable tachycardia exists when the heart rate is too fast for the patient's clinical condition. This excessive heart rate causes symptoms or an unstable condition because the heart is</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Beating so fast that cardiac output is reduced; this can cause pulmonary edema, coronary ischemia, and hypotension with reduced blood flow to vital organs (eg, brain, kidneys)</li>
                            <li>Beating ineffectively so that coordination between the atrium and ventricles or the ventricles themselves reduces cardiac output</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Signs and Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>Unstable tachycardia leads to serious signs and symptoms that include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hypotension</li>
                            <li>Acutely altered mental status</li>
                            <li>Signs of shock</li>
                            <li>Ischemic chest discomfort</li>
                            <li>Acute heart failure</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Rapid Recognition</h4>
                        <p>The 2 keys to managing unstable tachycardia are rapidly recognizing that</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient is significantly symptomatic or even unstable</li>
                            <li>The signs and symptoms are caused by the tachycardia</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Quickly determine whether the tachycardia is producing hemodynamic instability and the serious signs and symptoms or the serious signs and symptoms (eg, the pain and distress of an AMI) are the cause of the tachycardia.</p>
                        <p>Making this determination can be difficult. Many experts suggest that when a heart rate is less than 150/min, the symptoms of instability are not likely caused primarily by the tachycardia unless ventricular function is impaired. A heart rate typically less than 150/min is usually an appropriate response to physiologic stress (eg, fever, dehydration) or other underlying conditions.</p>
                        <p>Assess frequently for the presence or absence of signs and symptoms and for their severity.</p>
                        <h4>Indications for Cardioversion</h4>
                        <p>Rapidly identifying symptomatic tachycardia will help you determine whether to prepare for immediate cardioversion:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At heart rates typically 150/min or greater, symptoms are often present and cardioversion is often required in unstable patients.</li>
                            <li>If the patient is seriously ill or has underlying cardiovascular disease, symptoms may be present at lower rates.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You must know when cardioversion is indicated, how to prepare the patient for it (including appropriate medication), and how to switch the defibrillator/monitor to operate as a cardioverter.</p>

                        <p>The Adult Tachycardia With a Pulse Algorithm simplifies initial management of tachycardia. The presence or absence of pulses is considered the key to managing patients with any tachycardia. If a pulseless tachycardia is present, then manage the patient according to the PEA pathway of the Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm (Figure 41). If pulses are present, assess appropriateness for the clinical condition and determine whether the patient is stable or unstable, and then provide treatment based on the patient's condition and rhythm Step 1). Identify and treat underlying causes by doing the following (Step 2):</p>

                        <h5>Decision Point: Is the Persistent Tachycardia Causing Serious Signs or Symptoms?</h5>
                        <p>Assess the patient's degree of instability and determine if it is related to the tachycardia (Step 3).</p>
                        <h6>Unstable</h6>
                        <p>If the persistent tachyarrhythmia is causing the patient to demonstrate rate-related cardiovascular compromise with serious signs and symptoms, proceed to immediate synchronized cardioversion (Step 4).</p>
                        <p>Serious signs and symptoms are unlikely if the ventricular rate is less than 150/min in patients with a healthy heart. However, if the patient is seriously ill or has significant underlying heart disease or other conditions, symptoms may be present at a lower heart rate.</p>
                        <h6>Stable</h6>
                        <p>If the patient does not have rate-related cardiovascular compromise, proceed to Step 6. You'll have time to obtain a 12-lead ECG, evaluate the rhythm, determine the width of the QRS, and determine treatment options. For stable patients, seek expert consultation because treatment has the potential for harm.</p>
                        <h3>Cardioversion</h3>
                        <p>You must know when cardioversion is indicated and what type of shock to administer (Figure 31). Before cardioversion, establish IV access and sedate the responsive patient if possible, but do not delay cardioversion in unstable or deteriorating patients.</p>

                        <h4>Unsynchronized vs Synchronized Shocks</h4>
                        <p>Modern defibrillators and cardioverters can deliver unsynchronized or synchronized shocks. An unsynchronized shock means that the electrical shock is delivered as soon as you push the shock button on the device. These shocks may fall randomly anywhere within the cardiac cycle and use higher energy levels than synchronized shocks. Synchronized cardioversion uses a sensor to deliver a shock that is synchronized with a peak of the QRS complex. When you engage the sync option, pressing the shock button can result in a delay before shocking because the device synchronizes the shock to the peak of the R wave, and this may require analysis of several complexes. Synchronization avoids delivering a shock during cardiac repolarization (represented on the surface ECG as the T wave), a period of vulnerability in which a shock can precipitate VF. Synchronized shocks also use a lower energy level than attempted defibrillation. Always deliver synchronized shocks in patients with a pulse unless there is polymorphic VT, synchronization is impossible, or there is a delay to treatment in the unstable patient.</p>
                        <h4>Synchronized Cardioversion</h4>
                        <p>Synchronized cardioversion is the treatment of choice when a patient has a symptomatic (unstable) reentry SVT or VT with pulses and is recommended to treat unstable atrial fibrillation and flutter.</p>
                        <p>Cardioversion is unlikely to be effective for treating junctional tachycardia or ectopic or multifocal atrial tachycardia because these rhythms have an automatic focus arising from cells that are spontaneously depolarizing at a rapid rate. Delivering a shock generally cannot stop these rhythms and may actually increase the rate of the tachyarrhythmia.</p>
                        <p>In synchronized cardioversion, shocks are administered through adhesive electrodes or handheld paddles with the defibrillator/monitor in synchronized (sync) mode. The sync mode delivers energy just after the R wave of the QRS complex.</p>
                        <p>Follow these steps to perform synchronized cardioversion, modifying the steps for your specific device.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sedate all conscious patients unless unstable or deteriorating rapidly.</li>
                            <li>Turn on the defibrillator (monophasic or biphasic).</li>
                            <li>Attach monitor leads to the patient and ensure proper display of the patient's rhythm. Position adhesive electrode (conductor) pads on the patient.</li>
                            <li>Press the sync control button to engage the synchronization mode.</li>
                            <li>Look for markers on the R wave indicating sync mode.</li>
                            <li>Adjust monitor gain if necessary until sync markers occur with each R wave.</li>
                            <li>Select the appropriate energy level. Deliver synchronized shocks according to your device's recommended energy level to maximize the success of the first shock.</li>
                            <li>Announce to team members: "Charging defibrillator-stand clear!"</li>
                            <li>Press the charge button.</li>
                            <li>Clear the patient when the defibrillator is charged.</li>
                            <li>Press the shock button(s).</li>
                            <li>Check the monitor. If tachycardia persists, increase the energy level (joules) according to the device manufacturer's recommendations.</li>
                            <li>Activate the sync mode after delivery of each synchronized shock. Most defibrillators default back to the unsynchronized mode after delivery of a synchronized shock. This default allows an immediate shock if cardioversion produces VF.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Stable Tachycardias</h3>
                        <p>If the patient does not have rate-related cardiovascular compromise, proceed to Step 6. You'll have time to obtain a 12-lead ECG, evaluate the rhythm, determine if width of the QRS is 0.12 second or greater. In this case, consider adenosine only if the rhythm is regular and monomorphic, and consider antiarrhythmic infusion. Seek expert consultation because treatment has the potential for harm. If the rhythm is refractory, consider the underlying cause, the need to increase energy level for the next cardioversion, additional antiarrhythmic drugs, and additional expert consultation.</p>
