                        <p>A successful resuscitation attempt depends on high-quality resuscitation skills, good communication, and effective team dynamics. All rescuers on the team must be able to respond rapidly and effectively in an emergency situation. Effective multirescuer team dynamics help give victims the best chance of survival.</p>
                        <p>Team dynamics during a resuscitation attempt include 3 elements:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roles and responsibilities</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Because every second matters during a resuscitation attempt, it is important to define clear roles and responsibilities as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>When all team members know their jobs and responsibilities, the team functions more smoothly. Rescuers should clearly define roles as soon as possible and delegate tasks according to each team member's skill level. As soon as the victim is identified as pulseless, the CPR Coach will identify themselves and prompt the Compressor to begin chest compressions.</p>

                        <h3>Know Your Limitations</h3>
                        <p>All team members should know their limitations. The Team Leader needs to be aware of them as well. For example, advanced life support providers may be able to perform tasks that BLS providers would not be permitted to do. Some of these tasks are administering medications and performing intubation. Each team member should ask for assistance and advice early, before a situation starts to get worse.</p>

                        <h3>Offer Constructive Intervention</h3>
                        <p>Whether you are a team member or the Team Leader, there may be times when you need to point out another team member's incorrect or inappropriate actions. When this happens, it is important to intervene in a tactful and constructive way. This is especially important if someone is about to make a mistake on a drug, a dose, or an intervention.</p>
                        <p>Anyone on the team should speak up to stop someone else from making a mistake, regardless of role.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Share Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>Knowledge sharing is important for effective team performance. Not only can it help ensure that everyone fully understands the situation, but it can also help the team treat patients more efficiently and effectively. Team Leaders should frequently ask for observations and feedback. This includes asking for good ideas about managing a resuscitation attempt as well as for observations about possible oversights.</p>

                        <h3>Summarize and Reevaluate</h3>
                        <p>Summarizing information aloud is helpful during a resuscitation attempt because it:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provides an ongoing record of treatment</li>
                            <li>Is a way to reevaluate the victim's status, the interventions, and the team's progress within the algorithm of care</li>
                            <li>Helps team members respond to the victim's changing condition</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Use Closed-Loop Communication</h3>
                        <p>Closed-loop communication is an important technique used to prevent misunderstandings and treatment errors. It consists of the sender giving the message, the receiver repeating it back, and the sender then confirming it was heard correctly. To practice closed-loop communication, the Team Leader and team members should do the following:</p>
                        
                        <h4>Team Leader</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Call each team member by name and make eye contact when giving an instruction.</li>
                            <li>Do not assign additional tasks until you are sure the team member understands the instruction.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Team members</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Confirm that you understand each task the Team Leader assigns to you by verbally acknowledging that task.</li>
                            <li>Tell the Team Leader when you have finished a task.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Give Clear Messages</h3>
                        <p>To help prevent misunderstandings and keep everyone focused, all team members should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use clear, concise language</li>
                            <li>Speak loudly enough to be heard</li>
                            <li>Speak in a tone that's both calm and confident</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Show Mutual Respect</h3>
                        <p>All team members should display mutual respect and a professional attitude, regardless of each rescuer's skill level or training. Emotions can run high during a resuscitation attempt. It's especially important for the Team Leader to speak in a friendly, controlled voice and avoid shouting or aggression.</p>

                        <p>Coaching and debriefing are important in every resuscitation attempt. During the event, the CPR Coach will help improve performance of compressions and ventilation by ongoing coaching. They also will work with the Team Leader to minimize pauses in compressions during defibrillation and placement of an advanced airway.</p>
                        <p>After the resuscitation event, debriefing is an opportunity for the team to discuss how the resuscitation went, identify why the team took certain actions, and discuss whether anything can be improved in future events. Debriefing can occur immediately with the entire team or be scheduled at a later time with the team and others. It is an opportunity for education, quality improvement, and processing of emotions after participation in a stressful event.</p>
                        <p>Debriefing has been shown to:</p>
                        <ul>
