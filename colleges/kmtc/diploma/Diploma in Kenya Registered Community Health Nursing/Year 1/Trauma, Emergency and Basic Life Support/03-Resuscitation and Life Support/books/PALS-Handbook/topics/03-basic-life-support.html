                        <p>This handbook covers PALS and only briefly describes BLS. All PALS providers are assumed to be able to perform BLS appropriately. It is essential that PALS providers be proficient in BLS first. High-quality BLS is the foundation of PALS.</p>
                        <p>Basic Life Support (BLS) utilizes CPR and cardiac defibrillation when an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is available. BLS is the life support method used when there is limited access to advanced interventions such as medications and monitoring devices. In general, BLS is performed until the emergency medical services (EMS) arrives to provide a higher level of care. In every setting, high-quality CPR is the foundation of both BLS and PALS interventions. High-quality CPR gives the child or the infant the greatest chance of survival by providing circulation to the heart, brain, and other organs until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).</p>

                        <h3>ONE-RESCUER BLS FOR CHILDREN</h3>
                        <p>If you are alone with a child, do the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Tap their shoulder and talk loudly to the child to determine if they are responsive.</li>
                            <li>If the child does not respond and is not breathing (or is only gasping for breath), yell for help. If someone responds, send the second person to call 911 and to get an AED.</li>
                            <li>Assess if they are breathing while feeling for the child's carotid pulse (on the side of the neck) or femoral pulse (on the inner thigh in the crease between their leg and groin) for no more than 10 seconds.</li>
                            <li>If you cannot feel a pulse (or if you are unsure), begin CPR by doing 30 compressions followed by two breaths. If you can feel a pulse but the pulse rate is less than 60 beats per minute, you should begin CPR. This rate is too slow for a child.</li>
                            <li>After doing CPR for about two minutes (usually about five cycles of 30 compressions and two breaths) and if help has not arrived, call EMS while staying with the child. The ILCOR emphasizes that cell phones are available everywhere now and most have a built-in speakerphone. Get an AED if you know where one is.</li>
                            <li>Use and follow AED prompts when available while continuing CPR until EMS arrives or until the child's condition normalizes.</li>

                        <p>BLS for both children and infants is almost identical. The main differences between BLS for children and BLS for infants are (Table 2):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check the pulse in the infant using the brachial artery on the inside of the upper arm between the infant's elbow and shoulder.</li>
                            <li>During CPR, compressions can be performed on an infant using two fingers (with one rescuer) or with two thumb-encircling hands (if there are two rescuers and rescuer's hands are big enough to go around the infant's chest) (Figure 2).</li>
                            <li>Compression depth should be one-third of the chest depth; for most infants, this is about 1.5 inches (4 cm).</li>
                            <li>In infants, primary cardiac events are not common. Usually, cardiac arrest will be preceded by respiratory problems.

                            <li><strong>B.</strong> Early activation is key. Send any available bystanders to call 911. Many pediatric cardiac arrest situations are the result of a respiratory problem, and immediate intervention can be life-saving.</li>
                            <li><strong>C.</strong> The brachial pulse is located in the upper arm.</li>
                            <li><strong>B.</strong> For children and infants, 15:2 is the ratio for two rescuers, and 30:2 is the ratio for one rescuer.</li>
                            <li><strong>D.</strong> Additional components include clear messages, knowing one's limitations, constructive intervention, reevaluation, and summarizing.</li>
