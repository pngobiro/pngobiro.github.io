                        <h3>Course Description and Goal</h3>
                        <p>The Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS) Provider Course is designed for healthcare providers who either direct or participate in the management of cardiopulmonary arrest or other cardiovascular emergencies. Through didactic instruction and active participation in simulated cases, students will enhance their skills in the recognition and intervention of cardiopulmonary arrest, immediate post-cardiac arrest, acute dysrhythmia, stroke, and acute coronary syndromes (ACS). The goal of this course is to improve outcomes for adult patients of cardiopulmonary arrest and other cardiovascular emergencies through early recognition and interventions by high-performance teams.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
                        <p>After successfully completing this course, you should be able to</p>

                            <li>Perform early management of cardiac arrest until termination of resuscitation or transfer of care, including immediate post-cardiac arrest care</li>
                            <li>Evaluate resuscitative efforts during cardiac arrest by continually assessing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) quality, monitoring the patient's physiologic response, and delivering real-time feedback to the team</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Course Design</h3>
                        <p>To help you achieve these objectives, the ACLS Provider Course includes learning stations and a Megacode evaluation station. The learning stations provide activities such as</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simulated clinical scenarios</li>
                            <li>Video or instructor demonstrations</li>
                            <li>Discussion and role-playing</li>
                            <li>Group practice to achieve effective high-performance teams</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In these learning stations, you will practice essential skills both individually and as part of a team. Because this course emphasizes effective team skills as a vital part of the resuscitative effort, you'll practice as both a team member and as Team Leader.</p>
                        <p>In the Megacode evaluation station at the end of the class, you will participate in a simulated cardiac arrest scenario to evaluate your</p>

                        <p>ACLS providers face an important challenge: functioning as a team that implements basic and advanced life support to save a person's life. The 2020 AHA Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care reviewed evidence that in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings, many cardiac arrest patients do not receive high-quality CPR, and most do not survive. One study of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) showed that CPR quality was inconsistent and did not always meet guidelines recommendations.<sup>1</sup> Over the years, however, patient outcomes after cardiac arrest have improved. Table 1 shows the recent survival trends in both IHCA and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the United States.<sup>?</sup></p>

                        <h3>Continuous Quality Improvement</h3>
                        <p>Every emergency medical services (EMS) system and hospital system should assess its resuscitation interventions and outcomes through continuous quality improvement (CQI) with a defined process of data collection and review. The current consensus on the best way to improve both in-hospital and out-of-hospital survival after sudden cardiac arrest is to modify the standard quality improvement model according to the Chain of Survival metaphor. Each link in the chain comprises structural, process, and outcome variables that systems can examine, measure, and record. System managers can quickly identify gaps between observed processes and outcomes and local expectations or published standards. Individuals and teams who regularly review their performance in actual resuscitations will, on average, improve their performance in subsequent resuscitation events. Therefore, it is important for resuscitation teams to find the time to debrief themselves at some time after every resuscitation, either immediately or later.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Systems of Care</h3>
                        <p>A system is a group of interdependent components that regularly interact to form a whole. The system</p>

                            <li>Determines the strength of each link and of the chain</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Healthcare delivery requires structure (eg, people, equipment, education) and processes (eg, policies, protocols, procedures) that when integrated produce a system (eg, programs, organizations, cultures) leading to outcomes (eg, patient safety, quality, satisfaction). This integrated response, known as a system of care, comprises all of these elements—structure, process, system, and patient outcome—in a framework of CQI (Figure 1).</p>

                        <p>These systems require individuals and groups to share information so that they can evaluate and improve their system. Leadership and accountability are important components of this team approach.

                        <h4>Cardiac Arrest and Post-Cardiac Arrest Systems of Care</h4>
                        <p>Successful resuscitation requires integrated, coordinated actions. Experts believe that high survival rates from both in- and out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death are possible with strong systems of care.</p>
                        <p>Several factors have been associated with improved survival in patients with cardiac arrest:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Training healthcare providers to become more knowledgeable about what improves survival rates</li>
                            <li>Proactive planning and simulation of cardiac arrest to provide the opportunity for a healthcare provider to practice and improve responding to cardiac arrest</li>
                            <li>Rapidly recognizing cardiac arrest</li>

                        <p>The links in the system-specific Chains of Survival represent these actions. The chain of survival is a metaphor used to organize and describe the integrated set of time-sensitive coordinated actions necessary to maximize survival. The use of evidence-based education and implementation strategies can optimize the links in the chain. However, 2 separate chains (Figure 2) were created to reflect the differences in the steps needed for response to cardiac arrest in-hospital (IHCA) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).</p>

                        <p>Cardiac arrest can happen anywhere—on the street, at home, or in a hospital emergency department (ED), in-patient bed, or intensive care unit (ICU). Elements in the system of care and order of actions in the Chain of Survival differ based on the situation. Care will depend on whether the victim has the arrest outside the hospital or inside the hospital. Care also depends on whether the victim is an adult, child, or infant.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Chain of Survival Elements</h5>
                        <p>Although there are slight differences in the Chains of Survival based on the age of the victim and location of the cardiac arrest, each includes the following elements:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prevention and preparedness, including responder training, early recognition of cardiac arrest, and rapid response</li>
                            <li>Activation of the emergency response system, either outside of or within the hospital</li>
                            <li>High-quality CPR, including early defibrillation of VF and pVT</li>
                            <li>Advanced resuscitation interventions, including medications, advanced airway interventions, and extracorporeal CPR</li>
                            <li>Post-cardiac arrest care, including critical care interventions and targeted temperature management</li>
                            <li>Recovery, including effective support for physical, cognitive, emotional, and family needs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Regardless of where an arrest occurs, the care following resuscitation converges in the hospital, generally in an ED or ICU. This post-cardiac arrest care is depicted as the final link in both chains, symbolized by a hospital bed with a monitor and thermometer, which represent critical care interventions, advanced monitoring, and targeted temperature management. Patients who achieve ROSC after cardiac arrest in any setting have complex pathophysiologic processes called the post-cardiac arrest syndrome. This syndrome plays a significant role in patient mortality and includes</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Postarrest brain injury</li>
                            <li>Postarrest myocardial dysfunction</li>
                            <li>Systemic ischemia and reperfusion response</li>
                            <li>Persistent acute and chronic pathology that may have precipitated the cardiac arrest<sup>5</sup></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Healthcare systems should implement a comprehensive, structured, consistent, multidisciplinary system of care for treating post-cardiac arrest patients. Programs should address ventilation and hemodynamic optimization, targeted temperature management (TTM), immediate coronary reperfusion with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for eligible patients, neurologic care and prognostication, and other structured interventions. Individual hospitals that frequently treat cardiac arrest patients show an increased likelihood of patient survival when these interventions are provided.</p>
                        <p>As noted above, the structure and process elements before the convergence of the 2 chains vary significantly. Patients with OHCA depend on elements within the community for support. Lay rescuers must recognize the patient's arrest, call for help, and initiate CPR and early defibrillation (public-access defibrillation [PAD]) until a team of professionally trained emergency medical services (EMS) providers assumes responsibility and transports the patient to an ED and/or cardiac catheterization lab, followed by admission to an ICU for post-cardiac arrest care. Ideally, all victims of OHCA receive bystander CPR and defibrillation; if not, CPR and defibrillation won't occur until EMS personnel arrive, making the victim's chance of survival much lower. It is vital to measure and improve dispatch-aided CPR rates.</p>
                        <p>In contrast, patients with IHCA depend on a system of appropriate early recognition and prevention of cardiac arrest, which is represented by a magnifying glass in the first link. When cardiac arrest occurs, prompt activation of the emergency response system with a response to the cardiac arrest that provides high-quality CPR, early defibrillation, and advanced cardiovascular life support should result in the smooth interaction of a multidisciplinary team of professional providers, including physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and others. The last link is recovery and includes considerations for the postarrest needs of the patient and family. The chain metaphor endures: in any resuscitation, the chain is no stronger than its weakest link.</p>
                        <p>The classic resuscitation Chain of Survival concept linked the community to EMS and EMS to hospitals, with hospital care as the destination.<sup>6</sup> But patients with a cardiac emergency may enter the system of care at any point (Figure 3), including on the street; at home; or in the hospital's ED, inpatient bed, ICU, operating suite, catheterization suite, or imaging department. The system of care must be able to manage cardiac emergencies wherever they occur.</p>

                        <h5>Measurement</h5>
                        <p>Systems that continually work to improve resuscitation outcomes capture and review data related to resuscitation education, processes, and outcomes to identify measures that can lead to better patient care. Quality improvement efforts rely on valid assessments of resuscitation performance and patient outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Utstein-style guidelines and templates allow for reporting resuscitation outcomes after trauma and drowning.<sup>7</sup> These OHCA guidelines<sup>8</sup> provide guidance for core performance measures, including</p>

                        <p>Physiologic end points are generally considered the best indicators of resuscitation effectiveness, and outside of a hospital setting, ETCO<sub>2</sub> is typically available. During CPR, ETCO<sub>2</sub> is a relative indicator of cardiac output and can also signal return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), so this should be used if possible. CPR performance monitors are now widely available, 10 and they provide invaluable real-time feedback on the quality of CPR that rescuers deliver during resuscitation attempts. Other monitors of CPR performance are increasingly available and can provide real-time feedback to healthcare providers. After a resuscitation attempt, these monitors also provide data for debriefing and information for system-wide CPR CQI programs. Without a way to measure CPR and understand their performance, providers cannot improve.</p>
                        <p>Some CPR performance characteristics are available as immediate feedback while other characteristics are available only after CPR or not at all, given current technology. The ability to receive immediate feedback on the following items will depend on the level of technology available:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immediately available feedback
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-Chest compression rate</li>
                                    <li>-Depth</li>
                                    <li>-Recoil</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Feedback for review
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-Chest compression fraction</li>
                                    <li>-Preshock, perishock, and postshock pauses</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>-Feedback that cannot be assessed adequately
                                <ul>
                                    <li>-Ventilation rate</li>
                                    <li>-Airway pressure</li>

                                    <li>-Other physiological end points, if available (ie, ETCO2, intra-arterial blood pressure, cardiac ultrasound)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Current CPR monitoring devices do not always provide optimal feedback. For example, accelerometers do not sense mattress compression, and their rigid algorithms do not realistically prioritize the order of feedback—they cannot measure depth if the provider leans too much, so the devices prioritize feedback to correct leaning before depth. Although some solutions currently exist, including software (automated algorithms) and hardware (smart backboard, dual accelerometers, reference markers, and others), continued improvements to performance require continued improvements to CPR monitoring.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Benchmarking and Feedback</h5>
                        <p>Systems should review feedback data and compare the information to prior internal performance and similar external systems. Existing registries can help benchmark the data. Examples of these registries include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) for OHCA</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Change</h5>
                        <p>Simply by measuring and benchmarking care, systems can positively influence outcome. However, they must also review and interpret the data to identify areas for improvement, such as</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased bystander CPR response rates</li>
                            <li>Improved CPR performance</li>
                            <li>Shortened time to defibrillation</li>
                            <li>Citizen awareness</li>
                            <li>Citizen and healthcare professional education and training</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Over the past 50 years, rescuers have used the modern-era BLS fundamentals of early recognition and activation, early CPR, and early defibrillation to save hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. However, survival disparities identified years ago persist, so we must continue improving care to fulfill the potential of the Chain of Survival. Fortunately, we have the knowledge and tools—represented by the Chain of Survival—to address many of these care gaps, and future discoveries will offer opportunities to improve rates of survival.</p>

                        <p>For optimal care, healthcare providers use a systematic approach to assess and treat arrest and acutely ill or injured patients. For a patient in respiratory or cardiac arrest, high-performance teams aim to support and restore effective oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation with return of intact neurologic function.

                        <p>Before you approach any patient, rapidly verify scene safety (no threat to the provider). Once you've determined that the scene is safe, use the systematic approach (Figures 6 and 7) to determine the patient's level of consciousness.</p>

                        <h3>BLS Assessment</h3>
                        <p>The BLS Assessment is a systematic approach to BLS for trained healthcare providers. This approach stresses early CPR with basic airway management and defibrillation but not advanced airway techniques or drug administration. By using the BLS Assessment, any healthcare provider can support or restore effective oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation until the patient achieves ROSC or advanced providers intervene. Performing the BLS Assessment substantially improves a patient's chance of survival and a good neurologic outcome.</p>
                        <p><strong>Remember to assess first, and then perform the appropriate action.</strong></p>
                        <p>Although the BLS Assessment requires no advanced equipment, you can use readily available supplies, such as a bag-mask ventilation device if it is available. Whenever possible, place the patient faceup on a firm, flat surface to maximize the effectiveness of chest compressions. Table 2 is an overview of the BLS Assessment, and Figures 8 through 12 illustrate the steps needed during the BLS Assessment.</p>

                            <p>Chest compressions are more often too shallow than too deep. However, research suggests that compressing deeper than 2.4 inches (6 cm) in adults may not be optimal for survival from cardiac arrest and may cause injuries. If you have a CPR quality feedback device, target your compression depth from 2 to 2.4 inches (5 to 6 cm).</p>

                        <h4>Tailoring the Response</h4>
                        <p>Single rescuers may tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest. For example, a healthcare provider who sees an adolescent suddenly collapse (eg, after a blow to the chest) can assume that the patient has had a sudden cardiac arrest. In this case, the rescuer should activate the emergency response system via mobile device, get an AED if nearby, return to the patient to attach the AED, and then provide CPR. However, if the rescuer believes hypoxia caused the cardiac arrest (such as in a drowning victim), he or she may perform about 2 minutes of CPR, including breaths, before activating the emergency response system.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Critical Concepts: Minimizing Interruptions in Chest Compressions</h4>
                            <p>When you stop chest compressions, blood flow to the brain and heart stops, so you must minimize the number of interruptions. Additionally, try to limit the duration of interruptions for defibrillation or rhythm analysis to no longer than 10 seconds unless you are moving the patient from a dangerous environment. Refer to Figure 13.</p>

                            <li>Prolonged rhythm analysis</li>
                            <li>Frequent or inappropriate pulse checks</li>
                            <li>Prolonged ventilation</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) is aortic relaxation (diastolic) pressure minus right atrial relaxation (diastolic) pressure. During CPR, CPP correlates with both myocardial blood flow and ROSC. In 1 human study, ROSC did not occur unless a CPP of 15 mm Hg or greater was achieved during CPR. Because ETCO<sub>2</sub> is related to cardiac output with chest compressions during cardiac arrest, ROSC is similarly unlikely with a persistent ETCO<sub>2</sub> of less than 10 mm Hg.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Starting CPR When You Are Not Sure About a Pulse</h4>
                        <p>If you aren't sure whether you feel a pulse, start CPR. Unnecessary compressions are better than no compressions at all in a patient with no pulse, and delayed CPR reduces the chance of survival.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Agonal Gasps</h4>
                        <p>You may see agonal gasps in the first minutes after sudden cardiac arrest, but agonal gasps are not normal breathing. They are a sign of cardiac arrest. A patient who gasps may appear to be drawing air in very quickly. The mouth may be open, and the jaw, head, or neck may move with gasps. These gasps may appear forceful or weak, and some time may pass between them because they usually happen at a slow, irregular rate. An agonal gasp may sound like a snort, snore, or groan. If you identify agonal gasps, begin chest compressions without delay.</p>

                        <h3>Primary Assessment</h3>
                        <p>In the Primary Assessment, you continue to assess the patient and perform appropriate actions until the patient is transferred to the next level of care. Members of a high-performance team often perform assessments and actions in ACLS simultaneously.</p>
                        <p>For unconscious patients in arrest (cardiac or respiratory), complete the BLS Assessment before the Primary Assessment. For conscious patients who may need more advanced assessment and management, conduct the Primary Assessment first. Table 3 provides an overview of the Primary Assessment.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Hypovolemia and hypoxia are the 2 most common underlying and potentially reversible causes of PEA.</li>
                                <li>Look for evidence of these problems as you assess the patient and treat immediately.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <h4>Diagnosing and Treating Underlying Causes</h4>
                        <p>Patients in cardiac arrest (VF/pVT/asystole/PEA) need rapid assessment and management to determine if an underlying, potentially reversible problem caused the arrest. If you can quickly identify a specific condition, you may achieve ROSC. Identifying the underlying cause is crucial in cases of cardiac arrest. Addressing the underlying cause will provide the best chance for a successful resuscitation. Ultrasound may help with identifying the underlying cause quickly and can also provide information to help determine the next step for treatment. Paying attention to the patient's response to interventions may also help you narrow the differential diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>To search for the underlying cause, do the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider the underlying causes by recalling the H's and T's</li>
                            <li>Analyze the ECG for clues to the underlying cause</li>
                            <li>Recognize hypovolemia</li>
                            <li>Recognize drug overdose/poisonings</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Hypovolemia</h4>
                        <p>Hypovolemia, a common cause of PEA, initially produces the classic physiologic response of a rapid, narrow-complex tachycardia (sinus tachycardia) and typically increases diastolic and decreases systolic pressures. As loss of blood volume continues, blood pressure drops, eventually becoming undetectable, but the narrow QRS complexes and rapid rate continue (ie, PEA).</p>
                        <p>Consider hypovolemia as a cause of hypotension, which can deteriorate to PEA. Providing prompt treatment can reverse the pulseless state by rapidly correcting the hypovolemia. Common nontraumatic causes of hypovolemia include occult internal hemorrhage and severe dehydration. Consider volume infusion for PEA associated with a narrow-complex tachycardia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Cardiac and Pulmonary Conditions</h4>
                        <p>ACS that involve a large amount of heart muscle can present as PEA, VF, pVT, or asystole. That is, occlusion of the left main or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery can present with cardiogenic shock rapidly progressing to cardiac arrest and PEA. However, in patients with cardiac arrest and without known pulmonary embolism (PE) or suspected PE or STEMI, giving routine fibrinolytic treatment during CPR shows no benefit and is not recommended.</p>
                        <p>Massive or saddle PE obstructs flow to the pulmonary vasculature and causes acute right heart failure. In patients with cardiac arrest due to presumed or known PE, it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytics.</p>
                        <p>Pericardial tamponade may be reversible with pericardiocentesis, and during periarrest, volume infusion may help while definitive therapy is initiated. Once you recognize tension pneumothorax, you should effectively treat it with needle decompression and chest tube insertion.</p>
                        <p>You cannot treat cardiac tamponade, tension pneumothorax, and massive PE unless you recognize them. A skilled provider can perform bedside ultrasound to help rapidly identify tamponade, pneumothorax, and echocardiographic evidence of PE.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Drug Overdoses or Toxic Exposures</h4>
                        <p>Certain drug overdoses and toxic exposures may lead to peripheral vascular dilatation and/or myocardial dysfunction with resultant hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. Treat poisoned patients aggressively because the toxic effects may progress rapidly, but during this time, the myocardial dysfunction and arrhythmias may be reversible.</p>
                        <p>Treatments that can provide support include</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prolonged basic CPR in special resuscitation situations (such as accidental hypothermia)</li>
                            <li>Extracorporeal CPR</li>
                            <li>Intra-aortic balloon pump therapy</li>
                            <li>Renal dialysis</li>
                            <li>Intravenous lipid emulsion for lipid-soluble toxins</li>
                            <li>Specific drug antidotes (digoxin immune Fab, glucagon, bicarbonate)</li>
                            <li>Transcutaneous pacing</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Remember, if the patient shows signs of ROSC, begin post-cardiac arrest care.</strong></p>
