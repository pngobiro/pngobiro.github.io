                        <p>Welcome to the American Heart Association Basic Life Support (BLS) Provider Course. BLS is the foundation for saving lives after cardiac arrest. In this course, you will learn the skills of high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for victims of all ages. You will practice delivering these skills both as a single rescuer and as a member of a multirescuer team. The skills you learn in this course will enable you to:</p>

                            <li>Recognize cardiac arrest</li>

                            <li>Respond quickly and confidently</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Despite important advances in prevention, sudden cardiac arrest remains a leading cause of death in many countries. About half of cardiac arrests are unwitnessed. Outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains poor. Only about 10% of adult patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest who are treated by emergency medical services (EMS) survive to hospital discharge.</p>
                        <p>This course will help you give victims the best chance of survival.</p>

                        <h3>Skills Tests</h3>
                        <p>You must pass 2 skills tests to receive your BLS course completion card. During the course, you will have an opportunity to learn and practice chest compressions, bag-mask ventilation, and using an AED. After practice, your instructor will test your skills by reading a brief scenario. You will be asked to respond as you would in a real-life situation. The instructor will not coach or help you during the skills tests.</p>

                        <h3>Exam</h3>
                        <p>The exam is open resource. This means that you may refer to print or digital resources while you are taking the exam. You may not, however, discuss the exam questions with other students or your instructor. Examples of resources that you may use include notes you take in class, this Provider Manual, and the American Heart Association's Handbook of Emergency Cardiovascular Care for Healthcare Providers.</p>
