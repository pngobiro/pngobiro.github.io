                        <p>A choking victim's condition may worsen, and the victim may become unresponsive. If you are aware that a foreign-body airway obstruction is causing the victim's condition, you will know to look for a foreign body in the throat.</p>
                        <p>To relieve choking in an unresponsive adult or child, follow these steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Shout for help. If someone else is available, send that person to activate the emergency response system.</li>
                            <li>Gently lower the victim to the ground if you see that they are becoming unresponsive.</li>
                            <li>Begin CPR, starting with chest compressions. Do not check for a pulse. Each time you open the airway to give breaths, open the victim's mouth wide. Look for the object.
                                <br>a. If you see an object that looks easy to remove, remove it with your fingers.
                                <br>b. If you do not see an object, continue CPR.
                            </li>
                            <li>After about 5 cycles or 2 minutes of CPR, activate the emergency response system if someone has not already done so.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If a choking victim is already unresponsive when you arrive, you probably will not know if a foreign-body airway obstruction exists. In this situation, you should activate the emergency response system and start high-quality CPR.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Giving Effective Breaths When There Is an Airway Obstruction</h3>
                        <p>When a choking victim loses consciousness, the muscles in the throat may relax. This could convert a complete/severe airway obstruction to a partial obstruction. In addition, chest compressions may create at least as much force as abdominal thrusts, so they may help expel the object. Giving 30 compressions and then removing any object that's visible in the mouth may allow you to eventually give effective breaths.</p>

                        <h3>Actions After Choking Relief</h3>
                        <p>You will know you successfully removed an airway obstruction in an unresponsive victim if you saw and removed a foreign body from the victim's mouth and the victim starts to breathe. However, you don't always have to remove the foreign body to successfully relieve the obstruction. If you can feel air movement and see the chest rise when you give breaths, the airway is no longer obstructed.</p>
                        <p>After you relieve choking in an unresponsive victim, proceed as you would with any unresponsive victim. Check again for responsiveness, check for breathing and a pulse, confirm that someone has activated the emergency response system, and provide high-quality CPR or rescue breathing as needed.</p>
                        <p>Encourage a responsive victim to seek immediate medical attention. A healthcare professional should evaluate the victim for potential complications from abdominal thrusts.</p>

                        <h3>Responsive Infant</h3>
                        <p>Use back slaps and chest thrusts for choking relief in an infant. Do not use abdominal thrusts.</p>
                        <p>To relieve choking in a responsive infant, follow these steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Kneel or sit with the infant in your lap.</li>
                            <li>Hold the infant facedown with the head slightly lower than the chest, resting on your forearm. Support the infant's head and jaw with your hand. Take care to avoid compressing the soft tissues of the infant's throat. Rest your forearm on your lap or thigh to support the infant.</li>
                            <li>With the heel of your hand, deliver up to 5 forceful back slaps between the infant's shoulder blades (Figure 43A). Deliver each slap with enough force to attempt to dislodge the foreign body.</li>
                            <li>After delivering up to 5 back slaps, place your free hand on the infant's back, supporting the back of the infant's head with the palm of your hand. The infant will be adequately cradled between your 2 forearms, with the palm of one hand supporting the face and jaw while the palm of the other hand supports the back of the infant's head.</li>
                            <li>Turn the infant over while carefully supporting the head and neck. Hold the infant faceup, with your forearm resting on your thigh. Keep the infant's head lower than the trunk.</li>
                            <li>Provide up to 5 quick downward chest thrusts (Figure 43B) in the middle of the chest, over the lower half of the breastbone (the same location as for chest compressions during CPR). Deliver chest thrusts at a rate of about 1 per second, each with the intention of creating enough force to dislodge the foreign body.</li>
                            <li>Repeat the sequence of up to 5 back slaps and up to 5 chest thrusts until your actions have removed the object or the infant becomes unresponsive.</li>

                        <h3>Unresponsive Infant</h3>
                        <p>If the infant victim becomes unresponsive, stop giving back slaps and start CPR, starting with chest compressions.</p>
                        <p>To relieve choking in an unresponsive infant, follow these steps:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Shout for help. If someone responds, send that person to activate the emergency response system. Place the infant on a firm, flat surface.</li>
                            <li>Begin CPR (starting with compressions) with 1 extra step: Each time you open the airway, look for the object in the back of the throat. If you see an object and can easily remove it, remove it. Note that you do not check for a pulse before beginning CPR.</li>
                            <li>After about 2 minutes of CPR, activate the emergency response system (if no one has done so).</li>
