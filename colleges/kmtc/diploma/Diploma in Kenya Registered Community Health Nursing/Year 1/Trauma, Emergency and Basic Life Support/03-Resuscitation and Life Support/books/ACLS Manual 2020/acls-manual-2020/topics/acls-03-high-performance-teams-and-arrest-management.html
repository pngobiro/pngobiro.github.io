                        <p>High-performance teams are essential to successful resuscitation attempts. High-performance teams carry out their roles in highly effective manners, resulting in superior performance and timing, which can translate to improved survival for patients in cardiac arrest. What distinguishes high-performance teams from others is that each team member is committed to ensuring the highest-quality performance of the team rather than simply following orders. To function effectively, a high-performance team needs to focus on</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Timing:</strong> time to first compression, time to first shock, CCF ideally greater than 80%,* minimizing preshock pause, and early emergency medical services (EMS) response time</li>
                            <li><strong>Quality:</strong> rate, depth, complete recoil, minimizing interruptions, switching compressors every 2 minutes or sooner if fatigued, avoiding excessive ventilation, and using a feedback device</li>
                            <li><strong>Coordination:</strong> team dynamics: team members working together seamlessly toward a common goal, proficient in their roles</li>
                            <li><strong>Administration:</strong> leadership, measurement, continuous quality improvement, and number of participating code team members</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>* High-performing systems target at least 60%, with 80% or higher being a frequent goal.</em></p>
                        <p>High-performance teams (Figure 32) will need to incorporate timing, quality, coordination, and administration of the appropriate procedures during a cardiac arrest. The team will need to consider their overall purpose and goals, skills each team member possesses, appropriate motivation and efficacy, as well as appropriate conflict resolution and communication needs of the team. In addition, high-performance teams measure their performance, evaluate the data, and look for ways to improve performance and implement the revised strategy.</p>

                            <p>Whether you are a team member or the Team Leader during a resuscitation attempt, you should understand how a high-performance team can maximize CCF when performing CPR during a cardiac arrest. The team can achieve key metrics and increase CCF by doing the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Precharge the defibrillator 15 seconds before a 2-minute rhythm analysis (deliver shock immediately if VF or pVT on the monitor). This makes it possible to conduct a rhythm analysis and give a shock (if needed) within 10 seconds or less.</li>
                                <li>Perform a pulse check during the precharge phase in anticipation of an organized rhythm during analysis (a pulse check during compressions is not a reliable indicator of CPR quality).</li>
                                <li>Compressor hovers over the chest (not touching it), ready to start chest compressions immediately after a shock, a rhythm analysis, or other necessary pauses in compressions.</li>
                                <li>Have the next compressor ready to take over immediately.</li>
                                <li>Intubate without pausing compressions.</li>
                                <li>Deliver medications during compressions.</li>
                                <li>Consider CPR protocols that deliver fewer pauses (eg, continuous compressions with asynchronous ventilation using a bag-mask device).</li>

                        <p>Successful resuscitation attempts often require healthcare providers to simultaneously perform a variety of interventions. Although a CPR-trained bystander working alone can resuscitate a patient within the first moments after collapse, most attempts require multiple healthcare providers. Effective teamwork divides the tasks while multiplying the chances of a successful outcome.</p>
                        <p>Successful high-performance teams not only have medical expertise and mastery of resuscitation skills but also demonstrate effective communication and team dynamics. This section discusses the importance of team roles, behaviors of effective Team Leaders and team members, and elements of effective high-performance team dynamics.</p>

                        <h4>Team Leader Role</h4>
                        <p>Every high-performance team needs a leader to organize the efforts of the group. The Team Leader</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Organizes the group</li>
                            <li>Monitors individual performance of team members</li>
                            <li>Backs up team members</li>
                            <li>Models excellent team behavior</li>
                            <li>Trains and coaches</li>
                            <li>Facilitates understanding</li>
                            <li>Focuses on comprehensive patient care</li>
                            <li>Temporarily designates another team member to take over as Team Leader if an advanced procedure is required (eg, advanced airway placement)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Team Leader is responsible for making sure everything is done at the right time in the right way by monitoring and integrating individual performance of team members. The Team Leader should also help train future Team Leaders and improve team effectiveness. After resuscitation, the Team Leader can help analyze, critique, and practice for the next resuscitation attempt.</p>
                        <h4>Team Member Roles</h4>
                        <p>For a successful resuscitation attempt, high-performance team members must be</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proficient in performing the skills in their scope of practice</li>
                            <li>Clear about role assignments</li>
                            <li>Prepared to fulfill their role responsibilities</li>
                            <li>Well-practiced in resuscitation skills</li>
                            <li>Knowledgeable about the algorithms</li>
                            <li>Committed to success</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Team Member Role: CPR Coach</h4>
                        <p>Many resuscitation teams now include the role of CPR Coach. The CPR Coach supports performance of high-quality BLS skills, allowing the Team Leader to focus on other aspects of clinical care. Studies have shown that resuscitation teams with a CPR Coach perform higher-quality CPR with higher CCF and shorter pause durations compared with teams that don't use a CPR Coach.</p>
                        <p>The CPR Coach does not need to be a separate role; they can be blended into the current responsibilities of the Monitor/Defibrillator. The CPR Coach's main responsibilities are to help team members provide high-quality CPR and minimize pauses in compressions. The CPR Coach needs a direct line of sight to the Compressor, so they should stand next to the Defibrillator. Below is a description of the CPR Coach's actions.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Coordinate the start of CPR:</strong> As soon as a patient is identified as having no pulse, the CPR Coach says, "I am the CPR Coach," and tells providers to begin chest compressions. The CPR Coach can adjust the environment to help ensure high-quality CPR. They can lower the bedrails or the bed, get a step stool, or roll the victim to place a backboard and defibrillator pads.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coach to improve the quality of chest compressions:</strong> The CPR Coach gives feedback about performance of compression depth, rate, and chest recoil. They state the CPR feedback device's data to help the Compressor improve performance. This is useful because visual assessment of CPR quality is often inaccurate.</li>
                            <li><strong>State the midrange targets:</strong> The CPR Coach states the specific midrange targets so that compressions and ventilation are within the recommended range. For example, they should tell the Compressor to compress at a rate of 110/min instead of a rate between 100 and 120/min.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coach to the midrange targets:</strong> The CPR Coach gives team members feedback about their ventilation rate and volume. If needed, they also remind the team about compression-to-ventilation ratio.</li>
                            <li><strong>Help minimize the length of pauses in compressions:</strong> The CPR Coach communicates with the team to help minimize the length of pauses in compressions. Pauses happen when the team defibrillates, switches Compressors, and places an advanced airway.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>For respiratory arrest, this patient is unconscious and unresponsive and has a pulse, but respirations are completely absent or clearly inadequate to maintain effective oxygenation and ventilation. Do not confuse agonal gasps with adequate respirations. Use the BLS, Primary, and Secondary Assessments even though the patient is in respiratory but not cardiac arrest.</p>
                        <h3>Normal and Abnormal Breathing</h3>
                        <p>The average respiratory rate for an adult at rest is about 12 to 20/min. Typically, a tidal volume of 6 to 8 mL/kg maintains normal oxygenation and elimination of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
                        <p>Tachypnea is a respiratory rate above 20/min and bradypnea is a respiratory rate below 12/min. A respiratory rate below 6/min (hypoventilation), requires assisted ventilation with a bag-mask device or advanced airway with 100% oxygen.</p>
                        <h3>Identifying Respiratory Problems by Severity</h3>
                        <p>Identifying the severity of a respiratory problem will help you decide the most appropriate interventions. Be alert for signs of respiratory distress and respiratory failure.</p>
                        <h4>Respiratory Distress</h4>
                        <p>Respiratory distress is a clinical state characterized by abnormal respiratory rate or effort—either increased (eg, tachypnea, nasal flaring, retractions, and use of accessory muscles) or inadequate (eg, hypoventilation or bradypnea).</p>
                        <p>Respiratory distress can range from mild to severe. For example, a patient with mild tachypnea and a mild increase in respiratory effort with changes in airway sounds is in mild respiratory distress. A patient with marked tachypnea, significantly increased respiratory effort, deterioration in skin color, and changes in mental status is in severe respiratory distress. Severe respiratory distress can indicate respiratory failure.</p>
                        <p>Respiratory distress typically includes some or all of these signs in varying severity:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tachypnea</li>
                            <li>Increased respiratory effort (eg, nasal flaring, retractions)</li>
                            <li>Inadequate respiratory effort (eg, hypoventilation or bradypnea)</li>
                            <li>Abnormal airway sounds (eg, stridor, wheezing, grunting)</li>
                            <li>Tachycardia</li>
                            <li>Pale, cool skin (however, some causes of respiratory distress, like sepsis, may cause warm, red, and diaphoretic skin)</li>
                            <li>Changes in level of consciousness/agitation</li>
                            <li>Use of abdominal muscles to help breathe</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Respiratory Failure</h4>
                        <p>Respiratory failure is a clinical state of inadequate oxygenation, ventilation, or both. Respiratory failure is often the end stage of respiratory distress. If the patient has abnormal central nervous system control of breathing or muscle weakness, she may show little or no respiratory effort despite being in respiratory failure. In these situations, you may need to identify respiratory failure based on clinical findings. Confirm the diagnosis with objective measurements, such as pulse oximetry or blood gas analysis.</p>
                        <p>Suspect probable respiratory failure if some of the following signs are present:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Marked tachypnea</li>
                            <li>Bradypnea, apnea</li>
                            <li>No respiratory effort</li>
                            <li>Poor to absent distal air movement</li>
                            <li>Tachycardia (early); bradycardia (late)</li>
                            <li>Cyanosis</li>
                            <li>Stupor, coma (late)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Respiratory Arrest</h4>
                        <p>Respiratory arrest is the absence of breathing, usually caused by an event such as drowning or head injury. For an adult in respiratory arrest, provide a tidal volume of approximately 500 to 600 mL (6 to 7 mL/kg), or enough to produce visible chest rise.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Caution: Avoiding Excessive Ventilation</h4>
                            <p>Avoid excessive ventilation (too many breaths or too large a volume) during respiratory arrest and cardiac arrest. Excessive ventilation can cause gastric inflation and complications such as regurgitation and aspiration. More important, excessive ventilation can be harmful because it increases intrathoracic pressure, decreases venous return to the heart, diminishes cardiac output and survival, and may cause cerebral vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to the brain.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Managing Respiratory Arrest</h3>
                        <p>Management of respiratory arrest includes both BLS and ACLS interventions. These interventions may include giving supplemental oxygen, opening the airway, providing basic ventilation, using basic airway adjuncts (oropharyngeal airway [OPA] and nasopharyngeal airway [NPA]), and suctioning the airway.</p>
                        <p>Remember, for patients with a perfusing rhythm, deliver breaths once every 6 seconds.</p>

                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>To be successful, any resuscitation attempt needs a strong base of high-quality CPR and defibrillation when the patient's ECG rhythm requires it. Leaders must also assess the performance of each system component, ensuring that system participants can effectively intervene to improve care. This process of quality improvement consists of an iterative and continuous cycle of</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Systematic evaluation of resuscitation care and outcome</li>
                            <li>Benchmarking with stakeholder feedback</li>
                            <li>Strategic efforts to address identified deficiencies</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Another characteristic of high-quality CPR is minimal interruptions in chest compressions. Studies demonstrate that healthcare providers interrupt compressions far too often and for too long, in some cases spending 25% to 50% of a resuscitation attempt without delivering chest compressions.</p>
                        <h3>Managing VF/pVT: The Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm</h3>
                        <p>You must know the most important algorithm for adult resuscitation: the Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm (Figure 41). This algorithm outlines all the steps to assess and manage a pulseless patient who does not initially respond to BLS interventions, including a first shock from an AED. The algorithm consists of the 2 pathways for cardiac arrest:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A shockable rhythm, displayed on the VF/pVT pathway of the algorithm</li>
                            <li>A nonshockable rhythm, displayed on the asystole/PEA pathway of the algorithm</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Applying the Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm: VF/pVT Pathway</h4>
                        <p>For this algorithm, healthcare providers should have already completed the BLS Assessment, including activating the emergency response system, performing high-quality CPR, attaching the manual defibrillator, and delivering the first shock (Steps 1 through 4). Now, the ACLS high-performance team intervenes and conducts the Primary Assessment.</p>
                        <h5>Start CPR (Step 1)</h5>
                        <p>The initial step in the Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm is to start CPR. As soon as the patient is found to be unresponsive with no breathing (or only gasping), shout for nearby help and activate the emergency response system, send for a defibrillator, check for a pulse, and start CPR, beginning with chest compressions. Attach the ECG monitor or AED pads as soon as they are available. Throughout the resuscitation attempt, provide high-quality CPR (give chest compressions of adequate rate and depth, allow complete chest recoil after each compression, minimize interruptions in compressions, and avoid excessive ventilation).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Give oxygen.</li>
                            <li>Attach the monitor/defibrillator.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once the monitor/defibrillator is attached, check the rhythm to determine whether it is shockable (VF/pVT) or nonshockable (asystole/PEA) and follow the appropriate cardiac arrest pathway.</p>
                        <h5>Defibrillate (Shockable Rhythm: VF/pVT)</h5>
                        <p>As soon as you determine that the rhythm is shockable (VF or pVT), deliver 1 shock. The appropriate energy dose is determined by the identity of the defibrillator—monophasic or biphasic.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you are using a monophasic defibrillator, give a single 360-J shock.</li>
                            <li>When using biphasic defibrillators, providers should use the manufacturer's recommended energy dose (eg, initial dose of 120 to 200 J). If you do not know the effective dose range, deliver the maximal energy dose.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Immediately after the shock, resume CPR, beginning with chest compressions. Give 2 minutes of CPR. If there are available providers, IV or IO access should be established.</p>
                        <h5>Vasopressors</h5>
                        <p>When IV/IO access is available, give epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO during CPR after the second shock, and repeat every 3 to 5 minutes, or every 4 minutes as a midrange (ie, every other rhythm check). If additional team members are available, they should anticipate the need for drugs and prepare them in advance.</p>
                        <h5>Antiarrhythmics</h5>
                        <p>Healthcare providers may consider giving antiarrhythmic drugs, either before or after the shock. The focus should be on administering medications quickly and so that defibrillation is not delayed. Amiodarone or lidocaine may be considered for VF/pVT that is unresponsive to defibrillation.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Amiodarone:</strong> 300 mg IV/IO bolus, then consider 1 additional 150 mg IV/IO</li>
                            <li><strong>Lidocaine:</strong> 1 to 1.5 mg/kg IV/IO first dose, then 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg IV/IO at 5- to 10-minute intervals, to a maximum dose of 3 mg/kg</li>
                            <li><strong>Magnesium sulfate:</strong> For torsades de pointes, loading dose 1 to 2 g IV/IO diluted in 10 mL given as IV/IO bolus, typically over 20 minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Search for and treat any treatable underlying cause of cardiac arrest, such as the H's and T's.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Description of PEA</h3>
                        <p>PEA refers to a situation where the heart generates electrical activity that should correspond to a pulse but no pulse can be palpated. PEA encompasses a heterogeneous group of rhythms that are organized or semiorganized. Any organized rhythm without a pulse is defined as PEA.</p>
                        <h3>Approach to Asystole</h3>
                        <p>Asystole is a cardiac arrest rhythm associated with no discernible electrical activity on the ECG (also called flat line). You should confirm that the flat line on the monitor is indeed true asystole by validating that the flat line is not some other rhythm (eg, fine VF) or the result of a technical artifact.</p>
                        <h3>Managing Asystole/PEA: The Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm</h3>
                        <p>The Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm combines the asystole and PEA pathways because of their similar causes and management. A good resuscitation outcome requires the high-performance team to provide effective CPR and identify and correct the cause of the arrest.</p>

                        <h4>Managing Asystole/PEA</h4>
                        <p>If the patient has an organized rhythm on the monitor but no pulse, the condition is PEA (Step 9). Resume chest compressions immediately. With respect to timing, for cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm, it is reasonable to administer epinephrine as soon as feasible.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO</strong>—repeat every 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Administer drugs during CPR. Do not stop CPR to administer drugs. Prioritize establishing IV/IO access over managing an advanced airway unless bag-mask ventilation is ineffective or hypoxia caused the arrest. All high-performance team members must search for an underlying and treatable cause of the PEA while they perform their assigned roles.</p>
                        <h4>Identifying and Correcting Underlying Causes</h4>
                        <p>Treating asystole/PEA goes beyond the interventions in the algorithm. You must search for and treat reversible causes for resuscitative efforts to be potentially successful. Use the H's and T's to recall conditions that could have contributed to the arrest.</p>

                             <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span>Common Reversible Causes</h4>
                             <p>Remember that hypovolemia and hypoxia are the 2 most common underlying, potentially reversible causes of asystole/PEA.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Terminating Resuscitative Efforts</h3>
                        <p>If healthcare providers cannot rapidly identify an underlying cause and the patient does not respond to the BLS and ACLS interventions, consider terminating all resuscitative efforts. The decision to terminate rests with the treating physician and is based on many factors, including time to CPR, comorbid disease, initial arrest rhythm, response to interventions, and ETCO<sub>2</sub> less than 10 after 20 minutes of high-quality CPR.</p>
