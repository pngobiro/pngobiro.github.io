                        <p>An area in the health facility is normally designated as Accident and Emergency Department/Unit (A&E) or Casualty department. The A&E department/unit operates a 24-hour service and provides initial treatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries, which may be life threatening and require immediate attention. Financial considerations are not normally a barrier to the initial treatment of the patient. The A&E shall serves as a specialised care department, equipped and staffed to provide rapid and varied emergency care to all people with life-threatening conditions. The A&E provides initial appropriate care and arranges subsequent care either within the health facility or to another health facility.</p>
                        <p>The A&E uses a triage system of screening and classifying clients to determine their priority needs and to ration patient care efficiently. The A&E plays a key role in times of critical interventions of all kinds.</p>

                        <p>The triage team should assess all patients presenting to the A&E. A triaged patient should be attended to by a doctor as per clinical care guidelines. Clinical decision regarding patient disposition (transfer or discharge) is normally made be by the attending doctor.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Definition of Triaging</h3>
                        <p>Triaging is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition. This rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately. Several models of triaging are applied by different emergency medical services. The models generally classify casualties in three clusters:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Those who are likely to live, regardless of what care they receive;</li>
                            <li>Those who are likely to die, regardless of what care they receive;</li>
                            <li>Those for whom immediate care might make a positive difference in outcome.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>S.T.A.R.T. model of Triaging</h3>
                        <p>S.T.A.R.T. (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) is a simple triage system that can be performed by lightly trained lay and emergency personnel in emergencies. It is not intended to supersede or instruct medical personnel or techniques. It was developed at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, California for use by emergency services. It has been field-proven in mass casualty incidents such as train wrecks and bus accidents, though it was developed for use by community emergency response teams (CERTs) and firefighters after earthquakes.</p>

                        <p>Triage separates the injured into four groups:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The expectant who are beyond help</li>
                            <li>The injured who can be helped by immediate transportation</li>
                            <li>The injured whose transport can be delayed</li>
                            <li>Those with minor injuries, who need help less urgently</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Triage also sets priorities for evacuation and transport as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Deceased</strong> are left where they fell. These people are not breathing and an effort to reposition their airway has been unsuccessful.</li>
                            <li><strong>Immediate or Priority 1 (red)</strong> evacuation by MEDEVAC if available or ambulance as they need advanced medical care at once or within 1 hour. These people are in critical condition and would die without immediate assistance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Delayed or Priority 2 (yellow)</strong> can have their medical evacuation delayed until all immediate persons have been transported. These people are in stable condition but require medical assistance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Minor or Priority 3 (green)</strong> are not evacuated until all immediate and delayed persons have been evacuated. These will not need advanced medical care for at least several hours. Continue to re-triage in case their condition worsens. These people are able to walk, and may only require bandages and antiseptic.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Hospital systems</h3>
                        <p>Within the hospital system, the first stage on arrival at the emergency room is assessment by the hospital triage nurse. This nurse will evaluate the patient's condition, as well as any changes, and will determine their priority for admission to the Emergency Room and also for delayed treatment. Conventionally there are five classifications with corresponding colors and numbers although this may vary by region.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Black / Expectant:</strong> They are so severely injured that they will die of their injuries, possibly in hours or days (large-area burns, severe trauma, lethal radiation dose), or in life-threatening medical crisis that they are unlikely to survive given the care available (cardiac arrest, septic shock, severe head or chest wounds); their treatment is usually palliative, such as being given painkillers, to reduce suffering.</li>
                            <li><strong>Red / Immediate:</strong> They require immediate surgery or other life-saving intervention, and have first priority for surgical teams or transport to advanced facilities; they "cannot wait" but are likely to survive with immediate treatment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Yellow / Observation:</strong> Their condition is stable for the moment but requires watching by trained persons and frequent re-triage, will need hospital care (and would receive immediate priority care under "normal" circumstances).</li>
                            <li><strong>Green / Wait (walking wounded):</strong> They will require a doctor's care in several hours or days but not immediately, may wait for a number of hours or be told to go home and come back the next day (broken bones without compound fractures, many soft tissue injuries).</li>
                            <li><strong>White / Dismiss (walking wounded):</strong> They have minor injuries; first aid and home care are sufficient, a doctor's care is not required. Injuries are along the lines of cuts and scrapes, or minor burns.</li>
                        </ul>
