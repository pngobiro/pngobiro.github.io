                        <p>When lifting casualties, maximum care must be taken to avoid worsening an unstable trauma. The head-neck-chest axis must be kept straight to protect the spine, and the first aiders must keep the patient's body stable (no movement of the feet) during the lift. The first aiders have to carry a heavy load (probably more than 20 kg for an adult casualty) in an uncomfortable position. There is thus a risk of injury to the carrier, especially of the lumbar back. To avoid an injury, they must push with their legs (quadriceps), trying to keep their back straight.</p>

                        <h3>Scoop stretcher</h3>
                        <p>The use of a scoop stretcher allows a secure lifting with only two team members even in case of a spinal trauma. The use of this device is thus recommended for most operations.</p>
                        <p>However, in many situations, there is a lack not of people but of devices. Additionally, the scoop stretcher does not allow the emergency service provider to maintain the legs up or a half-seated position for the casualty. For these reasons, the other methods are applied.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>The most secured way to put a casualty on a stretcher is to use a vertical lift with five first aiders. The casualty is lifted by four first aiders while the fifth person holds the stretcher.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The first person (team leader) has one knee down, one knee up, and holds the head; he/she can hold it by sliding the finger under the head, the palm placed on each side of the head; or he/she can place one hand under the neck and hold the occiput, the other hand under the chin;</li>
                            <li>The second team member supports himself on the shoulder of another team member, and steps over the casualty; he/she puts his/her hands under the shoulders;</li>
                            <li>The third team member supports himself on the shoulder of another team member, and steps over the casualty; he/she puts his/her hands under the hip;</li>
                            <li>The fourth team member hold the ankles;</li>
                            <li>The fifth team member pushes the stretcher.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The feet of the team members must be enough spaced so the stretcher can slide in between. If the team leader uses the occipital-chin grip, the knee that is up is the knee on the side of the hand under the neck: as this arm supports the heaviest weight, it can support itself on the knee.</p>
                        <p>Another method consists in placing the team members at both sides of the casualty and holding the cloths. The cloths must be strong enough.</p>
                        <p>On the order of the team leader, the casualty is lifted, the stretcher is pushed, and the casualty is put down on the stretcher. During this procedure, the team leader remains kneeling (stable); the other team members lift pushing with their legs (arms stretched out, back kept straight). Then, the first and second team members pull back, supporting themselves on the shoulder of a still standing member.</p>
                        <p>With this method, the movement of the casualty is minimal, just vertical. When there is no room at the feet of the casualty for the stretcher, it must then be placed on the side of the head. The team leader must then kneel aside. If he uses the occipital-chin grip, the hand under the neck must be the closest to the casualty's feet; the same knee is up.</p>

                        <h4>With four team members</h4>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_21_69012fc8936999e815cag-13-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating a four-person vertical lift technique.">
                            <figcaption>Vertical lifting with four team members or "simple lifting".</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>With only four team members, it is necessary to use a "simple" lift: the team leader plays the role of the first team member: he steps over the casualty and places one hand under the neck, the other hand under the back, between the shoulder blades. The stretcher can come from the feet or from the head. This method is not adapted in case of suspicion of a spine trauma.</p>

                        <h4>With two team members</h4>
                        <p>When the casualty has no specific trauma, it is possible to slide a long spine board little by little. A team member lifts a part of the body (head, then shoulders, then hips), and the other one slide the board.</p>

                        <h4>Seated person</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes, it is necessary to lift a seated or half seated person: the seating position is adapted for a conscious person with a chest trauma or of respiratory difficulties.</p>
                        <p>For this, two team members are placed on each side of the casualty; they place one hand under the buttock, the other under the opposite armpit; the casualty places his/her arms around the neck of the team members. A third team member lifts the legs as usual, and a fourth pushes the stretcher. When a heart problem is suspected, the casualty should not lift his/hers arms.</p>
