                        <p><strong>For minor wounds:</strong> If the bite barely breaks the skin and there's no danger of massive bleeding, treat it as a minor wound. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply an antibiotic cream to prevent infection and cover the bite with a clean bandage.</p>
                        <p><strong>For deep wounds:</strong> If the animal bite creates a deep puncture of the skin or the skin is badly torn and bleeding, apply pressure with a clean, dry cloth to stop the bleeding. Continue with wound management and tetanus and rabies vaccination in the hospital.</p>

                        <p>Nosebleeds are common. Most often they are a nuisance and not a true medical problem. But they can be both.</p>
                        <p>The victim should sit upright and lean forward. By remaining upright, you reduce blood pressure in the veins of the nose. This discourages further bleeding. Sitting forward helps avoid swallowing blood, which can irritate the stomach.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pinch the nose.</strong> Instruct the patient to use their thumb and index finger to pinch their nostrils shut. Let them breathe through the mouth. Continue to pinch for five to 10 minutes. Pinching sends pressure to the bleeding point on the nasal septum and often stops the flow of blood.</p>
                        <p>To prevent re-bleeding, don't pick or blow your nose and don't bend down for several hours after the bleeding episode. During this time remember to keep your head higher than the level of your heart.</p>
                        <p>If re-bleeding occurs, blow out forcefully to clear your nose of blood clots. Pinch the nose again as described above and seek medical attention.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Poisoning is injury or death due to swallowing, inhaling, touching or injecting various drugs, chemicals, venoms or gases. Many substances - such as drugs and carbon monoxide - are poisonous only in higher concentrations or dosages. And others - such as cleaners - are dangerous only if ingested. Children are particularly sensitive to even small amounts of certain drugs and chemicals.</p>
                        <p>How you treat someone who may have been poisoned depends on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The person's symptoms</li>
                            <li>The person's age</li>
                            <li>Whether you know the type and amount of the substance that caused poisoning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>When to suspect poisoning</h3>
                        <p>Poisoning signs and symptoms can mimic other conditions, such as seizure, alcohol intoxication, stroke and insulin reaction. Signs and symptoms of poisoning may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Burns or redness around the mouth and lips</li>
                            <li>Breath that smells like chemicals, such as gasoline or paint thinner</li>
                            <li>Vomiting</li>
                            <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
                            <li>Drowsiness</li>
                            <li>Confusion or other altered mental status</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you suspect poisoning, be alert for clues such as empty pill bottles or packages, scattered pills, and burns, stains and odors on the person or nearby objects.</p>
                        <p>Call your local emergency number immediately if the person is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drowsy or unconscious</li>
                            <li>Having difficulty breathing or has stopped breathing</li>
                            <li>Uncontrollably restless or agitated</li>
                            <li>Having seizures</li>
                            <li>Known to have taken medications, or any other substance, intentionally or accidentally overdosed (in these situations the poisoning typically involves larger amounts, often along with alcohol).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Intervention</h3>
                        <p>Take the following actions when you suspect poisoning:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Swallowed poison.</strong> Remove anything remaining in the person's mouth. If the suspected poison is a household cleaner or other chemical, read the container's label and follow instructions for accidental poisoning.</li>
                            <li><strong>Poison on the skin.</strong> Remove any contaminated clothing using gloves. Rinse the skin for 15 to 20 minutes in a shower or with a hose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Poison in the eye.</strong> Gently flush the eye with cool or lukewarm water for 20 minutes or until help arrives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inhaled poison.</strong> Get the person into fresh air as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medicated patches.</strong> If you think a child got hold of medicated patches (adhesive products for transdermal drug delivery), carefully inspect the child's skin and remove any that are attached. Also check the roof of the mouth, where they can get stuck if the child sucks on them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the person vomits, turn his or her head to the side to prevent choking.</p>
                        <p>Begin CPR if the person shows no signs of life, such as moving, breathing or coughing.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>Note</h4>
                            <p>It is important to gather pill bottles, packages or containers with labels, and any other information about the poison to send along with the ambulance team. Do not induce vomiting.</p>

                        <h3>Intervention</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Follow DRABC.</li>
                            <li>Control any bleeding and cover any wounds.</li>
                            <li>Check for fractures: open, closed or complicated.</li>
                            <li>Ask the patient to remain as still as possible.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Immobilize the fracture:</strong> use broad bandages (where possible) to prevent movement at joints above and below the fracture. Support the limb, carefully passing bandages under the natural hollows of the body. Place a padded splint along the injured limb. Place padding between the splint and the natural contours of the body and secure firmly.</p>
                        <p>For leg fracture, immobilise foot and ankle apply figure of eight bandaging.</p>
                        <ol start="5">
                            <li>Check that bandages are not too tight (or too loose) every 15 minutes and watch for signs of loss of circulation to hands or feet.</li>
                            <li>Ensure an ambulance has been called.</li>
                        </ol>
