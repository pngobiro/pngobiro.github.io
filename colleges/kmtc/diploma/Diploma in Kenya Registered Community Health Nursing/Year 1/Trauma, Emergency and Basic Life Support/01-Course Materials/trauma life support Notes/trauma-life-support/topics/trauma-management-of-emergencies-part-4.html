                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>Near drowning occurs when a person becomes submerged in a liquid, usually water, making breathing difficult and causing near death. In some cases, the individual survives initially, only to die of related causes more than 24 hours later.</p>
                        <h3>What are the causes and risks of the injury?</h3>
                        <p>Near drowning is caused by lack of oxygen, whether or not water has entered the lungs. A deep pool of water is not the only drowning hazard. Someone can drown in a very small amount of water if the mouth and nose are covered, preventing the person from breathing. Individuals at greatest risk for near drowning are those who are very young, very old, unable to swim, or those who tire easily. Many drowning or near-drowning cases are the result of recreational activities, such as boating or swimming. It is more common in areas where swimming pools are common. Unsupervised toddlers, in particular, are prone to near drowning. Other risk factors include swimming after drinking alcohol.</p>
                        <h3>Recognition of victim</h3>
                        <p>A drowning victim will usually be spotted panicking at the surface of a body of water. Sometimes the person is found lying in the water or liquid, or on the shore near a large body of water.</p>
                        <h3>Intervention</h3>
                        <p>First aid for near drowning includes the following steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get the drowning person out of the water without placing yourself in danger. Tie a rope to a buoy, life preserver, or other flotation device and throw it to the person. Use the rope to pull them out of the water.</li>
                            <li>In deep water, try to use a boat or other object to reach the victim. Many people who are drowning will panic and pull the rescuer under water.</li>
                            <li>Assess the airway, breathing and circulation.</li>
                            <li>Immediately contact the emergency medical system.</li>
                            <li>Start cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, if the person stops breathing. Use 30 chest compressions for every 2 rescue breaths.</li>
                            <li>Stay with the victim and continue CPR until emergency help arrives, or until the person begins to breathe independently.</li>
                            <li>If CPR is not needed, change any wet clothing, warm the person, and give first aid for any injuries.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"> </span>Note</h4>
                            <p>The person may vomit and choke on his or her vomit during CPR and rescue breathing. If the victim does start to vomit, turn the person on his or her side so that the vomit will not block the throat or airway.</p>

                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <p>Unless very easy to deal with, don't interfere. Dress the wound, immobilise the part with splints and get medical aid.</p>

                        <h3>Foreign Body in the Eye</h3>
                        <p>Wings of insects, dust, coal, metal particles, wood particles and loose eyelashes are common objects that get lodged in the eye. They cause pain and later redness if they are not removed soon. Sometimes splinters that get lodged in the cornea may cause severe trouble and penetrating foreign bodies are a danger to the eye itself.</p>
                        <h4>Management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid rubbing the eye. In the case of a child, tie his hands together at the back.</li>
                            <li>Seat the patient so that light falls on the eye. Pull the lower lid down. If the foreign body is floating and not embedded remove it with a narrow moist swab. The corner of a handkerchief twisted to a fine point will also do.</li>
                            <li>If the foreign body is not visible, it may be under the upper eyelid. Ask the patient to keep clean water in the hand and blink briskly into the water.</li>
                            <li>If the foreign body is embedded in the eye, particularly in the cornea (the black of the eye), don't touch it. Apply a soft pad, ask the patient not to rub his eye and take him quickly to the hospital.</li>
                            <li>Penetrating foreign bodies are easily made out by bleeding, pain etc. These are for doctors to handle. Just put a pad on the eye and rush to the hospital.</li>
                            <li>When injury with corrosive acid, alkali or juices from plants are suspected, blinking eyelids under water a number of times or flushing with a large quantity of water is the best thing to do. Then apply a soft pad and take the patient to the hospital at once.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Foreign Body in the Ear</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the foreign body is an insect, fill the ear with glycerine or coconut or mustard oil or warm salt water. The insect will float up and can be removed easily.</li>
                            <li>If there is nothing floating up, leave it alone, don't meddle at all but get the patient to a doctor as soon as possible.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You can use a bandage to hold a dressing in place, to control bleeding, to support a limb and stop it moving, and to raise an injured limb to reduce swelling.</p>
                        <p>There are two main types of bandage:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Roller bandages:</strong> use these to hold dressings in place and to support injured limbs, particularly for ankles, knees, wrists or elbows.</li>
                            <li><strong>Triangular bandages:</strong> use these as large dressings, as slings to support a wrist, arm or shoulder injury, or folded as a broad-fold bandage to stop a limb from moving.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If you can't find a bandage, then you can always improvise by using a piece of clothing or material. For example, you could fold a headscarf diagonally in half to make a triangular bandage for a sling.</p>
                        
                        <h3>How to put on a bandage:</h3>
                        <p>If someone's hurt themselves and you need to apply a bandage, below are the key things to remember.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reassure them and explain what you're going to do before you start.</li>
                            <li>Make them comfortable by helping them sit or lie down in a comfortable position.</li>
                            <li>Support the injury by holding the limb carefully, or ask them or someone else to help.</li>
                            <li>Start bandaging from the front and from the side of the body or limb that's injured.</li>
                            <li>Apply bandages firmly but not so tightly that it restricts their circulation.</li>
                            <li>Generally, wrap the bandage using spiral turns working from the inside to the outside of the limb</li>
                            <li>For joint injuries, make diagonal turns in a figure-of-eight above and below the joint. See below for specific techniques.</li>
                            <li>To immobilise a limb, make a broad-fold bandage: lay a triangular bandage flat on a clean surface, fold it in half horizontally so the point touches the base, and then fold it in half again.</li>
                            <li>Leave fingers and toes peeking out, if possible, so you can press them to check circulation afterwards.</li>
                            <li>Use pins or tape to fasten roller bandages, otherwise, tuck the bandage in as securely as you can.</li>
                            <li>Use reef knots to tie triangular bandages: right over left and under, then left over right and under.</li>
                            <li>Check their circulation: Once you've finished, check for circulation, by pressing one of their finger or toe nails for five seconds until it goes pale. If the colour doesn't come back within two seconds, the bandage is too tight so you'll need to loosen it and do it again. Check their circulation every ten minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Specific bandage techniques for joints:</h3>
                        <p>The most common types of injury are in the joints, which can seem a bit tricky but are easy if you know how, so make sure you know these three main techniques:</p>
                        <h4>How to bandage a hand</h4>
                        <p>You can bandage a hand to hold a dressing in place, or to support a sprained or strained wrist. If the bandage is to provide support, you need to wrap it either side of the injury too, to give enough support for the whole area.</p>
                        <h5>What you need to do</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To bandage someone's hand, use a roller bandage.</li>
                            <li>Start by putting the end (tail) of the bandage on the inside of their wrist, below the bottom of their thumb, and wrap the bandage straight around their wrist, twice.</li>
                            <li>Then, wrap the bandage from the inside of their wrist, diagonally across the back of their hand up to the nail of their little finger, straight across underneath their fingers, and diagonally back across the back of their hand to the outside of their wrist.</li>
                            <li>Pass the bandage under their wrist and repeat the diagonal over the back of the hand, across the fingers and back again, so the tips of their fingers are still peeking out.</li>
                            <li>Keep going in the same way, bandaging diagonally across the hand like a figure-of-eight, but each time, only cover about two thirds of the previous layer, so that with each new layer you're covering a third of new skin. Make sure you leave the tips of their fingers peeking out though.</li>
                            <li>Once you've covered the whole hand, wrap the bandage straight around the wrist a couple of times, and then fasten the end using a safety pin or sticky tape or by tucking it in.</li>
                            <li>As soon as you've finished, check their fingers for circulation, by pressing a finger nail for five seconds until it goes pale. If the colour doesn't come back within two seconds, the bandage is too tight so you'll need to loosen it and do it again. Their hand could keep swelling after you've bandaged it, so keep checking their circulation every ten minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>How to bandage a sprain</h4>
                        <p>If someone's sprained a joint, like an ankle, knee or elbow, you can use a bandage to support the limb. To make sure you give the right kind of support, bend the joint slightly and then wrap the bandage in a figure-of-eight. You need to wrap it either side of the injury too, to give enough support for the whole area. (For this example we're going to describe how to wrap an ankle, but you can use the same method to bandage an elbow or knee).</p>
                        <h5>What you need to do</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To bandage someone's ankle, use a roller bandage.</li>
                            <li>First, you need to hold the ankle in a comfortable position, with the joint slightly bent.</li>
                            <li>Start by putting the end (tail) of the bandage on the inside of their ankle. Pass the bandage over and around to the outside of the ankle, and go round one and-a-half times, so that the tail end of the bandage is firmly covered and won't come loose.</li>
                            <li>Then make a figure-of-eight around the joint, wrapping the bandage diagonally above and then below the joint.</li>
                            <li>Keep going with the figure-of-eight, but each time, only cover about two thirds of the previous layer, so that with each new layer you're covering a third of new skin.</li>
                            <li>Once you've done this several times, wrap the bandage straight around the ankle a couple of times, and then fasten the end using a safety pin, sticky tape or by tucking it in.</li>
                            <li>As soon as you've finished, check their toes for circulation, by pressing their big toe nail for five seconds until it goes pale. If the colour doesn't come back within two seconds after you stop pressing, the bandage is too tight so you'll need to loosen it and do it again. Their ankle could keep swelling after you've bandaged it, so keep checking their circulation every ten minutes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>How to make an arm sling</h4>
                        <p>An arm sling stops someone's arm moving (immobilisation) and protects it so it can heal. It's also a useful warning to others that someone has an injury so they should be careful around them. There are two types of arm sling - an arm sling and an elevation sling. You can make both using a triangular bandage.</p>
                        <h5>Arm sling</h5>
                        <p>An arm sling holds someone's forearm in a horizontal or slightly raised position. This gives support for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>an injured upper arm</li>
                            <li>an injured wrist or forearm</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hundreds of thousands of fires, both big and small, break out in workplaces around the country every year. Many of these fires are controllable and only a very small percentage result in fatalities. There is therefore need for staff to have skills on fire extinguishing practices.</p>
                        <p>To understand how best to extinguish a fire, there must first be an appreciation of the three elements that make up the 'fire triangle': heat, fuel and oxygen. As fire is primarily a chemical reaction, removing one or more of these three factors will prevent the combustion from taking place.</p>
                        <h3>The Fire Triangle</h3>
                        <p>A simple model for understanding the chemical reaction involved in a fire, once your staff understand how a fire starts, it is much easier for them to understand how to react.</p>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_21_69012fc8936999e815cag-40-1.jpg" alt="A diagram of the fire triangle, showing the three elements: Heat, Fuel, and Oxygen.">
                        </figure>
                        <p>A fire needs three elements to ignite:</p>
                        <figure>
                           <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_21_69012fc8936999e815cag-40-2.jpg" alt="Text listing the three elements of fire: Heat, Fuel, Oxygen.">
                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Heat</strong> is required to ignite a fire, and will continue to be generated as the fire burns. For intentional fires, this could be as simple as the striking of a match. For accidental fires however, ignition can occur as a result of obstructing ventilation on machinery that heats up, or flammable materials being too close to heaters.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fuel</strong> can be anything that is combustible, such as wood, petroleum and spirits, and a number of gases. Solid fuels must reach a critical temperature in order to ignite, while many liquids release flammable vapours even when cold. Gases are the most hazardous and temperamental state, and can combust instantaneously.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>air</strong> feeding a fire only needs to be made up of 16% Oxygen in order to react with the heat and fuel. Generally, at low/normal altitude, the level is over 20%.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Effective Fire Extinction</h3>
                        <p>If the three parts of the 'fire triangle' are kept in mind, extinguishing a small blaze should be a matter of common sense. The principles of fire extinction state that a fire will be put out if one of the three elements are removed, and this can be done using three different approaches, as detailed below...</p>
                        <h4>Cooling</h4>
                        <p>Removing the heat is one of the most effective methods of fire extinction available, which is why water is a popular extinguishing material. The fire will go out so long as the heat generated by the fire is less than that which is absorbed by the water.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning">
                            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> water is not an appropriate extinguishing material to use on electrical fires, as well as those caused by cooking oils/fats or other flammable liquids.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Starving</h4>
                        <p>While cooling removes the heat/ignition element of the 'fire triangle', starving the blaze of its fuel source approaches extinction from a different angle. A raging fire will burn itself out if it runs out of flammable materials, such as a bonfire out in the open that isn't in contact with any other wood or dry grass. Similarly, a gas fire will immediately extinguish if the gas supply is cut off - you only have to look at a gas stove or Bunsen burner to see that.</p>
                        <h4>Smothering</h4>
                        <p>As the other key component present in the chemical reaction that causes combustion, removing oxygen from the equation is the final way of extinguishing a fire. For example, smothering a frying pan blaze with a fire blanket reduces the oxygen to below the 16% required to react, while covering a candle with a glass will snuff it out in a vacuum.</p>
                        <p>Smothering is a technique that is mostly applicable to solid fuel fires, although some materials may contain enough oxygen within their own chemical make up to keep the blaze burning.</p>
