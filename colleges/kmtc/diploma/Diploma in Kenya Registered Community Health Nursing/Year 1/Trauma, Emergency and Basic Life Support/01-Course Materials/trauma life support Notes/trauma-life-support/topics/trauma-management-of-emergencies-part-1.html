                            <li>Re-assess heart rate after first five breaths</li>
                            <li>Increasing heart rate or maintained at over 100 beats per minute is a sign of successful oxygenation</li>
                            <li>Continue giving breaths at 30-40 breaths per minute</li>

                        <h3>What is Shock?</h3>
                        <p>The presence of shock means that there is: An inadequate perfusion of organs and cells with oxygenated blood. Some form of cardiovascular compromise. Shock is a life threatening condition that requires immediate, intensive treatment.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Causes of Shock</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bleeding (Hypovolaemic shock)</li>
                            <li>Sepsis (Septic shock)</li>
                            <li>Heart failure due to anaemia can also be a cause of shock.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Signs of shock</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Brain:</strong> anxious, restless, confused, drowsy or unconscious</li>
                            <li><strong>Skin:</strong> sweaty, cold and clammy OR warm</li>
                            <li><strong>Conjunctivae:</strong> pale</li>
                            <li><strong>Breathing:</strong> rapid</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulse:</strong> weak, >100/minute (sometimes "bounding pulse")</li>
                            <li><strong>BP:</strong> low, < 90 mmHg (late sign)</li>
                            <li><strong>Kidney:</strong> poor urine output</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Septic shock</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tachycardia</li>
                            <li>Tachypnoea</li>
                            <li>Hypotension</li>
                            <li>Temperature changes: Pyrexia (early) or Hypothermia (late)</li>
                            <li>Poor response to simple fluid resuscitation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Shock - immediate action</h3>

                        <h3>Minor burns</h3>
                        <p>For minor burns:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cool the burn to help soothe the pain. Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain eases. Or apply a clean towel dampened with cool tap water.</li>
                            <li>Remove rings or other tight items from the burned area. Try to do this quickly and gently, before the area swells.</li>
                            <li>Don't break small blisters (no bigger than your little fingernail). If blisters break, gently clean the area with mild soap and water, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover it with a nonstick gauze bandage like paraffin gauze.</li>
                            <li>Administer pain reliever/analgesic such as ibuprofen, paracetamol or diclofenac.</li>
                            <li>Consider a tetanus toxoid shot. Make sure that your tetanus booster is up to date.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Major burns</h3>
                        <p>Call emergency medical help for major burns. Until an emergency unit arrives, take these actions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Protect the burned person from further harm. If you can do so safely, make sure the person you're helping is not in contact with smoldering materials or exposed to smoke or heat. But don't remove burned clothing stuck to the skin.</li>
                            <li>Check for signs of circulation. Look for breathing, coughing or movement. Begin CPR if needed.</li>
                            <li>Remove jewelry, belts and other restrictive items, especially from around burned areas and the neck. Burned areas swell rapidly.</li>
                            <li>Don't immerse large severe burns in cold water. Doing so could cause a serious loss of body heat (hypothermia) or a drop in blood pressure and decreased blood flow (shock).</li>
                            <li>Elevate the burned area. Raise the wound above heart level, if possible.</li>
                            <li>Cover the area of the burn. Use a cool, moist, bandage or a clean cloth.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Is it a minor burn or a major burn?</h3>
                        <p>If it's not clear what level of care is needed, try to judge the extent of tissue damage, based on the following burn categories:</p>
                        <h4>1st-degree burn</h4>
                        <p>A first-degree burn is the least serious type, involving only the outer layer of skin. It may cause:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Redness</li>
                            <li>Swelling</li>
                            <li>Pain</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can usually treat a first-degree burn as a minor burn. If it involves much of the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks or a major joint, seek emergency medical attention.</p>
                        
                        <h4>2nd-degree burn</h4>
                        <p>A second-degree burn is more serious. It may cause:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Red or white skin</li>
                            <li>Swelling</li>
                            <li>Pain</li>
                            <li>Blisters</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the second-degree burn is no larger than 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) in diameter, treat it as a minor burn. If the burned area is larger or covers the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks or a major joint, treat it as a major burn and get medical help immediately.</p>
                        
                        <h4>3rd-degree burns</h4>
                        <p>The most serious burns involve all layers of the skin and underlying fat. Muscle and even bone may be affected. Burned areas may be charred black or white. The person may experience:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
                            <li>Carbon monoxide poisoning</li>
                            <li>Other toxic effects, if smoke inhalation also occurred</li>
                        </ul>

                        <span class="heading-text">CHOKING</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Choking occurs when a foreign object becomes lodged in the throat or windpipe, blocking the flow of air. In adults, a piece of food often is the culprit. Young children often swallow small objects. Because choking cuts off oxygen to the brain, administer first aid as quickly as possible. The universal sign for choking is hands clutched to the throat. If the person doesn't give the signal, look for these indications:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Inability to talk</li>
                            <li>Difficulty breathing or noisy breathing</li>
                            <li>Inability to cough forcefully</li>
                            <li>Skin, lips and nails turning blue or dusky</li>
                            <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If choking is occurring, a "five-and-five" approach to delivering first aid is recommended:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Give 5 back blows.</strong> First, deliver five back blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Give 5 abdominal thrusts.</strong> Perform five abdominal thrusts (also known as the Heimlich maneuver).</li>
                            <li>Alternate between 5 blows and 5 thrusts until the blockage is dislodged.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>To perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) on someone else:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stand behind the person. Wrap your arms around the waist. Tip the person forward slightly.</li>
                            <li>Make a fist with one hand. Position it slightly above the person's navel.</li>
                            <li>Grasp the fist with the other hand. Press hard into the abdomen with a quick, upward thrust - as if trying to lift the person up.</li>
                            <li>Perform a total of 5 abdominal thrusts, if needed. If the blockage still isn't dislodged, repeat the five-and-five cycle.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you're the only rescuer, perform back blows and abdominal thrusts before calling your local emergency number for help. If another person is available, have that person call for help while you perform first aid. If the person becomes unconscious, perform standard CPR with chest compressions and rescue breaths.</p>

                        <h3>To perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) on yourself:</h3>
                        <p>First, if you're alone and choking you'll be unable to effectively deliver back blows to yourself, but you can still perform abdominal thrusts to dislodge the item.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Place a fist slightly above your navel.</li>
                            <li>Grasp your fist with the other hand and bend over a hard surface - a countertop or chair will do.</li>
                            <li>Shove your fist inward and upward.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>To clear the airway of a pregnant woman or obese person:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Position your hands a little bit higher than with a normal Heimlich maneuver, at the base of the breastbone, just above the joining of the lowest ribs.</li>
                            <li>Proceed as with the Heimlich maneuver, pressing hard into the chest, with a quick thrust.</li>
                            <li>Repeat until the food or other blockage is dislodged or the person becomes unconscious.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>To clear the airway of an unconscious person:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lower the person on his or her back onto the floor.</li>
                            <li>Clear the airway. If a blockage is visible at the back of the throat or high in the throat, reach a finger into the mouth and sweep out the cause of the blockage. Be careful not to push the food or object deeper into the airway, which can happen easily in young children.</li>
                            <li>Begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if the object remains lodged and the person doesn't respond after you take the above measures. The chest compressions used in CPR may dislodge the object. Remember to recheck the mouth periodically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>To clear the airway of a choking infant younger than age 1:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assume a seated position and hold the infant facedown on your forearm, which is resting on your thigh.</li>
                            <li>Thump the infant gently but firmly five times on the middle of the back using the heel of your hand. The combination of gravity and the back blows should release the blocking object.</li>
                            <li>Hold the infant faceup on your forearm with the head lower than the trunk if the above doesn't work. Using two fingers placed at the center of the infant's breastbone, give five quick chest compressions.</li>
                            <li>Repeat the back blows and chest thrusts if breathing doesn't resume. Call for emergency medical help.</li>
                            <li>Begin infant CPR if one of these techniques opens the airway but the infant doesn't resume breathing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the child is older than age 1, give abdominal thrusts only.</p>
