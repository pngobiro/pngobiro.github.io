                        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> First aid is the Emergency care or treatment given to an ill or injured person before regular medical aid can be obtained (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). It is the assistance given to any person suffering a sudden illness or injury, with care provided to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, and/or promote recovery. It includes initial intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being available, such as performing Resuscitation (CPR) while awaiting an ambulance, as well as the complete treatment of minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a fracture. First aid is generally performed by either laypersons or health care workers, with many lay people trained in providing basic levels of first aid, and others willing to do so from acquired knowledge.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Objectives:</h3>
                        <p>The following are the three objectives of first aid:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>To save somebody's life or preserve life</li>
                            <li>To avoid more injury or prevent the condition from worsening</li>
                            <li>To support healing or promote recovery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The basic or elementary goal of providing first aid is to save life. You cannot always depend on a qualified health care provider to be present to save somebody's life. It is not possible for qualified health care provider to be around wherever anyone gets injured or in case of accidents. Therefore, someone who knows first aid can save your life. The basic requirement to stay alive is to breathe free. When somebody falls unconscious, or gets choked, it gets difficult for them to breathe free. In case of choking, the first aider will use techniques that include putting pressure on the abdomen or slapping the back to remove the cause of choking and clearing the passage for the air to move in and out freely. If the victim is unable to breathe even after the air passage has been cleared, the first aider might perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR. In this the first aider gives mouth-to-mouth breathing to the victim and massages his or her chest simultaneously in order to aid normal flow of blood throughout the body.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, first aid aims to avoid more injury and to stop a wound from getting worse. When you perform first aid on somebody, you are helping him out of some danger. It might be as simple as moving the victim away from where he or she got hurt. For instance, by covering a burning victim with a blanket in case of fire, it is providing first aid to the victim. Similarly, covering a wound with a cloth to control bleeding is also another form of first aid.</p>
                        <p>Last but not least is to provide help in healing. In some cases, first aid might be the treatment to an injury like putting a bandage to a small scratch, whereas, in some cases, it could be the first step to healing. People trained in first aid know how to manage any kind of situation from a small cut to a fracture, till the arrival of the medical team.</p>

                        <p>Common sense is an important part of providing first aid care. First aid, properly given can reduce the effects of injuries and medical emergencies. It can keep seriously ill or injured person alive and can make the difference between a short and long hospital stay. Therefore, proper first aid must be given quickly and effectively or the victim's condition may worsen with time. In the excitement of an emergency, it is important to stop for a moment to clear your mind and think before you act. When responding to any emergency situation, remain calm and apply the four emergency action principles.</p>

                            <li>Conduct a secondary survey of the victim when appropriate.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In responding to an emergency situation, make a quick survey of the entire scene, look at the area around the victim, this should take only few seconds, then decide what to do next. Consider the following as you do your survey and don't forget the principle of DR.</p>

                        <h3>Is the scene safe?</h3>
                        <p>You must remember that you cannot help a victim by becoming a victim yourself. You should know your abilities. However, if you cannot get a victim because of extreme hazards, such as fire, toxic fumes, heavy traffic, electrical wires or deep swift moving water call EMS or other services needed to handle the specific life-threatening hazard.</p>
                        <p>However, if you safely get to victim, decide if it is save to remain at the scene while you continue the steps of emergency action principle and care for the victim. If it is not safe, you may need to make an immediate emergency rescue.</p>

                        <h3>What happened?</h3>
                        <p>If the victim is conscious, ask questions to what happened that caused the victim's illness or injury. If victim is unconscious, ask bystanders or look for clues, the scene itself often gives the answer.</p>

                        <h3>How many people are injured?</h3>
                        <p>You should look beyond the victim you see at first glance. There may be other victims.</p>

                        <h3>Are there bystanders who can help?</h3>
                        <p>If there are bystanders, use them to help you find out what happened. Although bystanders may not be trained in first aid, but they can help you in other important ways such as calling medical attention, by offering emotional support to the victim(s), their friends and their families and by keeping onlookers from crowding around the victim.</p>

                        <p><strong>D - Danger</strong> - Always presume that there is some danger so check for and deal with any danger to yourself, the victim and bystanders e.g. traffic, electricity, infection from body fluid etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>R - Response</strong> - Check for response by talking and asking the questions and shaking victim's shoulders gently.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Identify Yourself as First Aid Provider.</h3>
                        <p>Tell the victim and bystanders who you are and that you are trained in first aid, and this may help to reassure the victim, and also, it will help you to take charge of the situation. Quickly take in as much information as possible, and take into the consideration the principle of DRABCD.</p>
                        <p><strong>S - Shout</strong> - The first aider must shout for help when there is no response and he is alone with the victim.</p>
