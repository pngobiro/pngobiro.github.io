                        <h3>Trauma Team Activation Criteria</h3>
                        <p>The Trauma team comprises a group of emergency department doctors/clinical officers and nurses, surgeons, anaesthetists and theatre staff, radiographers and other support personnel, who work together as a team to assess and manage the trauma patient. Their actions are coordinated by a team leader who should not touch the patient. The aim of the trauma team is to provide a safe and efficient evaluation of the patient. Identify all injuries and instigate the definitive management of such injuries. Most trauma teams will have about 30 minutes to accomplish this and should work towards achieving this goal.</p>
                        <p>The Trauma Team should be activated immediately a patient who meets ANY of the criteria below arrives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Systolic BP &lt;90 mmHg</li>

                        <p>On returning home it is important that, if possible, you are accompanied by a responsible adult. While unlikely, there is a small risk of developing complications, so if you experience any of the following symptoms in the next few days you should return to ED as soon as possible.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>While most people recover quickly you may experience some of the following symptoms over the next few days and weeks, which don't require a return to hospital:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Headaches</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In most cases, these symptoms will resolve themselves within two weeks. However, in some cases, they may persist much longer. Try not to rush back into normal activities, as this may delay recovery. If you still have any symptoms after two weeks we suggest you come back to the ED and take this factsheet with you. It may be possible to seek a referral to a head injury specialist such as a neurologist or neuropsychologist.</p>

                        <p>If rabies is a concern, scrub the wound with soap and water for at least 15 minutes, then rinse and apply a disinfectant (e.g. iodopovidone) as soon as possible after exposure. The use of antibiotics in patients with animal bites is controversial, and some studies have shown little benefit. However, pre-emptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3-5 days is recommended for patients who;</p>

The victim is usually at low risk unless the biter's saliva is contaminated with blood. The risk is greater to the biter if blood is drawn from the victim's wound because of exposure to mucous membranes.</li>
                           <li>Hepatitis B vaccine preferably ≤ 24 hours if not previously immunized</li>

                        <p>DO NOT SUTURE ANIMAL AND HUMAN BITES. The above wounds should be irrigated copiously, dressed, left open to drain, and examined daily to detect signs of infection. During the first few days after injury, elevation of the injured body part, especially if swollen, accelerates healing. This should be accomplished using a passive method (a sling for outpatients or a tubular stockinet and an intravenous pole for inpatients). ALL infected wounds should be treated. If no signs of infection, delayed primary closure may be done <strong>72 hours</strong> after the injury.</p>
                        <h4>Antibiotics</h4>
                        <p>Amoxicillin/Clavulanate 1gm BD x 5-7 days</p>

These animals should be observed for 10 days, and if they show no sign of infection during the observation period they may be released, and the patient does not need to be vaccinated. Signs of infection in an animal include excessive salivation, aggression, paralysis, daytime activity in nocturnal animals, and impaired movement. If the animal shows any signs of infection, the patient should start the vaccination schedule and continue until the animal has been tested at an approved facility.</p>

Monitor breathing and other vital signs continuously. Remember not to have the drip running direct into the wounded limb which is already in danger from the pressure of swelling and should be kept elevated and well protected.</li>

                            <li>Patients with <10% TBSA burns can be resuscitated orally (unless the patient has an electrical injury or associated trauma). This needs ongoing evaluation and the patient may still require an IV line.</li>
                            <li>Patients with burns involving ≥ 20% of TBSA will require intravenous fluid resuscitation. Insert 2 large bore IV/IO lines and give appropriate fluid resuscitation (RL/NS/whole blood). Parkland Formula (available in MDCalc) - Total fluids over 24hrs = Adults - 2-4mL/Kg/%TBSA, Paeds <strong>3mL/Kg/%TBSA</strong>. Give <strong>1/2</strong> of this volume within the first <strong>8hrs</strong> of the burns then the next <strong>1/2</strong> over the next <strong>16hrs</strong> + maintenance fluid for children < 30 kg . Aim for a urine output of <strong>1 mL/kg/hour</strong> in children younger than <strong>2 years</strong> (or who weigh &lt;30 kg) and <strong>0.5 mL/kg/hour</strong> in adults and older children. If urine output is not adequate, increase fluids for the next hour to <strong>150%</strong> of calculated volume until urine output is adequate.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>High-voltage electrical injury causes significant muscle injury, so formulas for fluid resuscitation based on percentage of body surface area burned are not applicable. Aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate urine output (<strong>1.0-1.5 mL/kg per hour</strong>) should be initiated until the urine is clear of myoglobin (urinary dipstick positive for blood with no red cells in the sediment). Acute myoglobinuric renal failure with life-threatening consequences can occur if fluid resuscitation is delayed.</p>

                            <li>Give appropriate analgesia e.g. Fentanyl 1 µg/kg IV (see Analgesia Chart); Consider procedural sedation with Ketamine for wound dressing (see 45. Procedural Sedation and Analgesia (PSA))</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>E</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check temperature and provide warmth to the patient</li>
                            <li>Cool any burns < 3 hours old with cold tap water for at least 30 minutes and then dry the patient. In patients undergoing external cooling who have burns covering ≥ 10% of TBSA, monitor body temperature for hypothermia.</li>
                            <li>Remove all clothes, jewellery, necrotic tissue & debris</li>
                            <li>Wash wound with mild soap and tap water</li>
                            <li>DO NOT BURST BLISTERS. Blisters left intact heal faster and become infected less often.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Secondary Survey (Head-to-Toe Survey) and Other Considerations</h4>
                        <ul>
                           <li>In neck burns, a pillow is placed under the patient's head to hyperextend the neck at the shoulders to prevent contractures</li>
                           <li>Chest wall burns - Do a checker-box release - consult a Surgeon</li>
                           <li>Upper limb burns should be nursed elevated at 45°</li>
                           <li>Evaluate 3rd & 4th Degree Burns and circumferential burns for possible escharotomy, consult a Surgeon</li>
                           <li>Give Tetanus Toxoid.</li>
                           <li>Topical antimicrobial agents or bioengineered substitutes should be applied to all clean, debrided wounds except superficial burns. Prophylaxis with systemic antibiotics is currently NOT RECOMMENDED for patients with severe burns other than perioperatively.</li>
                        </ul>
