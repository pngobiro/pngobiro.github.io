                        <h4>Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation and Triage (SAFE-T)</h4>
                        <p>Suicide assessments should be conducted at first contact, with any subsequent suicidal behaviour, increased ideation, or pertinent clinical change; for inpatients, prior to increasing privileges and at discharge.</p>
                        
                        <h5>1. RISK FACTORS</h5>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Suicidal behaviour:</strong> history of prior suicide attempts, aborted suicide attempts, or self-injurious behaviour</li>
                           <li><strong>Current/past psychiatric disorders:</strong> especially mood disorders, psychotic disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, ADHD, TBI, PTSD, Cluster B personality disorders, conduct disorders (antisocial behaviour, aggression, impulsivity) Co-morbidity and recent onset of illness increase risk</li>
                           <li><strong>Key symptoms:</strong> anhedonia, impulsivity, hopelessness, anxiety/panic, global insomnia, command hallucinations</li>
                           <li><strong>Family history:</strong> of suicide, attempts, or Axis 1 psychiatric disorders requiring hospitalization</li>
                           <li><strong>Precipitants/stressors/Interpersonal:</strong> triggering events leading to humiliation, shame, or despair (e.g., loss of relationship, financial or health status-real or anticipated). Ongoing medical illness (esp. CNS disorders, pain). Intoxication. Family turmoil/chaos. History of physical or sexual abuse. Social isolation</li>
                           <li><strong>Change in treatment:</strong> discharge from psychiatric hospital, provider or treatment change</li>
                           <li><strong>Access to firearms</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>2. PROTECTIVE FACTORS</h5>
                        <p>Protective factors, even if present, may not counteract significant acute risk</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Internal:</strong> ability to cope with stress, religious beliefs, frustration tolerance</li>
                           <li><strong>External:</strong> responsibility to children or beloved pets, positive therapeutic relationships, social supports</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>3. SUICIDE INQUIRY</h5>
                        <p>Specific questioning about thoughts, plans, behaviours, intent</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> frequency, intensity, duration-in last 48 hours, past month, and worst ever</li>
                           <li><strong>Plan:</strong> timing, location, lethality, availability, preparatory acts</li>
                           <li><strong>Behaviours:</strong> past attempts, aborted attempts, rehearsals (tying noose, loading gun) vs. non-suicidal self-injurious actions</li>
                           <li><strong>Intent:</strong> extent to which the patient (1) expects to carry out the plan and (2) believes the plan/act to be lethal vs. self-injurious. Explore ambivalence: reasons to die vs. reasons to live</li>
                           <li>* For Youths: ask parent/guardian about evidence of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviours, and changes in mood, behaviours, or disposition</li>
                           <li>* Homicide Inquiry: when indicated, esp. in character disordered or paranoid males dealing with loss or humiliation. Inquire in four areas listed above</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>4. RISK LEVEL/INTERVENTION</h5>
                        <p>Assessment of risk level is based on clinical judgment, after completing steps 1-3. Reassess as patient or environmental circumstances change</p>

                        <ol>
                           <li>Provide at least one of the following brief suicide prevention interventions prior to discharge.</li>
                           <li>Include crisis center/hotline information with every brief intervention provided.</li>
                           <li>Involve significant other(s) in the intervention if present.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                           <li><strong>Brief Patient Education:</strong> Discuss the condition, risk and protective factors, type of treatment and treatment options, medication instructions, home care, lethal means restriction, follow-up recommendations, and signs of a worsening condition and how to respond. Provide verbal and written information on the nearest crisis hotline.</li>
                           <li><strong>Safety Planning:</strong> Work with the patient to develop a list of coping strategies and resources that he or she can use during or before suicidal crises. Use the Safety Planning resources (paper version or mobile app) provided in the full guide.</li>
                           <li><strong>Lethal Means Counselling:</strong> Assess whether the patient has access to firearms or other lethal means (e.g., prescription medications), and discuss ways to limit access until the patient is no longer feeling suicidal. Follow the Lethal Means Counselling Recommendations for Clinicians sheet available from Means Matter.</li>
                           <li><strong>Rapid Referral:</strong> During the ED visit, schedule an outpatient mental health appointment for the patient within seven days of discharge. If no appointments are available, review additional suggestions in the full guide and/or refer the patient for a follow-up with a primary care provider.</li>
                           <li><strong>Caring Contacts:</strong> Follow up with discharged patients via postcards, letters, e-mail or text messages, or phone calls. These communications can be automated.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Discharge Planning Checklist</h4>
                        <p>Involve the patient in the decision-making process. Shared decision-making lowers patient stress, gives patients a sense of control, and leads to better outcomes. Patients with suicide risk report higher satisfaction when they are involved in decisions about their care.</p>

                        <p>Atropine doses should be doubled every 5 minutes until the therapeutic endpoint (Atropinisation) is reached i.e. until pulmonary secretions are dried [reflected by improved oxygenation] and ease of breathing [or ease of ventilation]), a pulse rate <strong>&gt;80</strong> beats per minute and systolic blood pressure <strong>&gt;80mmHg</strong>. Start atropine infusion when atropinisation achieved <strong>-0.05mg/kg/hour</strong>. E.g. for a <strong>70kg</strong> patient give <strong>3.5 mg</strong> of atropine per hour as an infusion. Put 10 mg of atropine in 200 mLs of fluid run at 40-80 mLs per hour (2-4 mg/hr) depending on response.</p>
                        <p><strong>Precautions</strong> - Excessive doses of atropine can result in deleterious effects including delirium, agitation, and tachycardia and hypertension. Atropine will likely NOT improve miosis or skeletal muscle paralysis (nicotinic receptors); therefore, reversal of these effects is not a therapeutic endpoint.

                        <p>Benzodiazepines are needed to prevent or treat nerve agent-induced seizures in moderate to severe toxicity because anticholinergic treatment is increasingly less effective from 5-40 minutes post exposure.

Benzodiazepines should be infused rapidly to unresponsive patients who have been exposed to organophosphates, because such patients may have nonconvulsive seizures due to the onset of paralysis.</p>

                        <p>(Adults: 2 g IM or slow IV infusion over 15 to 30 minutes followed by a 500-mg/hour infusion)</p>
                        <p>Neither atropine nor benzodiazepines will alleviate symptoms affecting the nicotinic system (CNS, NMJ, autonomic ganglia). 2-PAM should be given to any patient exposed to an organophosphate nerve agent who is showing any systemic toxicity especially fasciculations or weakness. The initial dose should be given as quickly as possible. Caution: Delivering 2-PAM more rapidly than recommended can result in hypertension. This is usually self-limited, but in extreme cases, phentolamine 5 mg IV may be effective. Laryngospasm and rigidity can also occur with rapid IV administration.</p>

Untreated methanol poisoning is associated with a rate of death of <strong>28%</strong> and a rate of visual deficits or blindness of <strong>30%</strong> in survivors.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Monitor, support ABCs ; Consider Advanced Airway or nursing in recovery position for airway protection</li>
                            <li>Check vital signs (BP, PR, RR, SPO2, T °C, RBS).</li>
                            <li>Start Oxygen IF SPO<sub>2</sub> &lt;94%. Maintain SPO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 94%</li>
                            <li>If Hypoglycaemic (RBS &lt; 3.3 mmol/L), give 50 mls 50% dextrose IV (see 29. Hypoglycaemia Algorithm). Also, give 100 mg Thiamine IV followed by 100 mg PO BD for 6 weeks.</li>
                            <li>Send samples for FBC, UEC, LFTs, Lipase, VBG, toxicology. Correct any electrolyte imbalances (see 32: Electrolyte Abnormalities Algorithm)</li>
                            <li>Start IV Fluids - If hypotensive give repeated NS/RL boluses at <strong>20ml/kg</strong> until perfusion is restored (MAP > 65) and dehydration is corrected. More rapid administration and large amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients. When stable, start <strong>5% dextrose saline</strong> infusion at <strong>3L/24 hrs</strong></li>
                            <li>Perform brief, targeted history, physical exam</li>
                            <li>DO NOT PERFORM GASTRIC LAVAGE. If the patient's airway is protected, anecdotal evidence supports the use of gastric aspiration if large amounts of alcohol have been ingested and the patient can be treated very quickly (within an hour) after the ingestion.</li>
                            <li>DO NOT GIVE ACTIVATED CHARCOAL unless the patient has co-ingested other poisons (see 39. Poisoning for indications and contraindications for activated charcoal)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Give Ethanol (also see 39. Poisoning)</h4>
                        <p>Based on in vitro studies, ethanol's affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase is more than that of methanol by 15-fold and thus competes for the enzyme preventing methanol from being metabolized to the toxic metabolite, formic acid.</p>
                        <p><strong>Oral Dose:</strong><br>
                        Vodka, Gin, Whisky, Rum, Tequila (should be at least 35% ethanol content)<br>
                        Loading dose: 1.8 mL/Kg diluted in juice.<br>
                        Maintenance dose: 0.4 mL/Kg/hr<br>
                        <strong>Ethanol</strong><br>
                        Loading dose: 0.8 g/Kg in a 20% ethanol solution diluted in juice.<br>
                        Maintenance dose: 80 mg/Kg/hr; increase to maintain a serum ethanol concentration of 100-150mg/dL.</p>
                        <p><strong>IV Dose:</strong><br>
                        Loading dose: 0.6-0.8 g/Kg in a 10% ethanol solution in D5W (volume/volume).<br>
                        Maintenance dose: 80 to 130 mg/Kg/hr<br>
                        Higher maintenance doses are used in patients with chronic alcoholism or during haemodialysis.<br>
                        Side effects of ethanol treatment include; hypoglycaemia, CNS depression, intoxication, thrombophlebitis, and hypotension.</p>
