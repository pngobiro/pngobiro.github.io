                        <strong>E</strong> = Equipment Check: Follow the tubing from the ETT back to the ventilator and ensure everything is connected<br>
                        <strong>S</strong> = Stacked Breaths: Auto-PEEP. Patient unable to get all the air out from their lungs before initiating the next breath. Inspiratory time is much shorter than expiratory time (I/E ratio is anywhere from 1 to 3 or 1 to 4)</p>
                        
                        <h5>Fixing the Problem (Once you commit to this, do every step even if you fix the problem with one of the earlier letters):</h5>
                        <p><strong>D</strong> = Disconnect the Patient from the Ventilator: This fixes stacked breaths by decreasing intra-thoracic pressure and improving venous return<br>
                        <strong>O</strong> = O<sub>2</sub> 100% Bag Valve Mask: The provider should bag the patient not anyone else because this lets you get a sense of what the potential problem is. Look, Listen, and Feel<br>
                        - Look: Watch the chest rise and fall, look at ETT and ensure it is the same level it was at when it was put in<br>
                        - Listen: Air leaks from cuff rupture or cuff above the cords; Bilateral breath sounds; Prolonged expiratory phase<br>
                        - Feel: Feel the pressure of pilot balloon of endotracheal tube, crepitus; How is the patient bagging (Hard to bag or too easy to bag)</p>
                        <p><strong>T</strong> = Tube Position/Function: Suction catheter to ensure tube is patent; Can also use bougie if you don't have suction catheter, but be gentle (If to aggressive can cause potential harms); Ensure the tube is at the same level it was at when it was put in<br>
                        <strong>T</strong>=Tweak the Vent: Decrease respiratory rate, decrease tidal volume, decrease inspiratory time. Biggest bang for your buck is decreasing the respiratory rate. This may cause respiratory acidosis (permissive hypercapnia)<br>
                        <strong>S</strong> = Sonography: You can diagnose things much faster than waiting for respiratory therapist to come to the bedside or waiting for stat portable chest x-ray to be done.</p>
