Ingestion/exposure

Use of clinical signs alone may not identify all those who need time-dependent intervention. Patients with high risk ingestion or exposure should initially be up-triaged to Red for early clinical assessment.

- Activate Resuscitation Team (if not already present)
- Monitor, support ABCs. Be prepared to provide CPR and defibrillation
- Check vital signs (BP, PR, RR, SPO2, T ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, RBS)

\section*{Optimize Ventilation and Oxygenation}
- Consider an advanced airway and waveform capnography
- Avoid excessive ventilation.
- Start at 10-12 breaths/min (1 breath every 6 seconds)
- Titrate $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ to minimum necessary to maintain $\mathrm{SPO}_{2}$ 94\% - 98\%. DO NOT aim for 100\%
- Titrate to target $\mathrm{PETCO}_{2}$ of $35-45 \mathrm{mmHg}$

Treat Hypotension (SBP $<100 \mathrm{mmHg} /$ MAP $<65 \mathrm{mmHg}$ )
- IV/IO Bolus (if not contraindicated e.g. pulmonary oedema, renal failure): 1-2 L Ringer's Lactate/Hartmann's Solution
- Vasopressor infusion if NO response to fluid bolus or if fluid bolus contraindicated:
- Adrenaline IV Infusion: $0.1-0.5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}(7-35 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{min}$ in $70-\mathrm{kg}$ adult)
- Norepinephrine IV Infusion: $0.1-0.5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{min}(7-35 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{min}$ in $70-\mathrm{kg}$ adult $)$
- Target MAP to achieve adequate urine output ( $>0.5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$ ) and normal or decreasing lactate
- Get a 12-lead ECG immediately if likely cardiac cause. If STEMI, Unstable Cardiogenic Shock or Mechanical Circulatory Support is required - Consult an Interventional Cardiologist
- Identify and Treat reversible causes
- Hypoglycaemia
- Hypovolemia
- Hypoxia
- Hydrogen ion (acidosis)
- Hypo-/hyperkalaemia
- Hypothermia
- Tension Pneumothorax
- Tamponade, cardiac
- Toxins
- Thrombosis, pulmonary
- Thrombosis, coronary
- If patient is stable, transfer to Critical Care Unit (ICU/CCU) attached to a defibrillator
- Target normothermia and avoid fever( $\mathbf{> 3 7 . 7}{ }^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$ C) for atleast $\mathbf{7 2}$ hours after ROSC.

\section*{3. Maternal Cardiac Arrest Algorithm}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

\section*{FIRST RESPONDER}
- Activate Resuscitation Team (if not already present) AND OBGYN
- Document time of onset of maternal cardiac arrest
- Place the patient supine and perform a left uterine displacement (LUD) with as below.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_24_e845fd66d8b7ec460a65g-07.jpg?height=248&width=289&top_left_y=407&top_left_x=444)

B
- Start resuscitation as per the 1. Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm; place hands slightly higher on the sternum than usual

\section*{SUBSEQUENT RESPONDERS}

\section*{Maternal Interventions}

Treat as per 1. Adult Cardiac Arrest Algorithm
- Do not delay defibrillation
- Give typical ACLS drugs and doses
- Ventilate with $100 \%$ oxygen
- Monitor wave form capnography and CPR quality
- Provide post-cardiac arrest care as appropriate. See 2. Post-Cardiac Arrest Care Algorithm

\section*{Maternal Modifications}
- Start IV access above the diaphragm
- Assess for hypovolaemia and give fluid bolus when required
- Anticipate difficult airway; experienced provider preferred for advanced airway placement
- If patient receiving IV/IO magnesium prearrest, stop magnesium and give IV/IO calcium chloride 10 mL in $10 \%$ solution, or calcium gluconate 30 mL in $10 \%$ solution
- Continue all maternal resuscitative interventions (CPR, positioning, defibrillation, drugs, and fluids) during and after caesarean section

\section*{Obstetric Interventions for Patient with an Obviously Gravid Uterus*}
- Perform manual uterine displacement (LUD) displace uterus to the patient's left to relieve aortocaval compression
- Remove both internal and external foetal monitors if present
*An obviously gravid uterus is a uterus that is deemed clinically to be sufficiently large to cause aortocaval compression

\section*{Obstetric and neonatal teams should immediately prepare for possible emergency caesarean section if the pregnancy is determined to be viable}
- If no ROSC by 4 minutes of resuscitative efforts, consider performing immediate emergency caesarean section
- Aim for delivery within 5 minutes of onset of resuscitative efforts

\section*{Potential Aetiology of Maternal Cardiac Arrest}

Anaesthetic complications
Bleeding: DIC, Uterine atony, Placenta abruption/previa
Cardiac disease (MI/ischaemia/aortic dissection/cardiomyopathy)
Drugs
Embolism: coronary/pulmonary/amniotic fluid embolism
Fever (Sepsis)
General non-obstetric causes of cardiac arrest (H's and T's)
Hypertension/preeclampsia/eclampsia

\section*{4. Neonatal Resuscitation Algorithm}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

The most important and effective action in neonatal resuscitation is ventilation of the baby's lungs.

*Note: Endotracheal dose may not result in effective plasma concentration of drug, so vascular access should be established as soon as possible. Drugs given endotracheally require higher dosing than when given IV.

\section*{5. Rapid Sequence Intubation/Airway Algorithm}

\section*{Additional Settings}

Pressure support - $8-10 \mathrm{cmH}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
Inspiratory trigger - $2 \mathrm{cmH}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ below the set PEEP
i times - Adults 1 sec; Toddlers/Children 0.7 sec; Neonates 0.5 sec

Abbreviations: SIMV, Synchronised Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation; PRVC, Pressure Regulated Volume Control; VT, Tidal Volume; PBW, Predicted Body Weight; PEEP, Positive End Expiratory Pressure; PIP, Peak Inspiratory Pressure

The Crashing Intubated Patient (Peri-Arrest or Arrest):
DOPES then DOTTS: The first mnemonic is how to diagnose the problem and the second mnemonic is how to fix the problem:

\section*{Diagnosing the Problem:}

D = Displaced Endotracheal Tube or Cuff
O = Obstructed Endotracheal Tube: Patient biting down, kink in the tube, mucus plug
P = Pneumothorax
E = Equipment Check: Follow the tubing from the ETT back to the ventilator and ensure everything is connected
S = Stacked Breaths: Auto-PEEP. Patient unable to get all the air out from their lungs before initiating the next breath. Inspiratory time is much shorter than expiratory time (I/E ratio is anywhere from 1 to 3 or 1 to 4 )

Fixing the Problem (Once you commit to this, do every step even if you fix the problem with one of the earlier letters):
D = Disconnect the Patient from the Ventilator: This fixes stacked breaths by decreasing intra-thoracic pressure and improving venous return
$\mathrm{O}=\mathrm{O}_{2} 100 \%$ Bag Valve Mask: The provider should bag the patient not anyone else because this lets you get a sense of what the potential problem is. Look, Listen, and Feel
- Look: Watch the chest rise and fall, look at ETT and ensure it is the same level it was at when it was put in
- Listen: Air leaks from cuff rupture or cuff above the cords; Bilateral breath sounds; Prolonged expiratory phase
- Feel: Feel the pressure of pilot balloon of endotracheal tube, crepitus; How is the patient bagging (Hard to bag or too easy to bag)

T = Tube Position/Function: Suction catheter to ensure tube is patent; Can also use bougie if you don't have suction catheter, but be gentle (If to aggressive can cause potential harms); Ensure the tube is at the same level it was at when it was put in
T=Tweak the Vent: Decrease respiratory rate, decrease tidal volume, decrease inspiratory time. Biggest bang for your buck is decreasing the respiratory rate. This may cause respiratory acidosis (permissive hypercapnia)
S = Sonography: You can diagnose things much faster than waiting for respiratory therapist to come to the bedside or waiting for stat portable chest x-ray to be done.

\section*{8. Anaphylaxis Algorithm}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard

A patient meets the definition of anaphylaxis when ANY 1 of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of mucocutaneous signs AND 1 of the following:
- respiratory compromise (wheezing-bronchospasm, dyspnoea, stridor, hypoxemia),
- hypotension (syncope), or
- hypotonia.
2. Rapid onset of $\mathbf{2}$ of the following after exposure to likely allergen:
- mucocutaneous signs,
- respiratory compromise,
- hypotension, or
- persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.
3. Hypotension after exposure to a known allergen.

Patients with simple allergic reactions who DO NOT meet the criteria for anaphylaxis may be managed similarly WITHOUT the use of adrenaline.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_24_e845fd66d8b7ec460a65g-12.jpg?height=772&width=960&top_left_y=694&top_left_x=266)

Patients with risk factors for severe and potentially fatal anaphylaxis may need careful observation for up to $\mathbf{2 4}$ hours:
- Delayed administration of epinephrine
- Asthmatic component to their anaphylactic reaction
- Previous history of biphasic reactions
- Cardiovascular disease
- Possibility of continuing absorption of allergen
- Poor access to emergency care
- Presentation in the evening or at night
- Severe reactions with slow onset caused by idiopathic anaphylaxis

Patients diagnosed with anaphylaxis who are not high-risk should be discharged in the care of others with clear indications for immediate return to the emergency department (ED).

\section*{9. Acute Asthma Exacerbation Algorithm}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

Acute Asthmatic Attack
- Monitor, support ABCs
- Start Oxygen IF $\mathrm{SPO}_{2}<92 \%$. Maintain $\mathrm{SPO}_{2} \geq 92 \%$; Oxygen should be provided to all patients with severe asthma, even those with normal oxygenation.
- Perform brief, targeted history, physical exam (auscultation, use of accessory muscles, PR, RR)
- Initiate treatment of underlying cause of exacerbation
- Check Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) as per PEF Chart below and record predicted or best PEF (\%) in patient's clinical notes.

DO NOT measure PEF in patients with impending/actual respiratory arrest, drowsiness, confusion or silent chest. Start treatment immediately.

Notes: There is no known advantage for higher doses of corticosteroids in severe asthma exacerbations, nor is there any advantage for intravenous administration over oral therapy provided gastrointestinal transit time or absorption is not impaired. The total course of systemic corticosteroids for an asthma exacerbation requiring an ED visit or hospitalization may last from 3 to 10 days. For corticosteroid courses of $<1$ week, there is no need to taper the dose. For slightly longer courses (e.g., up to 10 d), there probably is no need to taper, especially if patients are concurrently taking ICSs. ICSs can be started at any point in the treatment of an asthma exacerbation.

1. See 14. Adult Bradycardia (< 50/min)/Tachycardia (> 150/min) (with Pulse) for indications. Inotropes may be used if transcutaneous pacing is NOT available.
2. Explain the procedure to the patient
3. Consider procedural sedation and analgesia
4. Place the pacing pads on the chest of the patient as per package instructions
5. Connect the pads cable to the pacing machine if not already connected
6. Turn the pacer ON. Observe for markers ( ${ }^{\boldsymbol{\circ}}$ ) indicating the R-wave on the screen. Some machines require that you START pacing after turning the pacer on. Observe for pacing spikes (|) on the baseline.
7. Set the Rate to approximately 60-70 bpm.
8. Set current milliamperes (mA) output as follows: Increase milliamperes (mA) from minimum setting until every pacer spike is immediately followed by a wide QRS and a broad T wave - This is termed as Electrical Capture.
9. Confirm by checking the patient's femoral pulse to see if the pulse rate matches the rate set above i.e. 60-70bpm. This is termed as Mechanical Capture.
10. Recheck the patient's vital signs and confirm the patient's signs of shock are resolving i.e. increase in blood pressure, improved mentation, etc. This is termed as Physiological Capture.
11. If all the above is achieved, increase the current milliamperes by $\mathbf{1 0} \boldsymbol{\%}$ for safety margin
12. Set the Mode to 'Fixed mode'
13. Transfer care to a Cardiologist without delay. DO NOT STOP PACING unless instructed to by a Cardiologist.

\section*{Trouble Shooting}
- Pacing Spikes not seen on the base line - Confirm that you have pressed the START button
- No Electrical Capture - Confirm that the pads are firmly pressed on the patient's chest. Continue increasing the milliamperes. There is no set minimum or maximum.
- No Mechanical Capture - Increase the milliamperes by increments of $5-10 \mathrm{~mA}$ and recheck the pulse
- No Physiological Capture - Consider hypovolaemia as the cause of shock and give a small fluid bolus ( $250-500 \mathrm{mls}$ ) and recheck the patient. If not, increase the set rate to 80bpm, confirm electrical capture and mechanical capture and recheck the patient
- In all cases, consult a Cardiologist.

\section*{Transferring a patient to another transcutaneous pacer (Handing Over Pacing)}
1. DO NOT disconnect the patient from the original pacing machine
2. Set the original pacing machine to 'Demand mode'

The following steps are performed on the new pacing machine;
3. Place a new set of pacing pads on the chest of the patient in the anteroposterior position. Place the anterior pad directly over the heart at the precordium to the left of the lower sternal border; place the posterior pad under the patient's body beneath the heart and immediately below the scapula.
4. Connect the pads cable to the new pacing machine if not already connected
5. Turn the pacer ON. Observe for markers ( ${ }^{\bullet}$ ) indicating the R-wave on the screen. Some machines require that you START pacing after turning the pacer on. Observe for pacing spikes (|) on the baseline.
6. Set the Rate higher than the rate in the original pacing machine e.g. 80-90 bpm.
7. Set current milliamperes (mA) output as follows: Increase milliamperes (mA) from minimum setting until every pacer spike is immediately followed by a wide QRS and a broad T wave - This is termed as Electrical Capture.
8. Confirm by checking the patient's femoral pulse to see if the pulse rate matches the rate set above i.e. 80-90bpm. This is termed as Mechanical Capture.
9. Recheck the patient's vital signs and confirm the patient's signs of shock are resolving i.e. increase in blood pressure, improved mentation, etc. This is termed as Physiological Capture.
10. If all the above is achieved, increase the current milliamperes by $\mathbf{1 0} \boldsymbol{\%}$ for safety margin
11. At this point, the original pacing machine will be in a 'Standby mode'
12. Disconnect the original pacing machine

\section*{Watch video on our \\ You Tube Channel}
1. See 14. Adult Bradycardia (< $50 / \mathrm{min}$ )/Tachycardia (> $150 / \mathrm{min}$ ) (with Pulse) for indications.
2. Explain the procedure to the patient
3. Consider procedural sedation and analgesia
4. Place the defibrillation pads on the chest of the patient as per package instructions
5. Connect the pads cable to the pacing machine if not already connected
6. Turn the defibrillator ON .
7. Select the appropriate energy level e.g. 50-100J. In paediatrics, begin with 0.5-1 J/kg; if not effective, increase to $2 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{kg}$.
8. Activate the synchronize mode by pressing the synchronize button.
9. Check to verify that the machine is correctly sensing the $R$ wave. Observe for markers $\left({ }^{\bullet}\right)$ indicating the $R$-wave on the screen.
10. Charge the machine to the ordered energy level.
11. Before discharging the current, shout 'CLEAR' and ensure no one (including yourself) is touching the patient, bed or equipment connected to the patient.
12. SHOCK the patient.
13. If no change in rhythm, increase the energy level e.g. by 50 J in adults or to $2 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{Kg}$ in paediatrics, and repeat steps 8-12
14. Consult a Cardiologist without delay.

Trouble Shooting
- In case you do not get a rhythm change after giving a shock, consider;
- Potential underlying causes e.g. Hs and Ts
- Poor pads connection
- Need for higher energy levels
- In all cases, consult a Cardiologist.

See Hypertensive Emergencies Drug Infusions for Dosages and Precautions
Neurological Emergencies
Hypertensive Encephalopathy - Reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) 20-25\% immediately. Drugs: Labetalol, Nicardipine Alt. Nitroprusside
Acute Ischemic Stroke
- In patients with markedly elevated blood pressure (SBP $>\mathbf{2 2 0} \mathbf{~ m m H g}$ or DBP $>\mathbf{1 2 0 ~ m m ~ H g}$ ) who do not receive fibrinolysis, a reasonable goal is to lower blood pressure by $\mathbf{1 5} \boldsymbol{\%}$ during the first $\mathbf{2 4}$ hours after onset of stroke.
- With indication for fibrinolysis and SBP $>185 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or DBP $>110 \mathrm{mmHg}$ - Reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) 15\% over 1 hour. Drugs: Labetalol, Nicardipine Alt. Nitroprusside. If BP is not maintained at or below $185 / 110 \mathrm{mmHg}$, do not administer rtPA
- After fibrinolysis - the SBP should be maintained $\mathbf{< 1 8 0} \mathbf{m} \mathbf{m H g}$ and DBP $\mathbf{< 1 0 5} \mathbf{m m H g}$ for $\mathbf{2 4}$ hours.

Acute Haemorrhagic Stroke and SBP $>150 \mathrm{mmHg}$ - No evidence exists to suggest that HTN provokes further bleeding in patients with ICH. A precipitous fall in SBP may compromise cerebral perfusion and increase mortality. Reduce SBP to a target of $\mathbf{1 4 0} \mathbf{~ m m H g}$ with the goal of maintaining in the range of $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ to $\mathbf{1 5 0} \mathbf{~ m m H g}$. Drugs: Labetalol, Nicardipine.

Subarachnoid Haemorrhage - Maintain SBP $<160 \mathrm{mmHg}$ until the aneurysm is treated or cerebral vasospasm occurs. Oral nimodipine is used to prevent delayed ischemic neurological deficits, but it is NOT indicated for treating acute hypertension.

Cardiovascular Emergencies
Acute Coronary Event - Reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 140mmHg immediately. Thrombolytics are contraindicated if BP is >185/100 mmHg. Drugs: Nitroglycerine, Labetalol

Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema - Reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 140mmHg immediately. Drugs: Nitroprusside or Nitroglycerine (with loop diuretic)

Acute aortic disease - Immediately reduce the SBP < 120mmHg and heart rate < 60bpm and maintain it at this level unless signs of end-organ hypo perfusion are present. Drugs: Esmolol and Nitroprusside or Nitroglycerine or Nicardipine. Alt. Labetalol or Metoprolol. Avoid $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-blockers if there is;
- aortic valvular regurgitation or
- suspected cardiac tamponade.

Other Disorders
Cocaine toxicity/Pheochromocytoma - Hypertension and tachycardia from cocaine toxicity rarely require specific treatment.
- Benzodiazepines are the preferred agents for cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes.
- Pheochromocytoma treatment guidelines are similar to that of cocaine toxicity. $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-blockers can be added for BP control only after $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-blockade.

Preferred medications - Diazepam, Phentolamine, Nitroglycerin/nitroprusside
Medications to avoid - $\beta$-adrenergic antagonists prior to phentolamine administration
Preeclampsia/eclampsia - In women with eclampsia or preeclampsia, SBP should be $\mathbf{<} \mathbf{1 6 0} \mathbf{~ m m H g}$ and DBP <110 mm Hg in the prepartum and intrapartum periods. If the platelet count is $<\mathbf{1 0 0 , 0 0 0}$ cells $/ \mathbf{m m}^{\mathbf{3}}$ BP should be maintained below $\mathbf{1 5 0} / \mathbf{1 0 0} \mathbf{m m H g}$. Patients with eclampsia or preeclampsia should also be loaded with IV Magnesium sulphate $\mathbf{4 g m}$ diluted in 100 mL NS over 15 mins then with an infusion of $\mathbf{2 g m} / \mathbf{h r}$ to avoid seizures.
Preferred medications - Hydralazine, Labetalol, Nifedipine
Medications to avoid - Nitroprusside, Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Esmolol

\section*{Hypertensive Emergencies Drug Infusions}
*For adults with a compelling condition (i.e., aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, or pheochromocytoma crisis), SBP should be reduced to $<140 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ during the first hour and to $<120 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in aortic dissection. For adults without a compelling condition, SBP should be reduced by no more than $25 \%$ within the first hour; then, if stable, to $160 / 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ with in the next 2 to 6 hours; and then cautiously to normal during the following 24 to 48 hours.

\section*{Trauma Team Activation Criteria}

The Trauma team comprises a group of emergency department doctors/clinical officers and nurses, surgeons, anaesthetists and theatre staff, radiographers and other support personnel, who work together as a team to assess and manage the trauma patient. Their actions are coordinated by a team leader who should not touch the patient. The aim of the trauma team is to provide a safe and efficient evaluation of the patient. Identify all injuries and instigate the definitive management of such injuries. Most trauma teams will have about 30 minutes to accomplish this and should work towards achieving this goal.

The Trauma Team should be activated immediately a patient who meets ANY of the criteria below arrives:
- Systolic BP $<90 \mathrm{mmHg}$
- Respiratory rate < 10 breaths/ min or > 30 breaths/ min
- GCS < 12 with torso or extremity trauma
- Pregnant patient (> 20 weeks) with foetal heart rate < 120 bpm or >160 bpm
- Amputation proximal to elbows or knees
- 2 or more proximal long bone fractures
- Suspected spinal cord injury
- Severe maxillofacial injury with airway compromise
- Burns > 15\% TBSA
- Pregnant patient with penetrating injury or significant blunt injury
- Gunshot wound proximal to knee or elbow
- Significant penetrating wound to head, neck, chest, abdomen or groin
- Ejection from vehicle
- Pedestrian thrown (hit by a car) or rolled over
- Fall from a height $>6$ metres (20 feet)
- Simultaneous arrival of 3 or more multi-trauma patients
- Emergency Doctor feels trauma team is necessary for an injured patient

A CT interpreted as normal by the Radiologist in a neurologically intact person with a normal mental status allows for safe discharge with appropriate instructions and avoids prolonged ER observation or hospital admission. WRITTEN and VERBAL Discharge Instructions (see MINOR HEAD INJURY DISCHARGE ADVICE) must be provided and should include symptoms to expect after a mild TBI, the time course, the overall positive prognosis, activity limitations, and the point at which a patient return to the ED for further testing.}
\end{figure}

\section*{Minor Head Injury Discharge Advice}

On returning home it is important that, if possible, you are accompanied by a responsible adult. While unlikely, there is a small risk of developing complications, so if you experience any of the following symptoms in the next few days you should return to ED as soon as possible.
- Loss of consciousness
- New deafness in one or both ears
- Loss of balance or problems walking
- Any weakness in one or both arms or legs
- Any vomiting
- Clear fluid coming out of your ears or nose
- Drowsiness when you would normally be wide awake
- Increasing disorientation
- Problems understanding or speaking
- Blurred or double vision
- Severe headache not relieved by painkillers such as paracetamol
- Bleeding from one or both ears
- Any fits (collapsing or passing out suddenly)
- Inability to be woken

\section*{Dos and Don'ts}

DO make sure you stay within reach of a telephone and medical help in the next few days
DO have plenty of rest and avoid stressful situations
DO show this factsheet to a friend or family member who can keep an eye on your condition
DO take painkillers such as paracetamol for headaches
DON'T stay at home alone for 48 hours after leaving the hospital
DON'T drink alcohol until you feel better
DON'T take aspirin or sleeping tablets without consulting a doctor
DON'T return to work until you feel ready
DON'T play any contact sport for at least three weeks without consulting your doctor
DON'T return to driving until you feel you have recovered. If in doubt consult your doctor.

While most people recover quickly you may experience some of the following symptoms over the next few days and weeks, which don't require a return to hospital:
- Headaches
- Feelings of dizziness
- Nausea
- Sensitivity to light or noise
- Sexual difficulties
- Sleep disturbance
- Memory problems
- Thinking and problem-solving
- Irritability
- Restlessness
- Impulsivity and self-control problems
- Difficulties with concentration
- Feeling depressed, tearful or anxious
- Fatigue
- Difficulties

In most cases, these symptoms will resolve themselves within two weeks. However, in some cases, they may persist much longer. Try not to rush back into normal activities, as this may delay recovery. If you still have any symptoms after two weeks we suggest you come back to the ED and take this factsheet with you. It may be possible to seek a referral to a head injury specialist such as a neurologist or neuropsychologist.

\section*{26. Bites (Animal \& Human), Tetanus \& Rabies}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

\section*{Animal Bites}

If rabies is a concern, scrub the wound with soap and water for at least 15 minutes, then rinse and apply a disinfectant (e.g. iodopovidone) as soon as possible after exposure. The use of antibiotics in patients with animal bites is controversial, and some studies have shown little benefit. However, pre-emptive early antimicrobial therapy for 3-5 days is recommended for patients who;
- are immunocompromised;
- are asplenic;
- have advanced liver disease;
- have pre-existing or resultant oedema of the affected area;
- have moderate to severe injuries, especially to the hand or face; or
- have injuries that may have penetrated the periosteum or joint capsule

ALL Human bites should receive;
- prophylactic antibiotics
- consider post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV within $\mathbf{7 2 h r s}$. The risk associated with bite injuries has not been quantified. The victim is usually at low risk unless the biter's saliva is contaminated with blood. The risk is greater to the biter if blood is drawn from the victim's wound because of exposure to mucous membranes.
- Hepatitis B vaccine preferably $\leq 24$ hours if not previously immunized

\section*{Treatment:}

DO NOT SUTURE ANIMAL AND HUMAN BITES. The above wounds should be irrigated copiously, dressed, left open to drain, and examined daily to detect signs of infection. During the first few days after injury, elevation of the injured body part, especially if swollen, accelerates healing. This should be accomplished using a passive method (a sling for outpatients or a tubular stockinet and an intravenous pole for inpatients). ALL infected wounds should be treated. If no signs of infection, delayed primary closure may be done $\mathbf{7 2}$ hours after the injury.

\section*{Antibiotics}

Amoxicillin/Clavulanate $1 \mathrm{gm} \mathrm{BD} \times 5-7$ days
In Penicillin Allergic Patients:
Clindamycin 300 mg PO QID/600 mg IV TDS OR Azithromycin 500mg PO OD for 3 days
PLUS
Tetanus Toxoid $\mathbf{0 . 5 m g}$ IM

Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis
The WHO rabies exposure categories are:
Category I Touching or feeding animals, licks on intact skin
Category II Nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches or abrasions without bleeding Single or multiple transdermal bites or broken skin with saliva from animal
Category III licks, exposure due to direct contact with bats.

\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Patients bitten by healthy appearing domestic animals may delay rabies post exposure prophylaxis if the animal is quarantined. These animals should be observed for 10 days, and if they show no sign of infection during the observation period they may be released, and the patient does not need to be vaccinated. Signs of infection in an animal include excessive salivation, aggression, paralysis, daytime activity in nocturnal animals, and impaired movement. If the animal shows any signs of infection, the patient should start the vaccination schedule and continue until the animal has been tested at an approved facility.

\section*{Burns Resuscitation Pathway (Resuscitation)}

\section*{Resuscitation (C-ABCDE)}

\section*{CONSULT A SURGEON IMMEDIATELY AS YOU BEGIN RESUSCITATION OF ANY BURNS PATIENT WITH $3^{\mathrm{RD}}$ OR $4^{\mathrm{TH}}$ DEGREE BURNS AND CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS ( also see Trauma Team Activation Criteria)}

C - If suspected C-Spine trauma and NOT cleared clinically, Head Blocks or Blanket Rolls strapped to the patient's head and trolley?
A
- Rapid Sequence Intubation? Avoid succinylcholine in patients with burns $\boldsymbol{>} \mathbf{2 4 h r s}$ due to risk of hyperkalaemia. Indications for intubation include presence of pharyngeal burns, air hunger, stridor, carbonaceous sputum and hoarseness, unconscious patients, hypoxic patients with severe smoke inhalation, or patients with flame or flash burns involving the face and neck.
B
- Supplementary Oxygenation? If suspected carbon monoxide poisoning (restlessness, headache, nausea, poor co-ordination, memory impairment, disorientation, or coma), give 100\% oxygen via a Non-Rebreather mask at 15L/min for 24 hrs
C
- Control Active Bleeding
- Do not include first degree burns in the calculation of \% TBSA
- Patients with $<10 \%$ TBSA burns can be resuscitated orally (unless the patient has an electrical injury or associated trauma). This needs ongoing evaluation and the patient may still require an IV line.
- Patients with burns involving $\geq 20 \%$ of TBSA will require intravenous fluid resuscitation. Insert 2 large bore IV/IO lines and give appropriate fluid resuscitation (RL/NS/whole blood). Parkland Formula (available in MDCalc) - Total fluids over 24hrs = Adults - 2-4mL/Kg/\%TBSA, Paeds $\mathbf{3 m L} / \mathbf{K g} / \mathbf{\% T B S A}$. Give $\mathbf{1} \boldsymbol{\frac { 2 } { 2 }}$ of this volume within the first $\mathbf{8 h r s}$ of the burns then the next $\mathbf{1} \boldsymbol{/} \mathbf{2}$ over the next $\mathbf{1 6 h r s}+$ maintenance fluid for children < 30 kg . Aim for a urine output of $\mathbf{1 ~ m L} / \mathbf{k g} /$ hour in children younger than $\mathbf{2}$ years (or who weigh $<30 \mathrm{~kg}$ ) and $\mathbf{0 . 5 ~ m L} / \mathbf{k g} /$ hour in adults and older children. If urine output is not adequate, increase fluids for the next hour to $\mathbf{1 5 0}$ of calculated volume until urine output is adequate.

High-voltage electrical injury causes significant muscle injury, so formulas for fluid resuscitation based on percentage of body surface area burned are not applicable. Aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain adequate urine output ( $\mathbf{1 . 0 - 1 . 5 ~ m L} / \mathbf{k g}$ per hour) should be initiated until the urine is clear of myoglobin (urinary dipstick positive for blood with no red cells in the sediment). Acute myoglobinuric renal failure with life-threatening consequences can occur if fluid resuscitation is delayed.
- GXM and request adequate supplementary blood and blood products if necessary

D
- Correct Hypoglycaemia - 50mls 50\% Dextrose IV
- Give appropriate analgesia e.g. Fentanyl $1 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV (see Analgesia Chart); Consider procedural sedation with Ketamine for wound dressing (see 45. Procedural Sedation and Analgesia (PSA))
E
- Check temperature and provide warmth to the patient
- Cool any burns < 3 hours old with cold tap water for at least 30 minutes and then dry the patient. In patients undergoing external cooling who have burns covering $\geq 10 \%$ of TBSA, monitor body temperature for hypothermia.
- Remove all clothes, jewellery, necrotic tissue \& debris
- Wash wound with mild soap and tap water
- DO NOT BURST BLISTERS. Blisters left intact heal faster and become infected less often.

Secondary Survey (Head-to-Toe Survey) and Other Considerations
- In neck burns, a pillow is placed under the patient's head to hyperextend the neck at the shoulders to prevent contractures
- Chest wall burns - Do a checker-box release - consult a Surgeon
- Upper limb burns should be nursed elevated at $45^{\circ}$
- Evaluate 3rd \& 4th Degree Burns and circumferential burns for possible escharotomy, consult a Surgeon
- Give Tetanus Toxoid.
- Topical antimicrobial agents or bioengineered substitutes should be applied to all clean, debrided wounds except superficial burns. Prophylaxis with systemic antibiotics is currently NOT RECOMMENDED for patients with severe burns other than perioperatively.

\section*{Disposition}

Minimum criteria for transfer to a burns centre (Modified from the Australian and New Zealand Burn Association (ANZBA) protocol)
Burn injury patients who should be referred to a burn unit include the following:

- immunocompromised patients \\
- recent use of antibiotics \\
A Stool Culture is NOT NECESSARY OR COSTEFFECTIVE in most cases of diarrhoea without systemic disease or dysentery unless an unusual bacterial cause is suspected \\
Typhoid - Bone marrow culture is the most sensitive routinely available diagnostic tool. Stool culture is positive only in up to $30-40 \%$ of cases but is often negative by the time that systemic symptoms bring patients to hospital. Blood cultures are positive in $40-80 \%$ of patients. Serologic tests e.g. the Widal test are of limited clinical utility because positive results may represent a previous infection.

Food-borne toxigenic diarrhoea usually requires only supportive treatment, not antibiotics. \\
Treatment of salmonellosis with antibiotics (including quinolones) can prolong the carrier state and lead to a higher clinical relapse rate. \\

- recent use of antibiotics \\
Ciprofloxacin $\mathbf{5 0 0 ~ m g ~ P O ~ B D ~ x ~} \mathbf{3}$ days. The duration of treatment may be extended by 2-3 days for moderate-to-severe cases. \\
The antimotility agent loperamide (Imodium) may reduce the duration of diarrhoea when given with antibiotics for traveller's diarrhoea. A loperamide/simethicone combination has demonstrated faster and more complete relief. Loperamide may cause dangerous prolongation of illness in patients with some forms of bloody or inflammatory diarrhoea and, therefore, should be restricted to patients with non-bloody stool.

Cloudiness of the urine is most often due to protein or crystal presence, and malodorous urine may be due to diet or medication use. A urinalysis with quantitative urine WBC counts should NOT be used alone to support a diagnosis of UTI or start antimicrobial therapy in any patient population. \\
A negative Leukocyte Esterase AND a negative urine Nitrate largely rule out infection in pregnant women, elderly patients, family medicine, and urology patients. The combination of a negative leukocyte esterase and negative nitrite test demonstrated a UTI negative predictive value of 88\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 84-92\%). \\
Pyuria in a urine specimen, in the absence of symptoms (Asymptomatic Bacteriuria), is NOT AN INDICATION for antimicrobial therapy. \\

\section*{Suicide Assessment Five-step Evaluation and Triage (SAFE-T)}

Suicide assessments should be conducted at first contact, with any subsequent suicidal behaviour, increased ideation, or pertinent clinical change; for inpatients, prior to increasing privileges and at discharge.

\section*{1. RISK FACTORS}
- Suicidal behaviour: history of prior suicide attempts, aborted suicide attempts, or self-injurious behaviour
- Current/past psychiatric disorders: especially mood disorders, psychotic disorders, alcohol/substance abuse, ADHD, TBI, PTSD, Cluster B personality disorders, conduct disorders (antisocial behaviour, aggression, impulsivity) Co-morbidity and recent onset of illness increase risk
- Key symptoms: anhedonia, impulsivity, hopelessness, anxiety/panic, global insomnia, command hallucinations
- Family history: of suicide, attempts, or Axis 1 psychiatric disorders requiring hospitalization
- Precipitants/stressors/Interpersonal: triggering events leading to humiliation, shame, or despair (e.g., loss of relationship, financial or health status-real or anticipated). Ongoing medical illness (esp. CNS disorders, pain). Intoxication. Family turmoil/chaos. History of physical or sexual abuse. Social isolation
- Change in treatment: discharge from psychiatric hospital, provider or treatment change
- Access to firearms

\section*{2. PROTECTIVE FACTORS Protective factors, even if present, may not counteract significant acute risk}
- Internal: ability to cope with stress, religious beliefs, frustration tolerance
- External: responsibility to children or beloved pets, positive therapeutic relationships, social supports

\section*{3. SUICIDE INQUIRY Specific questioning about thoughts, plans, behaviours, intent}
- Ideation: frequency, intensity, duration-in last 48 hours, past month, and worst ever
- Plan: timing, location, lethality, availability, preparatory acts
- Behaviours: past attempts, aborted attempts, rehearsals (tying noose, loading gun) vs. non-suicidal self-injurious actions
- Intent: extent to which the patient (1) expects to carry out the plan and (2) believes the plan/act to be lethal vs. self-injurious. Explore ambivalence: reasons to die vs. reasons to live
* For Youths: ask parent/guardian about evidence of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviours, and changes in mood, behaviours, or disposition
* Homicide Inquiry: when indicated, esp. in character disordered or paranoid males dealing with loss or humiliation. Inquire in four areas listed above

\section*{4. RISK LEVEL/INTERVENTION}
- Assessment of risk level is based on clinical judgment, after completing steps 1-3
- Reassess as patient or environmental circumstances change

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline RISK LEVEL & RISK/PROTECTIVE FACTOR & SUICIDALITY & POSSIBLE INTERVENTIONS \\
\hline High & Psychiatric diagnoses with severe symptoms or acute precipitating event; protective factors not relevant & Potentially lethal suicide attempt or persistent ideation with strong intent or suicide rehearsal & Admission generally indicated unless a significant change reduces risk. Suicide precautions \\
\hline Moderate & Multiple risk factors, few protective factors & Suicidal ideation with plan, but no intent or behaviour & Admission may be necessary depending on risk factors. Develop crisis plan. Give emergency/crisis numbers \\
\hline Low & Modifiable risk factors, strong protective factors & Thoughts of death, no plan, intent, or behaviour & Outpatient referral, symptom reduction. Give emergency/crisis numbers \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
(This chart is intended to represent a range of risk levels and interventions, not actual determinations.)

\section*{5. DOCUMENT}

Risk level and rationale; treatment plan to address/reduce current risk (e.g., medication, setting, psychotherapy, E.C.T., contact with significant others, consultation); firearms instructions, if relevant; follow-up plan. For youths, treatment plan should include roles for parent/guardian.

\section*{Brief Suicide Prevention Interventions}

For all patients with suicidal ideation who are being discharged:
1. Provide at least one of the following brief suicide prevention interventions prior to discharge.
2. Include crisis center/hotline information with every brief intervention provided.
3. Involve significant other(s) in the intervention if present.
- Brief Patient Education: Discuss the condition, risk and protective factors, type of treatment and treatment options, medication instructions, home care, lethal means restriction, follow-up recommendations, and signs of a worsening condition and how to respond. Provide verbal and written information on the nearest crisis hotline.
- Safety Planning: Work with the patient to develop a list of coping strategies and resources that he or she can use during or before suicidal crises. Use the Safety Planning resources (paper version or mobile app) provided in the full guide.
- Lethal Means Counselling: Assess whether the patient has access to firearms or other lethal means (e.g., prescription medications), and discuss ways to limit access until the patient is no longer feeling suicidal. Follow the Lethal Means Counselling Recommendations for Clinicians sheet available from Means Matter.
- Rapid Referral: During the ED visit, schedule an outpatient mental health appointment for the patient within seven days of discharge. If no appointments are available, review additional suggestions in the full guide and/or refer the patient for a follow-up with a primary care provider.
- Caring Contacts: Follow up with discharged patients via postcards, letters, e-mail or text messages, or phone calls. These communications can be automated.

\section*{Discharge Planning Checklist}

Involve the patient in the decision-making process. Shared decision-making lowers patient stress, gives patients a sense of control, and leads to better outcomes. Patients with suicide risk report higher satisfaction when they are involved in decisions about their care.
- Patient involved in planning
- Follow-up appointment scheduled for a date within one week of discharge
- Discharge plan reviewed verbally and understood by patient
- Barriers and solutions discussed
- Crisis center phone number provided
- Access to lethal means reviewed and discussed
- Written instructions and education materials provided, including what to do if the patient's condition worsens and when to return to the ED
- Patient confirms his or her understanding of the patient care plan
- Relevant health information transmitted to referral providers
- Patient senses the provider's care and concern

\section*{36. Management of the severely agitated or violent patient}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.
- Ensure staff safety
- Attempt to calm patient using verbal techniques
- Place physical restraints if necessary
- Monitor, support ABCs.

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding can vary in presentation, but most cases present in one or more of four ways as follows:
a) Melena (69\%): the passage of dark and pitchy stools stained with blood pigments or with altered blood. Melena is caused by the passage of at least $\mathbf{5 0 ~ m L}$ of blood in the upper GI tract. Bacteria degrade the blood into haematin or other haemachromes. Melena should not be confused with the dark stools that result from ingestion of iron or bismuth.
b) Haematemesis (30\%): the vomiting of bright red blood and indicates an upper GI site of bleeding, usually above the ligament of Treitz.
c) Coffee-ground emesis ( $28 \%$ ): emesis consisting of dark, altered blood mixed with stomach contents
d) Haematochezia (15\%): the passage of bloody faeces

\section*{SHOCKED (HYPOTENSIVE)}
- Monitor, support ABCs in ER; Intubate patient if airway is at risk from massive haematemesis
- Check vital signs (BP, PR, RR, $\mathrm{SPO}_{2}, \mathrm{~T}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{RBS}$ )
- Start Oxygen IF $\mathrm{SPO}_{2}<94 \%$. Maintain $\mathrm{SPO}_{2} \geq 94 \%$
- Establish 2 large bore IV accesses ( $\mathbf{1 4 - 1 6 G}$ ).
- Give rapid fluid boluses at $\mathbf{2 0 m L} / \mathbf{K g}$ Ringer's Lactate/Hartmann's soln; repeat if necessary.
- Start blood transfusions ONLY if $\mathbf{H b}<\mathbf{7 ~ g} / \mathbf{d L}$
- Send samples for FBC, UEC, LFTs, VBG, Coagulation screen. Crossmatch 6 units of packed cells.
- Perform brief, targeted history, physical exam including a rectal exam
- Insert NGT ONLY if intubated or has recurrent vomiting uncontrolled by anti-emetics

\section*{NOT SHOCKED}
- Monitor, support ABCs in ER; Intubate patient if airway is at risk from massive haematemesis
- Check vital signs (BP, PR, RR, SPO2, T ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, RBS)
- Start Oxygen IF $\mathrm{SPO}_{2}<94 \%$. Maintain $\mathrm{SPO}_{2} \geq 94 \%$
- Establish a large bore IV access (14-16G).
- Start IV Fluids TKVO - Ringer's Lactate (RL)/Hartmann's soln. Start blood transfusions ONLY if $\mathrm{Hb}<7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$
- Send samples for FBC, UEC, LFTs, VBG, Coagulation screen, Blood type \& screen.
- Perform brief, targeted history, physical exam including a rectal exam
- IV omeprazole ( $\mathbf{8 0 - m g}$ bolus followed by $\mathbf{8 ~ m g} / \mathbf{h}$ for $\mathbf{7 2 ~ h}$ ). Use pantoprazole if patient is on Clopidogrel.
- Monitor vital signs every 15 min until stable, then hourly.
- Correct hypotension with repeat fluid boluses/blood transfusion
- Monitor urine output - Aim for $\mathbf{> 0 . 5 m L / K g / h}$
- Consult Gastroenterologist
- Admit HDU/ICU

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

\section*{DECONTAMINATION AND PERSONAL PROTECTION}
- WEAR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (Gloves, Gowns and Masks)
- REMOVE ALL CLOTHING from and gently cleanse the patient with soap and water. Consider clothing and PPEs as hazardous waste and discard accordingly

The action of acetylcholine released into a synaptic cleft or neuromuscular junction is normally terminated when the enzyme acetylcholinesterase cleaves acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. Organophosphates bind to the active site of the cholinesterase enzymes causing an increase in the acetylcholine concentration and a marked hyper stimulation of the cholinergic system, which is responsible for the predominant signs of toxicity.

Muscarinic Manifestations
Ophthalmic: Conjunctival injection, lacrimation, miosis, blurred vision, diminished visual acuity, ocular pain
Respiratory: Rhinorrhoea, stridor, wheezing, cough, excessive sputum, chest tightness, dyspnoea, apnoea
Cardiovascular: Bradydysrhythmias, hypotension
Dermal: Flushing, diaphoresis, cyanosis
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, salivation, diarrhoea, abdominal cramping, tenesmus, faecal incontinence
Genitourinary: Frequency, urgency, incontinence

Nicotinic Manifestations
Cardiovascular:
Tachydysrhytmias, hypertension Striated muscle: Fasciculations, twitching, cramping, weakness, paralysis

Central Nervous System Anxiety, restlessness, depression, confusion, ataxia, tremors, convulsions, coma, areflexia, respiratory depression
*Parasympathetic nervous system manifestations (DUMB ${ }^{3}$ ELS Diarrhoea, Urination, Miosis, (Bradycardia, Bronchoconstriction, Bronchorrhea) Emesis, Lacrimation, Salivation)
- Monitor, support ABCs - The great majority of deaths due to nerve agents occur secondary to respiratory failure. This is due to bronchospasm, bronchorrhoea, paralysis of the muscles of respiration, and central apnoea. Consider inserting an advanced airway or nursing in recovery position for airway protection. DO NOT USE SUCCINYLCHOLINE FOR RSI.
- Check vital signs (BP, PR, RR, SPO2, T ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, RBS). Start Oxygen IF SPO2 < 94\%. If abnormal vital signs, START ATROPINE! (see indications below).
- Send samples for FBC, UEC, LFTs, VBG, toxicology. Correct any electrolyte imbalances (see 32: Electrolyte Abnormalities Algorithm)
- Perform brief, targeted history, physical exam
- DO NOT PERFORM GASTRIC LAVAGE.
- DO NOT GIVE ACTIVATED CHARCOAL unless the patient has co-ingested other poisons (see 39. Poisoning for indications and contraindications for activated charcoal)

\section*{GIVE IV ATROPINE}
( $\mathbf{2 ~ m g ~ I V ~ f o r ~ a d u l t s ~ o r ~} \mathbf{0 . 0 2 ~ m g} / \mathbf{k g}$ IV for children EZZdfulit every $\mathbf{5}$ minutes)
Indications for Atropine treatment (Miosis alone is NOT an indication for atropine administration)

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Symptoms & Severity \\
\hline Rhinorrhoea, lacrimation, or mild dyspnoea & Mild \\
\hline Inability to ambulate, dyspnoea, vomiting, fasciculations, weakness & Moderate \\
\hline Convulsions ${ }^{\dagger}$, coma, respiratory insufficiency & Severe \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
* Tachycardia can occur in organophosphate poisoning due to stimulation of the sympathetic ganglia as well as respiratory distress and hypoxia. Tachycardia is NOT a contraindication to atropine administration.
Atropine doses should be doubled every 5 minutes until the therapeutic endpoint (Atropinisation) is reached i.e. until pulmonary secretions are dried [reflected by improved oxygenation] and ease of breathing [or ease of ventilation]), a pulse rate $\mathbf{> 8 0}$ beats per minute and systolic blood pressure $\mathbf{> 8 0 m m H g}$. Start atropine infusion when atropinisation achieved $\mathbf{- 0 . 0 5 m g} / \mathbf{k g} / \mathbf{h o u r}$. E.g. for a $\mathbf{7 0 k g}$ patient give $\mathbf{3 . 5 ~ m g}$ of atropine per hour as an infusion. Put 10 mg of atropine in 200 mLs of fluid run at $40-80 \mathrm{mLs}$ per hour ( $2-4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{hr}$ ) depending on response.
Precautions - Excessive doses of atropine can result in deleterious effects including delirium, agitation, and tachycardia and hypertension. Atropine will likely NOT improve miosis or skeletal muscle paralysis (nicotinic receptors); therefore, reversal of these effects is not a therapeutic endpoint. Attempting to reverse these findings with atropine can result in administration of excessive doses of atropine.

\section*{${ }^{\dagger}$ Seizure control}
(Midazolam $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ or Diazepam $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ )
Benzodiazepines are needed to prevent or treat nerve agent-induced seizures in moderate to severe toxicity because anticholinergic treatment is increasingly less effective from 5-40 minutes post exposure. Phenytoin does NOT affect GABA-A and has been found to be ineffective in controlling organophosphate -induced seizures. Benzodiazepines should be infused rapidly to unresponsive patients who have been exposed to organophosphates, because such patients may have nonconvulsive seizures due to the onset of paralysis.

\section*{Pralidoxime (2-PAM)}

> WHO recommendation is $\mathbf{> 3 0 - m g} / \mathbf{k g}$ IV/IM bolus followed by $\boldsymbol{>} \mathbf{8 - m g} / \mathbf{k g} /$ hour IV infusion

(Adults: 2 g IM or slow IV infusion over 15 to 30 minutes followed by a $500-\mathrm{mg} /$ hour infusion)
Neither atropine nor benzodiazepines will alleviate symptoms affecting the nicotinic system (CNS, NMJ, autonomic ganglia). 2-PAM should be given to any patient exposed to an organophosphate nerve agent who is showing any systemic toxicity especially fasciculations or weakness. The initial dose should be given as quickly as possible. Caution: Delivering 2-PAM more rapidly than recommended can result in hypertension. This is usually self-limited, but in extreme cases, phentolamine 5 mg IV may be effective. Laryngospasm and rigidity can also occur with rapid IV administration.

\section*{Disposition}
- Consult a Physician
- Continue atropine infusion until the therapeutic endpoint (Atropinisation) is reached i.e. until pulmonary secretions are dried [reflected by improved oxygenation] and ease of breathing [or ease of ventilation]).
- Admit ALL symptomatic patients. Severe poising should be admitted to an ICU

\section*{41. Alcohol (Methanol) Poisoning Algorithm}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

\begin{tabular}{|l|}
\hline Suspected Methanol Poisoning \\
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Methanol toxicity commonly affects the neurological, ophthalmological, and gastrointestinal systems \\
a) Within the first 24 hours, central nervous system (CNS) depression, euphoria, and inebriation occur. \\
b) This is followed by a latent period (between 6 and 30 hours) during which methanol is metabolize to formic acid, which ultimately leads to systemic effects. \\
c) Ophthalmologic symptoms can range from blurry vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia to blindness or the classic "snowstorm" vision. A complaint of blurred vision with a relatively cleat sensorium should strongly suggest the diagnosis of methanol poisoning. Initially, visual fields are not affected, and patients may have a central scotoma (blind spot). If unrecognized and not appropriately treated, these changes will result in; \\
- permanent blindness, \\
- absent papillary response, and \\
- permanent optic nerve atrophy. \\
d) Methanol toxicity causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain with or without evidence of pancreatitis and/or hepatotoxicity. \\
In severe cases, the odour of formaldehyde may be present on the breath or in the urine. Untreated methanol poisoning is associated with a rate of death of $\mathbf{2 8}$ \% and a rate of visual deficits or blindness of $\mathbf{3 0 \%}$ in survivors.

- If Hypoglycaemic (RBS < $3.3 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{L}$ ), give $50 \mathrm{mls} 50 \%$ dextrose IV (see 29. Hypoglycaemia Algorithm). Also, give 100 mg Thiamine IV followed by 100 mg PO BD for 6 weeks. \\
- Send samples for FBC, UEC, LFTs, Lipase, VBG, toxicology. Correct any electrolyte imbalances (see 32: Electrolyte Abnormalities Algorithm) \\
- Start IV Fluids - If hypotensive give repeated NS/RL boluses at $\mathbf{2 0 m l} \boldsymbol{/} \mathbf{k g}$ until perfusion is restored (MAP > 65) and dehydration is corrected. More rapid administration and large amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients. When stable, start $\mathbf{5 \%}$ dextrose saline infusion at $\mathbf{3 L} / \mathbf{2 4 ~ h r s}$ \\
- Perform brief, targeted history, physical exam \\
-DO NOT PERFORM GASTRIC LAVAGE. If the patient's airway is protected, anecdotal evidence supports the use of gastric aspiration if large amounts of alcohol have been ingested and the patient can be treated very quickly (within an hour) after the ingestion. \\

\section*{Investigations: \\ Full Blood Count (FBC);}
- Most patients with HbSS disease have a baseline haemoglobin level of 6 to $9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ and tolerate this level of anaemia well because of physiologic adaptations.
- WBC is NOT a particularly sensitive nor specific indicator for infection

Reticulocyte count - normally elevated ( $>5 \%$ ). Levels < 5\% are a serious cause for concern as it signifies bone marrow hypo activity. In patients with worsened scleral icterus, back pain, fever, or signs that suggest haemolysis, additional tests would include; LFTs and LDH
Renal function tests
Blood typing and screening is necessary if haemoglobin has dropped $>1 \mathbf{~ m g} / \mathbf{d L}$ below baseline or if there is concern that the patient may need a transfusion. Indications for blood transfusion; Severe anaemia - $\downarrow \mathbf{H b} \boldsymbol{>} \mathbf{~ 2 g} / \mathbf{d L}$ below steady state or $\boldsymbol{<} \mathbf{6 g} / \mathbf{d L}$; Acute chest syndrome; Priapism; CVA in children; Before surgery

\section*{45. Procedural Sedation and Analgesia (PSA)}

\section*{SEE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROCEDURAL SEDATION AND ANALGESIA PHYSICIAN CHECKLIST}

Procedural sedation is the technique of administering sedatives or dissociative agents with or without analgesics to induce a state that allows the patient to tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining cardiorespiratory function.

Potential indications for procedural in the ED: fracture reduction, joint reduction, incision and drainage, chest tube placement, electro cardioversion, upper endoscopy (with a gastroenterologist), foreign body removal, burn or wound debridement

Patient selection: A pre-procedural history and physical exam, as documented in the ED record, should reflect a focused evaluation of the airway, cardiovascular status, pulmonary status, allergies, and history of prior adverse reactions to sedatives or anaesthetics. PSA may not be ideal for patients with significant chronic morbidities e.g. sleep apnoea, COPD, low baseline oxygen saturations or blood pressure, or anatomic features that would make bag valve mask (BVM) ventilation or maintaining an airway difficult.

Preparation: Monitoring equipment (continuous telemetry, pulse oximetry, BP; consider continuous end tidal CO2 monitoring), peripheral IV, Ringer's Lactate/Hartmann's Solution, medications for PSA, naloxone (if opiates are given), equipment for procedure (e.g. scalpel), team ( minimum one practitioner for sedation, one for procedure ONE OF THEM MUST BE PROFICIENT IN AIRWAY MANAGEMENT), airway equipment (oxygen source, nasal cannula/face mask, BVM, suction), rescue airway equipment (endotracheal tube, laryngoscope, LMA, nasal trumpet)

\hline Fentanyl & $0.5-3 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV over $3-5 \mathrm{mins}$ & Analgesic & Immediate onset, Peak effect $2-3 \mathrm{mins}$ & 30-45mins & Chest wall rigidity and respiratory depression may occur with rapid IV administration & Fentanyl is preferred for a rapid onset of analgesia in acutely distressed patients. \\
\hline Midazolam & 0.05 $0.15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ IV & Sedative & Onset 3-5 mins; Peak effect 15-30 mins & 20-60mins & Respiratory depression, hypotension & Midazolam has a rapid onset and short duration and is classed as an ultra-short acting benzodiazepine and is 2 to 3 times more potent than diazepam, so can produce significant respiratory depression. Blood pressure decreases, and heart rate increases as compensation for a decreased SVR, although CO remains unchanged. \\

\section*{Oxygen Prescription}

This clinical guideline is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this guideline does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

Oxygen is a treatment for hypoxaemia, not breathlessness. Oxygen has not been proven to have any consistent effect on the sensation of breathlessness in non-hypoxemic patients.

\section*{Table 1 Critical illness requiring high levels of supplemental oxygen}

The initial oxygen therapy is a reservoir mask at $15 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ pending the availability of reliable oximetry readings.
For patients with spontaneous circulation and a reliable oximetry reading, it may quickly become possible to reduce the oxygen dose while maintaining a target saturation range of $94-96 \%$.
If oximetry is unavailable, continue to use a reservoir mask until definitive treatment is available.
Patients with COPD and other risk factors for hypercapnia who develop critical illness should have the same initial target saturations as other critically ill patients pending the results of blood gas results after which these patients may need controlled oxygen therapy with target range $88-92 \%$ or supported ventilation if there is severe hypoxaemia and/or hypercapnia with respiratory acidosis.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

If oximetry is not available, give oxygen as above until oximetry or blood gas results are available. Change to reservoir mask if the desired saturation range cannot be maintained with nasal cannulae or simple face mask (and ensure that the patient is assessed by senior medical staff).

\section*{Equipment used to deliver emergency oxygen therapy;}
- Humidification is not required for the delivery of low-flow oxygen or for the short-term use of high-flow oxygen. It is not therefore required in prehospital care. Pending the results of clinical trials, it is reasonable to use humidified oxygen for patients who require high-flow oxygen systems for $>24 \mathrm{~h}$ or who report upper airway discomfort due to dryness.
- In the emergency situation humidified oxygen use can be confined to patients with tracheostomy or an artificial airway, although these patients can be managed without humidification for short periods of time (e.g., ambulance journeys).
- Humidification may also be of benefit to patients with viscous secretions causing difficulty with expectoration. This benefit can be achieved using nebulised normal saline.
- Bubble bottles should not be used because there is no evidence of clinically significant benefit but there is a risk of infection.

\section*{Acid-Base Disorders Worksheet}

This clinical pathway is intended to supplement, rather than substitute for, professional judgment and may be changed depending upon a patient's individual needs. Failure to comply with this pathway does not represent a breach of the standard of care.

Step \#1: Gather the necessary data ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}, \mathrm{pH}, \mathrm{PCO}_{2}$ )

\hline & & \\
\hline & respiratory & metabolic \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Step \#4: Look for disorders revealed by failures of compensation}
- If primary process is metabolic alkalosis $\rightarrow \mathrm{pCO}_{2}$ should be $>40$ but $<55^{*}$
*There are several metabolic alkalosis PCO2 prediction formulas, but fraught with clinical inaccuracy/unreliability
- If primary process is metabolic acidosis $\rightarrow$ calculate predicted $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}=\left(1.5 \times \mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}\right)+8 \pm 2$

In either case above:
- If actual $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$ is too high $\rightarrow$ there is an additional respiratory acidosis
- If actual $\mathrm{pCO}_{2}$ is too low $\rightarrow$ there is an additional respiratory alkalosis
- If primary process is respiratory $\rightarrow$ skip to Steps 5 \& 6 (where further metabolic disorders revealed)

Additional disorder: respiratory respiratory acidosis alkalosis
-or-
no additional disorder

Step \#5: Check if the patient has a significant Anion Gap ( $\mathbf{> 1 2 - 1 8}$ ) ( $\mathrm{AG}=\mathrm{Na}^{+}-\mathrm{Cl}^{-}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}{ }^{-}$) If AG is significantly elevated $\rightarrow$ the patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis in addition to (or in confirmation of) whatever Steps 2-4 yielded.
