## DEFINITION OF TERMS
- Critical- Denoting or of the nature of crisis or having the potential to become disastrous, at a point of crisis, or a condition where death is eminent or possible.
- Critical care- Involves taking care of patients with severe and life threatening illness. It is the specialized care of patients whose conditions require comprehensive care.
- Critical illness- This is a condition that is life threatening in nature, always associated with high mortality and morbidity rate.
- Coma - This is a state of unconsciousness in which a person, cannot be awakened, fails to respond normally to a painful stimuli, light or sound.

Critical care nursing-
- Nursing care of patient whose health is in danger or in crisis, so as to save their life or prevent complications.
- It is the field of Nursing whose focus is on the utmost care of the critically ill or unstable patient.
Critical care Nurses.
These are comprehensively trained community health nurses who have specialized to meet the needs of the critically ill patients who are admitted in acute rooms, emergency departments, intensive care units and operating theatres.

## TYPES OF CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS

## Definition of critically ill patient
- These are patients who are at high risk for actual or potential life threatening health problems.

- Unconsciousness
  - This is when a person is unable to respond to people and activities.
  - This is often called coma or being in comatose state.
  - Fainting due to a drop in the blood pressure and a decrease of the oxygen supply to the brain is a temporary loss of consciousness.

Loss of consciousness - This may occur as a result of traumatic brain injury, brain hypoxia, severe poisoning with drugs that depress the activity of the nervous system e.g. Alcohol, other hypnotic drugs or the sedative drugs and severe fatigue.

   - This is due to aspiration of vomitus into the lungs.

Management
- Position in semi fowlers, suck secretion, give secretion drying drugs, Give prophylactic antibiotics.
2. U.T.I
   - This is due to retention of urine in bladder during micturition.

Management.
- Give prophylactic antibiotics, Catheterize the patient, Do catheter care (Maintain aseptic technique when inserting a catheter, clean the catheter every morning to prevent ascending infection, Maintain input and output chart, check smell and color of urine.

## Cont....3. Muscle dystrophy
- This is due to loss of muscle strength and tone due to lack of motion and exercises, reduced neuromuscular activity to many parts of the body.
Management.
- Instruct patient to perform small exercise, Inform the physiotherapist to do exercises on the daily basis.
4. D.V.T (Deep venous thrombosis)
- This is due to prolonged immobility and this brings about stasis of blood causing embolization in the Deep veins of the calf muscles, pelvic. This embolus lodges into the walls of the pulmonary artery producing symptoms such as chest pains, cough, hemoptysis, restlessness etc.
- At the site of the formation of the emboli, the area looks shiny, warm, tender and swollen due to inflammation of the vein.

Management
- Elevate the affected limb, Give prophylactic anticoagulant drugs such as Heparin.
- Instruct patient to wear graduated stockings.
- Give analgesics to relieve pain.
- Perform exercises.
- Administer i.v fluids to prevent stasis of blood, monitor vital signs 4 hourly.

- This is the breakdown of the skin due to prolonged stay in bed or poor nursing care.

## Causes of Bed sores
1. Wetting of beddings by the unconscious patient
2. Prolonged stay in bed without turning.
3. Obesity.
4. Very sick patients.

## Areas prone to pressure sores
- Elbow, sacrum, foot eminences, shoulders and knees.

## Management of pressure areas
- Apply powder or zinc oxide to area prone to pressure sores.
- Massage the area to promote circulation.
- Do 2 hrly turning and maintain record of the turning chart.
- Straighten the linen on bed to avoid effects on the pressure areas.
- Catheterize the patient to avoid wetting the bed which causes breaking of the skin.
- Do exercises for the patient to avoid stasis of blood.

## 6. Contractures.
- This is the failure of the musculoskeletal system to attain normal flexion and extension due to immobility and unconsciousness and lack of exercises.
- The most affected areas of the body include upper and lower limbs joints.

## Management
- Involve the physiotherapist in the care of the patient.
- Do 2 hourly turning to promote circulation.

- This is a key principle of managing the unconscious patient
- Classify the pain
- For mild pain- give NSAIDs
- For severe pain- give OPIOID analgesics (IV morphine)
