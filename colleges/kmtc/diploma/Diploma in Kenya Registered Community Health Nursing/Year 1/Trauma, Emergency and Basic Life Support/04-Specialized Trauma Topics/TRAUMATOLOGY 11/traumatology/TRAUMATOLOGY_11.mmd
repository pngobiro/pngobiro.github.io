- Fractures may be open/closed/displaced/not displaced

\section*{Causes:}
- direct injury to the foot(stepping on /kicking foot/ dropping something on foot or falling on foot
- Twisting of foot on the ankle joint can cause fractures on base of $5^{\text {th }}$ metatarsal
- Twisting of foot from landing from a jump( e.g. ballet dancers)

\section*{Causes of stress fractures}

\section*{Diagnosis}
- X rays
- CT scan
- MRI
- Ultrasound
-Bone scan

\section*{Treatment}
- Pain killers (NSAIDS)
- Ice for 10-30 minutes immediately after injury to reduce blood flow to the area. Not done directly to the skin as it causes an ice burn (use an ice park) and press gently onto the injured part
- Rest/elevate to reduce swelling
- Stop the causative activity by resting
- Immobilize with a below knee cast
- Surgery to realign moved bones/physiotherapy care

\section*{Prevention}

\section*{111. Injuries of the head and spine:}
-Vertebral bones injuries- injuries involve fractures/ dislocations
- Fractures include any break of the vertebrae
- A dislocation is when the vertebral bones do not line up correctly or are out of place
- A fracture /dislocation may cause damage to the spinal cord

\section*{Types of fractures / dislocations that cause spinal/head injury:}
- Compression fracture: occurs due to hyper flexion (front to back)
-It forces part of the spinal column forward and downward
- Burst fracture: a serious force of compression fracture where the bone is shattered from the injury
-bone fragments may pierce the spinal cord
-occurs due to downward or upward force along the spine

\section*{Cont.}
-Subluxation: weakening of vertebral joints by an abnormal movement of the bones
-It is a partial dislocation of vertebrae caused by injury of muscles/ligaments in the spine which may also cause a spinal cord injury
-Dislocation: caused by torn/badly stretched ligaments from an injury
-it causes too much movements of the vertebrae
-The vertebrae may lock over each other on one or both sides

\section*{Cont.}
-Traction or surgery reduction is needed for reduction
-use of a brace/halovest/surgery is used to fuse the vertebrae for alignment/line up
- Fracture dislocation: occurs when there is a fracture/a dislocation of the vertebrae
-It causes injury to the soft tissues/ligament injury
-It may also cause injury to the spinal cord

\section*{Dislocation of the inter -vertebral bones}
- Joints in the back part of vertebrae are weakened by an abnormal movement
- Dislocation of vertebrae occurs due to injury to the muscles/ligaments in the spine causing injury to he spinal cord
Causes;
- Car accidents
- Sports collisions/injuries
- falls

\section*{Treatment}

- Heating pads/hot paths later reduce tightness/spasms in the muscles of the lower back for free movement
- Pain relievers- NSAIDS (ibuprofen/advil/motrin/aspirin/ acetaminophen/naproxen
- Stay active- do a normal daily activity- extended bed rest is harmful

\section*{cont.}
- Gentle stretches/exercises helps one return to normal activity
- Complementary care- spinal manipulation, massage and acupuncture help relieve pain and discomfort while healing
- It should be done by a professional person with license

\section*{Surgical treatment}

(Assignment- discuss the complications)

\section*{Ligamentous tears}
