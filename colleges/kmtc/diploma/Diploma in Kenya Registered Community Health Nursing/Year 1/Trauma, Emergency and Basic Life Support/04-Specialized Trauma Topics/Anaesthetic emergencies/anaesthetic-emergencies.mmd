Dr. Massoun Taha Jasser

\section*{Lecture Objectives..}

\section*{Students at the end of the lecture will be able to:}
1. Learn a common approach to emergency medical problems encountered in intraoperative and postoperative period.
2. Study post-operative respiratory and hemodynamic problems and understand how to manage these problems.
3. Learn about the predisposing factors, differential diagnosis and management of PONV.
4. Understand the causes and treatments of post-operative agitation and delirium.
5. Learn about the causes of delayed emergence and know how to deal with this problem.
6. Learn about different approaches of post-Operative pain management

\section*{Anaesthetic emergencies in the operating theatre}
- Introduction
- Emergencies are not common but when they do occur they are often life threatening and require immediate action.
- Factors in the mnemonic COVER ABCD accounts for approximately $95 \%$ of critical incidents.
- Colour - saturation, central cyanosis;
- Oxygen - ensure adequate and correct delivery;
- Ventilation - e.g. breathing circuit, air entry, CO2 trace, vaporizer;
- Endotracheal tube - kinks, obstruction, endobronchial;
- Review monitors - correctly sited, checked, calibrated;
- Airway - failed intubation, laryngeal spasm, foreign body, aspiration;
- Breathing - difficult to ventilate, e.g. tube occlusion, bronchospasm, pneumothorax, aspiration, lack of neuromuscular blocking drug (NMBD), pulmonary oedema;
- Circulation - hypotension: excess anaesthetic agent, dysrhythmia, myocardial ischaemia/MI, hypovolaemia from any cause (e.g. dehydration, bleeding), sepsis, tension pneumothorax, sympathetic block (e.g. spinal or epidural anaesthetic);
- Drugs - anaphylaxis, wrong drug/dose/route;
- Embolism - air/fat/cement/amniotic fluid;
- Others - related to CVP line (pneumothorax [see Chapter 25]/cardiac tamponade); awareness; endocrine and metabolic (MH, phaeochromocytoma).

\section*{Aspiration}

Definition:- inhalation of gastric contents can occur in patients who do not have fully functional upper airway reflexes. Impaired protective airway reflexes.

\section*{Signs}
- Gastric contents visible within breathing circuit/airway adjunct (e.g. LMA)
- $\llbracket \mathrm{SaO}_{2}$
- Wheeze/stridor
- Tachycardia
- Airway pressure
- Regurgitation of gastric contents can happen in any patient who does not have fully functioning upper airway protective reflexes Those at risk include:
- Inadequate period of preoperative starvation
- Delayed gastric emptying (e.g. opiates, pain, bowel obstruction, pregnancy at term; see Figure 6.2)
- Insufficient/lack of cricoid pressure at induction of anaesthesia early extubation in an at-risk patient in supine postion.

\section*{Treatment}
- 100\% oxygen
- Call for help
- $30 \%$ Head-down position to prevent/limit aspiration
- Oropharyngeal suction
- Tracheal intubation if needed, including tracheal suctioning
- Postoperatively: physiotherapy, oxygen.

Some advocate antibiotics and steroids

\section*{Air embolism}

Definition:- air embolism results from inadvertent introduction of air into the circulation, usually via the venous system.

Causes:
- Neurosurgery (dural sinuses are non-collapsible)
- Caesarean section (e.g. if exposed veins are raised above level of heart)
- Central line insertion/removal
- Epidural catheter placement
- (if loss of resistance to air is used)
- Entrainment through an intravenous line (especially if pressure-assisted)
- Situations where high pressure
- gas is used (laparoscopy)

\section*{Signs:}
- |HR
- BP
- $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}$
- ETCO2 (acute due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch)
- Murmur (millwheel, due to air circulating around the cardiac champers)

\section*{Treatment:}
-100\% Oxygen
- Airway, breathing, circulation and call for help
- Flood surgical site with saline
- Position patient in Trendelenburg/left lateral decubitus position
- Consider inserting a central venous catheter to aspirate gas
- Consider hyperbaric chamber if indicated.

\section*{Laryngospasm}

Definition:- is the complete or partial adduction of the vocal cords, resulting in a variable degree of airway obstruction.

\section*{Causes:}
- Airway manipulation
- Blood/secretions in oropharynx
- Patient movement
- Surgical stimulus
- Failure to deliver anaesthetic agent

\section*{Signs}
- Partial/complete airway obstruction
- Paradoxical respiratory effort in a spontaneously breathing patient (abdominal/ chest see-saw movements as respiratory effort attempts to overcome the obstruction).

\section*{Treatment}

Some or all might be needed:
- Positive pressure ventilation with high flow oxygen (e.g. CPAP or IPPV)
- Deepening of anaesthesia (e.g. i.v. propofol)
- Suxamethonium with or without tracheal intubation - causes rapid muscle relaxation and ceases vocal cord opposition .

\section*{Complications}
- $\| \mathrm{SaO}_{2}$
- Aspiration
- Bradycardia (especially in children)
- Pulmonary oedema

\section*{Failed intubation (reproduced from the Difficult Airway Society, with permission)}
1. Assess the likelihood and clinical impact of basic management problems:
- Difficulty with patient cooperation or consent
- Difficult mask ventilation
- Difficult supraglottic airway placement
- Difficult laryngoscopy
- Difficult intubation
- Difficult surgical airway access

\section*{Call for help}
2. Actively pursue opportunities to deliver supplemental oxygen throughout the process of difficult airway management.
3. Consider the relative merits and feasibility of basic management choices:
- Awake intubation vs. intubation after induction of general anesthesia
- Non-invasive technique vs. invasive techniques for the initial approach to intubation
- Video-assisted laryngoscopy as an initial approach to intubation
-Preservation vs. ablation of spontaneous ventilation

\section*{Status asthmaticus}
- This is a severe acute exacerbation of asthma refractory to conventional $\beta_{2}$ agonist therapy and is a medical emergency.
- Signs:-
-tachypnoea;
- use of accessory respiratory muscles (e.g. abdominal, sternocleidomastoid),
and intercostal and subcostal recession;
- wheeze might be minimal or absent;
- tachycardia;
- pulsus paradoxus \gg mmHg (a reduction in blood pressure on
inspiration);
- sweating;
- tiring;
- confusion.
- Treatment
- give supplemental oxygen to maintain SaO294-98\%;
- $\beta 2$ agonist (either salbutamol or terbutaline) via O 2 driven nebulizer;
- continuous nebulization can be used if there is a poor initial response;
- intravenous $\beta 2$ agonists should only be used when the inhaled route
is unreliable;
- steroids - either oral prednisolone or i.v. hydrocortisone;
- nebulized ipratropium (anticholinergic);
- consider i.v. magnesium sulphate when life-threatening or poor initial response to treatment; aminophylline might also be considered
in this situation.

\section*{Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)}

The role of the anaesthetist is not limited to theatres. There may be a number of postoperative responsibilities to undertake, both in the recovery room and on the surgical ward.

After receiving anesthesia for a surgery or procedure a patient is sent to the PACU to recover and wake up .

The PACU is a critical care unit where the patient's vital signs are closely observed ,pain management begins, and fluids are given .

The nursing staff is skilled in recognizing and managing problems in patients after receiving anesthesia .

The PACU is under the direction of the Department of Anesthesiology.

\section*{PACU}
