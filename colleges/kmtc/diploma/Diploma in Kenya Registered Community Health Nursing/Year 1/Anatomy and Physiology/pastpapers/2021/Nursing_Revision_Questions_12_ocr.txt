\section*{AnatomyandPhysiology:}
1. State2componentsofthecentralnervoussystems.

The central nervous system consists of 1. The Brain 2. The spinal cord
2. Explainthecompositionoftheperipheralnervoussystem.

The peripheral nervous system refers to parts of the nervous system outside the brain and spinal cord. It includes the cranial nerves, spinal nerves and their roots and branches, peripheral nerves, and neuromuscular junctions
3. State4compositionsofplasma.

Plasma contains 1. Minerals and respiratory gases 2. Antibodies 3. Coagulant factors 4. Fibrinogen 5. Albumin
4. State6factorsthataffectheartrate.
1. The terrain - a walk uphill increases the heart rate due to higher oxygen demand to compensate the much used oxygen. A walk downhill does the vice versa
2. Temperature: an increase in body temperature causes the body to sense a thermal stress hence an increase in heart rate to supply blood more superficially and rapidly to your skin to dissipate heat loss. Similarly decrease in body temperature increases blood supply to warm you.
3. Dehydration: as one becomes increasingly dehydrated, their blood becomes thicker due to accumulation of waste products. This causes the heart rate to increase in order to maintain the cardiac output volume.
4. Diminishing glycogen: The body stores energy in tissues in form of ATP and glucose. A reduction in the optimum levels causes the HR to increase in order to supply the insufficient glycogen present in the blood to the rest of the body systems.
5. Emotions and anxiety: our body natural response to emotions like stress is to produce stress hormones that include cortisol and adrenaline which causes our heart to beat more rapidly and blood vessels to narrow and help blood reach the central parts. In turn, they also increase blood pressure and blood sugar.
6. Medication: Some medication when taken can either increase or decrease the heart rate due to impairment of the normal electrical signals in your heart and cause an increased/faster heart rate. (Tachycardia) causing dizziness or lightheaded.
5. Statethreeprocessesinvolvedinthe formationofurine.

There are three main steps of urine formation: glomerular filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.
6. State4factorswhichaffectcardiacoutput.
1. Heart volume
2. Contractility of the ventricles
3. Gender.
4. Fitness level
5. Duration of contraction
7. Explain3 functionsofthecerebralcortex.

The cerebral cortex is the largest covering of the brain and is wrinkled to increase the surface area for the habitation of as many neurons as possible. It's complex function is mostly in the subdivisions of the lobes namely:
1. The frontal lobe for memory, speech recognition and emotions etc.
2. The parietal lobes for integration of body sensory information.
3. Temporal lobe for integration of memory, emotions forming speech etc.
4. Occipital lobe for integration of visual effects and color recognition
8. Explain4typesofbones,givinganexample ineachtype.

The four principal types of bones are:
1. Longbonese.g, thigh, leg, arm and forearm,
2. Short Bones e.g bones of the wrist and ankle,
3. Flat bones e.g the cranium bones.
4. Irregular bones e.g the vertebrate and the skull.

2. Supports $97 \%$ of the weight to the brain in the cranium
3. Carries chemical signals like hormones
4. Helps in nourishment of the brain.
10. Statethefunctionsofreticularformation.

The reticular layer formation of the skin is made up of collagen fibers that are arranged in parallel, making it dense hence (i) Strengthening the skin to provide its structure and elasticity. (ii) It also functions to support other components of the skin including the hair follicle, blood vessels and sweat glands among others.

(a) Growing long bone
(b) Mature long bone

Endochondral ossification follows five steps. (a) Mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes that produce a cartilage model of the future bony skeleton. (b) Blood vessels on the edge of the cartilage model bring osteoblasts that deposit a bony collar. (c) Capillaries penetrate cartilage and deposit bone inside cartilage model, forming primary ossification center. (d) Cartilage and chondrocytes continue to grow at ends of the bone while medullary cavity expands and remodels. (e) Secondary ossification centers develop after birth. (f) Hyaline cartilage remains at epiphyseal (growth) plate and at joint surface as articular cartilage.
12. Explainthe3typesofmusclesgivingspecificexamples.
1. Skeletal muscles - these are muscles attached to the bones, controlled by a portion of peripheral NS. (they are voluntarily controlled
2. Smooth muscles - muscles found in the hollow spaces of blood vessels, Gastrointestinal tracts, small intestines etc. they are autonomic ( Involuntarily controlled)
3. Cardiac muscles - these are the muscles of the heart and are also controlled by autonomic NS.
13. State3 layersoftissuecoveringthewallsof arteriesandarterioles.
1. Tunica intima - inner most
2. Tunica media - middle layer
3. Tunica externa - the outer layer

The lumen is the blood containing space. Capillaries have only one layer.
14. State2mechanismswhichcontrolthebloodpressure.

The following mechanisms are used in blood pressure regulation.
1. Variety of cardiovascular control systems which manage the cardiac output in in 3 ways:
i. Stimulating the cardiac output by increasing the heart rate through sympathetic cardiac nerves
ii. Inhibition of cardiac output by decreasing the heart rate through parasympathetic nerve impulses
iii. Vasomotor center regulates blood vessel diameter through sympathetic motor neurons Nb : the cardiac center receives the information through the baroreceptors located in the carotid sinus, aortic arch and the right atrium.
Also through chemoreceptors which detect the co2 and o2 concentration at carotid sinus and aortic arch.
2. Hormonal regulation by the kidney through regulation of the blood volumes. (Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System, RAAS)
In response to risen blood pressure, juxtag aerular segrets renin into the blood system. Renin converts

The process of urine formation in kidneys include the following steps:
(i) Glomerular filtration - Urine formation begins when the blood is filtered by the glomerulus and enters the

Bowman's capsule and the glomerular filtrate is formed. The afferent arteriole entering the glomerulus is wider than the efferent arteriole in diameter. This increases the blood pressure within the glomerulus helps in the filtration.

Glomerular filtrate is formed of all blood constituents except corpuscles and plasma proteins.
(ii) Tubular reabsorption - When the glomerular filtrate comes to the proximal tubule then the essential nutrients are reabsorbed. Glucose, amino acids, water, ions like sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, calcium are reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate. When the filtrate finally comes to the collecting duct ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) acts and reabsorbs the excess water and decreases the urine volume.
(iii) Tubular secretion - When the glomerular filtrate is in the proximal tubule cretinine, uric acid are secreted in it. When the filtrate goes to the distal part urea, potasium ion and some hydrogen ions are secreted in it.

d. Describe thenursingmanagementofmr.Mawetillfully conscious.

Basic Ventilator Support/Airway Care -
- This is airway control through positioning.
- The recovery position is best as it encourages drainage of secretions from the oral cavity.

Monitoring of Respiration
- This is meant to enable early detection of any changes that may indicate complication, for example, increase in respiration rate, abnormal respiration sounds, etc.
Ensuring Adequate Circulation
- This is achieved through maintaining adequate blood volume by administering enough fluids through the intravenous route to supplement the nasal gastric tube feeding
Nutritional Management
- Can be achieved through insertion of a nasal gastric tube and using it for feeding.

Skin Integrity
- This is maintained through proper skin hygiene, which includes
- Daily bathing,
- Two (2)-hourly turning of the patient and
- Keeping the patient's bed linen clean and dry.

Elimination
- Adequate fluid intake ensures that kidney function is maintained.
- Some patients may require catheterization to keep them dry and for proper monitoring of urine production.
Psychosocial Needs
- This includes addressing the patient by their name at all times, while providing care.
- It is important to assume that the patient can hear and, therefore, you should inform the patient of any intended action that you intend to perform on them.
General Monitoring of the Vital Signs
- This must be done to evaluate the patient's progress and identify early any impending complication

The patient should be informed on the need for the operation then explained to the procedure, benefits, possible risks, complications, possible outcome and be given a consent form to sign.
- Patient Assessment

Aimed at identifying disorders that may complicate surgery
A comprehensive history should be obtained and a physical (head to toe) examination done. In addition, the U/E/Cs samples obtained for lab tests and results obtained on time. Also take the vitals as required.
- Patient Education

Aims to prepare the patient on what is expected of him/her before and after surgery, which helps promote quick recovery and prevent complications.
It involves explaining the procedure and what is expected, the breathing techniques to be used.
- Physical and Psychological Preparation

Physical prep. Includes skin care, shaving of the surgical area if needed, bathing. Psychological preparation is meant to allay anxiety and promote coping depending on the outcome of the surgery The patient should be counseled and reassured especially those receiving operations such as amputation, hysterectomy or mastectomy.
- Pre - Operative Drugs

Any drug prescribed should be given 45-75 minutes before the patient is taken to the theatre e.g. atropine
- Rest and Sleep

9. Explainthe physiologicalchanges thattakeplaceinthe breastofapregnantwoman.

During the first trimester,
Your veins on your breasts become larger, bluer, and more visible. Your breasts will also continue to grow in size. They may feel tender and swollen, although these symptoms often dissipate within the first few weeks of pregnancy as your body adjusts to the hormonal.
During the Second trimester,
During the second trimester, estrogen levels continue to rise. Your breasts will continue feeling heavy or full as the milk ducts develop. Your breasts will also start to produce colostrum during the first few weeks of the second trimester.
During the Third trimester,
As your body continues to get ready to give birth, your breasts will become even heavier and denser. Your nipples will become larger and more pronounced. They may also change shape. Your nipples and areola may continue to darken significantly.As the skin on your breasts stretches to accommodate their growing size, you may experience itching or dryness. If so, using a gentle moisturizer will help. You may also develop stretch marks.

The mechanisms of labour, also known as the cardinal movements, involve changes in the position of the foetus's head during its passage in labour. These are described in relation to a vertex presentation. The cardinal movements are described as the following 7 discrete sequences:
1. Engagement
2. Descent
3. Flexion
4. Internal rotation
5. Extension
6. Restitution and external rotation
7. Expulsion

14. Outline theprocessofanormalpeuperium.

\section*{Uterus}

Weighs approximately 1000 g in pregnancy. In the 6 weeks following delivery, the uterus recedes to a weight of $50-100 \mathrm{~g}$.

\section*{Cervix}

The cervix also begins to rapidly revert to a nonpregnant state, but it never returns to the nulliparous state. By the end of the first week, the external os closes such that a finger cannot be easily introduced.

\section*{Vagina}

The vagina also regresses but it does not completely return to its prepregnantsize.lincreased vascularity and edemacauses the rugaeof the vagina begin to reappear.

\section*{Perineum}

The perineum has been stretched and traumatized during the process of labor and delivery. The swollen and engorged vulva rapidly resolves within 1-2 weeks.

\section*{Abdominal wall}

The abdominal wall remains soft and poorly toned for many weeks. The return to a prepregnant state depends greatly on maternal exercise.

\section*{Ovaries}

The resumption of normal function by the ovaries is highly variable and is greatly influenced by breastfeeding the infant. The woman who breastfeeds her infant has a longer period of amenorrhea(absence of menstruation) and anovulation (not releasing an egg) than the mother who chooses to use formula. Breasts
The changes to the breasts that prepare the body for breastfeeding occur throughout pregnancy. Lactogenesis, which is the development of the ability to secrete milk, occurs as early as 16 weeks gestation. The placenta supplies high levels of circulating progesterone which activates mature alveolar cells in the breast to secrete small amounts of milk.
15. State5temporarystructuresoffetalcirculation.
a. Umbilical veins - has a branch that joins the portal vein to supply the liver. Supplies oxygen and nutrients
b. Umbilical arteries - they return blood to the placenta as they branch off from the internal iliac artery
c. Ductus venosus- connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava. Carries partially deoxygenated blood
d. Ductus arteriosus-leads from the bifurcation of the pulmonary artery to the descending aorta
e. Foremen ovale- diverts blood from passing in the lungs for oxygenation but rather to enter inferior venacava

19. State4typesofjaundicenewbornsarelikelyto present.

Physiological jaundice- yellowing of the skin, or jaundice.
Breastfeeding jaundice is seen in breastfed babies during the first week of life. It is more likely to occur when babies do not nurse well or the mother's milk is slow to come, leading to dehydration

Breast milk jaundice may appear in some healthy, breastfed babies after day 7 of life. The problem may be due to how substances in the breast milk affect the breakdown of bilirubin in the liver.

- Problems with their uterus or cervix.
- Too little time (less than 18 months) between pregnancies.
- Vaginal bleeding or infections during pregnancy.
b. State6characteristicsofapreterm baby.

Small size, with a disproportionately large head. Sharper looking, less rounded features than a full-term baby's features, due to a lack of fat stores. Fine hair (lanugo) covering much of the body. Low body temperature, especially immediately after birth in the delivery room, due to a lack of stored body fat.
c. State5complicationsbabyJonesmaydevelopifpropernursinginterventionsarenotdone:

Some of the most common health conditions that affect premature babies are:
- Apnea of prematurity, or temporary pauses in breathing during sleep.
- Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or underdeveloped lungs.
- Intraventricular hemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain.
- Necrotizing enterocolitis, or inflammation of the intestines.
- Neonatal sepsis, or blood infection.
- Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or abnormal blood flow in the heart.
- Retinopathy of prematurity, or underdeveloped blood vessels in the eye.

Premature babies are also at a higher risk of developmental challenges. They may have health issues later in life, including:
- Cerebral palsy.
- Hearing and vision problems.
- Learning disabilities.
- Poor growth.

23. Explain5 injuriesthatmaybe foundinthe headof anewbornbaby.
1. Bone injuries

Bones may be broken (fractured) before or during delivery even when the delivery is normal.
2. Injuries to the skin and soft tissues

The new-born's skin may have minor injuries after delivery, especially areas that receive pressure during contractions or that first emerge from the birth canal during delivery
3. Perinatal asphyxia

Perinatal asphyxia is a decrease in blood flow to the baby's tissues or a decrease in oxygen in the baby's blood before, during, or just after delivery. Caused by
- Separation of the placenta from the uterus before delivery (placental abruption)
- Obstruction of umbilical cord blood flow
- Abnormal development of the foetus (for example, when there is a genetic abnormality)
- Severe infection in the foetus
- Exposure to certain drugs before birth
- Severe maternal haemorrhage
- Severe maternal illness
4. Nerve injuries may occur before or during delivery. These injuries usually cause weakness of the muscles controlled by the affected nerve. Nerve injuries may involve the
- Facial nerve: Lopsided facial expression
- Brachial plexus: Arm and/or hand weakness
- Phrenic nerve: Difficulty breathing
- Spinal cord (rare): Paralysis
5. Head injury is the most common birth-related injury.

Head moulding is not an injury. Moulding refers to the normal change in shape of the baby's head that results from pressure on the head during delivery.
6. Bleeding in and around the brain

Bleeding in and around the brain (intracranial haemorrhage) is caused by the rupture of blood vessels and may be caused by
- Birth injury
- Significant illness in the new-born that decreases delivery of blood or oxygen to the brain
- A blood clotting problem
24. State4typesofjaundice.

Pre-hepatic jaundice is caused by conditions that heighten your blood's rate of hemolysis. This is the process through which red blood cells are broken down, releasing hemoglobin and converting into bilirubin. Causes include Malaria, sickle cell anemiaetc
Hepatic jaundice happens when your liver tissue is scarred (known as cirrhosis), damaged, or dysfunctional. This makes it less effective at filtering out bilirubin from your blood. Causes include liver cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, liver hepatitis.
Post-hepatic, or obstructive jaundice, happens when bilirubin can't be drained properly into the bile ducts or digestive tract because of a blockage. Caused by gallstones, pancreatic cancer, bile duct cancer.
Neonatal jaundice is a common type of jaundice that happens to newborn babies.

Most babies are born with a lot of red blood cells, and because the liver isn't fully developed yet, bilirubin can't be processed quickly. As a result, your child may have jaundice symptoms a few days after they're born.
Types of neonatal jaundice include:
- Physiohis géarment is abaíabonph studocue liver isn't fully formed yet.
- Prematurity. This results from a baby being born too early and being unable to poop out bilirubin properly.
- Breastfeeding. Breast milk jaundice occurs from a baby having trouble breastfeeding or not getting enough breast milk.
- Incompatible blood type. This results from a baby and mother having different blood types, which can cause the mother to make antibodies that break down her baby's red blood cells.

29. Baby Junior, born at term with birth weight of 3.2 kg and score $9 / 1,10 / 10$ is diagnosed withjaundiceonthe seconddayof delivery.
a. Explain3causesofphysiologicaljaundice.

Physiologic jaundice is caused by a combination of
- Increased bilirubin production secondary to accelerated destruction of erythrocytes,
- Decreased excretory capacity secondary to low levels of ligandin in hepatocytes,
- Low activity of the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme
b. DescribethespecificmanagementofbabyJunioruntiljaundiceclears.
- Mild jaundice will usually resolve on its own as a baby's liver begins to mature. Frequent feedings (between 8 to 12 times a day) will help babies pass bilirubin through their bodies.
- More severe jaundice may require other treatments. Phototherapy is a common and highly effective method of treatment that uses light to break down bilirubin in your baby's body.
- In phototherapy, your baby will be placed on a special bed under a blue spectrum light while wearing only a diaper and special protective goggles. A fiber-optic blanket may also be placed underneath your baby.
- In very severe cases, an exchange transfusion may be necessary in which a baby receives small amounts of blood from a donor or a blood bank.
- This replaces the baby's damaged blood with healthy red blood cells. This also increases the baby's red blood cell count and reduces bilirubin levels.

ii) Explain the management of a mother who has just delivered and has been diagnosedwithamniotic fluidembolism.
Emergency treatments might include:
- Catheter placement. A thin, hollow tube placed into one of your arteries (arterial catheter) might be used to monitor your blood pressure. You might also have another tube placed into a vein in your chest (central venous catheter), which can be used to give fluids, medications or transfusions, as well as draw blood.
- Oxygen. You might need to have a breathing tube inserted into your airway to help you breathe.
- Medications. Your doctor might give you medications to improve and support your heart function. Other medications might be used to decrease the pressure caused by fluid going into your heart and lungs.
- Transfusions. If you have uncontrollable bleeding, you'll need transfusions of blood, blood products and replacement fluids.
If you have amniotic fluid embolism before delivering your baby, your doctor will treat you with the goal of safely delivering your baby as soon as possible. An emergency C-section might be needed.
35. Differentiatebetweenfetaldistressandmaternaldistress.

Fetal distress is a condition that the baby isn't coping with labour by not receiving enough oxygen through the placenta.

REVISIONQUESTIONSSEM1－EDITION1 2018

Theheartpossesses the propertyof auto rhythmicity，whichmeansitgeneratesits ownelectrical impulses and beats independently of nervous or hormonal control，i．e．it is not reliant onexternal mechanisms to initiate each heartbeat．However，it is supplied with both sympatheticand parasympathetic autonomic nerve fibres，which increase and decrease
respectively theintrinsic heart rate. In addition, the heart responds to a number of circulating hormones,includingadrenaline(epinephrine) andthyroxin.
Smallgroupsofspecializedneuromuscularcellsinthemyocardium initiateandconductimpulses,causingcoordinatedandsynchronized contractionoftheheartmuscle.

\section*{Sinoatrialnode (SAnode)}

This small mass of specialized cells lies in the wall of the right atrium near the opening of thesuperiorvenacava.
The sinoatrial cells generate these regular impulses because they are electrically unstable. Thisinstability leads them to discharge (depolarize) regularly, usually between 60 and 80 times aminute.
This depolarization is followed by recovery (depolarization), but almost immediately theirinstability leads them to discharge again, setting the heart rate. Because the SA node dischargesfaster than any other part of the heart, it normally sets the heart rate and is called thepacemakeroftheheart. Firingof theSAnodetriggersatrialcontraction.

\section*{Atrioventricularnode(AVnode)}

This small mass of neuromuscular tissue is situated in the wall of the atrial septum near theatrioventricular valves. Normally, the AV node merely transmits the electrical signals from theatria into the ventricles. There is a delay here; the electrical signal takes 0.1 of a second to passthrough into the ventricles. This allows the atria to finish contracting before the ventricles start.The AV node also has a secondary pacemaker function and takes over this role if there is aproblem with the SA node itself, or with the transmission of impulses from the atria. Its intrinsicfiringrate, however, is slowerthanthat setbytheSAnode(40-60 bpm).

\section*{Atrioventricularbundle(AVbundleorbundleofHis)}

This is a mass of specialisedfibres that originate from the AV node. The AV bundle crosses thefibrous ring that separates atria and ventricles then, at the upper end of the ventricular septum; it divides into right and left bundle branches. Within the ventricular myocardium the branchesbreak up into fine fibres, called the Purkinje fibres. The AV bundle, bundle branches and Purkinjefibrestransmitelectricalimpulses fromthe AV nodetothe apexofthemyocardiumwherethewaveofventricularcontractionbegins,thensweepsupwardsandout wards,pumpingbloodintothepulmonaryartery andtheaorta.

\section*{29. Explainthephysiologyofhearing.}

Every sound produces sound waves or vibrations in the air, which travel at about 332 meters persecond.
The auricle, because of its shape, collects and concentrates the waves and directs them alongthe auditory canal causing the tympanic membrane to vibrate. Tympanic membrane vibrationsare transmitted and amplified through the middle ear by movement of the ossicles. At theirmedial end the footplate of the stapes rocks to and fro in the oval window, setting up fluidwaves in the perilymph of the scalavestibuli. Some of the force of these waves is transmittedalong the length of the scalavestibuli and scala tympani, but most of the pressure is transmittedinto the cochlear duct. This causes a corresponding wave motion in the endolymph, resulting invibration of the basilar membrane and stimulation of the auditory receptors in the hair cells ofthe spiral organ. The nerve impulses generated pass to the brain in the cochlear (auditory)portionofthevestibulocochlearnerve(8thcranialnerve).Thefluidwaveisfinallyexpendedin to the middle ear by vibration of the membrane of the round window. The vestibulocochlearnerve transmits the impulses to the auditory nuclei in the medulla, where they synapse beforethey are conducted to the auditory area in the temporal lobe of the cerebrumBecause somefibres cross over in the medulla and others remain on the same side, the left and right auditoryareasof thecerebrumreceiveimpulsesfrombothears.

Pitch is determined by
frequenciesstimulate the basilar membrane at different places along its length, allowing discrimination ofpitch.
The volume depends on the magnitude of the sound waves and is measured in decibels $(\mathrm{dB})$.The greater the amplitude of the wave created in the endolymph, the greater is the stimulationoftheauditoryreceptorsinthe haircells inthespiralorgan, enablingperceptionofvolume.

\end{tabular}

The nephron consists of a tubule closed at one end, the other end opening into a collectingtubule. The closed or blind end is indented to form the cup-shaped glomerular capsule(Bowman's capsule), which almost completely encloses a network of tiny arterial capillaries, theglomerulus. These resemble a coiled tuft and are shown above. Continuing from the glomerularcapsule, theremainderofthenephronisabout3cmlongandis described inthree parts:
- Theproximalconvolutedtubule.
- Themedullaryloop(loopofHenle)
- Thedistalconvolutedtubule,leadingintoacollectingduct.

\section*{FILTRATION:}

This takes place through the semipermeable walls of the glomerulus and glomerular capsule. Water and other small molecules pass through, although some are reabsorbed later. Blood cells,plasma proteins and other large molecules are too large to filter through and therefore remainin the capillaries. The filtrate in the glomerulus is very similar in composition to plasma with theimportantexceptionsof plasma proteins andbloodcells.
Filtration takes place because there is a difference between the blood pressure in theglomerulus and the pressure of the filtrate in the glomerular capsule. Because the efferentarteriole is narrower than the afferent arteriole, a capillary hydrostatic pressure of about $7.3 \mathrm{kPa}(55 \mathrm{mmHg})$ builds upin the
glomerulus. This pressure is opposed by the osmotic pressure of the blood, provided mainly byplasma proteins, about 4 kPa ( 30 mmHg ), and by filtrate hydrostatic pressure of about 2 $\mathrm{kPa}(15 \mathrm{mmHg})$ intheglomerular capsule.

\section*{SELECTIVEREABSORPTION}

Most reabsorption from the filtrate back into the blood takes place in the proximal convolutedtubule, whose walls are lined with microvilli to increase surface area for absorption. Materialsessential to the body are reabsorbed here, including some water, electrolytes and organicnutrients suchasglucose.
Some reabsorption is passive, but some substances are transported actively. Only 60-70\% offiltrate reaches the loop of the nephron. Much of this, especially water, sodium and chloride, isreabsorbed in the loop, so only 15-20\% of the original filtrate reaches the distal convolutedtubule, and the composition of the filtrate is now very different from its starting values.
Moreelectrolytesarereabsorbedhere,especiallysodium,sothefiltrateenteringthecollectingductsis actuallyquitedilute.
The main function of the collecting ducts therefore is to reabsorb as much water as the bodyneeds.
Active transport takes place at carrier sites in the epithelial membrane, using chemical energy totransportsubstancesagainsttheirconcentrationgradients.
Some ions, e.g. sodium and chloride, can be absorbed by both active and passive mechanismsdependingonthesitein thenephron.

\section*{TUBULARSECRETION:}

Filtration occurs as the blood flows through the glomerular. Substances not required and foreignmaterials, e.g. drugs including penicillin and aspirin, may not be cleared from the blood byfiltration because of the short time it remains in the glomerular. Such substances are cleared bysecretionfrom theperitubularcapillariesinto the convolutedtubulesandexcretedfromthe
body in the urine．Tubular secretion of hydrogen ions（ $\mathrm{H}+$ ）is important in maintaining normalbloodpH．

10. Briefly explain why mature gametes carry only one set of chromosomes

A single gamete must combine with a gamete from an individual of the opposite sex to produce a fertilized egg, which has a complete set of chromosomes and is the first cell of a new individual
11. What special features are evident in sperm cells but not in somatic cells, and how do these specializations function?
Unlike somatic cells, sperm are haploid. They also have very little cytoplasm. They have a head with a compact nucleus covered by an acrosome filled with enzymes, and a midpiece filled with mitochondria that power their movement. They are motile because of their tail, a structure containing a flagellum, which is specialized for movement.
12. What do each of the three male accessory glands contribute to the semen?

The three accessory glands make the following contributions to semen: the seminal vesicle contributes about 60 percent of the semen volume, with fluid that contains large amounts of fructose to power the movement of sperm; the prostate gland contributes substances critical to sperm maturation; and the bulbourethral glands contribute a thick fluid that lubricates the ends of the urethra and the vagina and helps to clean urine residues from the urethra.

\section*{13. Describe how penile erection occurs.}

During sexual arousal, nitric oxide (NO) is released from nerve endings near blood vessels within the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum. The release of NO activates a signaling pathway that results in relaxation of the smooth muscles that surround the penile arteries, causing them to dilate. This dilation increases the amount of blood that can enter the penis, and induces the endothelial cells in the penile arterial walls to secrete NO, perpetuating the vasodilation. The rapid increase in blood volume fills the erectile chambers, and the increased pressure of the filled chambers compresses the thinwalled penile venules, preventing venous drainage of the penis. An erection is the result of this increased blood flow to the penis and reduced blood return from the penis.
14. While anabolic steroids (synthetic testosterone) bulk up muscles, they can also affect testosterone production in the testis. Using what you know about negative feedback, describe what would happen to testosterone production in the testis if a male takes large amounts of synthetic testosterone.
Testosterone production by the body would be reduced if a male were taking anabolic steroids. This is because the hypothalamus responds to rising testosterone levels by reducing its secretion of GnRH, which would in turn reduce the anterior pituitary's release of LH, finally reducing the manufacture of testosterone in the testes.
