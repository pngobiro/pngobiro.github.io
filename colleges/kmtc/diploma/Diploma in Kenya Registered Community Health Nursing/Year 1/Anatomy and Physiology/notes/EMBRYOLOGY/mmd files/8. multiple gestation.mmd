\section*{Objectives}
- Epidemiology
- Risk factors for multiple gestation
- Classification
- Concerns

\section*{Epidemiology}
- Multiple pregnancies are conception of more than one baby at the same time
- Twins are the commonest!

2\% of all deliveries
- Twins occur once in every 90 pregnancies
- Triplets is once in $90 \times 90$ pregnancies
- Quadruplets once in $90 \times 90 \times 90$
- Quintuplets once in $90 \times 90 \times 90 \times 90$ pregnancies. About $2 / 3$ of twins are dizygotic twins (DZ) and 1/3 are monozygotic twins (MZ)

\section*{Contributing factors}
- Hereditary factors:
- Dizygotic twins show hereditary tendency. There is tendency of DZ twins to repeat in families
- Previous multiple pregnancy:
if the first born are twins, a repetition of multiple birth is about 5 times more likely to occur at the next pregnancy than in the general population
- Age and height of the mother;
- Taller and older mothers have greater chance to have twins, especially DZ twins.
- Use of gonadotropin hormones to stimulate ovulation increases the incidence of multiple pregnancy.
- 5-Use of in vitro fertilization increases chances for multiple pregnancy

\section*{Types of twins}
- Monozygotic (identical)
- Monochorionic mono-amniotic
- Mono-Di
- Di-Di
- Dizygotic (Fraternal)

Figure 15. Monozygotic, genetically identical twin pregnancies.

\section*{Monozygotic twins}
- Identical genetic background.
- Physical and mental similarities.
- Same sex, same blood group, same finger prints,
- External appearance such as hair and eye color

\section*{Causes of discordant (different) MZ twins}

Environmental factors, e.g. anastomoses of placental vessels leading to unbalanced blood supply to the twins.

Vascular abnormalities in one twin.
Gene mutation in one twin.
Chromosomal aberration in one blastocyst after the splitting.

Uneven X- chromosome inactivation between female MZ twins with the result that one twin expresses the paternal $X$, and the other expresses the maternal X

\section*{Fetal Membranes in MZ twins}

\section*{Dichorionic-diamniotic MZ twins:}
-35\% of MZ twins separation occurs during the first 3 days (2-8 cell stage)
-Early separation of embryonic blastomeres results in MZ twins with two amnions, two chorions, and two placentas that may or may not fuse

\section*{Monochorionicdiamniotic}
- 65\% of MZ twins splitting occurs around the end of the first week in the blastocyst stage.
- This results in MZ twins, each in its own amniotic sac, develop within the same chorionic sac and share a common placenta.

\section*{Monochorionicmonoamniotic MZ twins:}
- Very rarely splitting occurs in the embryonic disc during the second week before appearance of the primitive streak.
- This splitting results in formation of one amniotic sac, a common chorionic sac and a single placenta.
- Monochorionic-monoamniotic MZ twins carry high mortality rate (50\% death) and increased risk of conjoined twins.

\section*{Monozygotic twins (syn: Identical, uniovular):}
- Upto 3 days - diamniotic-dichorionic
- Between $4^{\text {th }}$ \& $7^{\text {th }}$ day - diamniotic monochorionic - most common type
- Between $8^{\text {th }} \& 12^{\text {th }}$ day-monoamniotic-monochorionic
- After $13^{\text {th }}$ day - conjoined / Siamese twins.

Conjoined Twins

\section*{Complications of MZ twins}
- Intrauterine death:
- many twins die before birth, only 30\% of women pregnant with twins give birth to two infants
- Vanishing twin refers death of one of the fetus
- Fetus papyraceus (calcification)

\section*{Twin transfusion syndrome}
- Occurs in 5-15\% of monochorionic MZ twins
- Placental vascular anastomoses cause one twin to receive most of the blood while the other is compromised.
- As a result, one twin is larger than the other. The outcome is poor with death of both twins occurring in 60-100\% of cases. The small one dies from anemia, and the large one dies from heart failure.

\section*{Siamese twins}
- Occur in 1/50,000-1/100,000 pregnancies.
- As a results of incomplete splitting of the axial area of the germ disc.
- Conjoined twins may be connected to each other by a common skin bridge or by a common liver bridge.

\section*{Types of siamese twins}
- According to the nature and degree of union, they are classified as
- Thoracopagus (joined at the thorax),
- Pygopagus (joined at the pelvis)
- Craniopagus (joined at the head).

Conjoined twins can be surgically separated; however in most conjoined twins anatomical relations do not permit surgical separation

\section*{Dizygotic twins}
- Dizygotic twins occur when there is shedding of two ova at nearly the same time at one ovarian cycle
- and the two ova are fertilized by two different sperms.
- The two ova may come from one or two ovaries

\section*{Features of DZ twins}
- DZ twins have different genetic background and are not alike. They may or may not be of the same sex

\section*{Fetal membranes in DZ twins}
- Both zygotes implant individually in the uterus and each develops in its own amnion, its own chorion, and its own placenta, resulting in dichorionic-diamniotic DZ twins.
- 2-However, sometimes the two placentas fuse Similarly walls of the chorionic sacs come into close apposition and fuse resulting in monochorionic-diamniotic DZ twins.

\section*{Complications of DZ twins}
- Erythrocyte mosaicism:
- Anastomoses of blood vessels of the fused placentas of DZ twins results in erythrocyte mosaicism
- Members of the DZ twins have red blood cells of two different types because red cells were exchanged between the circulations of the twins.

\section*{Other types of multiple births}
- Triplets may be derived from:
- One zygote.
- Two zygotes, identical twins and a singleton.
- Three zygotes (non-identical) of the same or different sex.
- Similar combinations occur in quadruplets, quintuplets, sextuplets, and septuplets.
- Superfecundation (superfetation) is the fertilization of two or more oocytes at different times.
- It is very rare in human.

\section*{Superfetation vs Superfecundation}

\section*{Superfetation}

\section*{Superfecundation}
- A long interval intervenes between fertilizations
- Requires ovulation \& fertilization during the course of an established pregnancy
- Fertilization of 2 ova within the same menstrual cycle but not at the same coitus, nor necessarily by sperm from the same male
- Unproven to occur in humans

\section*{Superfecundation}
