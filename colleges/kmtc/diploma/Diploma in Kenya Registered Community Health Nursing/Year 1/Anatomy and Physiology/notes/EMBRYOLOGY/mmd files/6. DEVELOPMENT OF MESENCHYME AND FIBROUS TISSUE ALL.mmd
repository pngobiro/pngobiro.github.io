\section*{GASTRULATION}
- Key event - loss of epithelial characteristics of epiblast and hyopblast.
- The main important processes of gastrulation are formation of:
- Primitive streak
- Germ layers
- Notochord

\section*{THE PRIMITIVE STREAK}
- It develops at the beginning of $\mathbf{3}^{\text {rd }}$ week.
- Proliferation and migration of cells of the epiblast to the median plane of the embryonic disc.
- Cells leave the deep surface and form a loose network of embryonic connective tissue called MESENCYME OR MESOBLAST OR MESODERM.

\section*{SOURCES OF MESENCHYME}
- Definitions:
- Mesoderm refers to cells derived from the epiblast and extraembryonic tissues.
- Mesenchyme refers to loosely organized embryonic unspecialized cells that are set in a gelatinous ground substance.
- Sources:
- Mesoderm
- Primitive streak
- Somites.
- The somites differentiate to scleretome, myotome and dermatome.
- In early stages of differentiation, the somite cells show epithelial characteristics.
- Later, they loose this characteristic to form a loose jelly-like tissue - MESENCHYME.
- Mesodermal lateral plates.
- Neural crest cells especially in the head region

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF MESENCHYME}
- Mesenchyme consists of:
- cells
- intercellular ground substance
- Ability to differentiate in many different ways
- Ability to differentiate along a different pattern from their customary line (metaplasia)
- Ability to migrate and change their position and arrangement
- Cells are:
- Amoeboid - ability to move
- Different shapes:
- Stellate (star-shaped)
- Fusiform (spindle-shaped)
- Joined by cellular processes.
- Initially, ground substance is fluid, later it becomes a mucoid jelly containing scanty fibrils.

\section*{MORPHOGENESIS IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY CHANGES IN}
- The direction and number of cell divisions;
- Cell shape changes;
- Cell movement;
- Cell growth;
- Cell death;
- Changes in the composition of cell membrane and extracellular matrix.

\section*{FUNCTIONS}
- Forms supporting tissue of the embryo
- Forms most connective tissue of the body
- Forms stromal components or framework of glands
- Mesenchyme acts as "packing tissue" occupying all the spaces between the germ layers.
- Some mesenchymal cells persist in the adult connective tissue and under particular stimuli can differentiate along various lines.
- The mesoderm mesenchyme gives rise to:
- Connective tissue
- Cartilage
- Striated and smooth muscle
- Heart
- Kidneys
- Ovaries
- Tests
- Genital ducts
- Serous membranes lining the body cavities (pericardial, pleural and peritoneal)
- Spleen
- Cortex of suprarenal glands

\section*{THE MESENGENIC PROCESS}

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE}
- By $6^{\text {th }}$ week of development, mesenchymal cells join with their process forming a syncytium.
- Cells are spindle shaped.
- Delicate argyrophilic fibrils or marginal filaments develop along the peripheral area of the cytoplasm.
- Cells with many fibrils are called FIBROBLASTS.
- Fibroblasts are responsible for formation of fibres and ground substance of the supporting tissue.

\section*{CONNECTIVE TISSUE FIBERS}

- Process of fibre formation is fibrogenesis
- Fibrogenesis begins from basic embryonic molecule called tropocollagen.
- By $\mathbf{5}^{\text {th }}$ month, the fibrils have increased in number and thickness and are arranged in parallel bundles.
- The arrangement is correlated with the mechanical conditions under which the tissue will function.
- Reticular fibres arise by polymerization of tropocollagen.
- They are the first fibres to develop during wound healing.

\section*{FIBROBLAST}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_71ff980840d363eada8ag-20.jpg?height=1664&width=2496&top_left_y=9&top_left_x=0)

Collagen Types
I - skin, bone, tendon cornea (most common type)
II- cartilage, embryonic cornea
III- reticular fibers, loose c.t., blood vessel walls, dermis
IV- basal lamina of epithelium
(no fibers, matrix of randomly-oriented molecules)

\section*{TYPES OF COLLAGEN}

\section*{Type Tissues}
- I Skin, tendon, bone, meniscus, annulus fibrosus
- II Articular cartilage, vitreous humor, nucleus pulposus
- III Skin, muscle, blood vessels
- IV basement membrane (basal lamina)
- V,VI,IX,X articular cartilage
- X Articular cartilage, mineralization of cartilage in hypertrophic zone of physis
- XI Articular cartilage
- XII Tendon
- XIII endothelial cells

\section*{ELASTOGENESIS}
- Production of elastic fibres (elastogenesis) follows the appearance of collagen fibres.
- Elastic fibres are produced by specialized fibroblasts referred to as ELASTOBLASTS.
- The first stage of elastogenesis is represented by condensation of fusiform mesenchymal cells.
- Later, short delicate filaments appear orientated along the axis of the tendon and among collagen fibres.
- Formation of elastic fibres proceeds further with an increase in thickness and correspondingly more organization of the surrounding collagen fibres.
- Elastic fibres are similar to collagen in content of glycine and proline but differ in the content of valine and desmocine.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF ADIPOSE TISSUE}
- Adipose tissue is formed by LIPOBLASTS which are cells capable of storing lipoidal material.
- The distribution of fat differs in both sex and varies in individuals.
- In the developing fetus, subcutaneous fat is laid down during the last two months as white adipose tissue.
- Brown adipose tissue has more cytochrome and flavoproteins which give it typical reddish-brown color.
- It is distributed in the following areas:
- Axilla
- Cervical region
- Interscapular area
- Mediastinum
- Aortic area
- Pararenal area
- Inguinal areas.
- Brown fat is used by the infant to generate heat.

\section*{ABNORMALITIES OF DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE}
- These are dependent on the type of connective tissue involved and the organ e.g. defective collagen fibres which are of various varieties may lead to defective blood vessels, cervical incompetence, lax joints etc.

\section*{Marfan Syndrome}
- An inherited disorder caused by a defective gene for the glycoprotein fibrillin resulting in abnormal development of elastic fibers.
- This causes tissues that contain many elastic fibers to be malformed or weak (including the covering of bone, ligament that suspends the lens of the eye, and the walls of large arteries.
- People with Marfan syndrome are often tall, have long arms, legs, fingers and toes, blurred vision, and weakened aortic walls that may burst.

\section*{HISTOGENESIS OF CARTILAGE}
- Cartilage develops from mesenchyme.
- First appears in embryos during the $\mathbf{5}^{\text {th }}$ week.
- In areas where cartilage is to develop, the mesenchyme condenses to form chondrification centers.
- The mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondroblasts that secrete collagenous fibrils and the ground substance.
- Collagenous and/or elastic fibers are deposited in the intercellular substance or matrix.
- Three types of cartilage are distinguished according to the type of matrix that is formed:
- Hyaline cartilage, the most widely distributed type (e.g., in joints)
- Fibrocartilage (e.g., in intervertebral discs)
- Elastic cartilage (e.g., in auricle of ear)

\section*{Summary of chondrogenesis in the craniofacial skeleton}
- The three phases are precondensation, characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (brown); condensation (yellow); and differentiation (blue).
- The precondensation phase is characterized by expression of Hox genes (CHox-1 [Hoxa 4], Barx-1), Msx-1, 2, the growth factors bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and[transforming growth factor $\beta$ [TGF- $\beta$ ], and syndecan-1. Versican, syndecan-3, and tenascin, which are present in low concentrations precondensation, are up-regulated at condensation.
- Other Hox genes and transcription factors (Hoxd-3, -13, Hoxa-2, Cdxa [Chox-4], Mhox, Ck-erg, and Cart-1) and other growth factors (activin, BMP-4, -5, and GDF-5) are expressed at condensation.
- The cell adhesion molecules neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and N-cadherin also appear with condensation but are down-regulated during condensation.
- Heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans appear at condensation and are up-regulated during condensation.
- The transcriptional factor Pax-1 is present during and after condensation.
- Extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin, hyaluronan, and hyaladherin increase during condensation (yellow) but are down-regulated thereafter (blue).
- Collagen types II and IX and cartilage proteoglycan appear postcondensation, although mRNAs for the collagens and for the core protein of the proteoglycan are up-regulated during condensation.

\section*{CONDENSATION FORMATION}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_71ff980840d363eada8ag-51.jpg?height=1446&width=2116&top_left_y=170&top_left_x=192)

\section*{HISTOGENESIS OF BONE}
- Bone primarily develops in two types of connective tissue, mesenchyme and cartilage, but can also develop in other connective tissues.
- Like cartilage, bone consists of cells and an organic intercellular substance-the bone matrixthat comprises collagen fibrils embedded in an amorphous component.
- Osteogenesis and chondrogenesis are programmed early in development and are independent events under the influence of vascular events.

\section*{BONE FORMATION}
- Bone formation is termed osteogenesis or ossification.
- It is a process of transforming mesenchyme to bone.
- Bone first appearance - condensations of mesenchymal cells.
- Condensation marks the beginning of selective gene activity, which precedes cell differentiation.
- Two types of ossification occur.
- Intramembranous ossification is the formation of bone directly from or within fibrous connective tissue membranes.
- Endochondrial ossification is the formation of bone from hyaline cartilage models.
- Intramembranous ossification - no bone model.
- Endochondrial ossification - first form hyaline cartilage bone model.
- Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-5 and BMP-7), the growth factor Gdf5, members of the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) superfamily, and other signaling molecules have been implicated as endogenous regulators of chondrogenesis and skeletal development.

\section*{INTRAMEMBRANOUS OSSIFICATION}
- Mesenchyme forms a membranous sheath, hence, the name intramembranous ossification.
- Also called dermal ossification because it normally occurs in the deeper layers of connective tissue of the dermis of the skin.
- The mesenchyme condenses and becomes highly vascular.
- Some cells differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and begin to deposit unmineralized matrix osteoid.
- Calcium phosphate is then deposited in the osteoid tissue as it is organized into bone.
- Osteoblasts are trapped in the matrix and become osteocytes.
- At first, new bone has no organized pattern.
- Spicules of bone soon become organized and coalesce into lamellae (layers).
- Concentric lamellae develop around blood vessels, forming osteons (haversian systems).
- Some osteoblasts remain at the periphery of the developing bone and continue to lay down lamellae, forming plates of compact bone on the surfaces.
- Between the surface plates, the intervening bone remains spiculated or spongy.
- Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells with a hematopoietic origin.
- In the interstices of spongy bone, the mesenchyme differentiates into bone marrow.
- During fetal and postnatal life, there is continuous remodeling of bone by the coordinated action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

\section*{ENDOCHONDRAL OSSIFICATION}
- Endochondral ossification is formation of bone from preexisting cartilaginous models.
- In a long bone, for example, the primary center of ossification appears in the diaphysis - the part of a long bone between its ends - that forms the shaft of the bone.
- At the center of ossification, chondrocytes increase in size (hypertrophy), the matrix becomes calcified, and the cells die.
- Concurrently, a thin layer of bone is deposited under the perichondrium surrounding the diaphysis; thus, the perichondrium becomes the periosteum.
- Invasion by vascular connective tissue from blood vessels surrounding the periosteum also breaks up the cartilage.
- Some invading cells differentiate into hemopoietic cells, blood cells, of the bone marrow.
- Transformation of cartilage model to bone proceeds towards the epiphyses (ends of the bone).
- The spicules of bone are remodeled by the action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

\section*{GROWTH IN THICKNESS}
- Bone grow in thickness or diameter by appositional growth.
- The steps in these process are:
- Periosteal cells differentiate into osteoblasts which secrete collagen fibers and organic molecules to form the matrix.
- Ridges fuse and the periosteum becomes the endosteum.
- New concentric lamellae are formed.
- Osetoblasts under the periosteum form new circumferential lamellae.

\section*{Bone Growth in Width}

- By appositional growth at the bone's surface
- Periosteal cells differentiate into osteoblasts and form bony ridges and then a tunnel around periosteal blood vessel.
- Concentric lamellae fill in the tunnel to form an osteon.

- Lengthening of long bones occurs at the diaphysial-epiphysial junction.
- Cartilage cells in the diaphysial-epiphyseal region proliferate by mitosis.
- Toward the diaphysis, the cartilage cells hypertrophy and the matrix becomes calcified.
- Spicules are isolated from each other by vascular invasion from the medullary (marrow) cavity.
- Bone is deposited on these spicules by osteoblasts; resorption of this bone keeps the spongy bone masses relatively constant in length and enlarges the medullary cavity.
- Ossification of limb bones begins at the end of the embryonic period and thereafter makes demands on the maternal supply of calcium and phosphorus.
- Pregnant women are therefore advised to maintain an adequate intake of these elements to preserve healthy bones and teeth.
- At birth, the diaphyses are largely ossified, but most of the epiphyses are still cartilaginous.
- Secondary ossification centers appear in the epiphyses in most bones during the first few years after birth.
- Ossification spreads radially, and only the articular cartilage and a transverse plate of cartilage, the epiphysial cartilage plate, remain cartilaginous.
- Upon completion of growth, this plate is replaced by spongy bone; the epiphyses and diaphysis are united, and no further elongation of the bone occurs.
- In most bones, the epiphyses have fused with the diaphysis by the age of 20 years.
- The rate of deposition and resorption is balanced to regulate the thickness of the compact bone and the size of the medullary cavity.
- The internal reorganization of bone continues throughout life.
- In addition to membranous and endochondral ossification, chondroid tissue, which also differentiates from mesenchyme, is now recognized as an important factor for skeletal growth.

\section*{FACTORS THAT AFFECT BONE GROWTH}
- Minerals
- Vitamins
- Hormones
- Exercise

\section*{Minerals}

Calcium

Phosphorus
Magnesium
Boron

Manganese

Makes bone matrix hard
Hypocalcemia: low blood calcium levels.
Hypercalcemia: high blood calcium levels.
Makes bone matrix hard Deficiency inhibits osteoblasts May inhibit calcium loss, increase levels of estrogens Inhibits formation of new bone tissue

\section*{Vitamins}

Vitamin A Controls activity, distribution, and coordination of osteoblasts/osteoclasts
Vitamin B12 May inhibit osteoblast activity
Vitamin C Helps maintain bone matrix, deficiency leads to decreased collagen production which inhibits bone growth and repair
(scury) disorder due to a lack of Vitamin C
Vitamin D (Calcitriol) Helps build bone by increasing calcium absorption.
Deficiencies result in "Rickets" in children

\section*{Hormones}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Human Growth Hormone & Promotes general growth of all body tissue and normal growth in children \\
\hline Insulin-like Growth Factor & Stimulates uptake of amino acids and protein synthesis \\
\hline Insulin & Promotes normal bone growth and maturity \\
\hline Thyroid Hormones & Promotes normal bone growth and maturity \\
\hline Estrogen and Testosterone & Increases osteogenesis at puberty and is responsible for gender differences of skeletons \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{RICKETS}
- Rickets is a disease that occurs in children who have a vitamin D deficiency.
- This vitamin is required for calcium absorption by the intestine.
- The resulting calcium deficiency causes disturbances of ossification of the epiphysial cartilage plates (i.e., they are not adequately mineralized), and there is disorientation of cells at the metaphysis.
- The limbs are shortened and deformed, with severe bowing of the limb bones.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF JOINTS}
- Joints begin to develop with the appearance of the interzonal mesenchyme during the $6^{\text {th }}$ week, and by the end of the $8^{\text {th }}$ week, they resemble adult joints.
- Joints are classified as fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints, and synovial joints.
- Joints with little or no movement are classified according to the type of material holding the bones together, for example, the bones involved in fibrous joints are joined by fibrous tissue.

Bone

Development of joints during the $6^{\text {th }}$ and $7{ }^{\text {th }}$ weeks. A, Condensed interzonal mesenchyme in the gap between the developing bones. This primordial joint may differentiate into: a synovial joint (B), a cartilaginous joint (C), or a fibrous joint (D).

\section*{FIBROUS JOINTS}
- During the development of fibrous joints, the interzonal mesenchyme between the developing bones differentiates into dense fibrous tissue, for example, the sutures of the cranium are fibrous joints.

\section*{CARTILAGINOUS JOINTS}
- During the development of cartilaginous joints, the interzonal mesenchyme between the developing bones differentiates into hyaline cartilage (e.g., the costochondral joints) or fibrocartilage (e.g., the pubic symphysis).

\section*{SYNOVIAL JOINTS}
- During the development of synovial joints (e.g., the knee joint), the interzonal mesenchyme between the developing bones differentiates as follows:
- Peripherally it forms the capsular and other ligaments.
- Centrally it disappears, and the resulting space becomes the joint cavity or synovial cavity.
- Where it lines the joint capsule and articular surfaces, it forms the synovial membrane (which secretes synovial fluid), a part of the joint capsule (fibrous capsule lined with synovial membrane)
- An abnormal intrauterine environment restricting embryonic and fetal movements may interfere with limb development and cause joint fixation.
