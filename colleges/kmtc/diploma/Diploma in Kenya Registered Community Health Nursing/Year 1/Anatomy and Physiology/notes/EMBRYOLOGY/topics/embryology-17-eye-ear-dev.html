B, D, and F, Transverse sections of the optic stalk showing successive stages in closure of the retinal fissure and formation of the optic nerve. The retinal fissure normally closes during the sixth week. Defects in closure of the fissure result in coloboma of the iris and/or retina. Note that the lumen of the optic stalk is gradually obliterated as axons of ganglion cells accumulate in the inner layer of the optic stalk as the optic nerve forms.</p>
