As the buds continue to elongate they become club-shaped and the epithelium at the end of each molds itself over a little portion of the dermis in which the cells have become more numerous and which is known as the hair papilla.</span></li>

The hairs appear above the surface about the fifth month. Of the cells of the root sheath, those nearest the hair become scale-like to form the cuticle of the root sheath; the next few layers become modified (keratinized) to form Huxley's and Henle's layers. Outside of these is the stratum germinativum, the basal layer of which is composed of columnar cells resting upon a distinct basement membrane. The stratum germinativum is continued over the tip of the papilla, where its cells give rise to new cells for the hair shaft.</span></li>
