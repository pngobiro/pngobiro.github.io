Ihat are fetal membranes?
* They are structures that develop from the zygote and do not share in the formation of the embryo
* Extraembryonic structures from the primitive blastomeres

\section*{Fetal membranes}

\section*{* These include *Amnion}
*Umbilical vesicle (yolk sac)
*Allantois
* Umbilical cord
* Chorion

\section*{Embryonic sources}
* Amnion- Epiblast/ extraembyonic mesoderm
* Yolk sac- Hypoblast/Extraembryonic mesoderm
*Allantois-Distal gut/ Diverticulum off the yolk sac
* Chorion- Trophoblasts/extraembryonic mesoderm
* Placenta- Chorion/ Maternal decidua

\section*{Extraembryonic tissue}

\section*{Amnion, Amniotic cavity and}

\section*{Fluid \\ Amnion is a membrane which surrounds the} amniotic cavity
* This membrane is continuous with the ectoderm of the embryo
* The amniotic cavity contains about $800-1000 \mathrm{ml}$ of watery and clear fluid (Amniotic fluid) at full term
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_48e46c72930db6914cfag-09.jpg?height=802&width=1860&top_left_y=1069&top_left_x=320)

\section*{Formation of Amnion and Amniotic cavity (Before folding)}
* Begins as small vacuoles in the epiblast which coalesce together forming a single cavity
* Cells of the epiblast (ectoderm) adjacent to the cytotrophoblast are called amnioblasts
* Eventually, amnioblasts form the roof of the amniotic cavity
* This cavity also has a floor formed of ectoderm

\section*{Formation of Amniotic cavity: After folding}
* The amniotic cavity continues to increase in size
* The amniotic cavity surrounds the embryo in all directions
* It lies cranial, caudal, dorsal \& ventral to the embryo.

\section*{nniotic fluid: Composition}
* 98\% water
* 2\% solid substances
*Inorganic \& organic salt
*Fetal epithelium,
* Proteins
*Enzymes

\section*{Formation of amniotic fluid}
1. Amniotic membrane
2. Maternal tissue (interstitial) fluid by diffusion across the amnio-chorionic membrane from the deciduas parietalis
3. Filtrated from maternal blood.
4. Fluid is also secreted by the fetal respiratory tract ( $300-400 \mathrm{ml}$ daily) and enters the amniotic cavity
5. Fetal urine.

\section*{olume of Amniotic fluid}
* The volume of amniotic fluid increases slowly
$* 30 \mathrm{ml}$ at 10 weeks gestation
* 350 ml at 20 weeks
* $700-1000 \mathrm{ml}$ by 37 weeks

\section*{Functions of Amniotic fluid: Before labour}
1. Forms an isolating bag around the embryo protecting him from external trauma, shock \& temperature
2. Prevents adhesion of the embryo to its membranes
3. Allows homogenous media needed for the growth of the embryo
4. Permits the free movement of the embryo needed for muscular exercise
5. Allows the embryo to practice suckling

\section*{Function of Amniotic fluid}
* Control of body temperature
* Maintains homeostasis of fluid and electrolytes
* Important for development of the respiratory system
* Cushions the umbilical cord from compression between the mother and fetus

\section*{Functions of Amniotic fluid: During labour}
1. The bag of fore water allows regular dilatation of the cervix
2. After rupture of membrane the amniotic fluid serves as a lubricant for fetus descent
1. Amniotic fluid is bacteriostatic

\section*{Clinical uses of Amniotic fluid}
* Diagnostic purposes
* Amniotic fluid testing
* Usually done before 16 weeks
* For AFP, acetylcholinestarase
* Fetal karyotype
* Assessemnent for fetal lung maturity
* Amnioinfusion
* Amniotic stem cells

\section*{Examples of conditions where Acetylcholinestarase activity is elevated: Anencephaly}

\section*{Abnormalities associated with amniotic fluid}
* Polyhydramnions
* Oligohydramnions
* Potter's sequence (Oligohydramnions sequence)
* Amniotic band syndrome

\section*{Yolk sac/ Umbilical vesicle}

\section*{Primary yolk sac}
- Starts as vacuoles in the hypoblastic cells of the inner cell mass
-These vacuoles coalesce together forming a single cavity called primary yolk sac
-It's roof and side wall is formed by hypoblasts (endoderm)
-Heuser's membrane
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_48e46c72930db6914cfag-33.jpg?height=1395&width=1229&top_left_y=412&top_left_x=1267)

Figure 3.4 Human blastocyst of approximately 12 days. The trophoblastic lacunae at the embryonic pole are in open connection with maternal sinusoids in the endometrial stroma. Extraembryonic mesoderm proliferates and fills the space between the exocoelomic membrane and the inner aspect of the trophoblast.

\section*{Secondary yolk sac}

\section*{Primary yolk sac is reduced in size to be transformed to the Secondary yolk sac}

Fig. 49: Diagram showing development of the fetal membranes

\section*{Final yolk sac}

During folding 3 parts of yolk sac are fromed
* Intraembryonic yolk sac (incooporated to form the primitive gut)
* Extraembryonic yolk sac
* Vitellointestinal duct (yolk stalk)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_48e46c72930db6914cfag-37.jpg?height=1637&width=1203&top_left_y=170&top_left_x=1254)

\section*{Functions of the yolk sac}

It gives the primordial germ cells
* Nutrition to the embryo in the early weeks of development
* The endoderm will give the mucous membrane which lines the gut \& respiratory tract
* Site of haematopoesis in early development (week3-6)
* The splanchnopleuric primary mesoderm that surroundin it, gives the vitelline arteries (future superior mesenteric artery) \& vitelline vein (future liver sinusoids- portal \& hepatic veins)

\section*{Fate of the yolk sac}
* At 10 weeks, lies in chorionic cavity, between amniotic and chorionic sacs
* Atrophies as the pregnancy advances
* Its persistence is of no clinical significance
* Omphaloenteric duct detaches from the mid-gut loop by $6{ }^{\text {th }}$ week

\section*{Abnormalities of the yolk sac}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_48e46c72930db6914cfag-40.jpg?height=1470&width=2335&top_left_y=314&top_left_x=73)

\section*{Meckel' diverticulum}

It occurs due to patent intestinal end of the vitellointestinal duct (yolk stalk)
*Fingerlike pouch about $3-6 \mathrm{~cm}$ ( 2 inches) long that arises from the anti-mesenteric border of the ileum, *It is $\mathbf{2}$ feet from the ileocecal junction
* It occurs in 2-4\% of people and is 3-5 times more prevalent in males than females
*Sometimes it becomes inflamed and causes symptoms that mimic appendicitis
*It may contain gastric mucosa leads to ulcer in this diverticulum.

\section*{Allantois}
* Appears on day 16
* Endodermal in origin
* Diverticulum from caudal part of the yolk sac
* Towards connecting stalk
* Surrounded by splanchopleuric primary mesoderm
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_48e46c72930db6914cfag-42.jpg?height=1576&width=1248&top_left_y=299&top_left_x=1162)

\section*{Functions of the Allantois}

\section*{* Mesenchyme around gives origin to the umbilical vessels}
* Primitive organ of excretion in the embryo
* Nutritive? Site of Hematopoiesis

\section*{Fate of allantois}
* The extra-embryonic part lies inside the umbilical cord (obliterates by the $2^{\text {nd }}$ month )
* The intra-embryonic part obliterates forming the urachus in the fetus
* Later on the urachus transforms into ligament called the median umbilical ligament

\section*{Allantois and yolk sac}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_48e46c72930db6914cfag-45.jpg?height=1541&width=2342&top_left_y=263&top_left_x=149)

\section*{Abnormalities of the allantois}
- Urachal fistula: (persistence of the Allantois)
- Presence of a connection between the urinary bladder \& the umbilicus, so the urine will charge from the umbilicus
- Urachal sinus: one end of the allantois is opened \& the other end is closed
- Urachal cyst: the 2 ends of the allantois are closed but still a part of the allantois is opened between the 2 ends forming a cyst
