\section*{Cell cycle and it's regulation}

Dr. B. M. Ndung'u Lecturer, Dept of Human Anatomy UoN

\section*{Objectives}
* To understand the processes and the phases of the cell cycle.
* To appreciate the cellular events of each phase of the cell cycle.
* Introduce the molecular basis of the phases of mitosis.
* To appreciate the presence of cycle check-points and their role in carcinogenesis.

\section*{Cell Cycle}
* The cell cycle is an ordered set of events culminating in cell growth and division into two daughters cells.
* Cell division is controlled by a highly regulated series of biochemical events - the cell division cycle (cdc).
* The four coordinated processes of the cycle are:
$\checkmark$ Cell growth.
$\checkmark$ DNA replication.
$\checkmark$ Distribution of the duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells.

\section*{Cell Cycle Contd.}
$\checkmark$ Cell division (cytokinesis).
- Phases of the cycle.
$\checkmark$ Mitosis - nuclear division.
$\checkmark$ Interphase - time between consecutive mitosis.
* The interphase consists of:
* G1 (gap 1) phase.
$\checkmark$ Interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication.

\section*{Cell Cycle Contd.}
${ }^{\checkmark}$ Cell is metabolically active, exhibits continuous growth and prepares the chromosomes for replication.
*S- (synthesis) phase.
$\checkmark$ Synthesis and replication of DNA and centrosomes
- the microtubules organising centre.
* G2 (gap 2) phase.
$\checkmark$ Protein synthesis.
$\checkmark$ Cell growth continues.

\section*{Cell Cycle Contd.}

G0 (quiescent stage).
$\checkmark$ Cells are metabolically active but no longer proliferate unless stimulated by appropriate extracellular signals.
$\checkmark$ Not considered to be part of the cell cycle.

\section*{Cell Cycle}
- Time cell comes into existence until that cell divides again
- Rapidly growing human cells $20-24 \mathrm{hr}$
- Liver cells 1-2 year
- Neurons 1 only
- Quiescent $\mathrm{G}_{0}$

\section*{Cell Lifespan}
- Neutrophil
- 6-7 hours circulating
- 4 days in tissue
- Red blood cell

- Brain neuron
- 50-100 years
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-08.jpg?height=945&width=731&top_left_y=695&top_left_x=1242)

\section*{Regulation of the Cell Cycle}
* Critical for the normal development of multicellular organisms.
* A breakdown/defect in the regulation leads to 'out of control' growth which ultimately leads to cancer.

\section*{Regulation of the Cell Cycle}

Progression between cell cycle stages is controlled by conserved 'regulatory apparatus' which;
$\checkmark$ Coordinates the different events of the cycle.
$\checkmark$ Links the cycle with extra-cellular signals that control cell proliferation.
* 'Regulatory apparatus' are an interplay of many molecules.

\section*{Events of the Phases}
- Reasons for cell division;
> Growth.
> Repair and replacement of damaged parts.
- Reproduction of species.

\section*{M-phase}
* Mitosis ; formation of identical daughters cells.
* Basic events of mitosis.
$\checkmark$ Chromosomes condensation.
$\checkmark$ Formation of the mitotic spindle.
$\checkmark$ Attachment of chromosomes to the spindle.
$\checkmark$ Separation of sister chromatids and movement to the opposite poles of the spindle.
$\checkmark$ Formation of daughters nuclei.
* Stages/ phases of mitosis- PMAT.

\section*{Mitosis- Prophase}
- Chromosome DNA has been earlier duplicated (S Phase)
- Chromosomes begin condensing
- Chromosome pairs (chromatids) held together at centromere
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-14.jpg?height=629&width=963&top_left_y=553&top_left_x=1353)
- Microtubules disassemble
- Mitotic spindle begins to form
- At end of prophase nuclear envelope breaks down
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-14.jpg?height=444&width=913&top_left_y=1283&top_left_x=1364)

\section*{Prophase}
* Condensation of chromosomes.
$\checkmark$ Critical in enabling the movement along the mitotic spindle.
$\checkmark$ Mediated by phosphorylation of core histone H3 through interaction with the codensin complex.
$\checkmark$ The codensin-complex results from interaction of AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein), PKA (cAMPdependent protein kinase) and EG 7; A 150 KD inductive nuclear protein.

Cohesins and condensins help configure replicated chromosomes for segregation

Condensins $\gg$ chromosome condensation

\section*{Prophase}
* Cytoplasmic changes leading to the development of the mitotic spindle by selective stablization of interacting microtubules.
* Nucleolus disintegrates and the nuclear membranes dissolves.
* Induced by MPF (promoting factor) and cdc 2 phosphorylation of nuclear lamina and golgi matrix protein (GM130).

\section*{Kinetochores attach chromosomes to the mitotic spindle}

Kinetochore: a complex protein machine that assembles onto the highly condensed DNA at the centromere during late prophase

Three classes of microtubules in mitotic animal cells

\section*{Metaphase}
* Chromosomes arranges in the plane of the spindle equator- the equatorial /metaphase plate.
* Each chromosone divides longitudinally to form the sister chromatids.
* The kinetochore controls entry into anaphase so that the process of mitosis does not progress until all chromatid pairs are aligned at the cell equator.
* This metaphase check point prevents the formation of daughter cells with unequal number of chromosomes.

\section*{Mitotic Spindle}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-22.jpg?height=849&width=2013&top_left_y=618&top_left_x=231)

\section*{Mitosis- Metaphase}
- Kinetochore MTs align chromosomes in one midpoint plane
- Metaphase ends when sister kinetochores separate
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-23.jpg?height=1109&width=929&top_left_y=586&top_left_x=1379)

\section*{Anaphase}
- Marked by splitting of the centromere and the pulling of the chromosomes to opposite poles of the spindle.
* Progression from metaphase to anaphase results from activation of anaphase-promoting complex (cyclosome) (APC/c) which remains inhibited until a cell passes the metaphase check point.

\section*{Anaphase}
* APC/c triggers the events leading to;
$\checkmark$ Destruction of cohesins ; allows separation of sister chromatids.
$\checkmark$ Degradation of the mitotic cyclin B which leads to inactivation of m-promoting factor.
- Divided into anaphase-a and anaphase- B.

\section*{Sister chromatids separate suddenly at anaphase (cont'd)}
by two independent and overlapping processes:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-26.jpg?height=1234&width=1053&top_left_y=616&top_left_x=156)

ANAPHASE E
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-26.jpg?height=346&width=890&top_left_y=704&top_left_x=1379)
(1) a ulding force it generated between overlap microtubules from opposity poiss ito pash the pales apart;
(2) a pulling force acts divectly on the poles to move them apart
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-26.jpg?height=451&width=1018&top_left_y=1407&top_left_x=1315)

\section*{Both pushing and pulling forces contribute to anaphase B}

Motor proteins may act in anaphase B

\section*{Telophase}
$\checkmark$ Chromosomes uncoil to regain their interphase conformation.
$\checkmark$ Nuclear envelope reassembles. Nucleolus becomes apparent.
$\checkmark$ Cytokinesis also takes place during telophase.

\section*{Telophase}
- Inactivation of MPF and dephosphorylation of proteins that it had phosphorylated leads to nuclear, microtubules and membrane changes that characterize the end of m-phase.
* Cytokinesis is mediated by a contractile ring of actin and myosin II filaments beneath the plasma membrane at the position of the mitotic spindle.

\section*{Mitosis- Cytokinesis}
- Division of cytoplasmic contents
- Contractile ring
- forms at midpoint under membrane
- Microfilament ring

- Contracts forming cleavage furrow
- Eventually fully divides cytoplasm

\section*{Actin and myosin II in the contractile ring generate the force for cytokinesis}

The contractile ring begins to assemble as the astral MT in anaphase become longer lived and less dynamic in response to the loss of M-Cdk activity; regulated by polo-like family protein kinases dividing slime mold
