\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF MUSCLE}

Ngwazi DR K.O. AWORI Dept. of Human Anatomy.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
" From epiblast
" After gastrulation, the vast majority take up temporary positions in the paraxial mesoderm.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

\section*{The embryonic cells that give rise to muscle are myoblasts.}

Most skeletal muscles develop before birth.

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
Origin of skeletal, cardiac \& smooth muscles \& myoepithelial cells.
2. Parts \& derivatives of a myotome plate
3. Histogenesis of various muscle types
4. Factors in muscle location \& morphology
5. Growth of muscle
6. Congenital defects

\section*{SOURCES OF MESENCHYME}

\section*{Skeletal muscle is from the paraxial mesoderm}

Iridal \& ciliary muscles of the eye are neuroectodermal

\section*{SOURCES OF MESENCHYME}
- Cardiac smooth muscle of the GIT from splanchnic mesoderm
- Smooth muscles of blood vessels \& erector pili muscles from local mesenchyme
- Myoepithelial cells from ectoderm

\section*{PARAXIAL MESODERM}
- 1-7 remain as somitomeres
- $8^{\text {th }}$ pair caudally form somites

\section*{ORIGIN OF REGIONAL SKELETAL MUSCULATURE}
- Cranial musculature mainly from somitomeres.
- Patterns directed by connective tissue elements.
- Muscles of the tongue develop from occipital myotomes.

\section*{ORIGIN OF REGIONAL SKELETAL MUSCULATURE}
- Trunk muscles arise from somites.
- Limb muscles are from somitic mesoderm, cells which migrate to the developing limb bud.

\section*{STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SOMITE}

\section*{DERIVATIVES OF THE MYOTOME}

\section*{I. EPIMERE}

\section*{Extensor muscles of the neck.}

Erector spinae of the back.
- Lumbar extensor muscles.

Sacral and coccygeal myotomes degenerate to form dorsal sacrococcygeal ligaments.

\section*{DERIVATIVES OF THE MYOTOME Hypomere}

In the neck:
o prevertebral \& scalene muscles
o geniohyoid \& infrahyoid muscles( from ventral tip of hypomere).

\section*{DERIVATIVES OF THE MYOTOME Hypomere}
- In the thorax: intercostal muscles.
- In the abdomen: the oblique muscles \& rectus abdominis (from ventral tip) and quadratus lumborum

\section*{DERIVATIVES OF THE MYOTOME Hypomere}

\section*{Sacrococcygeal region}
- Pelvic diaphragm
- Perianal muscles

\section*{HYPOMERE}

\section*{HISTOGENESIS OF MUSCULAR TISSUE Skeletal muscle}

Migration of mesenchymal cells.
Mesenchymal differentiate into myoblasts.
Fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes.
Development of myofilaments in the cytoplasm of the myotubes
- Transformation of myotubes into myocytes
- Investment of myocytes by connective tissue

\section*{HISTOGENESIS OF MUSCULAR TISSUE Cardiac muscle}
> Mesenchymal cells are of splanchnic origin.
- Myoblasts establish intercalated disks between them.
- Some cardiac myocytes undergo an alternative pathway of differentiation to form the conduction system

\section*{FACTORS IN MUSCLE LOCATION, ORGANISATION AND MORPHOGENESIS.}
I. MIGRATION
Muscles of facial expression from the neck
- Trapezius from the head to neck \& back
- Latismus dorsi from the cervical region to the back.

\section*{FACTORS IN MUSCLE LOCATION, ORGANISATION AND MORPHOGENESIS.}

\section*{ii. FUSION}

Rectus abdominis from fusion of mesenchymal bars at the ventral tips of the abdominal hypomere.

\section*{FACTORS IN MUSCLE LOCATION, ORGANISATION AND MORPHOGENESIS}

\section*{iii. SPLITTING}
- Intercostal muscles
- Oblique abdominal muscles

\section*{FACTORS IN MUSCLE LOCATION, ORGANISATION AND MORPHOGENESIS}

\section*{IV. REGRESSION}

Some myotomes regress into aponeurosis and ligaments e.g abdominal aponeurosis,
Sacrospinous ligament the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.

\section*{FACTORS IN MUSCLE LOCATION, ORGANISATION AND MORPHOGENESIS}

\section*{V. INTERACTION WITH NERVES Muscle fibres which do not form functional units with nerves degenerate.}

\section*{VI. INFORMATION IN THE MESENCHYME}

\section*{MOLECULAR REGULATION OF MUSCLE DEVELOPMENT}
- Myogenic regulatory factors regulate transcription.
- They include, myogenic determining factor 1 (MyoD), myogenin, myf 5 and MRF 4.

\section*{GROWTH OF MUSCLE}

\section*{MECHANISMS}
1) Hypertrophy
2) Hyperplasia e.g. Uterus in pregnancy
3) In skeletal muscle, some undifferentiated cells called myosatellite cells may contribute to growth by forming new myoblasts

\section*{GROWTH OF MUSCLE}

\section*{FACTORS INFLUENCING:}
a) Nutrition
b) Innervation
c) Exercise
d) Hormones: anabolic steroids e.g testosterone lead to muscle growth, others include growth hormone

\section*{CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS absence}
palmaris longus, plantaris, pectoralis major etc.

Absence of some muscles may cause immobility of multiple joints

\section*{(ARTHROGRYPOSIS MULTIPLEX CONGENITA).}
- Absence of pectoralis major may be associated with breast defects \& limb malformations

Absent pect major + syndactyly (POLAND SYNDROME).

\section*{CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS}

\section*{2. CONGENITAL HYPOTONIA e.g PRUNE BELLY SYNDROME}

\section*{CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS Fibrosis}
> e.g congenital torticollis (wry neck) A muscle undergoes fibrosis due to vascular failure, in this case, sternoceidomastoid.

\section*{CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS}

\section*{4. CONGENITAL FAMILIAL WEAKNESS e.g congenital ptosis.}
