DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIMBS
}

\section*{Ngwazi DR. K.O. AWORI University of Nairobi}

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
I. ONTOGENY
- Sources of mesenchyme for limb development
- Limb development as a self-differentiating system.
- Stages of limb development
- Factors affecting limb development

\section*{OBJECTIVES}

\section*{II. TERATOLOGY}
- Mechanisms of limb malformations
- Common causes and examples of limb malformations

\section*{Introduction}
- Limbs are designed to serve mechanical functions.
- The upper limb functions include prehension and tactile sensibility.
- The lower limbs are for weight bearing and locomotion.

\section*{Introduction}
- Limb development is a complex process that is coordinated by various tissue components through close interaction.
- It begins only after musculature of the body wall beneath the undifferentiated limb bud is already well differentiated.

\section*{Introduction}

At any given time, upper limbs are more developed than the lower ones till the end of limb development when the two are nearly synchronised.

\section*{Sources of mesenchyme for development}
- Lateral plate mesoderm: bones, tendons, ligament connective tissue \& vasculature.
- Somitic mesoderm: gives rise to the musculature

\title{
Sources of mesenchyme for development
}

\section*{Neural crest:}
form melanocytes and Schwann cells.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}

Limb development begins with initiation of a group of mesenchymal cells in the lateral plate mesoderm.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}
- The signal for limb bud formation comes from LPM cells that will become the prospective limb mesenchyme.
- Around T1
- They produce FGF10
- Role of retinoic acid expression

\section*{Initiation of limb development}

The initiated mesoderm then influences the overlying surface ectoderm to thicken to form a limb disk.

Mesoderm to be considered as the prime mover of limb development.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}
- The primordium formed by the meso-ectodermal interaction, contains all the information required to attain the normal limb form even if removed from the body of the embryo;
- the so called self-differentiating system.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}

The homeobox genes are involved in limb development.

\section*{Organisation of the limb bud}
- The limb buds appear on the ventrolateral body wall by week 4
- The upper limb buds are visible by day 24 or 25 while the lower limb ones by day 27 or 28.

\section*{Organisation of the limb bud}
- The apical ectodermal ridge (AER) stimulates outgrowth by its influence on the progress zone.

\section*{Organisation of the limb bud}
- Fingers and toes form by programmed death (apoptosis) of cells between the digital rays.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues:}

\section*{BONE}
- Most limb bones ossify between week 5 and 12 except carpal bones and some tarsal bones that do after birth.
- The bones, except the clavicle ossify endochondrally
- Joints develop from mesenchymal interfaces.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues MUSCLES}

During the 5th week the mesenchyme from the somitic mesoderm upon migration, condenses into a ventral and dorsal masses with respect to the axial mesenchyme.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues MUSCLES}

These cells form individual muscle primordia that link with tendons and connective tissue components, and differentiate into myoblasts that give rise to various muscles of the limbs.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues MUSCLES}

While some muscles migrate generally,
- The dorsal mass gives rise to upper limb extensors and supinator and lower limb abductors,
- The ventral mass to flexors and pronators of the upper limb and flexors and adductors of the lower limb.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues NERVES}
- The innervation develops much later
- The limb muscles are innervated by the ventral primary rami of spinal nerves C5 to T1 and L4 to S3 for upper and lower limbs respectively.
- The dorsal divisions of the nerves supply the dorsal muscle mass while ventral divisions the ventral mass.

\section*{What determines the pattern of nerves in a limb (Axonal path-finding)?}
1. Configuration of other tissue components in the limb:
- in-growing nerves follow environmental cues. The growth cones of axons avoid or may be unable to penetrate regions with dense mesenchyme or with glycosaminoglycans.
2. Pre-determined structures:
- That the axons home-in upon the structures they are pre-determined to innervate.

\section*{Limb rotation}
- The limb buds rotate from their original coronal orientation into a more or less parasagittal orientation.
- They rotate through $90^{\circ}$ around their long axis, the upper limbs laterally and the lower ones medially.

\section*{II. TERATOLOGY}

\section*{Aetiology}
- In majority, the cause is unknown
- In most cases the cause is multi-factorial, resulting from interaction between genetic and environmental factors.
- Some of the environmental factors include chemicals/drugs such as thalidomide (amelia/phocomelia), and retinoic acid,
- Oligohydriamnios is associated with the amniotic band disruption complex

\section*{CLASSIFICATION \& EXAMPLES}
1. Failure of formation (amelia, phocomelia, congenital amputations, absence of radius or ulnar, tibia or fibula)
2. Failure of differentiation (syndactyly)
3. Duplication (polydactyly)
4. Overgrowth (macrodactyly or gigantism)
5. Undergrowth
6. Constriction bands
7. Generalized skeletal abnormalities (club foot)
