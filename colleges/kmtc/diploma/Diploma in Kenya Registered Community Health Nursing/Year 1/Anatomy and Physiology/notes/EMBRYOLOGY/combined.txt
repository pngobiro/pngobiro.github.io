\section*{Cell cycle and it's regulation}

Dr. B. M. Ndung'u Lecturer, Dept of Human Anatomy UoN

\section*{Objectives}
* To understand the processes and the phases of the cell cycle.
* To appreciate the cellular events of each phase of the cell cycle.
* Introduce the molecular basis of the phases of mitosis.
* To appreciate the presence of cycle check-points and their role in carcinogenesis.

\section*{Cell Cycle}
* The cell cycle is an ordered set of events culminating in cell growth and division into two daughters cells.
* Cell division is controlled by a highly regulated series of biochemical events - the cell division cycle (cdc).
* The four coordinated processes of the cycle are:
$\checkmark$ Cell growth.
$\checkmark$ DNA replication.
$\checkmark$ Distribution of the duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells.

\section*{Cell Cycle Contd.}
$\checkmark$ Cell division (cytokinesis).
- Phases of the cycle.
$\checkmark$ Mitosis - nuclear division.
$\checkmark$ Interphase - time between consecutive mitosis.
* The interphase consists of:
* G1 (gap 1) phase.
$\checkmark$ Interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA replication.

\section*{Cell Cycle Contd.}
${ }^{\checkmark}$ Cell is metabolically active, exhibits continuous growth and prepares the chromosomes for replication.
*S- (synthesis) phase.
$\checkmark$ Synthesis and replication of DNA and centrosomes
- the microtubules organising centre.
* G2 (gap 2) phase.
$\checkmark$ Protein synthesis.
$\checkmark$ Cell growth continues.

\section*{Cell Cycle Contd.}

G0 (quiescent stage).
$\checkmark$ Cells are metabolically active but no longer proliferate unless stimulated by appropriate extracellular signals.
$\checkmark$ Not considered to be part of the cell cycle.

\section*{Cell Cycle}
- Time cell comes into existence until that cell divides again
- Rapidly growing human cells $20-24 \mathrm{hr}$
- Liver cells 1-2 year
- Neurons 1 only
- Quiescent $\mathrm{G}_{0}$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-07.jpg?height=945&width=852&top_left_y=666&top_left_x=1277)

\section*{Cell Lifespan}
- Neutrophil
- 6-7 hours circulating
- 4 days in tissue
- Red blood cell
- 120 days
- Brain neuron
- 50-100 years
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-08.jpg?height=945&width=731&top_left_y=695&top_left_x=1242)

\section*{Regulation of the Cell Cycle}
* Critical for the normal development of multicellular organisms.
* A breakdown/defect in the regulation leads to 'out of control' growth which ultimately leads to cancer.

\section*{Regulation of the Cell Cycle}

Progression between cell cycle stages is controlled by conserved 'regulatory apparatus' which;
$\checkmark$ Coordinates the different events of the cycle.
$\checkmark$ Links the cycle with extra-cellular signals that control cell proliferation.
* 'Regulatory apparatus' are an interplay of many molecules.

\section*{Events of the Phases}
- Reasons for cell division;
> Growth.
> Repair and replacement of damaged parts.
- Reproduction of species.

\section*{M-phase}
* Mitosis ; formation of identical daughters cells.
* Basic events of mitosis.
$\checkmark$ Chromosomes condensation.
$\checkmark$ Formation of the mitotic spindle.
$\checkmark$ Attachment of chromosomes to the spindle.
$\checkmark$ Separation of sister chromatids and movement to the opposite poles of the spindle.
$\checkmark$ Formation of daughters nuclei.
* Stages/ phases of mitosis- PMAT.

\section*{Mitosis- Prophase}
- Chromosome DNA has been earlier duplicated (S Phase)
- Chromosomes begin condensing
- Chromosome pairs (chromatids) held together at centromere
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-14.jpg?height=629&width=963&top_left_y=553&top_left_x=1353)
- Microtubules disassemble
- Mitotic spindle begins to form
- At end of prophase nuclear envelope breaks down
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-14.jpg?height=444&width=913&top_left_y=1283&top_left_x=1364)

\section*{Prophase}
* Condensation of chromosomes.
$\checkmark$ Critical in enabling the movement along the mitotic spindle.
$\checkmark$ Mediated by phosphorylation of core histone H3 through interaction with the codensin complex.
$\checkmark$ The codensin-complex results from interaction of AKAP95 (A-kinase anchoring protein), PKA (cAMPdependent protein kinase) and EG 7; A 150 KD inductive nuclear protein.

Cohesins and condensins help configure replicated chromosomes for segregation

Condensins $\gg$ chromosome condensation

\section*{Prophase}
* Cytoplasmic changes leading to the development of the mitotic spindle by selective stablization of interacting microtubules.
* Nucleolus disintegrates and the nuclear membranes dissolves.
* Induced by MPF (promoting factor) and cdc 2 phosphorylation of nuclear lamina and golgi matrix protein (GM130).

\section*{Kinetochores attach chromosomes to the mitotic spindle}

Kinetochore: a complex protein machine that assembles onto the highly condensed DNA at the centromere during late prophase

\section*{Metaphase}
* Chromosomes arranges in the plane of the spindle equator- the equatorial /metaphase plate.
* Each chromosone divides longitudinally to form the sister chromatids.
* The kinetochore controls entry into anaphase so that the process of mitosis does not progress until all chromatid pairs are aligned at the cell equator.
* This metaphase check point prevents the formation of daughter cells with unequal number of chromosomes.

\section*{Mitotic Spindle}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-22.jpg?height=849&width=2013&top_left_y=618&top_left_x=231)

\section*{Mitosis- Metaphase}
- Kinetochore MTs align chromosomes in one midpoint plane
- Metaphase ends when sister kinetochores separate
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-23.jpg?height=1109&width=929&top_left_y=586&top_left_x=1379)

\section*{Anaphase}
- Marked by splitting of the centromere and the pulling of the chromosomes to opposite poles of the spindle.
* Progression from metaphase to anaphase results from activation of anaphase-promoting complex (cyclosome) (APC/c) which remains inhibited until a cell passes the metaphase check point.

\section*{Anaphase}
* APC/c triggers the events leading to;
$\checkmark$ Destruction of cohesins ; allows separation of sister chromatids.
$\checkmark$ Degradation of the mitotic cyclin B which leads to inactivation of m-promoting factor.
- Divided into anaphase-a and anaphase- B.

\section*{Sister chromatids separate suddenly at anaphase (cont'd)}
by two independent and overlapping processes:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-26.jpg?height=1234&width=1053&top_left_y=616&top_left_x=156)

ANAPHASE E
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-26.jpg?height=346&width=890&top_left_y=704&top_left_x=1379)
(1) a ulding force it generated between overlap microtubules from opposity poiss ito pash the pales apart;
(2) a pulling force acts divectly on the poles to move them apart
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_a0372e7c51f42d67f19fg-26.jpg?height=451&width=1018&top_left_y=1407&top_left_x=1315)

\section*{Both pushing and pulling forces contribute to anaphase B}

Motor proteins may act in anaphase B

\section*{Telophase}
$\checkmark$ Chromosomes uncoil to regain their interphase conformation.
$\checkmark$ Nuclear envelope reassembles. Nucleolus becomes apparent.
$\checkmark$ Cytokinesis also takes place during telophase.

\section*{Telophase}
- Inactivation of MPF and dephosphorylation of proteins that it had phosphorylated leads to nuclear, microtubules and membrane changes that characterize the end of m-phase.
* Cytokinesis is mediated by a contractile ring of actin and myosin II filaments beneath the plasma membrane at the position of the mitotic spindle.

\section*{Mitosis- Cytokinesis}
- Division of cytoplasmic contents
- Contractile ring
- forms at midpoint under membrane
- Microfilament ring

- Contracts forming cleavage furrow
- Eventually fully divides cytoplasm

\section*{Actin and myosin II in the contractile ring generate the force for cytokinesis}

The contractile ring begins to assemble as the astral MT in anaphase become longer lived and less dynamic in response to the loss of M-Cdk activity; regulated by polo-like family protein kinases dividing slime mold

\section*{Interphase}
$\checkmark$ Time between successive mitosis.
> Gap 1 phase (presynthesis).
* Period of cell growth, DNA and protein synthesis in preparation for next division or specialized function.
* During this time, the cell monitors it's environment and it's own size then decides the appropriate time to enter S-phase.
* Most variables cycle period time-wise among different type of cells.
* Can end in Go-phase.

\section*{Interphase}
> Synthetic phase (S/ DNA synthesis phase).
$\checkmark$ Synthesis and replication of DNA.
$\checkmark$ Duplication of the centrosomes with their centrioles.
- Gap 2 phase.
* Period between the end of DNA replication and mitosis.

\section*{Control of the Cell Cycle}
- Passage of a cell through the cycle is controlled by cytoplasmic proteins called cyclins.
* Cyclins.
$\checkmark$ G1 cyclin (cyclin D).
$\checkmark$ S-phase cyclin (cyclins E and A).
$\checkmark$ Mitotic cyclins (cyclins B and A).
* Their levels in the cell rise and fall with the stages of the cell cycle.

\section*{Control of the Cell Cycle}
* Cyclin- dependent kinases (cdks).
$\checkmark$ A G1 cdk (cdk4).
$\checkmark$ An S-phase cdk (cdk2).
$\checkmark$ An M-phase cdk (cdk1).
* Their levels in the cell remain fairly stable but must bind the appropriate cyclin (whose levels fluctuate) in order to be activated.
* They add phosphate groups to a variety of protein substrates that control processes in the cell cycle.
* A rising level of G1 cyclin bind to their cdks and signal the cell to prepare the chromosomes for replication.

\section*{Cell Cycle- Regulators}
- Cyclins

\section*{Follicular phase}
- Follicular stimulating hormone stimulates maturation of follicles
- Competition for dominance
- Only one follicle reaches maturation
- Maturing follicles secrete estradiol
- Estrodial (estrogen) stimulates production of GnRH which causes production of FSH and LH
- Sloughed endometrium is built up (proliferative phase)
- Day 5-13

\section*{Ovulation}
- LH causes release of secondary oocyte which matures to ootid then ovum
- Occurs from day 12-13 and may last 2 days
- Only one ovum is released from the ovary
- Uptake of the ovum at the fimbria transported to the ampulla
Fertilization within 36 hrs

\section*{Luteal phase}

Corpus luteum is significant
- Its growth is under influence of LH and FSH
- Produces progesterone and estrogen
- Progesterone has these effects:
-Prepares endometrium for implantation
- Causes rise in body temperature
- The products have negative feedback to LH/FSH production
- Involution of corpus luteum
- Falling levels of progesterone causes sloughing of the endometrium and marks the beginning of a new cycle.

\section*{Menstruation phase}
- Ist day of menses marks the $I^{\text {st }}$ day of female reproductive cycle
- Takes place between day I to day 6 (3-6 days)
- Maximum of 80 mls of blood is lost (average 35 mls )
- Some heavy losses, (cause aneamia?) painful losses
Blood does not clot, why?
- Most women are happier, why?

\section*{Proliferative phase}
- Facilitated by FSH and E2
- Build up of the stratum functionale
- Renewal of the connective tissue, increase in vascularity
- Thickening of the endometrium

\section*{Secretory phase}

Characteristics:
stroma becomes loose and edematous blood vessels entering the endometrium become thickened and twisted glands become tortuous and contain secretory material within the lumina

Reason for the name 'secretory phase'

What happens if fertilization takes?

\section*{Embryo produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)}
- Has similar polypeptide sequence as LH
- Maintains corpus luteum and its functions
- hCG is the specific to human embryo

\section*{Changes in other genital structures}

- Methods used to delineate awareness are:

Calender based
Symptoms based
Urine kits

\section*{Clinical application \\ - Catamenial epilepsy}
- McClintock effect (synchronization of menses)
- Anovulatory cycles
- Menorrhgia, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea.
- Hormonal contraception
- If women are supposed to be less rational and more emotional at the beginning of menstrual cycle when the sex hormones are their lowest, then why isn't it logical to say that, in those few days, women behave the most like the way men behave all month long?" Gloria Steinem

\begin{abstract}
The basic biology of the menstrual cycle is a complex, coordinated sequence of events involving the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, ovary, and endometrium. The menstrual cycle with all its complexities can be easily perturbed by environmental factors such as stress, extreme exercise, eating disorders, and obesity. Furthermore, genetic influences such as fragile X premutations (Chapter X), X chromosome abnormalities (Chapter X), and galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) point mutations (galactosemia) also contribute to perturbations of the menstrual cycle. Although not perfect, mouse model have helped to identify and confirm additional components and pathways in menstrual cycle function and dysfunction in humans.

\section*{Overview of the Menstrual Cycle in Humans}

Figure 1 shows a general overview of the key regulatory factors in the menstrual cycle. The hypothalamus secretes gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) which stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete both follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH are heterodimeric members of the glycoprotein hormone family and have an $\alpha: \mathrm{FSH} \beta$ and $\alpha: \mathrm{LH} \beta$ non-covalent structure, respectively. The $\alpha$ subunit is common to all glycoprotein hormone family members. The levels and timing of secretion of each gonadotropin is correlated by GnRH, feedback from sex steroid hormones, and other autocrine and paracrine factors such as inhibin and activin. The gonadotropins stimulate the ovary to produce the steroid hormones, estrogen or progesterone as well as several key autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine peptides. Similar to the pituitary, ovarian steroidogenesis is regulated by multiple factors. The ovarian steroid hormones in turn stimulate endometrial proliferation and affect many end organs. Although estrogen and progesterone have some feedback at the level of the hypothalamus, the more dynamic feedback occurs at the level of the anterior pituitary. Folliculogenesis, ovulation, luteinization, and endometrium growth and decline during the menstrual cycle depend on the above-mentioned autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors produced from this axis ${ }^{1}$.

\section*{Oocyte Development}

In humans, germ cells begin to develop at $5-6$ weeks of gestation ${ }^{1,2}$. These cells migrate to the genital ridge and multiply, giving a finite number of germ cells by the time of birth in females. These germ cells will be encapsulated by "pre-granulosa" cells to become oocytes at the primordial follicle stage. At this point, the oocyte will arrest at the diplotene stage of meiosis. Oocytes are surrounded by supporting cells called granulosa cells, while thecal cells surround the follicle after the primary follicle stage. The surrounding cells as well as the oocyte itself secrete factors which regulate folliculogenesis ${ }^{3}$. Folliculogenesis is the process of preparing a single oocyte from a primordial follicle for ovulation ${ }^{1,4,5}$. Figure 2 shows the anatomy of a follicle with representative factors.

\section*{Overview of Ovarian Folliculogenesis}

In the ovary, folliculogenesis can simply be divided into the follicular phase, prior to ovulation, and the luteal phase, after ovulation ${ }^{1}$. Figure 3 depicts the stages of ovarian folliculogenesis in humans. Ovarian folliculogenesis begins with the recruitment from a pool of growing primordial follicles1. Despite intense work in both mice and other species, the critical signals that initiate the recruitment of primordial follicles are still unknown1, $6^{-8}$. After recruitment, these follicles grow and become primary follicles. Once the multilayer (secondary) follicles express FSH receptors, they are then subject to endocrine regulation.

In the presence of FSH, these follicles begin to grow even more and are competent to develop into an antral follicle. Without FSH, the follicles become atretic. The theca, a layer of cells surrounding the follicle, is formed first at the two-layer pre-antral follicle stage, and with exposure to low levels of LH, produces androgens in humans. Androgens are converted to estrogen via a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, CYP19 (aromatase) in the granulosa cells. FSH induces granulosa cell proliferation, induction of aromatase, and increased FSH receptors on the granulosa cells, thus leading to a very high estrogen microenvironment. With an increase in estrogen, the antral follicle develops further. At the pre-antral follicle stage, the follicle is a two cell (granulosa and thecal cells), two gonadotropin (FSH and LH) system. This cross talk between the granulosa and thecal cells results in high estrogen levels within the follicle. This high estrogen down regulates FSH from the anterior pituitary and begins the process of selecting for a single dominant follicle. Follicles that are not at the appropriate stage and are not able to maintain a high estrogen microenvironment without stimulation from FSH degenerate and become atretic follicles. This process selects for the dominant follicle ${ }^{1}$.

The very high estrogen levels feed back to the anterior pituitary to induce the LH surge, which ultimately leads to ovulation. During ovulation, the oocyte is expulsed from the follicle with cumulus granulosa cells surrounding it. The remaining follicular cells in the ovary become luteinized as part of the corpus luteum which secretes progesterone. During the luteal phase, the granulosa cells within the corpus luteum also produce inhibin A, an $\alpha$ : $\beta$ A heterodimeric member of the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF $\beta$ ) superfamily, which acts as an endocrine hormone to suppresses pituitary FSH, inhibiting growth of other ovarian follicles. With no fertilization or implantation of the embryo, the corpus luteum degenerates, possibly in response to activin, homodimers ( $\beta \mathrm{A}: \beta \mathrm{A}$ or $\beta \mathrm{B}: \beta \mathrm{B}$ ) or heterodimers ( $\beta \mathrm{A}: \beta \mathrm{B}$ ) that share the $\beta$ subunits with inhibin A and inhibin $\mathrm{B}(\alpha: \beta \mathrm{B})$. When inhibin and progesterone levels fall with regression of the corpus luteum, suppression of FSH is released. At the luteal-follicular transition, FSH levels increase, and the next menstrual cycle begins ${ }^{1}$.

With fertilization and implantation, the corpus luteum is maintained by stimulation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by the placenta. HCG ( $\alpha: C G \beta$ ) is also a member of
the glycoprotein hormone family along with LH, FSH, and thyroid stimulating hormone ( $\alpha:$ TSH $\beta$; TSH), sharing the same common $\alpha$ subunit and binding to identical gonadal LH/ CG receptors as LH. HCG will peak at approximately the end of the first trimester. Detection of hCG in the urine (approximately 10 days after fertilization and shortly after implantation when hCG can enter the woman's bloodstream) is the major test of pregnancy. The rate of rise or fall of serum levels of hCG during the first trimester can be used to detect ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancies, and often-times, placental derived cancers such as hydatidform moles, gestational trophoblastic disease, and choriocarcinoma ${ }^{1}$.

Menstrual cycles continue for a woman until her finite population of oocytes is exhausted. Primary hypogonadism occurs in women with gonadal failure, low estrogen, with elevated FSH levels, also known as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. If these clinical findings are observed in a woman under 40, it is known as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).

\section*{Mouse Models with Folliculogenesis Defects}

Folliculogenesis in the mouse is similar to human ovarian folliculogenesis. To date, approximately 100 factors have been demonstrated to affect folliculogenesis or female fertility in mice using knockout or transgenic technology [reviewed in5]. Consistent with mouse models, mutations in some of these factors in mice have also been identified in humans, particularly in women with POI. Here, we attempt to review some of the factors shown to cause defects in mouse folliculogenesis that have mutations found in humans with POI.

One of the earliest genes involved in postnatal folliculogenesis is NOBOX. NOBOX is an oocyte-specific homeobox gene and is thought to be specifically expressed in the germ cells, primordial follicles, and growing oocytes ${ }^{9}$. NOBOX null female mice are infertile and have no follicular development past the primordial follicle stage. Furthermore, as these mice age, they have a decreased number of oocytes, or very early POI ${ }^{10}$.

Moving up to the anterior pituitary, the two most important extra-gonadal factors in ovarian folliculogenesis are FSH and LH. As mentioned earlier, FSH and LH share a common $\alpha$ subunit, but each has a unique $\beta$ subunit ${ }^{1}$. FSH $\beta$ null female mice are infertile with small ovaries. The FSH $\beta$ null mice have follicular arrest at the secondary follicle ${ }^{11}$. Similarly, $\mathrm{LH} \beta$ null female mice are infertile. The follicles in the $\mathrm{LH} \beta$ null animals arrest at the preovulatory follicle and undergo degeneration. Corpora lutea are not observed in these mice ${ }^{12}$. Not surprisingly, the gonadotropins are essential for folliculogenesis in the mouse.

Although orchestrated stimulation of the follicle by gonadotropins is important, the cells within the follicle secrete factors important for their own regulation. This crosstalk between the oocyte and the granulosa and thecal cells additionally regulates folliculogenesis4, 13. The factors secreted from these cells include the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF $\beta$ ) family of proteins. The expression of these factors is not only temporally regulated within the menstrual cycle, but also spatial regulated. The oocyte secretes growth and differentiation factor 9 (GDF9), bone morphogenic protein 15 (BMP15), and BMP6 while the granulosa cells secrete activins and inhibins. The thecal cells secrete TGF $\beta 1$, TGF $\beta 2$, BMP4, and BMP7. All of these factors act as autocrine and paracrine factors and influence folliculogenesis [reviewed in3].

GDF9, the first oocyte factor discovered, is a member of the TGF $\beta$ superfamily. GDF9 is expressed in the oocyte from early folliculogenesis through ovulation and controls the function of ovarian follicles. GDF9 null female mice are infertile and have small ovaries. Histological analysis of GDF9 null mice ovaries shows a block in folliculogenesis at the
primary follicle. Thus, GDF9 is important in early folliculogenesis, essential for the primary and secondary follicle transition ${ }^{7}$.

Additionally, GDF9 is important in later stages of folliculogenesis. Specifically, it is important for cumulus cell expansion. The cumulus is the layer of granulosa cells directly surrounding the oocytes along with its rich hyaluronic acid matrix. The mural granulosa cells line the follicle wall (Figure 2). During the peri-ovulatory period, the cumulus granulosa cells undergo expansion in preparation for ovulation. The cumulus protects the oocyte from the harsh environment, helps with extrusion of the cumulus oocyte complex, and permits capture of the freshly ovulated oocyte by the fibria. Importantly, it also enhances the ability of the sperm to fertilize the ovary in vivo ${ }^{13-21}$. In vitro, GDF9 exposure results in the expansion of mouse cumulus cells, suggesting its critical role in the function of this complex ${ }^{22-24}$.

BMP15 is another TGF $\beta$ family member that is homologous to GDF9 and is also important for folliculogenesis in the mouse. BMP15 null female animals are subfertile but not infertile. Thus, BMP15 is important but not as essential as GDF9 in the mouse. When the BMP15 null mice were bred to the GDF9 mice, the BMP15 null, GDF9 heterozygote female mice were even more subfertile than the BMP15 null mutation alone. These double mutant mice had late folliculogenesis defects noted on ovarian histology, having decreased numbers of late stage follicles. BMP15 and GDF9 may play synergistic roles in folliculogenesis as suggested by the more severe fertility defects in the heterozygous GDF9 and BMP15 knockout mice. Furthermore, the ratio of the number of oocytes ovulated to embryos created was extremely low. Of significant note, these double mutant animals lacked cumulus cell expansion. Thus, BMP15 and GDF9 play important complementary roles in cumulus cell expansion ${ }^{25}$.

Four major genes downstream of GDF9 in cumulus expansion are cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), hyaluronase synthase 2, pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ induced protein 6 (TNFAIP6). COX2, PTX3, and TNFAIP6 mutant mice have also been produced and show cumulus expansion and female fertility defects ${ }^{26-} 28$. Thus, these studies confirm the importance of these factors downstream of GDF9/BMP pathway in cumulus cell expansion and mouse fertility.

These factors are only the beginning of the list of autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors involved in female fertility. Many more mouse models that display reproductive phenotypes have been created to understand the menstrual cycle, female infertility, and premature ovarian insufficiency [reviewed in5]. The studies below in humans will go into the genetic defects and the translational aspect of this work in the clinic.

\section*{Human models of ovarian dysfunction}

Although the above members of the TGF $\beta$ superfamily play important roles in folliculogenesis in mice, the correlation to human premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is not so simple. Many of the factors described above as important in mouse folliculogenesis have been directly sequenced in patients with POI. However, mutations in these genes seem to be uncommon factors in the pathophysiology of POI.

Multiple studies over many years have attempted to discover gene mutations involved in POI. Early studies focused on gonadotropin gene and gonadotropin receptor defects [reviewed in29]. Mutations in the $\alpha$ subunit of the glycoprotein hormone family have not been found in women with POI. Until recently, mutations in LH $\beta$ had not been found in women with POI. Recently, one woman with secondary amenorrhea was found to have a point mutation in exon 2 of the $\mathrm{LH} \beta$ gene. This mutation caused a frame shift of exon 3 and

LH deficiency, leading to her secondary amenorrhea. However, she did not have elevated levels of FSH30. Mutations in the FSH $\beta$ gene have been found in women with primary amenorrhea and infertility. This mutation is a 2 base pair deletion, resulting in a stop codon, and early ovarian failure. Females with mutations in the LH receptor (LHR) have primary amenorrhea with elevated FSH levels, POI. Females with FSH receptor (FSHR) mutations also have POI, demonstrating ovarian dysgenesis and lack of ovarian follicle development29. Overall, these studies reveal that mutations in gonadotropins or their receptors are involved in human folliculogenesis and some isolated cases of POI, but are not a common cause of clinical POI.

Over the years, more sophisticated gene chip and computational experiments have discovered additional candidate genes for POI. However, mutations in these genes in humans with POI are still uncommon. For example, in humans with POI, NOBOX gene mutations are present in $<1 \%$ of analyzed population ${ }^{31}$. Additionally, mutations in GDF9 or BMP15 are found in few patients with POI32 ${ }^{-} 38$. In one of the largest studies of women with POI, 6 of 166 women with POI had missense substitutions in BMP15, but 0 out of 392 controls had this variation in BMP15. Additional variations were found in BMP15 in both the POI and control population39. Although statistically significant, the functional significance of many of these mutations (except the BMP15 mutation in two sisters with infertility40) have not been demonstrated. Overall, NOBOX, GDF9, and BMP15 mutations do not appear to be common causes of POI, but other factors within the TGF $\beta$ signaling pathway may be important.

\section*{Overview of the Cyclic Endometrium}

The endometrium is one of the most sensitive organs to ovarian steroid hormones. The endometrium is composed of two layers. The most luminal layer is the functionalis which is thickened and sloughed in response to ovarian hormones. The basalis is closest to the myometrium and remains throughout the menstrual cycle ${ }^{1}$.

The endometrium can simply be divided into the proliferative phase, corresponding to the follicular phase in the ovary, and the secretory phase, corresponding to the luteal phase in the ovary. Figure 4 shows a representation of the endometrium throughout the menstrual cycle. In menstrual cycle dating, the first day of the menstrual bleed is considered day 1. During the menstrual phase, the endometrium undergoes changes and is sloughed in women, due to low estrogen levels. The proliferative phase is defined as the period of time from the menstrual phase to ovulation. As estrogen levels begin to rise, the endometrial lining thickens, giving a proliferative pattern. Estrogen leads to a proliferation of stroma and glands and elongation of the spiral arteries. The secretory phase is from ovulation until menstruation. After ovulation, progesterone levels begin to rise in the early secretory phase. This leads to secretion of glycogen and mucus. In the mid-secretory phase, the endometrium becomes decidualized and receptive to a fertilized embryo. In the late secretory phase, in the absence of pregnancy, and with the accompanying drop in both estrogen and progesterone, the spiral arteries vasoconstrict, leading to involution of the endometrium. The cycle then repeats ${ }^{1}$.

\section*{Mouse Models with Endometrial Dysfunction}

Numerous factors have been demonstrated to play a role in implantation, decidualization, or embryo spacing in knockout mouse models. These factors include cytokines, transcription factors, ovarian hormones, and other autocrine/paracrine factors [reviewed in41-44]. Additionally, a mouse model of endometriosis has been created45.

Estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) are obviously important in the development of the endometrium. E2 signals through either estrogen receptor alpha (ER $\alpha$ ) or beta (ER $\beta$ ) to activate a number of estrogen responsive genes. P4 signals through progesterone receptor A (PRA) and B (PRB) to activate a number of progesterone responsive genes in the mouse ${ }^{42}$.

ER $\alpha$ null mice are infertile, have abnormalities of the female reproductive tract, and cannot support implantation. However, $\mathrm{ER} \beta$ null mice support implantation. Leukemia inhibitory factor is a member of the IL-6 family and is a down stream target for estrogen. LIF null mice do not support implantation, although a similar role of LIF in humans has not been observed. Thus, $\mathrm{ER} \alpha$ and cytokines, perhaps acting downstream of $\mathrm{ER} \alpha$, are important to maintain endometrial receptivity ${ }^{42}$.

Progesterone receptor null mice (lacking both PRA and PRB) also have reproductive tract anomalies and lack of decidualization. However, PRB null mice have normal reproductive features suggesting that PRA is more important to reproduction and possibly endometrial function in the mouse. Indian hedge hog (IHH) is a progesterone responsive gene. IHH null mice with conditional deletion in the uterus are infertile due to lack of a decidual response ${ }^{42}$. Thus, PRA and progesterone responsive genes are important for the decidual response during endometrial receptivity.

For successful pregnancy to occur, the endometrium must be receptive, the blastocyst must come into contact with the endometrium, and the blastocyst must penetrate the decidua to access a blood supply. The homeobox transcription factors, HOXA10 and HOXA11, are expressed during the window of receptivity in both mice and humans and are important for decidualization. HOXA10 null mice are subfertile. They demonstrate a failure of embryos to implant and the uterus to decidualize, most likely due to a lack of stromal proliferation. HOXA11 null mice have a more severe phenotype with hypoplastic uteri and failure of implantation. FKBP52 null mice have defects in luminal closure of the uterus during implantation and thus defects in apposition of the blastocysts to the endometrium. Prostaglandins are important for increased vascular permeability at the time of implantation. PTGS2 (COX2) null animals are deficient in the enzyme which mediates prostaglandin synthesis and are infertile ${ }^{41}$.

Most mouse models of endometriosis use autologous endometrial tissue transplanted into the abdominal cavity to reproduce the phenotypic endometriotic peritoneal implants. However, the single mutant K-ras oncogene mouse developed peritoneal endometriotic implants by 8 months of age. Furthermore, when the K-ras oncogene mouse was crossed with a Pten conditional mouse, the mice developed endometrioid ovarian cancers which are more common in women with endometriosis. Currently, this is the only genetic mouse model for endometriosis ${ }^{45}$.

\section*{Human Models with Endometrial Dysfunction}

In the human, a coordinated response to estrogen and progesterone leads to the cyclic changes in the endometrium. With inappropriate thickening or decidualization of the endometrium, clinical problems such as break through bleeding, metrorhagia, or cancer occur. Furthermore, endometrial tissue located outside the uterine cavity as in the case of endometriosis is still hormonally sensitive, potentially leading to cyclic pain. Lastly, an endometrium that is not receptive to a blastocyst will not support a normal pregnancy, and thus defects in receptivity of the endometrium lead to infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss ${ }^{1}$.

Since the endometrium is a hormonally-responsive organ, the gene expression profile changes dependent on the phase of the cycle. Gene expression projects over the years have
attempted to create a database of gene expression patterns based on timing of the cycle for normal women. Some of this data can be found in the Gene Expression Omniobus http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.

In humans, the receptive phase is $7-10$ days into the secretory phase, designated as $7-10$ days past the LH surge (LH+7-10) (Figure 4). Prior to this, the endometrium is not supportive of a blastocyst. After this receptive phase, the endometrium is hostile to the blastocyst1. Multiple translational studies during the receptive phase have searched for factors responsible for receptivity defects, but no good candidates have been identified. Additionally, multiple gene expression studies have attempted to identify dysregulated genes at the receptive time point of the endometrium in women with infertility [reviewed in46]. Likewise, important factors for these receptivity defects have not yet been identified in humans.

Similar gene expression studies have attempted to determine dysregulated genes involved in endometriosis, but to date no good gene candidates have been discovered ${ }^{47-49}$. Recently, endometrium from patients with severe endometriosis at different times within the menstrual cycle was compared to endometrium from normal women using robust gene expression arrays. Although the expression of many genes was different, the progesterone responsive genes showed the most significant dysregulation. This confirms the progesterone resistance found with endometriosis. Furthermore, additional analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern did not fit the timing of the cycle, showing some delay in expression of early secretory genes. Thus, endometriosis and the resulting infertility may result from a combination of progesterone resistance and a menstrual cycle timing defect ${ }^{50}$. Additionally, mutation screening studies of women with endometriosis did not reveal any mutations in Kras or Pten ${ }^{51,52}$.

\section*{Conclusions}

The basic biology of the menstrual cycle is not so basic. However, mouse models have improved our understanding of folliculogenesis, implantation, and endometriosis in mammals. Even though the factors important in mouse folliculogenesis do not play a large role in POI, the concepts open avenues for further study and may lead to an understanding of human POI and eventually treatment. Furthermore, a better understanding of implantation and decidualization defects in mice may lead to treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss, infertility, and possibly endometriosis.

Figure 1. General overview of the important factors in the menstrual cycle
Regulation of the menstrual cycle begins with influences at the level of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus stimulates the anterior pituitary which stimulates the ovaries. One of the end organs for the ovarian sex hormones is the endometrium. The menstrual cycle is regulated by feed back and cross talk between these different components.

Figure 2. Anatomy of an ovarian follicle
This cartoon depicts the various cell types of an antral follicle and some of the factors secreted by each cell type. The oocyte is surrounded by cumulus granulosa cells, while the mural granulosa cells surround the antrum. The theca cells surround the entire follicle. Crosstalk between these cell types by the factors listed and others are important for ovarian folliculogenesis.

Figure 3. Stages of ovarian follicular development
Folliculogenesis requires a coordinated progression of growth of ovarian follicles. The process begins with the germ cells which are recruited to a pool of primordial follicles. The primordial follicles progress to primary and then secondary follicles. At the secondary follicle stage, theca cells are present. The early antral follicle stage is defined by the presence of antrum. The peri-ovulatory follicle stage is also known as the dominant follicle and is ready for ovulation. this stage, cumulus and mural granulosa cells are present. Once the oocyte is ovulated, the remaining granulosa cells become the corpus luteum. This cycle of folliculogenesis occurs for every single oocyte ovulated.

Figure 4. Endometrial lining throughout the menstrual cycle
The endometrial lining thickens in response to estrogen in the proliferative phase. After ovulation, the endometrium becomes decidualized in the secretory phase. The window of receptivity is $7-10$ days after the LH surge, near the time of ovulation. After the cycle is finished, menstruation occurs and the cycle begins again.

The zygote develops by undergoing cleavage
Individual cells are called blastomeres
12-32 cell stage is a morula
Cells are compacted due to rapid increase in number, but not size (zona pellucida still intact)

\section*{$1^{\text {ST }}$ WEEK OF DEVELOPMENT}
- The blastomeres take up fluid into a cavity (blastocyst cavity)
- Cells reorganize into two cellular populations - inner and outer cell masses
- The resultant structure is called a blastocyst
- The zona pellucida degenerate progressively (hatching) - early and late blastocyst

\section*{GASTRULATION}
- Key event - loss of epithelial characteristics of epiblast and hyopblast.
- The main important processes of gastrulation are formation of:
- Primitive streak
- Germ layers
- Notochord

\section*{THE PRIMITIVE STREAK}
- It develops at the beginning of $\mathbf{3}^{\text {rd }}$ week.
- Proliferation and migration of cells of the epiblast to the median plane of the embryonic disc.
- Cells leave the deep surface and form a loose network of embryonic connective tissue called MESENCYME OR MESOBLAST OR MESODERM.

\section*{SOURCES OF MESENCHYME}
- Definitions:
- Mesoderm refers to cells derived from the epiblast and extraembryonic tissues.
- Mesenchyme refers to loosely organized embryonic unspecialized cells that are set in a gelatinous ground substance.
- Sources:
- Mesoderm
- Primitive streak
- Somites.
- The somites differentiate to scleretome, myotome and dermatome.
- In early stages of differentiation, the somite cells show epithelial characteristics.
- Later, they loose this characteristic to form a loose jelly-like tissue - MESENCHYME.
- Mesodermal lateral plates.
- Neural crest cells especially in the head region

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF MESENCHYME}
- Mesenchyme consists of:
- cells
- intercellular ground substance
- Ability to differentiate in many different ways
- Ability to differentiate along a different pattern from their customary line (metaplasia)
- Ability to migrate and change their position and arrangement
- Cells are:
- Amoeboid - ability to move
- Different shapes:
- Stellate (star-shaped)
- Fusiform (spindle-shaped)
- Joined by cellular processes.
- Initially, ground substance is fluid, later it becomes a mucoid jelly containing scanty fibrils.

\section*{MORPHOGENESIS IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY CHANGES IN}
- The direction and number of cell divisions;
- Cell shape changes;
- Cell movement;
- Cell growth;
- Cell death;
- Changes in the composition of cell membrane and extracellular matrix.

\section*{FUNCTIONS}
- Forms supporting tissue of the embryo
- Forms most connective tissue of the body
- Forms stromal components or framework of glands
- Mesenchyme acts as "packing tissue" occupying all the spaces between the germ layers.
- Some mesenchymal cells persist in the adult connective tissue and under particular stimuli can differentiate along various lines.
- The mesoderm mesenchyme gives rise to:
- Connective tissue
- Cartilage
- Striated and smooth muscle
- Heart
- Kidneys
- Ovaries
- Tests
- Genital ducts
- Serous membranes lining the body cavities (pericardial, pleural and peritoneal)
- Spleen
- Cortex of suprarenal glands

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE}
- By $6^{\text {th }}$ week of development, mesenchymal cells join with their process forming a syncytium.
- Cells are spindle shaped.
- Delicate argyrophilic fibrils or marginal filaments develop along the peripheral area of the cytoplasm.
- Cells with many fibrils are called FIBROBLASTS.
- Fibroblasts are responsible for formation of fibres and ground substance of the supporting tissue.

- Process of fibre formation is fibrogenesis
- Fibrogenesis begins from basic embryonic molecule called tropocollagen.
- By $\mathbf{5}^{\text {th }}$ month, the fibrils have increased in number and thickness and are arranged in parallel bundles.
- The arrangement is correlated with the mechanical conditions under which the tissue will function.
- Reticular fibres arise by polymerization of tropocollagen.
- They are the first fibres to develop during wound healing.

Collagen Types
I - skin, bone, tendon cornea (most common type)
II- cartilage, embryonic cornea
III- reticular fibers, loose c.t., blood vessel walls, dermis
IV- basal lamina of epithelium
(no fibers, matrix of randomly-oriented molecules)

\section*{TYPES OF COLLAGEN}

\section*{Type Tissues}
- I Skin, tendon, bone, meniscus, annulus fibrosus
- II Articular cartilage, vitreous humor, nucleus pulposus
- III Skin, muscle, blood vessels
- IV basement membrane (basal lamina)
- V,VI,IX,X articular cartilage
- X Articular cartilage, mineralization of cartilage in hypertrophic zone of physis
- XI Articular cartilage
- XII Tendon
- XIII endothelial cells

\section*{ELASTOGENESIS}
- Production of elastic fibres (elastogenesis) follows the appearance of collagen fibres.
- Elastic fibres are produced by specialized fibroblasts referred to as ELASTOBLASTS.
- The first stage of elastogenesis is represented by condensation of fusiform mesenchymal cells.
- Later, short delicate filaments appear orientated along the axis of the tendon and among collagen fibres.
- Formation of elastic fibres proceeds further with an increase in thickness and correspondingly more organization of the surrounding collagen fibres.
- Elastic fibres are similar to collagen in content of glycine and proline but differ in the content of valine and desmocine.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF ADIPOSE TISSUE}
- Adipose tissue is formed by LIPOBLASTS which are cells capable of storing lipoidal material.
- The distribution of fat differs in both sex and varies in individuals.
- In the developing fetus, subcutaneous fat is laid down during the last two months as white adipose tissue.
- Brown adipose tissue has more cytochrome and flavoproteins which give it typical reddish-brown color.
- It is distributed in the following areas:
- Axilla
- Cervical region
- Interscapular area
- Mediastinum
- Aortic area
- Pararenal area
- Inguinal areas.
- Brown fat is used by the infant to generate heat.

\section*{ABNORMALITIES OF DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTIVE TISSUE}
- These are dependent on the type of connective tissue involved and the organ e.g. defective collagen fibres which are of various varieties may lead to defective blood vessels, cervical incompetence, lax joints etc.

\section*{Marfan Syndrome}
- An inherited disorder caused by a defective gene for the glycoprotein fibrillin resulting in abnormal development of elastic fibers.
- This causes tissues that contain many elastic fibers to be malformed or weak (including the covering of bone, ligament that suspends the lens of the eye, and the walls of large arteries.
- People with Marfan syndrome are often tall, have long arms, legs, fingers and toes, blurred vision, and weakened aortic walls that may burst.

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
- Understand the process of cartilage, bone and JOINT development
- Understand the embryological basis of cartilage and bone congenital malformation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_71ff980840d363eada8ag-47.jpg?height=1794&width=1452&top_left_y=15&top_left_x=521)

\section*{HISTOGENESIS OF CARTILAGE}
- Cartilage develops from mesenchyme.
- First appears in embryos during the $\mathbf{5}^{\text {th }}$ week.
- In areas where cartilage is to develop, the mesenchyme condenses to form chondrification centers.
- The mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondroblasts that secrete collagenous fibrils and the ground substance.
- Collagenous and/or elastic fibers are deposited in the intercellular substance or matrix.
- Three types of cartilage are distinguished according to the type of matrix that is formed:
- Hyaline cartilage, the most widely distributed type (e.g., in joints)
- Fibrocartilage (e.g., in intervertebral discs)
- Elastic cartilage (e.g., in auricle of ear)

\section*{Summary of chondrogenesis in the craniofacial skeleton}
- The three phases are precondensation, characterized by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (brown); condensation (yellow); and differentiation (blue).
- The precondensation phase is characterized by expression of Hox genes (CHox-1 [Hoxa 4], Barx-1), Msx-1, 2, the growth factors bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and[transforming growth factor $\beta$ [TGF- $\beta$ ], and syndecan-1. Versican, syndecan-3, and tenascin, which are present in low concentrations precondensation, are up-regulated at condensation.
- Other Hox genes and transcription factors (Hoxd-3, -13, Hoxa-2, Cdxa [Chox-4], Mhox, Ck-erg, and Cart-1) and other growth factors (activin, BMP-4, -5, and GDF-5) are expressed at condensation.
- The cell adhesion molecules neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) and N-cadherin also appear with condensation but are down-regulated during condensation.
- Heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans appear at condensation and are up-regulated during condensation.
- The transcriptional factor Pax-1 is present during and after condensation.
- Extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin, hyaluronan, and hyaladherin increase during condensation (yellow) but are down-regulated thereafter (blue).
- Collagen types II and IX and cartilage proteoglycan appear postcondensation, although mRNAs for the collagens and for the core protein of the proteoglycan are up-regulated during condensation.

\section*{CONDENSATION FORMATION}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_71ff980840d363eada8ag-51.jpg?height=1446&width=2116&top_left_y=170&top_left_x=192)

\section*{HISTOGENESIS OF BONE}
- Bone primarily develops in two types of connective tissue, mesenchyme and cartilage, but can also develop in other connective tissues.
- Like cartilage, bone consists of cells and an organic intercellular substance-the bone matrixthat comprises collagen fibrils embedded in an amorphous component.
- Osteogenesis and chondrogenesis are programmed early in development and are independent events under the influence of vascular events.

\section*{BONE FORMATION}
- Bone formation is termed osteogenesis or ossification.
- It is a process of transforming mesenchyme to bone.
- Bone first appearance - condensations of mesenchymal cells.
- Condensation marks the beginning of selective gene activity, which precedes cell differentiation.
- Two types of ossification occur.
- Intramembranous ossification is the formation of bone directly from or within fibrous connective tissue membranes.
- Endochondrial ossification is the formation of bone from hyaline cartilage models.
- Intramembranous ossification - no bone model.
- Endochondrial ossification - first form hyaline cartilage bone model.
- Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP-5 and BMP-7), the growth factor Gdf5, members of the transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) superfamily, and other signaling molecules have been implicated as endogenous regulators of chondrogenesis and skeletal development.

\section*{INTRAMEMBRANOUS OSSIFICATION}
- Mesenchyme forms a membranous sheath, hence, the name intramembranous ossification.
- Also called dermal ossification because it normally occurs in the deeper layers of connective tissue of the dermis of the skin.
- The mesenchyme condenses and becomes highly vascular.
- Some cells differentiate into osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and begin to deposit unmineralized matrix osteoid.
- Calcium phosphate is then deposited in the osteoid tissue as it is organized into bone.
- Osteoblasts are trapped in the matrix and become osteocytes.
- At first, new bone has no organized pattern.
- Spicules of bone soon become organized and coalesce into lamellae (layers).
- Concentric lamellae develop around blood vessels, forming osteons (haversian systems).
- Some osteoblasts remain at the periphery of the developing bone and continue to lay down lamellae, forming plates of compact bone on the surfaces.
- Between the surface plates, the intervening bone remains spiculated or spongy.
- Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells with a hematopoietic origin.
- In the interstices of spongy bone, the mesenchyme differentiates into bone marrow.
- During fetal and postnatal life, there is continuous remodeling of bone by the coordinated action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

\section*{ENDOCHONDRAL OSSIFICATION}
- Endochondral ossification is formation of bone from preexisting cartilaginous models.
- In a long bone, for example, the primary center of ossification appears in the diaphysis - the part of a long bone between its ends - that forms the shaft of the bone.
- At the center of ossification, chondrocytes increase in size (hypertrophy), the matrix becomes calcified, and the cells die.
- Concurrently, a thin layer of bone is deposited under the perichondrium surrounding the diaphysis; thus, the perichondrium becomes the periosteum.
- Invasion by vascular connective tissue from blood vessels surrounding the periosteum also breaks up the cartilage.
- Some invading cells differentiate into hemopoietic cells, blood cells, of the bone marrow.
- Transformation of cartilage model to bone proceeds towards the epiphyses (ends of the bone).
- The spicules of bone are remodeled by the action of osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

\section*{GROWTH IN THICKNESS}
- Bone grow in thickness or diameter by appositional growth.
- The steps in these process are:
- Periosteal cells differentiate into osteoblasts which secrete collagen fibers and organic molecules to form the matrix.
- Ridges fuse and the periosteum becomes the endosteum.
- New concentric lamellae are formed.
- Osetoblasts under the periosteum form new circumferential lamellae.

\section*{Bone Growth in Width}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_71ff980840d363eada8ag-74.jpg?height=591&width=2053&top_left_y=240&top_left_x=172)
- By appositional growth at the bone's surface
- Periosteal cells differentiate into osteoblasts and form bony ridges and then a tunnel around periosteal blood vessel.
- Concentric lamellae fill in the tunnel to form an osteon.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_71ff980840d363eada8ag-74.jpg?height=651&width=2241&top_left_y=1224&top_left_x=114)
- Lengthening of long bones occurs at the diaphysial-epiphysial junction.
- Cartilage cells in the diaphysial-epiphyseal region proliferate by mitosis.
- Toward the diaphysis, the cartilage cells hypertrophy and the matrix becomes calcified.
- Spicules are isolated from each other by vascular invasion from the medullary (marrow) cavity.
- Bone is deposited on these spicules by osteoblasts; resorption of this bone keeps the spongy bone masses relatively constant in length and enlarges the medullary cavity.
- Ossification of limb bones begins at the end of the embryonic period and thereafter makes demands on the maternal supply of calcium and phosphorus.
- Pregnant women are therefore advised to maintain an adequate intake of these elements to preserve healthy bones and teeth.
- At birth, the diaphyses are largely ossified, but most of the epiphyses are still cartilaginous.
- Secondary ossification centers appear in the epiphyses in most bones during the first few years after birth.
- Ossification spreads radially, and only the articular cartilage and a transverse plate of cartilage, the epiphysial cartilage plate, remain cartilaginous.
- Upon completion of growth, this plate is replaced by spongy bone; the epiphyses and diaphysis are united, and no further elongation of the bone occurs.
- In most bones, the epiphyses have fused with the diaphysis by the age of 20 years.
- The rate of deposition and resorption is balanced to regulate the thickness of the compact bone and the size of the medullary cavity.
- The internal reorganization of bone continues throughout life.
- In addition to membranous and endochondral ossification, chondroid tissue, which also differentiates from mesenchyme, is now recognized as an important factor for skeletal growth.

\section*{FACTORS THAT AFFECT BONE GROWTH}
- Minerals
- Vitamins
- Hormones
- Exercise

\section*{Minerals}

Calcium

Phosphorus
Magnesium
Boron

Manganese

Makes bone matrix hard
Hypocalcemia: low blood calcium levels.
Hypercalcemia: high blood calcium levels.
Makes bone matrix hard Deficiency inhibits osteoblasts May inhibit calcium loss, increase levels of estrogens Inhibits formation of new bone tissue

\section*{Vitamins}

Vitamin A Controls activity, distribution, and coordination of osteoblasts/osteoclasts
Vitamin B12 May inhibit osteoblast activity
Vitamin C Helps maintain bone matrix, deficiency leads to decreased collagen production which inhibits bone growth and repair
(scury) disorder due to a lack of Vitamin C
Vitamin D (Calcitriol) Helps build bone by increasing calcium absorption.
Deficiencies result in "Rickets" in children

\section*{Hormones}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Human Growth Hormone & Promotes general growth of all body tissue and normal growth in children \\
\hline Insulin-like Growth Factor & Stimulates uptake of amino acids and protein synthesis \\
\hline Insulin & Promotes normal bone growth and maturity \\
\hline Thyroid Hormones & Promotes normal bone growth and maturity \\
\hline Estrogen and Testosterone & Increases osteogenesis at puberty and is responsible for gender differences of skeletons \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{RICKETS}
- Rickets is a disease that occurs in children who have a vitamin D deficiency.
- This vitamin is required for calcium absorption by the intestine.
- The resulting calcium deficiency causes disturbances of ossification of the epiphysial cartilage plates (i.e., they are not adequately mineralized), and there is disorientation of cells at the metaphysis.
- The limbs are shortened and deformed, with severe bowing of the limb bones.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF JOINTS}
- Joints begin to develop with the appearance of the interzonal mesenchyme during the $6^{\text {th }}$ week, and by the end of the $8^{\text {th }}$ week, they resemble adult joints.
- Joints are classified as fibrous joints, cartilaginous joints, and synovial joints.
- Joints with little or no movement are classified according to the type of material holding the bones together, for example, the bones involved in fibrous joints are joined by fibrous tissue.

Development of joints during the $6^{\text {th }}$ and $7{ }^{\text {th }}$ weeks. A, Condensed interzonal mesenchyme in the gap between the developing bones. This primordial joint may differentiate into: a synovial joint (B), a cartilaginous joint (C), or a fibrous joint (D).

\section*{FIBROUS JOINTS}
- During the development of fibrous joints, the interzonal mesenchyme between the developing bones differentiates into dense fibrous tissue, for example, the sutures of the cranium are fibrous joints.

\section*{CARTILAGINOUS JOINTS}
- During the development of cartilaginous joints, the interzonal mesenchyme between the developing bones differentiates into hyaline cartilage (e.g., the costochondral joints) or fibrocartilage (e.g., the pubic symphysis).

\section*{SYNOVIAL JOINTS}
- During the development of synovial joints (e.g., the knee joint), the interzonal mesenchyme between the developing bones differentiates as follows:
- Peripherally it forms the capsular and other ligaments.
- Centrally it disappears, and the resulting space becomes the joint cavity or synovial cavity.
- Where it lines the joint capsule and articular surfaces, it forms the synovial membrane (which secretes synovial fluid), a part of the joint capsule (fibrous capsule lined with synovial membrane)
- An abnormal intrauterine environment restricting embryonic and fetal movements may interfere with limb development and cause joint fixation.

\section*{Fetal membranes: Chorion and Placenta}

Obimbo MM,

\section*{Lecture objectives}
- At the end of this lecture, you should be able to:
- Specify the development and functions of chorion and placenta
- Discuss the disorders related to the development of chorion and placenta

Fetal membranes are membranous/auxiliary structures that surround or associated with vertebrate embryo but do NOT take part in final embryo formation.

Include:
I-Amnion.
2-Yolk sac.
3-Allantois.
4-Connecting stalk and umbilical cord.
5-Chorion

Placenta.

\section*{Chorion}
- One of the embryonic membranous structures than encloses both the fetus as well as the amnion.
- Consists of two layers: an outer formed by the trophoblast, and an inner by the somatic extraembryonic mesoderm
- The chorion begins to form chorionic villi towards its outer surface, which initially serves to provide nutrition to the developing embryo.
- At two months the villi cover the entire chorion, but, after this they develop unequally.
- The greater part of the chorion is in contact with the decidua capsularis
- At 4 months, over this portion the villi, undergo atrophy, and hence this part of the chorion becomes smooth, and is named the chorion læve;
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_d730c713fd8455b6537cg-05.jpg?height=1851&width=2603&top_left_y=6&top_left_x=357)

\section*{Chorion}
- Chorionic cavity (extraembryonic coelom)- lined with extraembryonic mesoderm
- Chorionic cavity expands separating amnion from cytotrophoblast
- Chorionic sac consist of: cytotrophoblastic layer/ syncytiotrophoblastic layer extraembryonic somatic mesoderm
- Chorion forms stem villi; chorion frondosum
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_d730c713fd8455b6537cg-07.jpg?height=1536&width=1915&top_left_y=125&top_left_x=684)

\section*{PLACENTA}

The placenta is the fetal membrane that carries out nutrition, respiration and excretion of the embryo and fetus.

Origin - The placenta has two components of:
- A fetal part called chorion frondosum.
- A maternal part called decidua basalis
- Revisit development of primitive uteroplacental circulation
- Decidual formation.

Development and parts of the deciduas.
- With advancement of pregnancy; formation of chorion frondosum and laeve respectively
- The decidua is the functional layer of the endometrium of the pregnant uterus.
- Decidua over the chorion frondosum, - decidua basalis -, consists of compact layer of large cells, decidual cells, with abundant amounts of lipids and glycogen.
- Other parts: decidua capsularis and parietalis
- With increase in volume of amnionitic cavity, amnion and chorion fuse forming amniochorionic membrane which obliterates the chorionic cavity.

\section*{Development of the placenta}
- Starts with primitive (lacunar) uteroplacental circulation:
- During the 2nd week, the syncytial lacunae appear in the syncytiotrophoblast and form the primordial of the intervillous spaces of the placenta.
- The fluid in the lacunar spaces - embryotrph - passes to the embryonic disc by diffusion and provides nutritive material to the embryo.
- -By the end of the 4th week, complex vascular network is established in the placenta which facilitates maternal-embryonic exchanges of gases, nutrients and waste products.
- Villus at the end week 3

- In its final form the placenta is made up of stem villi that extend from the chorionic plate.
- These villi either float within the intervillous space (maternal blood space) as - terminal villi or
${ }^{\circ}$ extend and attach to the decidua basalis as anchoring villi

- As pregnancy progresses during the 4th month, most of the cytotrophoblast cells degenerate.
- On the fetal side, the placenta is bordered by the chorionic plate;
- On its maternal side, it is bordered by the decidual plate.
- In between, trophoblast and decidua cells intermingle.
${ }^{-}$This zone is characterized by decidual and syncytial giant cells and is rich in amorphous extracellular material.
- Erosion of most of decidual basalis to increase size of intervillous spaces-decidual septa result
- Septation results in formation of cotyledons
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_d730c713fd8455b6537cg-17.jpg?height=1204&width=2616&top_left_y=2&top_left_x=2)

Composite drawing of the placenta in the second half of pregnancy. Thecotyledons are partially separated from each other by the decidual (maternal) septe. Note that most of the intervillous blood returns to the maternal circulation by wav of the endometrial veins. A small portion enters neighboring cotyledons. The intenillous spaces are lined by syncytium.

Fetal and maternal surfaces of the placenta.
- Full size placenta achieved by I3weeks and increases in size with fetal growth.
- The fully developed placenta covers 15 to $30 \%$ of the decidua and weighs about one-sixth that of the fetus.
- Dimensions of full term placenta:
- Weight 550-650gms
- Greatest diameter $15-25 \mathrm{~cm}$
- Greatest thickness - 2.5 - 3.4 cm (Obimbo et al., 2016)

\section*{Placental Circulation}

It is through the numerous branch villi that the main exchange of material between the mother and the fetus takes place. Circulations of the mother and fetus are separated by placental membrane (barrier). Up to the 4th month the placental membrane is formed of:
I-Syncytiotrophoblast.
2-Cytotrophoblast.
3-Mesoderm
4-Endothelium of the fetal capillaries.
-From the 4th month on, the placental membrane becomes much thinner, thus increasing the rate of exchange. It is formed of:
I-Syncytiotrophoblast.
2-Endothelium of fetal capillaries.

\section*{Fetal Placental Circulation}
- Poorly oxygenated blood passes through umbilical arteries to the placenta
- Extensive arterio-capillary-venous system in the chorionic villi.
- Syncytiotrophoblasts show many microvilli that increase the surface area for exchange.
Maternal and fetal blood do not come in contact

\section*{Maternal Placental Circulation}
- Numerous spiral arteries discharge blood into intervillous space in jets.
- Washing of villous structure with oxygenated blood
- As the pressure decreases, blood flows back from the chorionic plate toward the decidua, where it enters the endometrial veins.
- Intervillous spaces of the mature placenta contains 150 ml of blood which is replenished 4 times per minute.
- Reductions in uteroplacental circulation result in fetal hypoxia and fetal growth restriction/death.

\section*{Functions of Placenta}

The main functions of the placenta are:
I-Transport of gaseous and metabolic products between maternal and fetal blood.

2-Metabolism, e.g., synthesis of glycogen, cholesterol and fatty acids.

3-Production of hormones ,e.g., human chorionic trophic hormones, estrogens and progesterones.

\section*{I-Placental Transfer}

Materials are transported across the placental membrane by one of the following mechanisms:
Simple diffusion - gases, water, fatty acids, urea, steroids
Facilitated diffusion - electrolytes
Active transport - amino acids
Pinocytosis - lgs, small proteins
In placental membrane breaks - check mechanism of Rh isoimmunization

\section*{2-Metabolism}

The placenta synthesizes glycogen, cholesterol and fatty acids, which serve as sources of nutrients and energy for the fetus.

\section*{3-Endocrine Function}
- Human Chorionic Gonadotropin - Corpus Luteum (declines after 8 weeks)
- Progesterone - High levels by the end of first trimester
- Estrogen - Synthesis involves enzymatic activity of fetal adrenal gland and liver
- Chorionic Somatomammotropin - Human Placental Lactogen similar to GH (growth, lactation, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism)
- Placental Growth Hormone - similar to GH - Replaces materrnal GH by 15 wks - enhances blood glucose levels
- Chorionic Thyrotropin, Chorionic Corticotropin

\section*{Placental anomalies}
A) Variations in shape and size

I-When villi persist on the entire surface of the chorionic sac, a thin layer of the placenta (membranous placenta) attaches to a large area of the uterus. This type of the placenta is called diffuse placenta or placenta membranacea.
2-When villi persist elsewhere, several variations in shape may result: i-Placenta with two or three lobes; placenta bipartita (bidiscoid) or placenta tripartita.
ii-Placenta has two or three separate lobes; placenta duplex or placenta triplex.
iii-Placenta has small accessory lobe(s); placenta succenturiata.
iv-Failure of placenta to develop over a small area; placenta fenestrata.
v-Placenta with central depression; placenta circumvallata. vi-Horseshoe placenta.
- Although there are variations in the size and shape of the placenta, most of them are of little physiological or clinical significance.
B) Abnormal insertion of the umbilical cord

I-Marginal insertion of the cord; battledore placenta.
2-Umbilical cord attaches to membranes outside the placenta; placenta velamentosa.
C) Abnormal site of implantation of the blastocyst close to or overlying the internal os, the abnormality is called placenta previa.lt has varieties:
i-Implantation in the lateral uterine wall; placenta previa lateralis. ii-Implantation approaching internal os; placenta previa marginalis.

central placenta praevia
iii-Implantation overlying internal os; placenta previa centralis.
Late pregnancy bleeding may result from placenta previa.
The fetus has to be delivered by Cesarean section when the placenta completely obstructs the internal os.
D) Abnormal adherence of the chorionic villi to the uterine wall
I-Chorionic villi adhere to myometrium; placenta accreta (placenta increta).

2-Chorionic villi penetrate the full thickness of the myometrium to the perimetrium (peritoneal covering); placenta pancreta (placenta percreta).

After birth the placenta fails to separate from the uterine wall, and attempts to remove it may cause hemorrhage that is difficult to control. Most of these cases end with hysterectomy.
E) Abnormal proliferation of trophoblast may result in vesicular moles or choriocarcinoma. In choriocarcinoma the cells invade the decidua basalis, penetrate its blood vessels and lymphstics and may spread to lungs, bone marrow, liver and other organs. This tumour is sensitive to chemotherapy and cure is usually achieved.
F) Placental insufficiency: degenerative changes in the placenta that progressively reduce the oxygen supply and nourishment of the fetus.
G) Abruptio placentae:
premature detachment of the placenta during pregnancy rather than after delivery. Detachment may be complete or incomplete.
It carries risk of serious blood loss of the mother and risk of death of the fetus.

\section*{Placental stage of labour (3rd stage)}
- Uterine contractions begin again shortly after partiurition.
- Retraction of the uterus reduces the area of placental attachment.
- The placenta and fetal membranes are expelled.
- The duration of the third stage of labour is 15-30 minutes.

\section*{Recovery}
- Myometrial contractions constrict spiral arteries preventing excessive bleeding.
- Duration of the fourth stage of labour is $\mathbf{2}$ hours.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF CHORIONIC VILLI}
- Development of chorionic villi begin with proliferation of cytotrophoblastic cells into the syncytiotrophoblast
- First wave of proliferation produces primary chorionic villi at the end of the $2^{\text {nd }}$ week.
- Early in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week, mesenchyme grows into these primary villi, forming a core of mesenchymal tissue converting primary villi into secondary chorionic villi .
- Secondary choriomic villi cover the entire surface of the chorionic sac.
- Some mesenchymal cells in the villi soon differentiate into capillaries and blood cells converting secondary chorionic villi into tertiary chorionic villi .
- The capillaries in the chorionic villi fuse to form arteriocapillary networks, which soon become connected with the embryonic heart through vessels that differentiate in the mesenchyme of the chorion and connecting stalk.
- By the end of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week, embryonic blood begins to flow slowly through the capillaries in the chorionic villi.
- Cytotrophoblastic cells of the chorionic villi proliferate and extend through the syncytiotrophoblast to form an extravillous cytotrophoblastic shell, which gradually surrounds the chorionic sac and attaches it to the endometrium.

Diagrams illustrating development of secondary chorionic villi into tertiary chorionic villi. A, Sagittal section of an embryo (approximately 16 days). B, Section of a secondary chorionic villus. C, Section of an implanted embryo (approximately 21 days). D, Section of a tertiary chorionic villus. The fetal blood in the capillaries is separated from the maternal blood surrounding the villus by the endothelium of the capillary, embryonic connective tissue, cytotrophoblast, and syncytiotrophoblast.

- Cover the entire chorionic sac until the beginning of the $8^{\text {th }}$ week.
- As this sac grows, the villi associated with the decidua capsularis are compressed, reducing the blood supply to them.
- These villi soon degenerate, producing a relatively avascular bare area, the smooth chorion.
- Villi associated with the decidua basalis rapidly increase in number, branch profusely, and enlarge resulting in a bushy area the villous chorion which forms the placenta.
- The decidua capsularis, the layer of decidua overlying the implanted chorionic sac, forms a capsule over the external surface of the sac.
- As the conceptus enlarges, the decidua capsularis bulges into the uterine cavity and becomes greatly attenuated.
- Eventually the decidua capsularis contacts and fuses with the decidua parietalis, thereby slowly obliterating the uterine cavity.
- By 22 to 24 weeks, the reduced blood supply to the decidua capsularis causes it to degenerate and disappear.
- After disappearance of the decidua capsularis, the smooth part of the chorionic sac fuses with the decidua parietalis.
- This fusion is not complete , there is a potential space.

\section*{THE UMBILICAL VESICLE (YOLK SAC) (1)}
- The blastocystic cavity is renamed umbilical vesicle after formation of amniotic cavity.
- At 32 days, the umbilical vesicle is large.
- By 10 weeks, the umbilical vesicle has shrunk to a pear-shaped remnant approximately 5 mm in diameter and is connected to the midgut by a narrow omphaloenteric duct (yolk stalk).
- By 20 weeks, the umbilical vesicle is very small; thereafter, it is usually not visible.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UMBILICAL VESICLE (1)}
- Nonfunctional in humans but essential for:
- Transfer of nutrients to the embryo during the $\mathbf{2}^{\text {nd }}$ and $3^{\text {rd }}$ weeks - NUTRITION.
- Blood development beginning in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week and continues to form there until hemopoietic activity begins in the liver during the $\mathbf{6}^{\text {th }}$ week - BLOOD FORMATION.
- During the $\mathbf{4}^{\text {th }}$ week, the endoderm of the umbilical vesicle is incorporated into the embryo as the primordial gut - GUT DEVELOPMENT.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-020.jpg?height=1458&width=1854&top_left_y=14&top_left_x=320)

B, Dorsal view of the embryo exposed by removing the amnion. C to F, Sections of blood islands showing progressive stages in the development of blood and blood vessels.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UMBILICAL VESICLE (2)}
- Endoderm gives rise to the epithelium of the trachea, bronchi, lungs - RT DEVELOPMENT.
- Primordial germ cells appear in the endodermal lining of the wall of the umbilical vesicle in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week and subsequently migrate to the developing gonads where they differentiate into spermatogonia in males and oogonia in females - GERM CELLS.

\section*{FATE OF THE UMBILICAL VESICLE}
- In very unusual cases, the umbilical vesicle persists throughout pregnancy and appears under the amnion as a small structure on the fetal surface of the placenta near the attachment of the umbilical cord.
- The omphaloenteric duct usually detaches from the midgut loop by the end of the sixth week.
- In approximately $2 \%$ of adults, the proximal intraabdominal part of the omphaloenteric duct persists as an ileal diverticulum (Meckel diverticulum).

\section*{THE ALLANTOIS (1)}
- In the $\mathbf{3}^{\text {rd }}$ week, it appears as a sausage - like diverticulum from the caudal wall of the umbilical vesicle that extends into the connecting stalk.
- Although the allantois is not functional in human embryos, it is important for three reasons:
- Blood formation occurs in its wall during the $\mathbf{3}^{\text {rd }}$ to $\mathbf{5}^{\text {th }}$ weeks.
- Formation of umbilical vein and arteries.
- The intraembryonic part of the allantois runs from the umbilicus to the urinary bladder, with which it is continuous.

\section*{THE ALLANTOIS (2)}
- During the $\mathbf{2}^{\text {nd }}$ month, the extraembryonic part of the allantois degenerates.
- As the bladder enlarges, the allantois involutes to form a thick tube, the urachus.
- After birth, the urachus becomes a fibrous cord, the median umbilical ligament, that extends from the apex of the urinary bladder to the umbilicus.

Illustrations of the development and usual fate of the allantois. A, A 3-week embryo. B, A 9-week fetus. C, A 3-month male fetus. D, Adult female. The nonfunctional allantois forms the urachus in the fetus and the median umbilical ligament in the adult.

\section*{ALLANTOIC CYSTS}
- A cystic mass in the umbilical cord may represent the remains of the extraembryonic part of the allantois.
- These cysts usually resolve but may be associated with omphalocele - congenital herniation of viscera into the proximal part of the umbilical cord.
- The cysts are generally asymptomatic until childhood or adolescence, when they can become infected and inflamed.

\section*{AMNIOTIC FLUID(1)}
- Amnion is formed from embryoblast cells when lacunae appear among these cells which later coalesce to form amniotic cavity.
- Cells from embryoblast forms amnioblast which line the amniotic cavity forming the amniotic membrane.
- Sources of amniotic fluid
- Secretion by amniotic cells;
- Diffusion of maternal tissue and interstitial fluid across the amniochorionic membrane from the decidua parietalis.
- Diffusion of fluid through the chorionic plate from blood in the intervillous space of the placenta.
- Diffusion through fetal skin before keratinization of the skin; thus, amniotic fluid is similar to fetal tissue fluid.
- Secretion by the fetal respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.
- Beginning in the $11^{\text {th }}$ week, urine excreted by the fetus.
- The volume of amniotic fluid normally increases slowly, reaching approximately $\mathbf{3 0 ~ m L}$ at $\mathbf{1 0}$ weeks, $\mathbf{3 5 0 ~ m L}$ at $\mathbf{2 0}$ weeks, and $\mathbf{7 0 0}$ to $\mathbf{1 0 0 0}$ mL by 37 weeks.

\section*{DISORDERS OF AMNIOTIC FLUID VOLUME (1)}
- Low volumes of amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios.
- Causes:
- Placental insufficiency.
- Preterm rupture of the amniochorionic membrane.
- Renal agenesis (failure of kidney formation).
- Obstructive uropathy (urinary tract obstruction).

\section*{DISORDERS OF AMNIOTIC FLUID VOLUME (2)}
- Complications of oligohydramnios include:
- pulmonary hypoplasia,
- facial defects,
- limb defects that are caused by fetal compression by the uterine wall
- compression of the umbilical cord is a potential complication if severe

\section*{DISORDERS OF AMNIOTIC FLUID VOLUME (3)}
- High volumes of amniotic fluid is called polyhydramnios.
- Causes
- Causes of polyhydramnios:
- 60\% are idiopathic (unknown cause),
- 20\% are caused by maternal factors,
- 20\% are fetal in origin
- Failure of the fetus to swallow the usual amount of amniotic fluid e.g. in esophageal atresia (blockage).
- Severe anomalies of the central nervous system, such as meroencephaly (anencephaly).

\section*{COMPOSITION OF AMNIOTIC FLUID (1)}
- Amniotic fluid is an aqueous solution in which undissolved material (desquamated fetal epithelial cells) is suspended.
- Amniotic fluid contains approximately equal portions of organic and inorganic salts.
- Organic constituents:
- 50\%-protein;
- 50\%-carbohydrates, fats, enzymes, hormones, and pigments.
- As pregnancy advances, the composition of the amniotic fluid changes as fetal excreta (meconium [fetal feces] and urine) are added.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF AMNIOTIC FLUID (1)}
- The embryo, suspended in amniotic fluid by the umbilical cord, floats freely.
- Amniotic fluid has critical functions in the normal development of the fetus.
- The buoyant amniotic fluid:
- Permits symmetric external growth of the embryo and fetus
- Acts as a barrier to infection
- Permits normal fetal lung development
- Prevents adherence of the amnion to the embryo and fetus

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE OF AMNIOTIC FLUID (2)}
- Cushions the embryo and fetus against injuries by distributing impacts the mother receives
- Helps control the embryo's body temperature by maintaining a relatively constant temperature
- Enables the fetus to move freely, thereby aiding muscular development in the limbs
- Assists in maintaining homeostasis of fluid and electrolytes
- Amniotic fluid can be obtained for diagnostic purposes

\section*{THE PLACENTA}
- The placenta is a fetomaternal organ that has two components:
- A fetal part that develops from the chorionic sac
- A maternal part that is derived from the endometrium
- The placenta and umbilical cord form a transport system for substances passing between the mother and fetus.
- Functions and activities of the placenta and fetal membranes:
- protection,
- nutrition,
- respiration,
- excretion,
- hormone production.
- Shortly after birth, the placenta and fetal membranes are expelled from the uterus as the afterbirth.

\section*{Development of the Placenta}
- Early placental development is characterized by the rapid proliferation of the trophoblast and development of the chorionic sac and chorionic villi.
- By the end of the third week, the anatomic arrangements necessary for physiologic exchanges between the mother and her embryo are established.
- A complex vascular network is established in the placenta by the end of the fourth week, which facilitates maternal-embryonic exchanges of gases, nutrients, and metabolic waste products.
- Growth in the size and thickness of the placenta continues rapidly until the fetus is approximately 18 weeks old ( 20 weeks' gestation).
- The fully developed placenta covers $\mathbf{1 5 \%}$ to 30\% of the decidua and weighs approximately one sixth that of the fetus.
- Decidual cells may protect the maternal tissue against uncontrolled invasion by the syncytiotrophoblast and that they may be involved in hormone production.
- The fetal part of the placenta (villous chorion) is attached to the maternal part of the placenta (decidua basalis) by the cytotrophoblastic shell, the external layer of trophoblastic cells on the maternal surface of the placenta.
- The chorionic villi attach firmly to the decidua basalis and anchor the chorionic sac to the decidua basalis.
- The shape of the placenta is determined by the persistent area of chorionic villi .
- Usually this is a circular area, giving the placenta a discoid shape.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-046.jpg?height=1750&width=2094&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-047.jpg?height=1531&width=2102&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=1)
- As the chorionic villi invade the decidua basalis, decidual tissue is eroded to enlarge the intervillous space.
- This erosion produces several wedge-shaped areas of decidua, placental septa, that project toward the chorionic plate.
- The placental septa divide the fetal part of the placenta into irregular convex areas - cotyledons.
- Each cotyledon consists of two or more stem villi and their many branch villi.
- By the end of the $4^{\text {th }}$ month, the decidua basalis is almost entirely replaced by the cotyledons.
- The intervillous space of the placenta, which contains maternal blood, is derived from the lacunae that developed in the syncytiotrophoblast during the $2^{\text {nd }}$ week of development.
- The intervillous space of the placenta is divided into compartments by the placental septa; however, there is free communication between the compartments because the septa do not reach the chorionic plate.
- Maternal blood enters the intervillous space from the spiral endometrial arteries in the decidua basalis and discharge blood into the intervillous space.
- The intervillous space is drained by endometrial veins that also penetrate the cytotrophoblastic shell.
- The numerous branch chorionic villi arising from stem villi are continuously showered with maternal blood that circulates through the intervillous space.

\section*{Placental Circulation}
- The branch chorionic villi of the placenta provide a large surface area where materials may be exchanged across the very thin placental membrane ("barrier") interposed between the fetal and maternal circulations.
- It is through the numerous branch villi that the main exchange of material between the mother and fetus takes place.
- The circulations of the fetus and the mother are separated by the placental membrane consisting of extrafetal tissues.

\section*{Fetal Placental Circulation}
- Poorly oxygenated blood leaves the fetus and passes through the umbilical arteries to the placenta.
- The blood vessels in the placenta form an extensive arteriocapillary-venous system within the chorionic villi, which brings the fetal blood extremely close to the maternal blood.
- This system provides a very large surface area for the exchange of metabolic and gaseous products between the maternal and fetal bloodstreams.
- There is normally no intermingling of fetal and maternal blood; however, very small amounts of fetal blood may enter the maternal circulation when minute defects develop in the placental membrane.
- The well-oxygenated fetal blood in the fetal capillaries passes into thin-walled veins that follow the chorionic arteries to the site of attachment of the umbilical cord.
- They converge here to form the umbilical vein.
- This large vessel carries oxygen rich blood to the fetus.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-054.jpg?height=1750&width=2118&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=169)

\section*{Maternal Placental Circulation}
- The maternal blood in the intervillous space is temporarily outside the maternal circulatory system.
- It enters the intervillous space through 80 to 100 spiral endometrial arteries in the decidua basalis.
- These vessels discharge into the intervillous space through gaps in the cytotrophoblastic shell.
- The blood flow from the spiral arteries is pulsatile and is propelled in jetlike fountains by the maternal blood pressure .
- The entering blood is at a considerably higher pressure than that in the intervillous space and spurts toward the chorionic plate forming the "roof" of the intervillous space.
- As the pressure dissipates, the blood flows slowly over the branch villi, allowing an exchange of metabolic and gaseous products with the fetal blood.
- The blood eventually returns through the endometrial veins to the maternal circulation.
- The intervillous space of the mature placenta contains approximately $\mathbf{1 5 0 ~ m L}$ of blood that is replenished three or four times per minute.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-057.jpg?height=1775&width=1920&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)

\section*{The Placental Membrane}
- The placental membrane is a composite structure that consists of the extrafetal tissues separating the maternal and fetal blood.
- Until approximately 20 weeks, the placental membrane consists of four layers:
- syncytiotrophoblast,
- cytotrophoblast,
- connective tissue of villus,
- endothelium of fetal capillaries
- After the $20^{\text {th }}$ week, histologic changes occur in the branch villi that result in the cytotrophoblast in many of the villi becoming attenuated.
- Eventually cytotrophoblastic cells disappear over large areas of the villi, leaving only thin patches of syncytiotrophoblast.
- As a result, the placental membrane consists of three layers in most places.
- In some areas, the placental membrane becomes markedly thinned and attenuated.
- At these sites, the syncytiotrophoblast comes in direct contact with the endothelium of the fetal capillaries to form a vasculosyncytial placental membrane.
- Electron micrographs of the syncytiotrophoblast show that its free surface has many microvilli, more than 1 billion/cm ${ }^{2}$ at term, that increase the surface area for exchange between the maternal and fetal circulations.
- During the third trimester, numerous nuclei in the syncytiotrophoblast aggregate to form multinucleated protrusions called nuclear aggregations or syncytial knots.
- These aggregations continually break off and are carried from the intervillous space into the maternal circulation.
- Some knots lodge in capillaries of the maternal lung where they are rapidly destroyed by local enzyme action.
- Toward the end of pregnancy, fibrinoid material forms on the surfaces of villi.
- Fibrinoid material results mainly from aging and appears to reduce placental transfer.

\section*{Placental Transfer}
- The transport of substances in both directions between the fetal and maternal blood is facilitated by the great surface area of the placental membrane.
- Almost all materials are transported across the placental membrane by one of the following four main transport mechanisms:
- simple diffusion,
- facilitated diffusion,
- active transport,
- pinocytosis
- Passive transport by simple diffusion is usually characteristic of substances moving from areas of higher to lower concentration until equilibrium is established.
- In facilitated diffusion, there is transport through electrical gradients.
- Active transport against a concentration gradient requires energy.
- Such systems may involve carrier molecules that temporarily combine with the substances to be transported.
- Pinocytosis is a form of endocytosis in which the material being engulfed is a small amount of extracellular fluid.
-This method of transport is usually reserved for large molecules.
-Some proteins are transferred very slowly through the placenta by pinocytosis.

\section*{Other Placental Transport Mechanisms (1)}
- There are three other methods of transfer across the placental membrane.
- First, fetal red blood cells pass into the maternal circulation, particularly during parturition, through microscopic breaks in the placental membrane.
- Labeled maternal red blood cells have also been found in the fetal circulation.
- Consequently, red blood cells may pass in either direction through very small defects in the placental membrane.

\section*{Other Placental Transport Mechanisms (2)}
- Second method of transport, cells cross the placental membrane under their own power, e.g., maternal leukocytes and Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis.
- Third method of transport, some bacteria and protozoa such as Toxoplasma gondii infect the placenta by creating lesions and then cross the placental membrane through the defects that are created.

\section*{Transfer of Gases}
- Oxygen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide cross the placental membrane by simple diffusion.
- The placental membrane approaches the efficiency of the lungs for gas exchange.
- The quantity of oxygen reaching the fetus is primarily flow limited rather than diffusion limited; hence, fetal hypoxia (decreased levels of oxygen) results primarily from factors that diminish either the uterine blood flow or fetal blood flow.

\section*{Placental Endocrine Synthesis and Secretion}
- Using precursors derived from the fetus and/or the mother, the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta synthesizes protein and steroid hormones.
- The protein hormones synthesized by the placenta are:
- hCG
- Human chorionic somatomammotropin or human placental lactogen
- Human chorionic thyrotropin
- Human chorionic corticotropin

\section*{The Placenta as an Allograft}
- The placenta can be regarded as an allograft with respect to the mother.
- The fetal part of the placenta is a derivative of the conceptus, which inherits both paternal and maternal genes.
- What protects the placenta from rejection by the mother's immune system?
- The syncytiotrophoblast of the chorionic villi, although exposed to maternal immune cells within the blood sinusoids, lacks major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens and thus does not evoke rejection responses.
- Thus, it appears that the decidua plays a dual role in uteroplacental homeostasis by immunoprotection of the placenta and protection of the uterus from placental overinvasion.

\section*{Uterine Growth during Pregnancy}
- The uterus of a nonpregnant woman lies in the pelvis. To accommodate the growing conceptus, the uterus increases in size.
- It also increases in weight, and its walls become thinner.
- During the first trimester, the uterus moves out of the pelvis and by 20 weeks reaches the level of the umbilicus.
- By 28 to 30 weeks, the uterus reaches the epigastric region, the area between the xiphoid process of the sternum and the umbilicus.
- The increase in size of the uterus largely results from hypertrophy of preexisting smooth muscular fibers and partly from the development of new fibers.

\section*{PARTURITION}
- Parturition (childbirth) is the process during which the fetus, placenta, and fetal membranes are expelled from the mother's reproductive tract.
- Labor is the sequence of involuntary uterine contractions that result in dilation of the uterine cervix and expulsion of the fetus and placenta from the uterus.
- Several factors control onset of labor including steroids, hormones etc
- 3 stages of labor:
- First stage - uterine dilatation
- Second stage - cervix fully dilated and delivery of baby
- Third stage - delivery of the placenta
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-073.jpg?height=1698&width=1621&top_left_y=15&top_left_x=379)

\section*{The Placenta and Fetal Membranes after Birth}
- The placenta commonly has a discoid shape, with a diameter of 15 to 20 cm and a thickness of 2 to 3 cm .
- It weighs 500 to 600 g , which is approximately one sixth the weight of the average fetus.
- The margins of the placenta are continuous with the ruptured amniotic and chorionic sacs.
- When villi persist on the entire surface of the chorionic sac (an uncommon occurrence), a thin layer of placenta attaches to a large area of the uterus.
- This type of placenta is a membranous placenta-placenta membranacea.
- When villi persist elsewhere, several variations in placental shape occur:
- accessory placenta,
- bidiscoid placenta,
- horseshoe placenta.
- Although there are variations in the size and shape of the placenta, most of them are of little physiologic or clinical significance.

\section*{Maternal Surface of the Placenta}
- The characteristic cobblestone appearance of the maternal surface is produced by slightly bulging villous areas-cotyledons-that are separated by grooves that were formerly occupied by placental septa.
- The surface of the cotyledons is covered by thin grayish shreds of decidua basalis that separated from the uterine wall when the placenta was extruded.
- These shreds of tissue are recognizable in sections of the placenta that are examined under a microscope.

\section*{Placental implantation Abnormalities}
- Abnormal adherence of chorionic villi to the myometrium is called placenta accreta.
- Placenta increta is when the placenta invades the myometrium but does not reach the serosa
- When chorionic villi penetrate the full thickness of the myometrium to or through the perimetrium (peritoneal covering), the abnormality is called placenta percreta.
- Third-trimester bleeding is the common presenting sign of these placental abnormalities.
- Most patients with placenta accreta have normal pregnancies and labors.
- Placenta previa is when the placenta is attached to the lower uterine segment

\section*{The Umbilical Cord}
- The attachment of the umbilical cord to the placenta is usually near the center of the fetal surface of this organ, but it may attach at any point.
- Insertion of it at the placental margin produces a battledore placenta
- Attachment to the fetal membranes is a velamentous insertion of the cord
- The umbilical cord is usually 1 to 2 cm in diameter and 30 to 90 cm in length (average, 55 cm ).
- Excessively long or short cords are uncommon.
- Long cords have a tendency to prolapse and/or to coil around the fetus.
- Prompt recognition of prolapse of the umbilical cord is important because the cord may be compressed between the presenting body part of the fetus and the mother's bony pelvis, causing fetal hypoxia or anoxia.
- A very short cord may cause premature separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus during delivery.
- The umbilical cord usually has two arteries and one vein that are surrounded by mucoid connective tissue (Wharton jelly).
- Because the umbilical vessels are longer than the cord, twisting and bending of the vessels are common.
- In most cases, the knots form during labor as a result of the fetus passing through a loop of the cord. Simple looping of the cord around the fetus occasionally occurs.
- In approximately one fifth of deliveries, the cord is loosely looped around the neck without increased fetal risk.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-092.jpg?height=1780&width=2042&top_left_y=19&top_left_x=165)

\section*{Umbilical Artery Doppler Velocimetry}
- As gestation and trophoblastic invasion of the decidua basalis progress, there is a progressive increase in the diastolic flow velocity in the umbilical arteries.
- Doppler velocimetry of the uteroplacental and fetoplacental circulation is used to investigate complications of pregnancy such as IUGR and fetal distress resulting from fetal hypoxia and asphyxia.
- For example, there is a statistically significant association between IUGR and abnormally increased resistance in an umbilical artery.

\section*{Absence of an Umbilical Artery}
- In approximately one in 100 newborns, only one umbilical artery is present, a condition that may be associated with chromosomal and fetal abnormalities.
- Absence of an umbilical artery is accompanied by a 15\% to 20\% incidence of cardiovascular anomalies in the fetus.
- Absence of an artery results from either agenesis or degeneration of one of the two umbilical arteries.
- A single umbilical artery and the anatomic defects associated with it can be detected before birth by ultrasonography.

\section*{MULTIPLE PREGNANCIES}
- Multiple pregnancy or gestation is a situation where more than one embryo/fetus is growing in a woman
- The risks of chromosomal anomalies and fetal morbidity and mortality are higher in multiple gestations than in single gestations.
- As the number of fetuses increases, the risks are progressively greater.
- Multiple births are more common now because of greater access to fertility therapies, including induction of ovulation for assisted reproductive technologies.

\section*{Twins and Fetal Membranes}
- Twins that originate from two zygotes are dizygotic (DZ) twins or fraternal twins, whereas twins that originate from one zygote are monozygotic (MZ) twins or identical twins.
- The fetal membranes and placentas vary according to the origin of the twins.
- In the case of MZ twins, the type of placenta and membranes formed depends on when the twinning process occurs.

Diagrams illustrating how dizygotic twins develop from two zygotes. The relationships of the fetal membranes and placentas are shown for instances in which the blastocysts implant separately (A) and the blastocysts implant close together (B). In both cases, there are two amnions and two chorions. The placentas are usually fused when they implant close together.
- Approximately two thirds of twins are DZ.
- The frequency of DZ twinning shows marked racial differences, but the incidence of MZ twinning is approximately the same in all populations.
- In addition, the rate of MZ twinning shows little variation with the mother's age, whereas the rate of DZ twinning increases with maternal age.
- Studies in a Mormon population showed that the genotype of the mother affects the frequency of DZ twins, but the genotype of the father has no effect.
- It has also been observed that if the firstborn are twins, a repetition of twinning or some other form of multiple birth is approximately five times more likely to occur with the next pregnancy than in the general population.

\section*{Anastomosis of Placental Blood Vessels}
- Anastomoses between blood vessels of fused placentas of DZ twins may result in erythrocyte mosaicism.
- The members of these DZ twins have red blood cells of two different types because red cells were exchanged between the circulations of the twins.
- In cases in which one fetus is a male and the other is female, masculinization of the female fetus does not occur.

\section*{Twin Transfusion Syndrome}
- This syndrome occurs in as many as $30 \%$ of monochorionic-diamniotic MZ twins.
- There is shunting of arterial blood from one twin through arteriovenous anastomoses into the venous circulation of the other twin.
- The donor twin is small, pale, and anemic, whereas the recipient twin is large and polycythemic - an increase above the normal in the number of red blood cells.
- The placenta shows similar abnormalities; the part of the placenta supplying the anemic twin is pale, whereas the part supplying the polycythemic twin is dark red.
- In lethal cases, death results from anemia in the donor twin and congestive heart failure in the recipient twin.

This is a picture of a monochoionic diamnionic placenta with twin to twin transfusion syndrome. There is velamentous insertion of the cord on the left side. This was the smaller donor twin (B). When one looks carefully at the blood vessels that came from the insertion of the cord and go to the placenta, one will see some white streaks in the veins - they are thrombi. Birth weights were recipient baby $(A) 1400 \mathrm{~g}$ and donor baby (B) 925g at 29 weeks. Both did well.

This shows a higher magnification of the velamentous insertion and the thrombi.

\section*{Dizygotic Twins}
- Because they result from fertilization of two oocytes, DZ twins develop from two zygotes and may be of the same sex or different sexes.
- For the same reason, they are no more alike genetically than brothers or sisters born at different times.
- The only thing they have in common is that they were in their mother's uterus at the same time (i.e., "womb mates").
- DZ twins always have two amnions and two chorions, but the chorions and placentas may be fused.
- DZ twinning shows a hereditary tendency.
- Recurrence in families is approximately three times that of the general population.
- The incidence of DZ twinning shows considerable variation, being approximately 1 in 500 in Asians, 1 in 125 in whites, and as high as 1 in 20 in some African populations.

\section*{Monocygotic twins}
- Because they result from the fertilization of one oocyte and develop from one zygote, MZ twins are of the same sex, genetically identical, and very similar in physical appearance.
- Physical differences between MZ twins are environmentally induced, e.g., because of anastomosis of placental vessels.
- MZ twinning usually begins in the blastocyst stage, approximately at the end of the first week, and results from division of the embryoblast into two embryonic primordia.
- Subsequently, two embryos, each in its own amniotic sac, develop within the same chorionic sac and share a common placenta-a monochorionic-diamniotic twin placenta.
- Uncommonly, early separation of embryonic blastomeres (e.g., during the two- to eight-cell stages) results in MZ twins with two amnions, two chorions, and two placentas that may or may not be fused.
- In such cases, it is impossible to determine from the membranes alone whether the twins are MZ or DZ.

\section*{Establishing the Zygosity of Twins}
- Establishing the zygosity of twins is important in tissue and organ transplantation (e.g., bone marrow transplantations).
- The determination of twin zygosity is now done by molecular diagnosis because any two people who are not MZ twins are virtually certain to show differences in some of the large number of DNA markers that can be studied.
- Approximately 35\% of MZ twins result from early separation of the embryonic blastomeres, i.e., during the first $\mathbf{3}$ days of development.
- The other $65 \%$ of MZ twins originate at the end of the first week of development.
- Late division of early embryonic cells, such as division of the embryonic disc during the second week, results in MZ twins that are in one amniotic sac and one chorionic sac.
- A monochorionic-monoamniotic twin placenta is associated with a fetal mortality rate approaching 50\%.
- These MZ twins are rarely delivered alive because the umbilical cords are frequently so entangled that circulation of blood through their vessels ceases and one or both fetuses die.
- Sonography plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of twin pregnancies .
- Ultrasound evaluation is necessary to identify various conditions that may complicate MZ twinning such as IUGR, fetal distress, and premature labor.
- MZ twins may be discordant for a variety of birth defects and genetic disorders, despite their origin from the same zygote.
- In addition to environmental differences and chance variation, the following have been implicated:
- Mechanisms of embryologic development, such as vascular abnormalities, that can lead to discordance for anomalies
- Postzygotic changes, such as somatic mutation leading to discordance for cancer, or somatic rearrangement of immunoglobulin or T cell-receptor genes
- Chromosome aberrations originating in one blastocyst after the twinning event
- Uneven X chromosome inactivation between female MZ twins, with the result that one twin preferentially expresses the paternal X and the other the maternal X .
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_78ed28f58e26c95f573bg-122.jpg?height=1592&width=2097&top_left_y=49&top_left_x=148)

\section*{Early Death of a Twin}
- Because ultrasonographic studies are a common part of prenatal care, it is known that early death and resorption of one member of a twin pair is fairly common.
- Awareness of this possibility must be considered when discrepancies occur between prenatal cytogenetic findings and the karyotype of an infant.
- Errors in prenatal cytogenetic diagnosis may arise if extraembryonic tissues (e.g., part of a chorionic villus) from the resorbed twin are examined.

\section*{Conjoined Monozygotic Twins}
- If the embryonic disc does not divide completely, or adjacent embryonic discs fuse, various types of conjoined MZ twins may form .
- The attached twins are named according to the regions that are attached, e.g., thoracopagus indicates that there is anterior union of the thoracic regions.
- It has been estimated that the incidence of conjoined twins is 1 in 50,000 to 100,000 births.
- In some cases, the twins are connected to each other by skin only or by cutaneous and other tissues, e.g., fused livers .
- Some conjoined twins can be successfully separated by surgical procedures ; however, the anatomic relations in most conjoined twins do not permit surgical separation with sustained viability.

Siebert, Children's Hospital and Regional Center, Seattle, WA.)

\section*{Superfecundation}
- Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more oocytes at different times.
- In humans, the presence of two fetuses in the uterus caused by fertilization at different times (superfetation) is rare.
- DZ human twins with different fathers have been confirmed by genetic markers.

\section*{Other Types of Multiple Births}
- Triplets may be derived from:
- One zygote and be identical
- Two zygotes and consist of identical twins and a singleton
- Three zygotes and be of the same sex or of different sexes
- In the last case, the infants are no more similar than infants from three separate pregnancies. Similar combinations occur in quadruplets, quintuplets, sextuplets, and septuplets.

Ihat are fetal membranes?
* They are structures that develop from the zygote and do not share in the formation of the embryo
* Extraembryonic structures from the primitive blastomeres

\section*{Fetal membranes}

\section*{* These include *Amnion}
*Umbilical vesicle (yolk sac)
*Allantois
* Umbilical cord
* Chorion

\section*{Embryonic sources}
* Amnion- Epiblast/ extraembyonic mesoderm
* Yolk sac- Hypoblast/Extraembryonic mesoderm
*Allantois-Distal gut/ Diverticulum off the yolk sac
* Chorion- Trophoblasts/extraembryonic mesoderm
* Placenta- Chorion/ Maternal decidua

\section*{Amnion, Amniotic cavity and}

\section*{Fluid \\ Amnion is a membrane which surrounds the} amniotic cavity
* This membrane is continuous with the ectoderm of the embryo
* The amniotic cavity contains about $800-1000 \mathrm{ml}$ of watery and clear fluid (Amniotic fluid) at full term
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_48e46c72930db6914cfag-09.jpg?height=802&width=1860&top_left_y=1069&top_left_x=320)

\section*{Formation of Amnion and Amniotic cavity (Before folding)}
* Begins as small vacuoles in the epiblast which coalesce together forming a single cavity
* Cells of the epiblast (ectoderm) adjacent to the cytotrophoblast are called amnioblasts
* Eventually, amnioblasts form the roof of the amniotic cavity
* This cavity also has a floor formed of ectoderm

\section*{Functions of Amniotic fluid: Before labour}
1. Forms an isolating bag around the embryo protecting him from external trauma, shock \& temperature
2. Prevents adhesion of the embryo to its membranes
3. Allows homogenous media needed for the growth of the embryo
4. Permits the free movement of the embryo needed for muscular exercise
5. Allows the embryo to practice suckling

\section*{Function of Amniotic fluid}
* Control of body temperature
* Maintains homeostasis of fluid and electrolytes
* Important for development of the respiratory system
* Cushions the umbilical cord from compression between the mother and fetus

\section*{Functions of Amniotic fluid: During labour}
1. The bag of fore water allows regular dilatation of the cervix
2. After rupture of membrane the amniotic fluid serves as a lubricant for fetus descent
1. Amniotic fluid is bacteriostatic

* The endoderm will give the mucous membrane which lines the gut \& respiratory tract
* Site of haematopoesis in early development (week3-6)
* The splanchnopleuric primary mesoderm that surroundin it, gives the vitelline arteries (future superior mesenteric artery) \& vitelline vein (future liver sinusoids- portal \& hepatic veins)

\section*{Fate of the yolk sac}
* At 10 weeks, lies in chorionic cavity, between amniotic and chorionic sacs
* Atrophies as the pregnancy advances

\section*{Objectives}
- Epidemiology
- Risk factors for multiple gestation
- Classification
- Concerns

\section*{Epidemiology}
- Multiple pregnancies are conception of more than one baby at the same time
- Twins are the commonest!

2\% of all deliveries
- Twins occur once in every 90 pregnancies
- Triplets is once in $90 \times 90$ pregnancies
- Quadruplets once in $90 \times 90 \times 90$
- Quintuplets once in $90 \times 90 \times 90 \times 90$ pregnancies. About $2 / 3$ of twins are dizygotic twins (DZ) and 1/3 are monozygotic twins (MZ)

\section*{Contributing factors}
- Hereditary factors:
- Dizygotic twins show hereditary tendency. There is tendency of DZ twins to repeat in families
- Previous multiple pregnancy:
if the first born are twins, a repetition of multiple birth is about 5 times more likely to occur at the next pregnancy than in the general population
- Age and height of the mother;
- Taller and older mothers have greater chance to have twins, especially DZ twins.
- Use of gonadotropin hormones to stimulate ovulation increases the incidence of multiple pregnancy.
- 5-Use of in vitro fertilization increases chances for multiple pregnancy

\section*{Types of twins}
- Monozygotic (identical)
- Monochorionic mono-amniotic
- Mono-Di
- Di-Di
- Dizygotic (Fraternal)

Figure 15. Monozygotic, genetically identical twin pregnancies.

\section*{Monozygotic twins}
- Identical genetic background.
- Physical and mental similarities.
- Same sex, same blood group, same finger prints,
- External appearance such as hair and eye color

\section*{Causes of discordant (different) MZ twins}

Environmental factors, e.g. anastomoses of placental vessels leading to unbalanced blood supply to the twins.

Vascular abnormalities in one twin.
Gene mutation in one twin.
Chromosomal aberration in one blastocyst after the splitting.

Uneven X- chromosome inactivation between female MZ twins with the result that one twin expresses the paternal $X$, and the other expresses the maternal X

\section*{Fetal Membranes in MZ twins}

\section*{Dichorionic-diamniotic MZ twins:}
-35\% of MZ twins separation occurs during the first 3 days (2-8 cell stage)
-Early separation of embryonic blastomeres results in MZ twins with two amnions, two chorions, and two placentas that may or may not fuse

\section*{Monochorionicdiamniotic}
- 65\% of MZ twins splitting occurs around the end of the first week in the blastocyst stage.
- This results in MZ twins, each in its own amniotic sac, develop within the same chorionic sac and share a common placenta.

\section*{Monochorionicmonoamniotic MZ twins:}
- Very rarely splitting occurs in the embryonic disc during the second week before appearance of the primitive streak.
- This splitting results in formation of one amniotic sac, a common chorionic sac and a single placenta.
- Monochorionic-monoamniotic MZ twins carry high mortality rate (50\% death) and increased risk of conjoined twins.

\section*{Monozygotic twins (syn: Identical, uniovular):}
- Upto 3 days - diamniotic-dichorionic
- Between $4^{\text {th }}$ \& $7^{\text {th }}$ day - diamniotic monochorionic - most common type
- Between $8^{\text {th }} \& 12^{\text {th }}$ day-monoamniotic-monochorionic
- After $13^{\text {th }}$ day - conjoined / Siamese twins.

Conjoined Twins

\section*{Complications of MZ twins}
- Intrauterine death:
- many twins die before birth, only 30\% of women pregnant with twins give birth to two infants
- Vanishing twin refers death of one of the fetus
- Fetus papyraceus (calcification)

\section*{Twin transfusion syndrome}
- Occurs in 5-15\% of monochorionic MZ twins
- Placental vascular anastomoses cause one twin to receive most of the blood while the other is compromised.
- As a result, one twin is larger than the other. The outcome is poor with death of both twins occurring in 60-100\% of cases. The small one dies from anemia, and the large one dies from heart failure.

\section*{Siamese twins}
- Occur in 1/50,000-1/100,000 pregnancies.
- As a results of incomplete splitting of the axial area of the germ disc.
- Conjoined twins may be connected to each other by a common skin bridge or by a common liver bridge.

\section*{Types of siamese twins}
- According to the nature and degree of union, they are classified as
- Thoracopagus (joined at the thorax),
- Pygopagus (joined at the pelvis)
- Craniopagus (joined at the head).

Conjoined twins can be surgically separated; however in most conjoined twins anatomical relations do not permit surgical separation

\section*{Thoracopagus}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_80a0279f812ba26c4c67g-24.jpg?height=1292&width=993&top_left_y=419&top_left_x=677)

\section*{Dizygotic twins}
- Dizygotic twins occur when there is shedding of two ova at nearly the same time at one ovarian cycle
- and the two ova are fertilized by two different sperms.
- The two ova may come from one or two ovaries

\section*{Features of DZ twins}
- DZ twins have different genetic background and are not alike. They may or may not be of the same sex

\section*{Fetal membranes in DZ twins}
- Both zygotes implant individually in the uterus and each develops in its own amnion, its own chorion, and its own placenta, resulting in dichorionic-diamniotic DZ twins.
- 2-However, sometimes the two placentas fuse Similarly walls of the chorionic sacs come into close apposition and fuse resulting in monochorionic-diamniotic DZ twins.

\section*{Complications of DZ twins}
- Erythrocyte mosaicism:
- Anastomoses of blood vessels of the fused placentas of DZ twins results in erythrocyte mosaicism
- Members of the DZ twins have red blood cells of two different types because red cells were exchanged between the circulations of the twins.

\section*{Other types of multiple births}
- Triplets may be derived from:
- One zygote.
- Two zygotes, identical twins and a singleton.
- Three zygotes (non-identical) of the same or different sex.
- Similar combinations occur in quadruplets, quintuplets, sextuplets, and septuplets.
- Superfecundation (superfetation) is the fertilization of two or more oocytes at different times.
- It is very rare in human.

\section*{Superfetation vs Superfecundation}

\section*{Superfetation}

\section*{Superfecundation}
- A long interval intervenes between fertilizations
- Requires ovulation \& fertilization during the course of an established pregnancy
- Fertilization of 2 ova within the same menstrual cycle but not at the same coitus, nor necessarily by sperm from the same male
- Unproven to occur in humans

\section*{Superfecundation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_80a0279f812ba26c4c67g-33.jpg?height=1299&width=1439&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=492)

\section*{Risks associated with multiple pregnancy}
- Perinatal mortality and morbidity
- Low birth weight and prematurity
- Abnormal presentation
- Premature labour
- Risk of cerebral palsy

General principles of teratology (check Wilson's 6 principles)

Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the genotype of the conceptus

Dose and duration of exposure
Most susceptible time is embryonic period

\section*{Wilson's Principles of Teratology}
1. Susceptibility to Teratogenesis depends on the genotype of the conceptus and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors
2. Susceptibility to Teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence
3. Teratogenic agents act in specific ways (mechanisms) on developing cells and tissues to initiated sequences of abnormal developmental events (pathogenesis)
4. The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence (agent)
5. The four manifestations of deviant development are death, malformation, growth retardation, and functional deficit
6. Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases, from the no-effect to the totally lethal level

\section*{Consequences of exposure to a teratogen}
- Death - abortion or miscarriage
- Malformation
- IUGR - intrauterine growth retardation
- Functional defects in the newborn
- Normal newborn

Death of embryo may occur
$\square$ Malformation of embryo may occur (e.g., heart defect)
$\square$ Functional disturbance of fetus may occur (e.g., mental retardation)

\section*{Causes of congenital anomalies}
- Idiopathic - 50\%
- Genetic - 18\%
- Environmental - 7\%
- Multifactorial - 25\%

Figure 9-1. Graphic illustration of the causes of human congenital anomalies. Note that the causes of most anomalies are unknown and that 20 to $25 \%$ of them are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance).

\section*{FDA Pregnancy Category Definitions}

A-Adeguate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first (second, third, or atl) trimester(s), and the possibility of fetal harm appéars remote.

B -Animal studies do not indicate a risk to the fetus; however, there are no adequate, well-controlled studies in pregnant women OR Animal studies ha've shown an adverse. effect on the fetus but adequate, welt-controlled studies in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus. Despite the animal findings, the possibility of fetal harm appears remote, if used during pregnancy.

C-Animal studies have shown that the drug exerts teratogenic or embryocidal effects, and there are no adequate, wellcontrotted studies iń pregnant women, OR No studies are available in either animats or pregnant women.

D-Positive evidence of human fetal risk exists, but benefits in certain situations (eg, life-threatening situations or serious

DEVELOPMENT OF THE LIMBS
}

\section*{Ngwazi DR. K.O. AWORI University of Nairobi}

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
I. ONTOGENY
- Sources of mesenchyme for limb development
- Limb development as a self-differentiating system.
- Stages of limb development
- Factors affecting limb development

\section*{OBJECTIVES}

\section*{II. TERATOLOGY}
- Mechanisms of limb malformations
- Common causes and examples of limb malformations

\section*{Introduction}
- Limbs are designed to serve mechanical functions.
- The upper limb functions include prehension and tactile sensibility.
- The lower limbs are for weight bearing and locomotion.

\section*{Introduction}
- Limb development is a complex process that is coordinated by various tissue components through close interaction.
- It begins only after musculature of the body wall beneath the undifferentiated limb bud is already well differentiated.

\section*{Introduction}

At any given time, upper limbs are more developed than the lower ones till the end of limb development when the two are nearly synchronised.

\section*{Sources of mesenchyme for development}
- Lateral plate mesoderm: bones, tendons, ligament connective tissue \& vasculature.
- Somitic mesoderm: gives rise to the musculature

\title{
Sources of mesenchyme for development
}

\section*{Neural crest:}
form melanocytes and Schwann cells.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}

Limb development begins with initiation of a group of mesenchymal cells in the lateral plate mesoderm.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}
- The signal for limb bud formation comes from LPM cells that will become the prospective limb mesenchyme.
- Around T1
- They produce FGF10
- Role of retinoic acid expression

\section*{Initiation of limb development}

The initiated mesoderm then influences the overlying surface ectoderm to thicken to form a limb disk.

Mesoderm to be considered as the prime mover of limb development.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}
- The primordium formed by the meso-ectodermal interaction, contains all the information required to attain the normal limb form even if removed from the body of the embryo;
- the so called self-differentiating system.

\section*{Initiation of limb development}

The homeobox genes are involved in limb development.

\section*{Organisation of the limb bud}
- The limb buds appear on the ventrolateral body wall by week 4
- The upper limb buds are visible by day 24 or 25 while the lower limb ones by day 27 or 28.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_86259c116caaf8b420feg-14.jpg?height=1124&width=1235&top_left_y=433&top_left_x=1264)

Figure 8.12 Development of the limb buds in human embryos. A. At 5 weeks 6 weeks. C. At 8 weeks. The hindlimb buds are less well developed than those

\section*{Organisation of the limb bud}
- The apical ectodermal ridge (AER) stimulates outgrowth by its influence on the progress zone.

\section*{Organisation of the limb bud parts;}

\section*{Organisation of the limb bud}
- Fingers and toes form by programmed death (apoptosis) of cells between the digital rays.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_86259c116caaf8b420feg-17.jpg?height=1057&width=1238&top_left_y=428&top_left_x=1253)

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues:}

\section*{BONE}
- Most limb bones ossify between week 5 and 12 except carpal bones and some tarsal bones that do after birth.
- The bones, except the clavicle ossify endochondrally
- Joints develop from mesenchymal interfaces.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues MUSCLES}

During the 5th week the mesenchyme from the somitic mesoderm upon migration, condenses into a ventral and dorsal masses with respect to the axial mesenchyme.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues MUSCLES}

These cells form individual muscle primordia that link with tendons and connective tissue components, and differentiate into myoblasts that give rise to various muscles of the limbs.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues MUSCLES}

While some muscles migrate generally,
- The dorsal mass gives rise to upper limb extensors and supinator and lower limb abductors,
- The ventral mass to flexors and pronators of the upper limb and flexors and adductors of the lower limb.

\section*{Differentiation of specific tissues NERVES}
- The innervation develops much later
- The limb muscles are innervated by the ventral primary rami of spinal nerves C5 to T1 and L4 to S3 for upper and lower limbs respectively.
- The dorsal divisions of the nerves supply the dorsal muscle mass while ventral divisions the ventral mass.

\section*{What determines the pattern of nerves in a limb (Axonal path-finding)?}
1. Configuration of other tissue components in the limb:
- in-growing nerves follow environmental cues. The growth cones of axons avoid or may be unable to penetrate regions with dense mesenchyme or with glycosaminoglycans.
2. Pre-determined structures:
- That the axons home-in upon the structures they are pre-determined to innervate.

\section*{Limb rotation}
- The limb buds rotate from their original coronal orientation into a more or less parasagittal orientation.
- They rotate through $90^{\circ}$ around their long axis, the upper limbs laterally and the lower ones medially.

\section*{II. TERATOLOGY}

\section*{Aetiology}
- In majority, the cause is unknown
- In most cases the cause is multi-factorial, resulting from interaction between genetic and environmental factors.
- Some of the environmental factors include chemicals/drugs such as thalidomide (amelia/phocomelia), and retinoic acid,
- Oligohydriamnios is associated with the amniotic band disruption complex

\section*{CLASSIFICATION \& EXAMPLES}
1. Failure of formation (amelia, phocomelia, congenital amputations, absence of radius or ulnar, tibia or fibula)
2. Failure of differentiation (syndactyly)
3. Duplication (polydactyly)
4. Overgrowth (macrodactyly or gigantism)
5. Undergrowth
6. Constriction bands
7. Generalized skeletal abnormalities (club foot)

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF SKIN AND ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES}

Dr Peter Gichangi
Nov 122012

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
- Understand the development of different layers of the skin
- Understand development of skin associated/related structures
- Understand the embryological basis of congenital malformations of skin development

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- The integumentary system consists of:
- the skin
- and its appendages:
- sweat glands,
- nails,
- hairs,
- sebaceous glands,
- arrector muscles of hairs (arrector pili muscles),
- mammary glands,
- teeth

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF SKIN}
- The skin, is a complex organ system
- It is the largest organ.
- Consists of two layers:
- The epidermis derived from surface ectoderm
- The dermis derived from mesenchyme
- There is Ectodermal (epidermal) - mesenchymal (dermal) reciprocal induction mechanisms mediated by signaling molecules including: the Wnt, FGF, TGF $\beta$, and Hedgehog pathways.
- Skin structures vary from one part of the body to another e.g.
- skin of the eyelids is thin and soft and has fine hairs,
- skin of the eyebrows is thick and has coarse hairs.
- At 4 to 5 weeks, skin consists of a single layer of surface ectoderm overlying the mesoderm.

Light micrograph of thick skin (x132). Observe the epidermis and dermis as well as the dermal papilla interdigitating with the epidermal ridges.

\section*{Epidermis}
- Epidermal growth occurs in stages.
- The primordium is a single layer of surface ectodermal cells.
- These cells proliferate and form a layer of squamous epithelium, the periderm, and a basal layer.
- The cells of the periderm continually undergo keratinization and desquamation, and are replaced by cells from the basal layer.
- The exfoliated peridermal cells and sebum from sebaceous glandsform a white greasy substance - vernix caseosa - that covers the fetal skin.
- The vernix:
- protects the developing skin from constant exposure to amniotic fluid, with its high content of urine, bile salts, and sloughed cells, during the fetal period.
- facilitates birth of the fetus.
- The basal layer of the epidermis becomes the stratum germinativum which produces other layers and epidermal ridges.
- The transformation of the surface ectoderm into the multilayered definitive epidermis is induced by the dermis.
- By 11 weeks, the intermediate layer is formed.
- Replacement of peridermal cells continues until approximately the 21st week; thereafter, the periderm disappears and the stratum corneum forms from the stratum lucidum.
- Epidermal ridges:
- appear by $10^{\text {th }}$ week
- permanently established by 19 weeks
- those of the hand appear approximately one week earlier than in the feet.
- The epidermal ridges produce grooves on the surface of the palms and soles, fingers and toes.
- The type of pattern genetically determined genetically and is specific for an individual - basis for fingerprints.
- Abnormal chromosome complements affect the development of ridge patterns; for instance, infants with Down syndrome have distinctive patterns on their hands and feet that are of diagnostic value.
- Neural crest cells migrate into the mesenchyme of the developing dermis and differentiate into melanoblasts.
- Melanoblasts migrate to the dermoepidermal junction and differentiate into melanocytes which contain pigment granules.
- Melanocytes appear in the developing skin at 40 to 50 days, immediately after the migration of neural crest cells.
- Only a few melanin - containing cells are normally present in the dermis.
- The melanocytes begin producing melanin before birth and distribute it to the epidermal cells.

- The relative content of melanin inside the melanocytes accounts for the different colors of skin in different races and not the number of melanocytes.
- Skin is classified as thick or thin based on the thickness of the epidermis.
- Thick skin covers the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet; it lacks hair follicles, arrector muscles of hairs, and sebaceous glands, but it has sweat glands.
- Thin skin covers most of the rest of the body; it contains hair follicles, arrector muscles of hairs, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands.

\section*{Dermis}
- The dermis develops from mesenchyme derived from:
- somatic layer of lateral mesoderm
- dermatomes of the somites.
- By 11 weeks, the mesenchymal cells have begun to produce collagenous and elastic connective tissue fibers.
- The epidermal ridges form the dermis projects into the epidermis, forming dermal papillae, which interdigitate with the epidermal ridges.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_349d8d142a264b3cdc02g-15.jpg?height=1509&width=1706&top_left_y=17&top_left_x=397)

Light micrograph of thick skin (x132). Observe the epidermis and dermis as well as the dermal papilla interdigitating with the epidermal ridges. (From Gartner LP, Hiatt JL: Color Textbook of Histology, 2nd ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 2001.)
- Some dermal papillae:
- have capillary loops of blood vessels to nourish the epidermis
- others have sensory nerve endings.
- The developing afferent nerve fibers influence the spatial and temporal sequence of dermal ridge formation.
- By $5{ }^{\text {th }}$ week, capillary - like vessels are present.
- These capillary - like structures differentiate to arterioles, arteries, venules and veins.
- By the end of the first trimester, the major vascular organization of the fetal dermis is established.

\section*{Development of Glands}
- The glands of the skin include:
-eccrine sweat glands
-apocrine sweat glands
-sebaceous glands
-mammary glands
- They are derived from the epidermis and grow into the dermis.

\section*{Sebaceous Glands}
- Cellular buds develop from the sides of the developing epithelial root sheaths of hair follicles.
- The buds invade the surrounding dermal connective tissue and branch to form several alveoli and their associated ducts.
- The central cells of the alveoli break down, forming an oily substance - sebrum - that protects the skin against friction and dehydration.
- Sebum is released into the hair follicle and passes to the surface of the skin to form vernix caseosa.
- Sebaceous glands in the glans of the penis and labia minora, develop as cellular buds from the epidermis that invade the dermis.

\section*{Sweat Glands}
- Eccrine sweat glands are located in the skin throughout most of the body.
- They develop as cellular buds from the epidermis that grow into the underlying mesenchyme.
- As the buds elongate, their ends coil to form the bodies of the secretory parts of the glands.
- The epithelial attachments of the developing glands to the epidermis forms the sweat ducts.
- The peripheral cells of the secretory parts of the glands differentiate into myoepithelial and secretory cells.

Illustrations of the successive stages of the development of a sweat gland. $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, The cellular buds of the glands develop at approximately 20 weeks as a solid growth of epidermal cells into the mesenchyme. C, Its terminal part coils and forms the body of the gland. The central cells degenerate to form the lumen of the gland. D, The peripheral cells differentiate into secretory cells and contractile myoepithelial cells.
- Myoepithelial cells are specialized smooth muscle cells that assist in expelling sweat from the glands.
- Eccrine sweat glands begin to function shortly after birth.
- Sudoriferous (producing sweat) apocrine sweat glands are mostly confined to the axillary, pubic and perineal regions, and the areolae of the breast.
- The glands develop from down growths of the stratum germinativum of the epidermis .
- The ducts of these glands open, not onto the skin surface, as do eccrine sweat glands, but into the canals of the hair follicles superficial to the entry of the sebaceous gland ducts.
- Secretion by apocrine sweat glands is influenced by hormones and does not begin until puberty.

\section*{DISORDERS OF KERATINIZATION}
- Ichthyosis is agroup of skin disorders resulting from excessive keratinization - formation of horny layers of skin.
- The skin is characterized by dryness and scaling, which may involve the entire body surface.
- A harlequin fetus results from a rare keratinizing disorder that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
- The skin is markedly thickened, ridged, and cracked.
- Most affected neonates die during the first week of life.
- A collodion infant is covered by a thick, taut membrane that resembles collodion or parchment.
- The membranous skin cracks and begins to fall off in large sheets.
- Deficiency of transglutaminase- 1 is the most common cause.
- Complete shedding may take several weeks, occasionally leaving normal-appearing skin.
- Lamellar ichthyosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. A neonate may appear to be a collodion baby; however, the scaling persists.
- Growth of hair may be curtailed and development of sweat glands is often impeded.
- Affected infants are unable to sweat.

\section*{CONGENITAL ECTODERMAL DYSPLASIA}
- A group of rare hereditary disorders involving tissues that are ectodermal in origin.
- The teeth are completely or partially absent and often the hairs and nails are affected.
- Ectrodactyly - ectodermal dysplasia - clefting syndrome is a congenital skin that involves both ectodermal and mesodermal tissues, consisting of:
- ectodermal dysplasia associated with hypopigmentation of skin and hair,
- scanty hair and eyebrows,
- absence of eyelashes,
- nail dystrophy,
- hypodontia
- microdontia,
- ectrodactyly, and cleft lip and palate.

\section*{ANGIOMAS OF SKIN}
- Some transitory and/or surplus primitive blood or lymphatic vessels persist as either:
- arteries,
- venous,
- cavernous angiomas,
- often of a mixed type.
- Angiomas composed of lymphatics are called cystic lymphangiomas or cystic hygromas.
- True angiomas are benign tumors of endothelial cells.
- Nevus flammeus denotes a flat, pink or red, flame - like blotch that often appears on the posterior surface of the neck.
- A port - wine stain hemangioma which is sharply demarcated is a larger and darker angioma than a nevus flammeus and is nearly always anterior or lateral on the face and/or neck.
- Common angioma (pinkish-red blotch) may cross the median plane.
- A port-wine stain in the area of distribution of the trigeminal nerve is sometimes associated with a similar type of angioma of the meninges of the brain and seizures at birth (Sturge-Weber syndrome).

\section*{ALBINISM}
- Generalized albinism, is an autosomal recessive trait where the skin, hairs, and retina lack pigment; however, the iris usually shows some pigmentation.
- Albinism occurs when the melanocytes fail to produce melanin because of the lack of the enzyme tyrosinase or other pigment enzymes.
- In localized albinism - piebaldism - an autosomal dominant trait, there is a lack of melanin in patches of skin and/or hair.

\section*{Mammary Glands}
- Mammary glands are modified and highly specialized types of sweat glands.
- Development of mammary glands also called mammogenesis is similar in male and female embryos.
- The first evidence of mammary development appears in the fourth week when mammary crests (ridges)/line develop along each side of the ventral surface of the embryo.
- These crests extend from the axillary region to the inguinal region.
- The crests usually disappear except for the parts at the site of the future breasts.
- Involution of the remaining mammary crests in the $5^{\text {th }}$ week produces the primary mammary buds.
- These buds are down growths of the epidermis into the underlying mesenchyme.
- The changes occur in response to an inductive influence from the mesenchyme.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_349d8d142a264b3cdc02g-32.jpg?height=1264&width=2106&top_left_y=57&top_left_x=197)

C, Transverse section of a mammary crest at the site of a developing mammary gland. D to F, Similar sections showing successive stages of breast development between the 12th week and birth.
- Each primary mammary bud soon gives rise to several secondary mammary buds, which develop into lactiferous ducts and their branches.
- Canalization of secondary mammary buds is induced by placental sex hormones entering the fetal circulation.
- By term, 15 to 19 lactiferous ducts are formed.
- The fibrous connective tissue and fat of the mammary glands develop from the surrounding mesenchyme.
- During the late fetal period, the epidermis at the site of origin of the mammary gland becomes depressed, forming a shallow mammary pit.
- The nipples are poorly formed and depressed in neonates.
- Soon after birth, the nipples usually rise from the mammary pits because of proliferation of the surrounding connective tissue of the areola.
- The smooth muscle fibers of the nipple and areola differentiate from surrounding mesenchymal cells.
- The rudimentary mammary glands of newborn males and females are identical and are often enlarged.
- Some secretion, often called "witch's milk" (galactorrhea), may be produced caused by maternal hormones.
- The breasts of neonates contain lactiferous ducts but no alveoli (secretory parts of glands).
- In females, the breasts enlarge rapidly during puberty, mainly because of development of the mammary glands and the accumulation of the fibrous stroma and fat associated with them.
- Full development occurs at approximately 19 years.
- Normally, the lactiferous ducts of males remain rudimentary throughout life.

Note that the nipple is inverted at birth (A). At puberty (12-15 years), the breasts of females enlarge because of development of the mammary glands and the increased deposition of fat.

\section*{GYNECOMASTIA}
- Gynecomastia refers to the development of the rudimentary lactiferous ducts in the male mammary tissue.
- During midpuberty, approximately two thirds of boys develop varying degrees of hyperplasia of the breasts.
- This subareolar hyperplasia may persist for a few months to 2 years.
- A decreased ratio of testosterone to estradiol is found in boys with gynecomastia.
- Approximately $80 \%$ of males with Klinefelter syndrome have gynecomastia, which is associated with an XXY chromosome complement.

\section*{ABSENCE OF NIPPLES (ATHELIA) OR BREASTS (AMASTIA)}
- These rare birth defects may occur bilaterally or unilaterally.
- They result from failure of development or disappearance of the mammary crests.
- These conditions may also result from failure of mammary buds to form.
- More common is hypoplasia of the breast, often found in association with gonadal agenesis and Turner syndrome.
- Poland syndrome is associated with hypoplasia or absence of the breast or nipple.

\section*{APLASIA OF BREAST}
- The breasts of postpubertal females often differ somewhat in size.
- Marked differences are regarded as anomalies because both glands are exposed to the same hormones at puberty.
- In these cases, there is often associated rudimentary development of muscles of the thoracic wall, usually the pectoralis major.

\section*{SUPERNUMERARY BREASTS AND NIPPLES}
- An extra breast (polymastia) or nipple (polythelia) occurs in approximately 1\% of the female population - inherited.
- An extra breast or nipple usually develops just inferior to the normal breast.
- Supernumerary nipples are also relatively common in males; often they are mistaken for moles.
- Less commonly, supernumerary breasts or nipples appear in the axillary or abdominal regions of females.
- In these positions, the nipples or breasts develop from extra mammary buds that develop from remnants of the mammary crests.
- They usually become more obvious in women when they are pregnant.
- Approximately one third of affected persons have two extra nipples or breasts.
- Supernumerary mammary tissue very rarely occurs in a location other than along the course of the mammary crests.
- It probably develops from tissue that was displaced from these crests.

\section*{INVERTED NIPPLES}
- Sometimes the nipples fail to elevate above the skin surface after birth or during puberty, that is, they remain in their prenatal location.
- Inverted nipples may make breast-feeding of an infant difficult; however, a number of breast-feeding techniques can be used to reduce this difficulty.

\section*{Development of Hairs}
- Hairs begin to develop early in the fetal period, but they do not become easily recognizable until approximately the $20^{\text {th }}$ week.
- Hairs are first recognizable on the eyebrows, upper lip, and chin.
- The hair follicles begin as proliferations of the stratum germinativum of the epidermis, and extend into the underlying dermis.
- The hair buds soon become club shaped, forming hair bulbs.
- The epithelial cells of the hair bulbs constitute the germinal matrix, which later produces the hair shafts.
- The hair bulbs (primordia of hair roots) are soon invaginated by small mesenchymal hair papillae.
- The peripheral cells of the developing hair follicles form the epithelial root sheaths, and the surrounding mesenchymal cells differentiate into the dermal root sheaths.
- As cells in the germinal matrix proliferate, they are pushed toward the surface, where they become keratinized to form hair shafts.
- The hairs grow through the epidermis on the eyebrows and upper lip by the end of the $12{ }^{\text {th }}$ week.

- The first hairs to appear - lanugo - are fine, soft, and lightly pigmented.
- Lanugo hairs help to hold the vernix caseosa on the skin.
- Lanugo is replaced by coarser hairs during the perinatal period.
- This hair persists over most of the body, except in the axillary and pubic regions, where it is replaced at puberty by even coarser terminal hairs.
- In males, similar coarse hairs also appear on the face and often on the chest - anterior wall of thorax.
- Melanoblasts migrate into the hair bulbs and differentiate into melanocytes.
- The relative content of melanin accounts for different hair colors.
- Arrector muscles of hairs, small bundles of smooth muscle fibers, differentiate from the mesenchyme surrounding the hair follicles and attach to the dermal root sheaths of the hair follicles and the papillary layer of the dermis, which interdigitates with the epidermis.
- Contractions of the arrector muscles depress the skin over their attachment and elevate the skin around the hair shafts, causing the hairs to stand up ("goose bumps").
- The arrector muscles are poorly developed in the hairs of the axillary region and in certain parts of the face.
- The hairs forming the eyebrows and the cilia forming the eyelashes have no arrector muscles.

Fig. 355- Five stages in the development of a human hair. Stother.
- I-II - about three months, local thickenings of the epidermis appear (beginning in the region of the forehead and eye-brows) and grow obliquely into the underlying dermis in the form of solid buds the hair germs. As the buds continue to elongate they become club-shaped and the epithelium at the end of each molds itself over a little portion of the dermis in which the cells have become more numerous and which is known as the hair papilla.
- III - IV - As the epidermal bud grows deeper, its central cells become spindle-shaped and undergo keratinization to form the beginning of the hair shaft; the peripheral layers constitute the anlage of the root sheath. The hair shaft grows from its basal end, new keratinized cells being added from the epithelium nearest the papilla as the older cells are pushed toward the surface of the skin.
- V - The surface cells of the hair shaft become flattened to form the cuticle of the hair. The hairs appear above the surface about the fifth month. Of the cells of the root sheath, those nearest the hair become scale-like to form the cuticle of the root sheath; the next few layers become modified (keratinized) to form Huxley's and Henle's layers. Outside of these is the stratum germinativum, the basal layer of which is composed of columnar cells resting upon a distinct basement membrane. The stratum germinativum is continued over the tip of the papilla, where its cells give rise to new cells for the hair shaft.

\section*{ALOPECIA}
- Absence or loss of scalp hairs may occur alone or with other defects of the skin and its derivatives.
- Congenital alopecia (hair loss) may be caused by failure of hair follicles to develop, or it may result from follicles producing poor - quality hairs.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_349d8d142a264b3cdc02g-55.jpg?height=1512&width=2201&top_left_y=159&top_left_x=38)
- HYPERTRICHOSIS
- Excessive hairiness results from the development of supernumerary hair follicles, or from the persistence of lanugo hairs that normally disappear during the perinatal period.
- It may be localized (e.g., on the shoulders and back) or diffuse.
- Localized hypertrichosis is often associated with spina bifida occulta.
- PILI TORTI
- In this familial disorder, the hairs are twisted and bent (Latin tortus, twisted).
- Other ectodermal defects (e.g., distorted nails) may be associated with this condition.
- Pili torti is usually first recognized at 2 to 3 years of age.

\section*{Development of Nails}
- Toe nails and fingernails begin to develop at the tips of the digits at approximately 10 weeks.
- Development of fingernails precedes that of toenails by approximately 4 weeks.
- The primordia of nails appear as thickened areas or nail fields of the epidermis at the tip of each digit.
- Later these fields migrate onto the dorsal surfaces of the nails, carrying their innervation from the ventral surface.
- The nail fields are surrounded laterally and proximally by folds of epidermis, the nail folds.
- Cells from the proximal nail fold grow over the nail field and become keratinized to form the nail plate.
- At first, the developing nail is covered by a narrow band of epidermis, the eponychium.
- Eponychium degenerates, exposing the nail, except at its base, where it persists as the cuticle.
- The skin under the free margin of the nail is the hyponychium.
- The fingernails reach the fingertips by approximately 32 weeks; the toenails reach the toe tips by approximately 36 weeks.
- Nails that have not reached the tips of the digits at birth indicate prematurity.

\section*{APLASTIC ANONYCHIA}
- Anonychia is congenital absence of nails.
- Anonychia results from failure of nail fields to form or from failure of the proximal nail folds to form nail plates.
- The abnormality is permanent.
- Aplastic anonychia (defective development or absence of nails) may be associated with extremely poor development of hairs and with defects of the teeth.
- Anonychia may be restricted to one or more nails of the digits of the hands and/or feet.

\section*{Development of Teeth}
- Two sets of teeth normally develop:
- primary dentition or deciduous teeth
- secondary dentition or permanent teeth.
- Teeth develop from:
- oral ectoderm,
- mesenchyme,
- neural crest cells.
- The enamel is derived from ectoderm of the oral cavity
- All other tissues differentiate from the surrounding mesenchyme and neural crest cells.
- As the mandible and maxilla grow to accommodate the developing teeth, the shape of the face changes.

- Odontogenesis (tooth development) is a property of the oral epithelium.
- Odontogenesis is a continuous process involving reciprocal induction between neural crest mesenchyme and the overlying oral epithelium.
- Odontogenesis is divided into stages for descriptive purposes based on the appearance of the developing tooth.
- The first tooth buds appear in the anterior mandibular region; later, in the anterior maxillary region and then progresses posteriorly in both jaws.
- Tooth development continues for years after birth.
- The first indication of tooth development occurs early in the $6{ }^{\text {th }}$ week as a thickening of the oral epithelium.
- These U - shaped bands - dental laminae - follow the curves of the primitive jaws.

\section*{Bud Stage of Tooth Development}
- Each dental lamina develops 10 centers of proliferation from which swellings - tooth buds - grow into the underlying mesenchyme.
- These buds develop into the deciduous teeth.
- The tooth buds for permanent teeth that have deciduous predecessors begin to appear at approximately 10 weeks from deep continuations of the dental lamina.
- They develop lingual (toward the tongue) to the deciduous tooth buds.
- The permanent molars have no deciduous predecessors and develop as buds from posterior extensions of the dental laminae (horizontal bands).
- The tooth buds for the permanent teeth appear at different times, mostly during the fetal period.
- The buds for the second and third permanent molars develop after birth.
- The deciduous teeth have well-developed crowns at birth, whereas the permanent teeth remain as tooth buds.

\section*{Cap Stage of Tooth Development}
- Invagination of the tooth bud by mesenchyme that forms the primordium of the dental papilla and dental follicle converts the tooth bud into a cap.
- The ectodermal part of the developing tooth, the enamel organ produces enamel.
- The internal part of each cap - shaped tooth, the dental papilla, is the primordium of dentin and dental pulp.
- The outer cell layer of the enamel organ is the outer enamel epithelium, and the inner cell layer lining the papilla is the inner enamel epithelium.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_349d8d142a264b3cdc02g-69.jpg?height=1174&width=2318&top_left_y=73&top_left_x=69)

Photomicrograph of the primordium of a lower incisor tooth. A, A 12-week-old fetus (early bell stage). A cap-like enamel organ is formed and the dental papilla is developing beneath it. B, Primordium of a lower incisor tooth in a 15-week-old fetus (late bell stage). Observe the inner and outer enamel layers, the dental papilla, and bud of the permanent tooth.
- The central core of loosely arranged cells between the layers of enamel epithelium is the enamel reticulum (stellate reticulum).
- As the enamel organ and dental papilla develop, the mesenchyme surrounding the developing tooth condenses to form the dental sac (dental follicle), a vascularized capsular structure.
- The dental sac is the primordium of the cement and periodontal ligament.
- The cement is the bone-like, mineralized connective tissue covering the root of the tooth.
- The periodontal ligament, derived from neural crest cells, is a specialized vascular connective tissue that surrounds the root of the tooth, attaching it to the alveolar bone.

\section*{Bell Stage of Tooth Development}
- As the enamel organ differentiates, the developing tooth assumes the shape of a bell.
- The mesenchymal cells in the dental papilla adjacent to the internal enamel epithelium differentiate into odontoblasts, which produce predentine and deposit it adjacent to the epithelium.
- Later, the predentine calcifies and becomes dentine, the second hardest tissue in the body.
- As the dentine thickens, the odontoblasts regress toward the center of the dental papilla; however, their finger - like cytoplasmic processes - odontoblastic processes - remain embedded in the dentine.
- Cells of the inner enamel epithelium differentiate into ameloblasts under the influence of the odontoblasts, which produce enamel in the form of prisms (rods) over the dentine.

\section*{Photomicrograph of a section of the crown and neck of a tooth (x17). Observe the enamel (E), dentine (D), dental pulp (P), and odontoblasts (O).}

- As the enamel increases, the ameloblasts migrate toward the outer enamel epithelium.
- Enamel is the hardest tissue in the body.
- It overlies and protects the dentine from being fractured.
- Enamel and dentine formation begins at the cusp (tip) of the tooth and progresses toward the future root.
- The root of the tooth begins to develop after dentine and enamel formation are well advanced.
- The inner and outer enamel epithelia come together at the neck of the tooth (cementoenamel junction), where they form a fold, the epithelial root sheath.
- This sheath grows into the mesenchyme and initiates root formation.

- The odontoblasts adjacent to the epithelial root sheath form dentine that is continuous with that of the crown.
- As the dentine increases, it reduces the pulp cavity to a narrow root canal through which the vessels and nerves pass.
- The inner cells of the dental sac differentiate into cementoblasts, which produce cement that is restricted to the root.
- Cement is deposited over the dentine of the root and meets the enamel at the neck of the tooth.
- As the teeth develop and the jaws ossify, the outer cells of the dental sac also become active in bone formation.
- Each tooth soon becomes surrounded by bone, except over its crown.
- The tooth is held in its alveolus (bony socket) by the strong periodontal ligament, a derivative of the dental sac.
- Some fibers of this ligament are embedded in the cement of the root; other fibers are embedded in the bony wall of the alveolus.

\section*{Tooth Eruption}
- As the deciduous teeth develop, they begin a continuous slow movement toward the oral cavity.
- This process (eruption) results in the emergence of the tooth from the dental follicle in the jaw to its functional position in the mouth.
- The mandibular teeth usually erupt before the maxillary teeth, and girls' teeth usually erupt sooner than boys' teeth.
- The child's dentition contains 20 deciduous teeth.
- As the root of the tooth grows, its crown gradually erupts through the oral epithelium.
- The part of the oral mucosa around the erupted crown becomes the gingiva (gum).

A 4-year-old child's cranium. Bone has been removed from the mandible and maxilla to expose the relationship of the developing permanent teeth to the erupted deciduous teeth.

- Usually eruption of the deciduous teeth occurs between the 6th and 24th months after birth.
- The mandibular medial or central incisor teeth typically erupt 6 to 8 months after birth, but this process may not begin until 12 or 13 months in some children.
- Despite this, all 20 deciduous teeth are usually present by the end of the second year in healthy children.
- Delayed eruption of all teeth may indicate a systemic or nutritional disturbance such as hypopituitarism or hypothyroidism.
- The complete permanent dentition consists of 32 teeth.
- The permanent teeth develop in a manner similar to that described for deciduous teeth.
- As a permanent tooth grows, the root of the corresponding deciduous tooth is gradually resorbed by osteoclasts (odontoclasts).
- Consequently, when the deciduous tooth is shed, it consists only of the crown and the uppermost part of the root.
- The permanent teeth usually begin to erupt during the sixth year and continue to appear until early adulthood.
- The shape of the face is affected by the development of the paranasal sinuses and the growth of the maxilla and mandible to accommodate the teeth.
- It is the lengthening of the alveolar processes (bony sockets supporting the teeth) that results in the increase in the depth of the face during childhood.

\section*{NATAL TEETH}
- Natal teeth are erupted at birth.
- There are usually two in the position of the mandibular incisors.
- Natal teeth are observed in approximately one in 2000 newborn infants.
- Natal teeth may produce maternal discomfort during breast-feeding.
- In addition, the infant's tongue may be lacerated or the teeth may detach and be aspirated; for these reasons, natal teeth are sometimes extracted.
- Because these are prematurely erupting decidual teeth, spacers may be required to prevent overcrowding of the other teeth.

\section*{ENAMEL HYPOPLASIA}
- Defective enamel formation causes pits and/or fissures in the enamel of teeth.
- These defects result from temporary disturbances of enamel formation.
- Various factors may injure ameloblasts, the enamel builders (e.g., nutritional deficiency, tetracycline therapy, and infectious diseases such as measles).
- Rickets occurring during the critical in utero period of tooth development (6-12 weeks) is a common cause of enamel hypoplasia.
- Rickets, a disease in children who are deficient in vitamin D, is characterized by disturbance of ossification of the epiphysial cartilages and disorientation of cells at the metaphysis.

Some common birth defects of teeth. A, Enamel pearl (furcation of a permanent maxillary third molar). B, Gemination and tetracyline staining (maxillary third molar). C, Fusion (permanent mandibular central and lateral incisors). D, Abnormally short root (microdont permanent maxillary central incisor). E, Dens invaginatus (talon cusps

F, Taurodont tooth (radiograph of the mesial surface of the permanent maxillary second molar). G, Fusion (primary mandibular central and lateral incisors).

More common birth defects of teeth. A, Amelogenesis imperfecta. B, Extra root (mandibular molar). C, Extra root (mandibular canine). D, Accessory root (maxillary lateral incisor). Extra roots present challenges for root canal therapy and extraction. E, Tetracycline staining (root of maxillary third molar). F, A midline supernumerary tooth ( M , mesiodens) located near the apex of the central incisor. The prevalence of supernumerary teeth is 1\% to 3\% in the general population

\section*{Variations of Tooth Shape}
- Abnormally shaped teeth are relatively common.
- Occasionally there is a spherical mass of enamelenamel pearl - on the root of a tooth that is separate from the enamel of the crown.
- The pearl is formed by aberrant groups of ameloblasts.
- In other cases, the maxillary lateral incisor teeth may have a slender, tapering shape (peg-shaped incisors).
- Congenital syphilis affects the differentiation of the permanent teeth, resulting in incisors with central notches in their incisive edges.
- The molars are also affected and are called mulberry molars because of their characteristic features.

\section*{NUMERICAL ABNORMALITIES}
- One or more supernumerary teeth (mesiodens) may develop, or the normal number of teeth may fail to form.
- Many studies report a higher prevalence in females.
- Supernumerary teeth usually develop in the area of the maxillary incisors and can disrupt the position and eruption of normal teeth.
- The extra teeth commonly erupt posterior to the normal ones (or remain unerupted) and are asymptomatic in most cases.
- In partial anodontia, one or more teeth are absent; this is often a familial trait.
- In total anodontia, no teeth develop; this is an extremely rare condition.
- It is usually associated with congenital ectodermal dysplasia.
- Occasionally a tooth bud either partially or completely divides into two separate teeth.
- A partially divided tooth germ is called gemination.
- The result is a macrodontia (large teeth) with a common root canal system.
- Small teeth (microdontia) also occur.
- If the tooth germ completely divides into two separate teeth, the result is twinning with one additional tooth in the dentition.
- Fusion of two teeth results in one fewer tooth in the dentition.
- This condition can be differentiated radiographically from gemination by two separate root canal systems found with fusion.

\section*{DENTIGEROUS CYST}
- A cyst may develop in a mandible, maxilla, or maxillary sinus that contains an unerupted tooth.
- The dentigerous (tooth-bearing) cyst develops because of cystic degeneration of the enamel reticulum of the enamel organ of an unerupted tooth.
- Most cysts are deeply situated in the jaw and are associated with misplaced or malformed secondary teeth that have failed to erupt.

\section*{AMELOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}
- Amelogenesis imperfecta is a complex group of at least 14 different clinical entities that involve developmental aberrations in enamel formation in the absence of any systemic disorder.
- This is a inherited ectodermal birth defect that primarily affects the enamel only.
- The enamel may be hypoplastic, hypocalcified, or hypomature.
- Depending on the type of amelogenesis imperfecta, the enamel may be hard or soft, pitted or smooth, and thin or normal in thickness.
- The incidence of amelogenesis imperfecta ranges from 1 in 700 to 1 in 8000, depending on the population studied.
- Multiple modes of inheritance patterns are involved.
- Classification of this condition is based on clinical and radiographic findings, as well as mode of inheritance.

\section*{DENTINOGENESIS IMPERFECTA}
- The teeth are brown to gray-blue with an opalescent sheen because the odontoblasts fail to differentiate normally and poorly calcified dentine results.
- Both deciduous and permanent teeth are usually involved.
- The enamel tends to wear down rapidly, exposing the dentine.
- This anomaly is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with the genetic defect in most cases localized on chromosome 4q and this condition is relatively common in Caucasian children.

The teeth of a child with dentinogenesis imperfecta.

\section*{DISCOLORED TEETH}
- Foreign substances incorporated into the developing enamel and dentine discolor the teeth.
- The hemolysis associated with erythroblastosis fetalis or hemolytic disease of the newborn may produce blue to black discoloration of the teeth.
- All tetracyclines are extensively incorporated into the teeth.
- The critical period at risk is from approximately 14 weeks of fetal life to the $10^{\text {th }}$ postnatal month for deciduous teeth, and from approximately 14 weeks of fetal life to the eighth postnatal year for permanent teeth.
- Tetracycline staining affects both enamel and dentine because it binds to hydroxyapatite.
- The brownish-yellow discoloration (mottling) of the teeth, produced by tetracycline, is due to the conversion of tetracycline to a colored by-product under the action of light.
- The dentine is probably affected more than the enamel because it is more permeable than enamel after tooth mineralization is complete.
- The enamel is completely formed on all but the third molars by approximately 8 years of age.
- For this reason, tetracyclines should not be administered to pregnant women or children younger than 8 years of age.

\title{
DEVELOPMENT OF \\ DEVELOPMENT OF THE FACIAL SKELETON AND ASOCIATED STRUCTURES Prof Peter Gichangi March 2017
}

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
-Describe development of facial skeleton including: face, nose, palate and paranasal sinuses
-Describe associated developmental defects

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- During the development of the face and nose, there is serial closing and then the re-opening of a space.
- This is seen in the separation of the nasal and oral cavities, and the nostrils.
- After the formation of the head fold, there is formation of two prominent swellings on the ventral aspect of the embryo separated by the stomatodaeum.
- Mesoderm covering the developing forebrain proliferates, and forms a downward projection that overlaps the upper part of the stomatodaeum.
- This downward projection is called the frontonasal process. which filled with cranial neural crest.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-04.jpg?height=1362&width=2353&top_left_y=38&top_left_x=499)

Drawing (A) of a ventral view of a 3- to 4-week embryo shows the anterior neuropore and the early formation of the maxillary processes. Drawing (B) in the late $4^{\text {th }}$ week shows closure of the anterior neuropore and the location of the future frontonasal process. Note the cardiac prominence
- Early craniofacial development is characterized by several massive migrations and displacements of cells and tissues.
- Face development is based on the timing, location, and interactions of individual streams of neural crest and mesodermal cells.
- The early cranial mesoderm consists mainly of the paraxial and prechordal mesoderm.
- Mesenchymal cells originating in the paraxial mesoderm form the connective tissue and skeletal elements of the caudal part of the cranium and the dorsal part of the neck.
- Myogenic cells from paraxial mesoderm undergo extensive migrations to form the bulk of the muscles of the cranial region.
- In the face and ventral pharynx, this connective tissue forming muscles with myogenic cells is of neural crest origin.
- The precordal mesoderm may contribute myoblasts which form the extraocular muscles.
- The lateral plate mesoderm gives rise to endothelial and smooth muscle cells.
- Note the formation of ectodermal placodes which combines with cells of the neural crest to form parts of sense organs and ganglia of certain cranial nerves.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-07.jpg?height=924&width=1532&top_left_y=176&top_left_x=820)

Relationship of paraxial mesoderm and neural crest cells
- The ectoderm overlying the frontonasal process soon shows bilateral localised thickenings - the nasal placodes, that are situated a little above the stomatodaeum.
- The formation of nasal placodes is induced by the underlying forebrain.
- The placodes soon sink below the surface to form nasal pits.
- The pits are continuous with the stomatodaeum.
- The edges of each pit are raised above the surface:
- The medial raised edge is called the medial nasal process and
- The lateral edge is called the lateral nasal process.

\section*{FORMATION OF THE FACE}
- The major development of the facial region occurs between the $4^{\text {th }}$ and $8^{\text {th }}$ embryonic weeks.
- Development of the face and jaws is a complex three process involving the patterning, outgrowth, fusion, and molding of various tissue masses.
- Three sopurces: head ectoderm; mesoderm and neural crest mesenchyme from the forebrain the first two rhombomeres.
- The forebrain acts as a signaling center for early facial development with stomodeum as the reference point.
- In the $5^{\text {th }}$ week, the oropharyngeal membrane disintegrates, creating communication between the foregut and the outside.
- $5^{\text {th }}$ week mesenchymal growth in the first branchial arch produces first the maxillary process and then the faster growing mandibular process on each side of the future face.
- The mandibular processes rapidly extend to the facial midline and merge.
- The stomodeum is now surrounded by the frontonasal process above, the paired maxillary processes on either side, and the paired mandibular processes below (future lower jaw).
- The lower face (maxillary region and lower jaw) is derived from the first pharyngeal arch.
-The face is derived from the following primordia that lie around the stomodeum:
- Unpaired frontonasal prominence
- First pharyngeal arches derivatives
- Paired maxillary prominences
- Paired mandibular prominences
- Nasal primordia derivatives
- Paired nasomedial processes
- Paired nasolateral processes

Anterior oblique drawing of an embryo in the late fourth week $(A)$ shows the stomodeum with the oropharyngeal membrane surrounded by the further development of the frontonasal process and the maxillary and mandibular processes. B, Drawing shows the breakdown of the oropharyngeal membrane by the fifth week. The early appearance of the lens and otic placodes is also seen.

Anterior oblique drawing $(A)$ of a 5-week embryo showing the appearance of the nasal (olfactory) placode. B, Drawing shows the development of the medial and lateral nasal processes forming a downward-facing "horseshoe" around the sinking nasal placode, which forms the nasal pit.

Frontal and lateral views of heads of human embryos 4 to 8 weeks of age.
Further development of the face is due mainly to the growth in size and change in position of its components.
The eyes migrate medially due to the expansion of the frontal bones. Their forwards directed position confers to man and higher primates stereoscopic vision and depth perception and contributes to increasing skull height.

\section*{FORMATION OF JAWS}
- The upper jaw contains a mixed population of neural crest cells derived from the forebrain and midbrain, whereas the lower jaw contains mesenchymal cells derived from midbrain and hindbrain (rhombomeres 1 and 2) neural crest.
- The specific morphology of facial skeletal elements is determined by signals passed from the pharyngeal endoderm to the facial ectoderm and then to the neural crest precursors of the facial bones.
- The maxillary and mandibular processes have traditionally been considered to be derivatives of the first pharyngeal arch.
- MMED? Is this correct?
- There is recent research suggesting that although some of the cells that form the maxillary process arise from the first arch, many mesenchymal cells of the maxillary process are not first-arch derivatives, but instead come from other areas of cranial neural crest.
- The outgrowth of the frontonasal prominence and the maxillary and mandibular processes depends on mesenchymalectodermal interactions.
- Despite the relatively featureless appearance of the early mandibular process (first pharyngeal arch), the mediolateral (oral-aboral) and proximodistal axes are tightly specified.
- This can explain why only certain parts are affected when gene mutations occur.
- Growth of the jaws is influenced by various growth factors, especially the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which, at different stages, are produced in either the ectoderm or the mesenchyme and can have strikingly different effects.
- The upper jaw and lip are formed as a result of the fusion and merging of the medial nasal, lateral nasal and maxillary prominences.
- The merged nasomedial processes form the intermaxillary segment, which is a precursor for
- (1) the philtrum of the lip
- (2) the premaxillary component of the upper jaw
- (3) the primary palate
- Between the maxillary process and the nasal primordium (nasolateral process) is a nasolacrimal groove (naso-optic furrow) that extends to the developing eye.
- The ectoderm of the floor of the nasolacrimal groove thickens to form a solid epithelial cord, which undergoes canalization and forms the nasolacrimal duct and, near the eye, the lacrimal sac.
- The nasolacrimal duct extends from the medial corner of the eye to the nasal cavity (inferior meatus) and, in postnatal life, acts as a drain for lacrimal fluid.
- Other fusions:
- Nasomedial process fuses with the maxillary process.
- Over the region of the nasolacrimal groove, the nasolateral process merges with the superficial region of the maxillary process.
- Between the nasomedial and maxillary process is a space called the bucconasal groove.
- The closure across the bucconasal groove is not by fusion but by the growth of an epithelial membrane, the bucconasal membrane.
- The overall fusion across the bucconasal groove is often referred to as the nasal fin, and it separates the primitive nasal cavity from the primitive oral cavity.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-18.jpg?height=998&width=2366&top_left_y=195&top_left_x=352)

Frontal drawings of 4- to 5-week ( $A$ ) and 5- to 6-week ( $B$ ) embryos illustrate the progressive displacement of the nasal sacs toward the midline as a result of medial growth of the maxillary processes. Frontal view of a 6- to 7-week embryo ( $C$ ) shows the nasolacrimal groove
- The lower jaw is formed in a simpler manner.
- The bilateral mandibular prominences enlarge, and their medial components merge in the midline, to form the point of the lower jaw.
- The midline dimple that is seen in the lower jaw of some individuals is a reflection of variation in the degree of merging of the mandibular prominences.
- A prominent cartilaginous rod called Meckel's cartilage differentiates within the lower jaw.
- Derived from neural crest cells of the first pharyngeal arch, Meckel's cartilage forms the basis around which membranous bone (which forms the definitive skeleton of the lower jaw) is laid down.
- Shortly after the basic facial structures take shape, they are invaded by mesodermal cells associated with the first and second pharyngeal arches.
- These cells form the muscles of mastication (first-arch derivatives, which are innervated by cranial nerve V) and the muscles of facial expression (second-arch derivatives, which are innervated by cranial nerve VII).
- At the level of individual muscles, highly coordinated spatiotemporal relationships between mesodermal and neural crest cells are very important in the determination of muscle attachments and the overall shape of the muscles.
- Although the basic structure of the face is established between 4 and 8 weeks, changes in the proportionality of the various regions continue until well after birth.
- In particular, the midface remains underdeveloped during embryogenesis and early postnatal life.

\section*{TEMPORAL MANDIBULAR JOINT}
- The temporomandibular joint is a complex synovial joint between the mandibular condyle and the squamous part of the temporal bone.
- It has an articular disk between the two bones.
- The disc and joint cavity formation during TMJ development are complex and rather unique processes that are distinct from those occurring in developing joints at other skeletal sites.
- This joint is formed late during development, first appearing as mesenchymal condensations associated with the temporal bone and mandibular condyle during the $7^{\text {th }}$ week of development.
- The condylar condensation differentiates into cartilage, forms a growth plate-like structure, and becomes distinguishable into four distinct portions along its main axis:
- a fibrous cell layer,
- a polymorphic progenitor cell layer,
- a zone of flattened chondrocytes, and
- a zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes
- The elongation process is largely due to appositional growth at its apical end which is different from other long bones which elongate by mitotic activity of chondrocytes within the proliferative zone of the growth plate.
- The articular disk and capsule begin to take shape a week later, and the actual joint cavity forms between weeks 9 and 11 weeks.
- The articular disc develops a separate flat-shaped mesenchymal condensation located between condyle apex and temporal bone.
- TMJ development is considered to be in three phases:
- 1) the blastematic stage (weeks 7-8 of development);
- 2) the cavitation stage (weeks 9-11 of development); and
- 3) the maturation stage (after week 12 of development).

\section*{MIDFACIAL DEVELOPMENT}
- During the $5^{\text {th }}$ week, while the olfactory portions of the nasal sacs are developing, the maxillary processes grow medially resulting in medial displacement of the nasal sacs.
- At the same time, there is also some ventrolateral expansion of each medial nasal process, which causes compression of each nasal sac aperture into a slit-shaped opening.
- Merging of the nasomedial process (globular process of His forms the intermaxillary segment, primary palate.

Drawing from below of a 6-week fetus showing the emergence of the intermaxillary segment below the medial nasal processes.

\section*{UPPER LIP}
- Each maxillary process now grows medially and fuses, first with the lateral nasal process, and then with the medial nasal process.
- The two merged medial nasal processes then form the philtrum and columella and complete the upper lip.
- The fusion of the two medial nasal processes displaces the frontonasal process superiorly and posteriorly.
- Although the frontonasal process formed the upper border of the stomodeum, it does not contribute to the definitive upper lip, jaw, or nasal tip.
- The medial migration of the maxillary processes forms not only the lateral upper lip but the upper cheek regions, resulting in continuity of the upper jaw and lip.
- The medial and lateral nasal processes also fuse with each other.
- In this way the nasal pits (now called external nares) are cut off from the stomodaeum.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-25.jpg?height=1144&width=2518&top_left_y=219&top_left_x=293)

Frontal drawings of the upper lip region in embryos at $5(A), 6(B)$ and $7(C)$ weeks show the progressive medial growth of the maxillary processes toward the midline.
- Formation of Lower Lip
- The mandibular processes of the two sides grow towards each other and fuse in the midline.
- They now form the lower margin of the stomatodaeum.
- The fused mandibular processes give rise to the lower lip, and to the lower jaw.
- Formation of Cheeks
- After formation of the upper and lower lips, the stomatodaeum (which can now be called the mouth) is very broad.
- In its lateral part, it is bounded above by the maxillary process and below by the mandibular process.
- These processes undergo progressive fusion with each other to form the cheeks.

\section*{FORMATION OF NOSE}
- At the end of the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, the ectoderm on each side of the frontal prominence thickens and forms the nasal or olfactory placodes.
- The nasal placodes originate from ecotoderm on the anterolateral edge of the frontalnasal process before closure of the neural tube.
- Each nasal placode begins to deepen forming nasal pit as a result of active growth of the placodal epithelium and proliferation of the mesenchyme deep to the edges of the placode.
- The mesenchyme around the placodes proliferates and causes elevations on both sides with the lateral one forming first followed by the medial one.
- These elevations are called nasomedial and lateral nasolateral folds or processes, horseshoe-shaped with open ends facing the future mouth.
- The nasal pits deepen to form nasal sacs which continue to grow towards the oral cavity.
- By $6^{\text {th }}$ week, only a thin oronasal/bucconasal membrane separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity.
- The oronasal membrane soon breaks down, thereby making the nasal cavities continuous with the oral cavity through openings behind the primary palate called nasal choanae.
- Shortly after breakdown of the oronasal/bucconasal membrane, the outer part of the nasal cavity becomes blocked with a plug of epithelial cells, which persists until the end of the fourth month.
- The region occupied by the plug will become the nasal vestibule and the future limen nasi, which is a ridge separating the nasal cavity proper from the vestibule of the nose.
- As a consequence, the nasal vestibule consists of skin and adnexa derived from ectoderm.
- If this epithelial plug does not disintegrate, atresia of the nostril will

Scanning electron micrograph of 7-week human embryo.
- The medial nasal process is more prominent than the lateral nasal process, extending farther ventrally and caudally.
- Each medial nasal process has an enlarged caudal end that is called the "globular process of His".
- As the nasal primordia merge toward the midline during weeks $6^{\text {th }}$ and $7^{\text {th }}$ weeks, the nasomedial processes form the tip and crest of the nose along with part of the nasal septum, and the nasolateral processes form the wings (alae) of the nose.
- The receding frontonasal process contributes to part of the bridge of the nose.
- On each side of the face, along the junction between the maxillary and lateral nasal processes is the nasolacrimal groove (naso-optic furrow).
- The nasolacrimal groove extends between the developing lower lateral nose and the medial orbit.
- These ducts usually become completely patent only after birth.
- The epithelium of each nasal pit induces the surrounding neural crest mesenchyme to form a cartilaginous capsule around it.
- In a three-dimensionally complex manner, the medial parts of the nasal capsules combine with more centrally derived deep neural crest mesenchyme to form the midline nasal septum and ethmoid bones.
- The lateral region of the nasal capsule forms the nasal bones.
- During the $3^{\text {rd }}$ month, shelflike structures called nasal conchae form from the ethmoid bones on the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.
- The size and shape of these structures have a significant impact on the form of the face during its postnatal growth period.
- At 6 to 7 weeks, a pair of epithelial ingrowths can be seen in each side of the nasal septum near the palate.
- Developing as invaginations from the medial portion of the nasal placode, these diverticula, known as vomeronasal organs, reach a maximum size of about 6 to 8 mm at around the sixth fetal month and then begin to regress, leaving small cystic structures.
- In most mammals and many other vertebrates, the vomeronasal organs, which are lined with a modified olfactory epithelium, remain prominent and are involved in the olfaction of food in the mouth or sexual olfactory stimuli (e.g., pheromones).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-33.jpg?height=1064&width=2348&top_left_y=110&top_left_x=459)

A and B, Frontal sections through the human head, showing fusion of the palatal shelves. Note vomeronasal organ in the nasal septum
- The dorsal most ectodermal epithelium of the nasal pits undergoes differentiation as a highly specialized olfactory epithelium.
- Beginning in the embryonic period and continuing throughout life, the olfactory epithelium is able to form primitive sensory bipolar neurons, which send axonal projections toward the olfactory bulb of the brain.
- Preceding axonal ingrowth, some cells break free from this epithelium and migrate toward the brain.
- Other cells migrating from the olfactory placode (specifically, the vomeronasal primordium) synthesize luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and migrate to the hypothalamus, the site of synthesis and release of this hormone in adults.
- The embryonic origin of these cells in the olfactory placode helps to explain the basis for Kallmann's syndrome, which is characterized by anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
- Cells of the olfactory placode also form supporting (sustentacular) cells and glandular cells in the olfactory region of the nose.
- Physiological evidence shows that the olfactory epithelium is capable of some function in late fetal life, but full olfactory function is not attained until after birth.

Sagittal sections through embryonic heads with special emphasis on development of the nasal chambers. A, At 5 weeks. B, At 6 weeks. C, At weeks. D, At 7 weeks. E, At 12 weeks.
- Anomalies of the Nasal Cavity
- There may be atresia of the cavity at the external nares, at the posterior nasal aperture, or in the cavity proper.
- This may be unilateral or bilateral.
- Very rarely, there may be total absence of the nasal passages.
- Congenital defects in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone may lead to a communication between the cranial cavity and the nose.
- The nasal septum may not be in the middle line, i.e. it may be deflected to one side.
- The septum may be absent.
- The nasal cavity may communicate with the mouth.

\section*{PARANASAL SINUS}
- The paranasal sinuses namely the frontal, maxillary, ethmoidal and sphenoidal, develop during the $3^{\text {rd }}$ month as diverticula of the nasal mucosa into the corresponding bones after which they are named.
- The growth of the sinuses and their pneumatization occurs at different rates.
- The maxillary and sphenoidal sinuses are the first to appear before birth followed by others after birth.
- The frontal sinuses do not develop into the frontal bones until the second year and they may be absent.
- The paranasal sinuses reach their maximum size around puberty.
- Enlargement of paranasal sinuses is associated with overall enlargement of the facial skeleton, including the jaws.
- This provides space in the jaws for growth and eruption of teeth.
- Absences of frontal and sphenoidal sinuses are characteristics feature of mongolism.

\section*{FORMATION OF PALATE}
- The early embryo possesses a common oronasal cavity.
- The palate forms between 6 and 10 weeks to separate the oral from the nasal cavity.
- The palate is derived from three primordia: an unpaired median palatine process, a pair of lateral palatine processes with contribution from nasal septum.
- The median palatine process is an ingrowth from the merged nasomedial processes.
- As it grows, the median palatine process forms a triangular bony structure called the primary palate.
- In postnatal life, the skeletal component of the primary palate is referred to as the premaxillary component of the maxilla.
- The four upper incisor teeth arise from this structure.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-39.jpg?height=1226&width=1796&top_left_y=140&top_left_x=616)

Development of the palate as seen from below
- Formation of the palate involves
- (1) growth of the palatal shelves,
- (2) their elevation,
- (3) their fusion, and
- (4) removal of the epithelial at the site of fusion
- The lateral palatine processes, which are the precursors of the secondary palate, first appear as outgrowths of the maxillary processes during the sixth week.
- At first, they grow downward on either side of the tongue.
- Similar to other facial primordia, outgrowth of the palatal shelves involves ectodermal-mesenchymal interactions and specific growth factors.
- During week 7, the lateral palatine processes (palatal shelves) dramatically dislodge from their positions alongside the tongue and become oriented perpendicularly to the maxillary processes.
- The mechanism underlying the elevation of the palatine shelves remains obscure.
- The apices of these processes meet in the midline and begin to fuse.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-41.jpg?height=996&width=1822&top_left_y=119&top_left_x=722)

Postnatal bony palate, showing the premaxillary segment
- The nasal septum, a midline downgrowth structure from the frontonasal prominence reaches the level of the palatal shelves when the palatal shelves fuse to form the definitive secondary palate.
- The nasal septum is also continuous with the primary palate.
- The fusion of the free lower edge of the nasal septum with forming palate separates the two nasal cavities from each other, while the palate separate them from the mouth.
- The midline point of the fusion of the primary palate with the two palatal shelves is marked by the midpalatal suture and incisive foramen.
- During the process of fusion, the midline abutting epithelial disappears.
- The epithelium on the nasal surface of the palate differentiates into a ciliated columnar type, whereas the epithelium on the oral surface of the palate differentiates into a stratified squamous epithelium.
- Their fusion begins anteriorly and proceeds backwards.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-43.jpg?height=1179&width=2561&top_left_y=74&top_left_x=348)

Drawings from below show the development of the palate from 6 to 7 weeks ( $A$ ), 7 to 8 weeks ( $B$ ), and 8 to 10 weeks (C).
- At a later stage, the mesenchyme in the palate undergoes intramembranous ossification to form the hard palate.
- However, ossification does not extend into the most posterior portion, which remains as the soft palate and midline uvula.
- Initially the hard palate is a flat unarched roof to the mouth.
- Later, the depth of the palatal arch increases cranially in association with tooth eruption.
- Congenital malformations of the lip and palate
- Congenital defects in relation to failure of fusion or incomplete development of the components of the face and palate are common and more frequent in males.
- The causes, besides the hereditary trend (20-30\%) in the same family, may be due to maternal infection during pregnancy (virus), alcoholism or dietry defíciencies.
- Cleft Lip and Palate
- Cleft lip or harelip is due to defective fusion between the maxillary and nasomedial processes and can be unilateral or bilateral.
- The defect may be partial, involving only the lips (1 in 1000 birth), or total, extending into the nasal fossa with involvement of the alveolar ridge.
- The nose is deviated and there is flattering of the ala of the affected side.
- If the parents are healthy but have one child with harelip, the probability of a second child with the same defect lies between the $4 \%$ and $7 \%$.
- If one of the parents is affected by harelip the probability for a second child with cleft lip is between 11\% and 14\%.
- In the most complete form of cleft lip and palate, the entire premaxillary segment is separated from both maxillae, with resulting bilateral clefts that run through the lip and the upper jaw between the lateral incisors and the canine teeth.
- The point of convergence of the two clefts is the incisive foramen.
- The premaxillary segment commonly protrudes past the normal facial contours when viewed from the side.
- The mechanism frequently underlying cleft lip is hypoplasia of the maxillary process that prevents contact between the maxillary and nasomedial processes from being established.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-46.jpg?height=1082&width=2423&top_left_y=82&top_left_x=414)

B, Bilateral cleft lip and palate similar to that seen in the patient in Figure 14.19A. C, Midline palatal cleft. D, Bilateral cleft lip and palate continuous with a midline cleft of the secondary palate
- Cleft palate or palatoschisis is caused by failure of the palatine processes (palatal shelves) to fuse with an incidence of approximately 1 in 2500 births.
- The deformity can be partial, involving only the uvula, part or all of the hard and soft palates, or complete in which the alveolar ridges are also affected.
- As with cleft lip, cleft palate cause is usually multifactorial.
- Some chromosomal syndromes (e.g., trisomy 13) are characterized by a high incidence of clefts.
- In other cases, cleft lip and cleft palate can be linked to the action of a chemical teratogen (e.g., anticonvulsant medications).
- In humans, mutations of MSX1 are strongly associated with nonsyndromic cleft palate.
- The higher female incidence of cleft palate may be related to the occurrence of fusion of the palatal shelves in female embryos about 1 week later than in male embryos, thus prolonging the susceptible period.
- The genetic and molecular basis of normal palate closure is complex.
- Even closure of the anterior and posterior parts of the palate operates under different combinations of molecular interactions.
- Consequently, more than 300 genetic syndromes include cleft palate as part of the spectrum of disease.
- In these cases there is extensive irregular dental occlusion with rotated and misplaced teeth.
- These defects interfere with sucking, proper nutrition and later with development of speech.
- Frequently, infections of the nasopharynx and ear are serious consequences.
- Surgery attains good results in the harelip at 4-6 weeks of age and around the second year for cleft palate.
- Oblique Facial Cleft
- Oblique facial cleft is a rare defect that results when the maxillary process fails to fuse with the corresponding nasolateral process, usually resulting from hypoplasia of one of the tissue masses.
- The result is a groove on the face along the line of the nasolacrimal duct.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-49.jpg?height=1123&width=2246&top_left_y=106&top_left_x=463)

Varieties of facial clefts. A, Oblique facial cleft combined with a cleft lip. B, Macrostomia. C, Medial cleft lip with a partial nasal cleft.

\section*{- Macrostomia (Lateral Facial Cleft) and microstomia}
- Macrostomia, a rare malformation results from hypoplasia or poor merging of the maxillary and mandibular processes.
- This condition manifests as a very large mouth on one or both sides.
- In severe cases, the cleft can reach almost to the ears.
- Microstomia is an abnormally small mouth

\section*{- Median Cleft Lip}
- Another rare anomaly, median cleft lip, results from incomplete merging of the two nasomedial processes.

\section*{- First arch syndrome and other jaw defects}
- The entire first arch may remain underdeveloped on one or both sides, affecting the lower eyelid (coloboma type defect), the maxilla, the mandible, and the external ear.
- The prominence of the cheek is absent and the ear may be displaced ventrally and caudally.
- There may be presence of cleft palate and of faulty dentition.
- This condition is called mandibulofacial dysostosis, Treacher Collins syndrome or first arch syndrome.
- This is a genetic condition inherited as autosomal dominant.
- The mandible may be small compared to the rest of the face resulting in a receding chin (retrognathia). In extreme cases it may fail to develop (agnathia).

\section*{- Holoprosencephaly and face, nose and palate defects}
- Because of the significant role of influences from the forebrain in development of the face and associated structures, primary defects of the forebrain often manifest externally as facial malformations, typically a reduction in tissue of the frontonasal process.
- Severe reduction in frontonasal process could result in cyclopia, absent nose or tubular proboscis.
- Midline defects of the upper lip can also be attributed to holoprosencephaly.
- Many cases of holoprosencephaly (e.g., Meckel's syndrome, which includes midline cleft lip, olfactory bulb absence or hypoplasia, and nasal abnormalities) can be attributed to genetic causes.
- Meckel's syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition.
- Other factors which have been associated with holoprosencephaly include: exposure to an excess of retinoic acid; maternal consumption of alcohol during the first month of pregnancy; maternal diabetes and trisomies of chromosomes 13 and 18.

\section*{- Frontonasal Dysplasia}
- Frontonasal dysplasia encompasses various nasal malformations that result from excessive tissue in the frontonasal process.
- The spectrum of anomalies usually includes a broad nasal bridge and hypertelorism (an excessive distance between the eyes).
- In very severe cases, the two external nares are separated, often by several centimeters, and a median cleft lip can occur.

\section*{- Torus palatines}
- This is genetically and anthropologically a bony growth in the midline of the hard palate which occurs in about $60 \%$ of the Eskimos.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-51.jpg?height=1141&width=2481&top_left_y=93&top_left_x=469)

A to C, Varying degrees of frontonasal dysplasia

\section*{Remodeling and Postnatal growth of the face}
- During the early fetal period, the nose is flat, the mandible appears small, and the orbits face laterally.
- As the brain enlarges, the cranial vault expands to each side causing the orbits to face forward.
- The ostia of the external auditory canals remain stationary but appear to rise because the jaw elongates and grows downward.
- Early on, the stomodeum extends across nearly the full width of the embryonic face.
- Differential growth of the facial elements brings the eyes and lateral portions of the maxilla and mandible to a more frontal location.
- Although the expansion of the cranial vault does make the mouth appear smaller, it is the formation of the cheeks by progressive fusion of the maxillary with the mandibular processes at the lateral angles of the mouth that most reduces the size of the mouth.
- The coronal plane along which the oropharyngeal membrane originally attached eventually corresponds to the plane of the Waldeyer ring.
- The progressive depth of this ring in the postnatal period is due to the dominant differential growth of the ventral face.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-53.jpg?height=1060&width=2055&top_left_y=159&top_left_x=486)

Lateral drawings of a 7 - to 8 -week embryo (A) and an 8- to 10-week fetus (B) show that the opening of the external auditory canal remains stationary but appears to rise because the progressive elongation of the jaw creates this impression.

\section*{- Later Facial Growth}
- At birth, the skull has a sagittal suture system that divides the cranium and face into left and right halves.
- Anteriorly, this system is made up of the metopic suture, the internasal suture, the intermaxillary suture, and the mandibular symphysis.
- Posteriorly, the sagittal suture system splits around the body of the sphenoid bone, along the cartilage between the body of the sphenoid and the greater wings of the sphenoid.
- The sagittal system does not bisect the entire skull because other midline structures basioccipit, basisphenoid, lesser wings of the sphenoid, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid, and the interorbital portion of the frontal bone extend from the foramen magnum to the nasion.
- By 8-9 weeks, the initial skeleton of the face is cartilaginous and composed of the nasal capsule in the upper face and Meckel cartilage in the lower face.
- The chondrocranium forms the skull base.
- By 12 weeks, most of the ossification centers have appeared in the membranous bones, and the enchondral ethmoid bone has started to ossify.
- Ossification then proceeds within these bones.
- During the late fetal period and until the first postnatal year, growth in the width of the craniofacial skeleton occurs at the midsagittal suture system.
- The main mechanism of this growth is the progressive enlargement of the brain and growth of the cartilage between the body and greater wings of the sphenoid bone.
- In the first year of life, the metopic suture unites, and soon after, the mandibular symphysis unites.
- Then the greater sphenoid wings unite with the sphenoid body.
- These changes close the midline sagittal suture system, and it ceases to be a growth site.
- At approximately 3 years, ossification of the cribriform plates unites the ethmoid bodies with the perpendicular plate, creating a single ethmoid bone and stabilizing the interocular and upper nasal regions.
- The progressive growth of the nasal septal cartilage "pushes" the midface forward and thus contributes to the facial anteroposterior growth.
- After the third year, separation of the maxillary bones is still possible, as is separation of the zygomatic bone from the maxilla.
- However, with completion of the growth of the orbits between the seventh and 10th years, further outward movement of the maxilla and zygoma ceases at these sutures.
- Further growth of the upper facial skeleton takes place by surface bone deposition in association with internal bone resorption.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_27_5a75b3617fbee2a09fe2g-55.jpg?height=894&width=1124&top_left_y=187&top_left_x=1092)

B, Frontal drawing of the body of the sphenoid bone, the greater sphenoid wings, and the cartilage between them (black). C, Frontal drawing of the midfacial structures at approximately 3 years of age. The union of the ethmoid bodies (pink) with the perpendicular plate (orange) as a result of ossification of the cribriform plates (green) makes the ethmoid bone a single bone and stabilizes the interocular and upper nasal regions. The maxilla is beige; vomer, yellow; septal cartilage, light blue.

\section*{Childhood to Adulthood Facial Remodeling}
- As one ages from childhood to adulthood, there is a constant growth and remodeling of the facial bones, which results in changes in the facial morphology.
- Overall, there is forward and downward growth of the face with progressing age.
- Growth of the mandible begins later and continues longer than does the growth of the midface and orbits.
- During the first decade of life, the forehead grows in an anterior and slightly upward direction. This contributes to the elevation and widening of the nasal bridge.
- The zygomatic/maxillary region grows progressively posteriorly as the dental arch becomes elongated by addition of new bone on the posterior margin of the maxilla.
- The part of the maxilla anterior to the zygomatic arch regresses while the posterior portion increases in size.
- The backward movement of the malar region and the forward growth of the supraorbital region serve to draw out the anteroposterior dimensions of the face.
- The inferior orbital rim and the superior orbital rim are in the same coronal plane in the young face, but in the older face, the supraorbital region protrudes forward of the cheek.
- In the transverse plane, the maxillary bones and the ethmoid bodies grow apart from one another so that the interocular distance increases with age.
- The movement of the nasal area combined with the malar movement results in an increase in the vertical size and the width of the upper part of each nasal cavity.
- The mandibular ramus becomes progressively deeper in its anteroposterior dimension.
- The ramus also increases in vertical dimension, accommodating the marked downward growth of the nasomaxillary complex and the eruption of the teeth.
- The young face appears somewhat brachycephalic because it is relatively wide and vertically short. The dentition has not yet become fully established, and the jaws have not yet grown to their full vertical extent.
- The young face also appears small compared with the cranium when the craniofacial sizes are compared with an adult skull.
- Thus, compared with an adult face, the young face appears "cute," with wide-set large eyes, a small jaw, a small "pug" nose, prominent cheeks, a high flat forehead without full eyebrows ridges, a low nasal bridge, and a small mouth.
- The growth of the face is characterized by the initial rapid expansion of the upper third which is associated with the development of the frontal lobes of the brain.
- It is almost completed at the age of twelve years.
- The middle and lower two thirds grow more slowly and their development is in relation to the respiratory needs, the influence of the masticatory apparatus and later to the eruption of the third molars. It is completed between the ages of 18-25 years.
- The height and width of the face are also related to the growth of the eyes which separates the skeletal components at the frontomaxillary and frontozygomatic sutures.
- The medial migration of the position of the eyes is due to the expansion of the frontal and temporal bones.
- The shape of the face is determined by the nose cavity and as nasal septum.
- Defective development of the septum results in a concave shape of the face. The nasal cavity also influences the growth and form of the face.
- In the case of inadequate nasal respiration (hyperthrophy of the adenoids), the face appears narrow and pinched.
- Permanent appearance is attained at about the age of 25 years.

Lateral diagram of the fetal skull (A) (darker areas) and the adult skull (B) (lighter areas) shows that the inferior orbital rim and the superior orbital rim are in the same plane in the young face (dark line in A), but in the older face, the supraorbital region protrudes forward of the cheek (dark line in B). Frontal diagrams (C and D) show that as the maxillary bones and the ethmoid bodies separate from one another, this movement increases the lateral growth of the interocular distance. As a result, the orbits enlarge and shift laterally (C). The movement of the nasal area combined with the malar movement results in an increase in the vertical size and the width of the upper part of each nasal

- Early eye development results from a series of inductive signals.
- The eyes are derived from four sources:
- The neuroectoderm of the forebrain
- The surface ectoderm of the head
- The mesoderm between the above layers
- Neural crest cells
- The neuroectoderm of the forebrain differentiates into the:
- retina,
- the posterior layers of the iris,
- optic nerve.
- The surface ectoderm forms:
- the lens of the eye
- the corneal epithelium.
- The mesoderm between the neuroectoderm and surface ectoderm gives rise to the:
- Fibrous tissue
- vascular coats of the eye.
- Neural crest differentiate into:
- the choroid,
- sclera,
- corneal endothelium
- Homeobox-containing genes, including the transcription regulator Pax6, fibroblast growth factors, and other inducing factors play an important role in the molecular development of the eye.
- Eye development is first evident at the beginning of the fourth week.

\section*{Events:}
- Appearance of Optic grooves (sulci) in the neural folds at the cranial end of the embryo.
- Evagination of the optic grooves to form hollow diverticula - optic vesicles - that project from the wall of the forebrain into the adjacent mesenchyme.
- The cavities of the optic vesicles are continuous with the cavity of the forebrain.
- Formation of hollow optic stalks by constriction of the connection with forebrain and expansion of the distal ends of optic vesicle.

A to $\mathbf{G}$, Early development of the human eye
- The optic vesicles as it grows makes contact with the surface ectoderm leading to its thickening to form lens placodes, the lens primordia.
- Formation of lens placodes is induced by the optic vesicles.
- The lens placodes invaginate to form lens pits.
- The edges of the pits approach each other and fuse to form spherical lens vesicles, which soon lose their connection with the surface ectoderm.
- As the lens vesicles are developing, the optic vesicles invaginate to form double-walled optic cups.
- The opening of each cup is large at first, but its rim infolds around the lens.
- The lens vesicles lose their connection with the surface ectoderm and enter the cavities of the optic cups.
- Retinal fissures (optic fissures) develop on the ventral surface of the optic cups and along the optic stalk.
- The fissures contain vascular mesenchyme from which the hyaloid blood vessels develop.
- The hyaloid artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery, supplies the inner layer of the optic cup, the lens vesicle, and the mesenchyme in the cavity of the optic cup.
- The hyaloid vein returns blood from these structures.
- As the edges of the retinal fissure fuse, the hyaloid vessels are enclosed within the primordial optic nerve.
- Distal parts of the hyaloid vessels eventually degenerate, but proximal parts persist as the central artery and vein of the retina.

The optic vesicle and the optic stalk invaginate, forming the choroid fissure inferiorly.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE RETINA}
- The retina develops from the walls of the optic cup, an outgrowth of the forebrain.
- The outer, thinner layer of the optic cup becomes the retinal pigment epithelium (pigmented layer of retina),
- The inner, thicker layer differentiates into the neural retina (neural layer of retina).
- During the embryonic and early fetal periods, the two retinal layers are separated by an intraretinal space, which is the original cavity of the optic cup.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-017.jpg?height=1117&width=2115&top_left_y=376&top_left_x=186)
- Before birth, intraretinal space gradually disappears as the two layers of the retina fuse, but this fusion is not firm - can separate neural layer from the pigment layer.
- Layers of the optic cup are continuous with the wall of the brain-out growth of forebrain.
- Under the influence of the developing lens, the inner layer of the optic cup proliferates to form a thick neuroepithelium.
- Neuroepithelium cells differentiate into the neural retina.

![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-021.jpg?height=1446&width=1203&top_left_y=119&top_left_x=1152) of the layers of the neural retina
- Neural retina contains photoreceptors (rods and cones) and the cell bodies of neurons (e.g., bipolar and ganglion cells).
- Retinal ganglion cell differentiation is signaled/regulated by Fibroblast growth factor.
- Because the optic vesicle invaginates as it forms the optic cup, the neural retina is "inverted," that is, lightsensitive parts of the photoreceptor cells are adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium.
- Light must pass through the thickest part of the retina before reaching the receptors.
- However, because the retina overall is thin and transparent, it does not form a barrier to light.
- The axons of ganglion cells in the superficial layer of the neural retina grow proximally in the wall of the optic stalk to the brain.
- As a result, the cavity of the optic stalk is gradually obliterated as the axons of the many ganglion cells form the optic nerve.
- Myelination of optic nerve fibers is incomplete at birth.
- After the eyes have been exposed to light for approximately 10 weeks, myelination is complete, but the process normally stops short of the optic disc, where the optic nerve enters the eyeball.
- Normal newborn infants can see, but not too well; they respond to changes in illumination and are able to fixate points of contrast.
- Visual acuity has been estimated to be in the range of 20/400.
- At 2 weeks of age, the infants show a more sustained interest in large objects.

\section*{CONGENITAL DETACHMENT OF THE RETINA}
- Congenital detachment of the retina occurs when the inner and outer layers of the optic cup fail to fuse during the fetal period to obliterate the intraretinal space - primary detachment.
- Detachment may be partial or complete.
- Retinal detachment may result from unequal rates of growth of the two retinal layers; as a result, the layers of the optic cup are not in perfect apposition.
- Secondary detachments usually occur in association with other anomalies of the eye and head.
- Although separated from the retinal pigment epithelium, the neural retina retains its blood supply (central artery of retina), derived from the embryonic hyaloid artery.
- Detached retina may follow a blow to the eyeball, as may occur during a boxing match.
- As a result, fluid accumulates between the layers and vision is impaired.

\section*{EDEMA OF THE OPTIC DISC}
- The optic nerve is surrounded by three sheaths that evaginated with the optic vesicle and stalk; which are continuous with the meninges of the brain.
- The outer dural sheath from the dura mater is thick and fibrous and blends with the sclera.
- The intermediate sheath from the arachnoid mater is thin.
- The inner sheath from the pia mater is vascular and closely invests the optic nerve and central vessels of the retina as far as the optic disc.
- Cerebrospinal fluid is present in the subarachnoid space between the intermediate and inner sheaths of the optic nerve.
- The relationship of the sheaths of the optic nerve to the meninges of the brain and the subarachnoid space is important clinically.
- An increase in CSF pressure (often resulting from increased intracranial pressure) slows venous return from the retina, causing papilledema (fluid accumulation) of the optic disc.
- This occurs because the retinal vessels are covered by pia mater and lie in the extension of the subarachnoid space that surrounds the optic nerve.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE CILIARY BODY}
- The ciliary body is a wedge-shaped extension of the choroid.
- Its medial surface projects toward the lens, forming ciliary processes.
- The pigmented portion of the ciliary epithelium is derived from the outer layer of the optic cup and is continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium.
- The nonpigmented portion of the ciliary epithelium represents the anterior prolongation of the neural retina in which no neural elements develop.
- The ciliary muscle-the smooth muscle of the ciliary body that is responsible for focusing the lens-and the connective tissue in the ciliary body develop from mesenchyme located at the edge of the optic cup in the region between the anterior scleral condensation and the ciliary pigment epithelium.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE IRIS}
- The iris develops from the rim of the optic cup, which grows inward and partially covers the lens.
- The two layers of the optic cup remain thin in this area.
- The epithelium of the iris represents both layers of the optic cup; it is continuous with the double-layered epithelium of the ciliary body and with the retinal pigment epithelium and neural retina.
- The connective tissue framework (stroma) of the iris is derived from neural crest cells that migrate into the iris.
- The dilator pupillae and sphincter pupillae muscles of the iris are derived from neuroectoderm of the optic cup.
- They appear to arise from the anterior epithelial cells of the iris.
- These smooth muscles result from a transformation of epithelial cells into smooth muscle cells.

19 weeks

\section*{COLOR OF THE IRIS}
- The iris is typically light blue or gray in most newborn infants.
- The iris acquires its definitive color as pigmentation occurs during the first 6 to 10 months.
- The concentration and distribution of pigmentcontaining cells-chromatophores-in the loose vascular connective tissue of the iris determine eye color.
- If the melanin pigment is confined to the pigmented epithelium on the posterior surface of the iris, the iris appears blue.
- If melanin is also distributed throughout the stroma (supporting tissue) of the iris, the eye appears brown.

\section*{CONGENITAL ANIRIDIA}
- In this rare anomaly, there is almost complete absence of the iris.
- This defect results from an arrest of development at the rim of the optic cup during the eighth week.
- The anomaly may be associated with glaucoma and other eye abnormalities.
- Aniridia may be familial, the transmission being dominant or sporadic.
- In humans, mutation of the Pax6 gene results in aniridia.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-036.jpg?height=767&width=2102&top_left_y=283&top_left_x=199)

Heterochromia (also known as a heterochromia iridis or heterochromia iridium) is an ocular condition in which one iris is a different color from the other iris. The subject on the photo above has a brown and hazel eye.

\section*{Coloboma of the Iris}
- Coloboma is a defect in the inferior sector of the iris or a notch in the pupillary margin, giving the pupil a keyhole appearance.
- The defect may be limited to the iris or it may extend deeper and involve the ciliary body and retina.
- A typical coloboma of the iris results from failure of closure of the retinal fissure during the sixth week.
- The defect may be caused by environmental factors.
- A simple coloboma is frequently hereditary and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant characteristic.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-038.jpg?height=1603&width=2096&top_left_y=137&top_left_x=202)

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE LENS}
- The lens develops from the lens vesicle, a derivative of the surface ectoderm.
- The anterior wall of this vesicle, composed of cuboidal epithelium, becomes the subcapsular lens epithelium.
- The nuclei of the tall columnar cells forming the posterior wall of the lens vesicle undergo dissolution.
- These cells lengthen considerably to form highly transparent epithelial cells, the primary lens fibers.
- As these fibers grow, they gradually obliterate the cavity of the lens vesicle.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-040.jpg?height=900&width=2116&top_left_y=462&top_left_x=192)
© Elsevier. Moore \& Persaud: The Developing Human 8e - www.studentconsult.com
- The rim of the lens is known as the equatorial zone because it is located midway between the anterior and posterior poles of the lens.
- The cells in the equatorial zone are cuboidal; as they elongate, they lose their nuclei and become secondary lens fibers.
- These new lens fibers are added to the external sides of the primary lens fibers.
- Although secondary lens fibers continue to form during adulthood and the lens increases in diameter, the primary lens fibers must last a lifetime.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-042.jpg?height=1175&width=2122&top_left_y=63&top_left_x=243)

Photomicrograph of a portion of the developing eye. Observe that the lens fibers have elongated and obliterated the cavity of the lens vesicle. Note that the inner layer of the optic cup has thickened greatly to form the neural retina and that the outer layer is heavily pigmented (retinal pigment epithelium).
- Lens nutrition
- During development: distal part of the hyaloid artery;.
- Later nutrition when avascular: from the aqueous humor in the posterior and anterior chamber of the eye, and from the vitreous humor.
- The developing lens is invested by a vascular mesenchymal layer, the tunica vasculosa lentis.
- The anterior part of this capsule is the pupillary membrane.
- When hyaloid artery degenerate, the tunica vasculosa lentis and pupillary membrane degenerate.
- The lens capsule produced by the anterior lens epithelium and the lens fibers persists.
- The lens capsule represents a greatly thickened basement membrane.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-044.jpg?height=1510&width=2116&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=192)
© Elsevier. Moore \& Persaud: The Developing Human 8e - www.studentconsult.com
- The vitreous body forms within the cavity of the optic cup.
- It is composed of vitreous humor, an avascular mass of transparent, gel-like, intercellular substance.
- The primary vitreous humor is derived from mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin.
- The primary vitreous humor does not increase but it is surrounded by a gelatinous secondary vitreous humor, generally believed to arise from the inner layer of the optic cup.
- The secondary vitreous humor consists of primitive hyalocytes (vitreous cells), collagenous material, and traces of hyaluronic acid.

\section*{PERSISTENT PUPILLARY MEMBRANE}
- Remnants of the pupillary membrane, which covers the anterior surface of the lens during the embryonic period, may persist as weblike strands of connective tissue or vascular arcades over the pupil in newborns, especially in premature infants.
- This tissue seldom interferes with vision and tends to atrophy.
- Very rarely the entire pupillary membrane persists, giving rise to congenital atresia of the pupil.

\section*{PERSISTENCE OF THE HYALOID ARTERY}
- The distal part of the hyaloid artery normally degenerates as its proximal part becomes the central artery of the retina.
- If the distal part of the hyaloid artery persists, it may appear as a freely moving, nonfunctional vessel or as a wormlike structure projecting from the optic disc.
- Sometimes the hyaloid artery remnant may appear as a fine strand traversing the vitreous body.
- In other cases, a remnant of the artery may form a cyst.
- In unusual cases, the entire distal part of the artery persists and extends from the optic disc through the vitreous body to the lens.
- In most of these unusual cases, the eye is microphthalmic (very small).

\section*{CONGENITAL APHAKIA}
- Absence of the lens is extremely rare and results from failure of the lens placode to form during the fourth week.
- Congenital aphakia could also result from failure of lens induction by the optic vesicle.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE AQUEOUS CHAMBERS}
- The anterior chamber of the eye develops from a cleftlike space that forms in the mesenchyme located between the developing lens and cornea.
- The mesenchyme superficial to this space forms the substantia propria of the cornea and the mesothelium of the anterior chamber.
- After the lens is established, it induces the surface ectoderm to develop into the epithelium of the cornea and conjunctiva.

- The posterior chamber of the eye develops from a space that forms in the mesenchyme posterior to the developing iris and anterior to the developing lens.
- When the pupillary membrane disappears and the pupil forms, the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye are able to communicate with each other through a circumferential scleral venous sinus.
- This vascular structure encircling the anterior chamber is the outflow site of aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye to the venous system.

\section*{CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA}
- Abnormal elevation of intraocular pressure in newborn infants usually results from abnormal development of the drainage mechanism of the aqueous humor during the fetal period.
- Intraocular tension rises because of an imbalance between the production of aqueous humor and its outflow.
- This imbalance may result from abnormal development of the scleral venous sinus.
- Congenital glaucoma is genetically heterogeneous, but the condition may result from a rubella infection during early pregnancy.

\section*{CONGENITAL CATARACTS}
- In this condition, the lens is opaque and frequently appears grayish white.
- Without treatment, blindness results.
- Many lens opacities are inherited, dominant transmission being more common than recessive or sex-linked transmission.
- Some congenital cataracts are caused by teratogenic agents, particularly the rubella virus, that affect early development of the lenses.
- The lenses are vulnerable to rubella virus between the fourth and seventh weeks, when primary lens fibers are forming.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-058.jpg?height=942&width=2093&top_left_y=438&top_left_x=207)
© Elsevier. Moore \& Persaud: The Developing Human 8e - www.studentconsult.com
- Physical agents, such as radiation, can also damage the lens and produce cataracts.
- Another cause of cataract is an enzymatic deficiency-congenital galactosemia.
- These cataracts are not present at birth, but may appear as early as the second week after birth.
- Because of the enzyme deficiency, large amounts of galactose from milk accumulate in the infant's blood and tissues, causing injury to the lens and resulting in cataract formation.
- Treatment of cataracts requires surgery, typically at a very early age (younger than 4 months), to remove the damaged lens.
- In most cases, corrective eyewear is required, although some studies have shown that artificial intraocular lenses may be safely implanted.
- More than 70\% of patients with bilateral congenital cataracts can attain reasonable visual acuity.
- Extended treatment with refractive correction and additional surgery may be required.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORNEA}
- The cornea is induced by the lens vesicle.
- The inductive influence results in transformation of the surface ectoderm into the transparent, multilayered avascular cornea, the part of the fibrous tunic of the eye that bulges out of the orbit.
- The cornea is formed from three sources:
- The external corneal epithelium, derived from surface ectoderm
- The mesenchyme, derived from mesoderm, which is continuous with the developing sclera
- Neural crest cells that migrate from the lip of the optic cup and differentiate into the corneal endothelium
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-062.jpg?height=1510&width=2116&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=192)

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHOROID AND SCLERA}
- The mesenchyme surrounding the optic cup (largely of neural crest origin) reacts to the inductive influence of the retinal pigment epithelium by differentiating into:
- an inner vascular layer, the choroid,
- an outer fibrous layer, the sclera.
- The sclera develops from a condensation of mesenchyme external to the choroid and is continuous with the stroma of the cornea.
- Toward the rim of the optic cup, the choroid becomes modified to form the cores of the ciliary processes, consisting chiefly of capillaries supported by delicate connective tissue.
- The first choroidal blood vessels appear during the 15th week; by the 23rd week, arteries and veins can be easily distinguished.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE EYELIDS}
- The eyelids develop during the sixth week from:
- neural crest cell mesenchyme
- two cutaneous folds of ectoderm that grow over the cornea.
- The eyelids adhere to one another by the beginning of the $10^{\text {th }}$ week and remain adherent until the 26th to the 28th week.
- While the eyelids are adherent, there is a closed conjunctival sac anterior to the cornea.
- As the eyelids open, the bulbar conjunctiva is reflected over the anterior part of the sclera and the surface epithelium of the cornea.
- The palpebral conjunctiva lines the inner surface of the eyelids.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-066.jpg?height=913&width=1401&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=511)

By the end of the embryonic period, eyelids begin to form.
- The eyelashes and glands in the eyelids are derived from the surface ectoderm in a manner similar to that described for other parts of the integument.
- The connective tissue and tarsal plates develop from mesenchyme in the developing eyelids.
- The orbicularis oculi muscle is derived from mesenchyme in the second pharyngeal arch and is supplied by its nerve (CN VII).

\section*{CONGENITAL PTOSIS OF THE EYELID}
- Drooping of the superior (upper) eyelids at birth is relatively common.
- Ptosis (blepharoptosis) may result from failure of normal development of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle.
- Congenital ptosis may more rarely result from prenatal injury or dystrophy of the superior division of the oculomotor nerve (CN III), which supplies this muscle.
- If ptosis is associated with inability to move the eyeball superiorly, there is also failure of the superior rectus muscle of the eyeball to develop normally.
- Congenital ptosis may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.
- Congenital ptosis is also associated with several syndromes.

\section*{Coloboma of the Eyelid}
- Large defects of the eyelid (palpebral colobomas) are uncommon.
- A coloboma is usually characterized by a small notch in the superior (upper) eyelid, but the defect may involve almost the entire lid.
- A coloboma of the inferior (lower) eyelid is rare.
- Palpebral colobomas appear to result from local developmental disturbances in the formation and growth of the eyelids.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-074.jpg?height=1739&width=1850&top_left_y=36&top_left_x=325)

\section*{Cryptophthalmos}
- Cryptophthalmos results from congenital absence of the eyelids; as a result, skin covers the eye.
- The eyeball is small and defective, and the cornea and conjunctiva usually do not develop.
- Fundamentally, the defect means absence of the palpebral fissure (slit) between eyelids; usually there is varying absence of eyelashes and eyebrows and other eye defects.
- Cryptophthalmos is an autosomal recessive condition that is usually part of the cryptophthalmos syndrome.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE LACRIMAL GLANDS}
- At the superolateral angles of the orbits, the lacrimal glands develop from a number of solid buds from the surface ectoderm.
- The buds branch and become canalized to form the nasolacrimal ducts.
- The lacrimal glands are small at birth and do not function fully until approximately 6 weeks; hence, the newborn infant does not produce tears when it cries.
- Tears are often not present with crying until 1 to 3 months.

\section*{CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE EYE}
- The type and severity of congenital eye anomalies depend on the embryonic stage during which development is disrupted.
- Several environmental teratogens cause congenital eye defects.
- Most common eye anomalies result from defects in closure of the retinal/choroid fissure.

\section*{CYCLOPIA}
- In this very rare anomaly, the eyes are partially or completely fused, forming a single median eye enclosed in a single orbit.
- There is usually a tubular nose (proboscis) superior to the eye.
- Cyclopia (single eye) and synophthalmia (fusion of eyes) represent a spectrum of ocular defects in which the eyes are partially or completely fused.
- These severe eye anomalies are associated with other craniocerebral defects that are incompatible with life.
- Cyclopia appears to result from severe suppression of midline cerebral structures-holoprosencephaly-that develop from the cranial part of the neural plate.
- Cyclopia is transmitted by recessive inheritance.

\section*{Microphthalmia}
- Congenital microphthalmia is a heterogeneous group of eye anomalies.
- The eye may be very small with other ocular defects or it may be a normal-appearing rudimentary eye.
- The affected side of the face is underdeveloped and the orbit is small.
- Microphthalmia may be associated with other congenital anomalies (e.g., a facial cleft) and be part of a syndrome (e.g., trisomy 13).
- Severe microphthalmia results from arrested development of the eye before or shortly after the optic vesicle has formed in the fourth week.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-082.jpg?height=1433&width=1951&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=283)
- The eye is essentially underdeveloped and the lens does not form.
- Development arrested in the $6{ }^{\text {th }}$ week - the eye is larger, but the microphthalmos is associated with gross ocular defects.
- Development is arrested in the $8^{\text {th }}$ week or during the early fetal period, simple microphthalmos results (small eye with minor ocular abnormalities).
- Some cases of microphthalmos are inherited: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked.
- Most cases of simple microphthalmia are caused by infectious agents (e.g., rubella virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and herpes simplex virus) that cross the placental membrane during the late embryonic and early fetal periods.

\section*{Anophthalmia}
- Congenital absence of the eye - a rare condition.
- The eyelids form, but no eyeball develops.
- This severe defect is usually accompanied by other severe craniocerebral anomalies.
- In primary anophthalmos, eye development is arrested early in the fourth week and results from failure of the optic vesicle formation.
- In secondary anophthalmos, development of the forebrain is suppressed and absence of the eye or eyes is one of several associated anomalies.

DEVELOPMENT OF EAR
}

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
- Understand development of the ear
- Understand ear related congenital malformation

\section*{Anatomic parts}
- External ear, consisting of the:
- auricle (pinnae),
- external acoustic meatus (passage),
- the external layer of the tympanic membrane (eardrum)
- Middle ear, consisting of:
- three small auditory ossicles (ear bones)
- the internal layer of the tympanic membranes
- Internal ear, consisting of:
- the vestibulocochlear organ

\section*{Development of Internal Ear}
- First part of the ears to develop.
- Early in the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, a thickening of surface ectoderm, the otic placode, appears on each side of the rhombencephalonmyelencephalon.
- Formation of otic placode is induced by signals from the paraxial mesoderm and notochord.
- Each otic placode soon invaginates forming otic pit and sinks deep to the surface ectoderm into the underlying mesenchyme.
- The edges of the pit soon come together and fuse to form an otic vesicle-the primordium of the membranous labyrinth.
- The otic vesicle loses its connection with the surface ectoderm.
- A diverticulum grows from the vesicle and elongates to form the endolymphatic duct and sac.
- The otic vesicles has two parts:
- Dorsal utricular parts, from which the small endolymphatic ducts, utricles, and semicircular ducts arise
- Ventral saccular parts, which give rise to the saccules and cochlear ducts
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-090.jpg?height=1261&width=2102&top_left_y=154&top_left_x=231)

- Three disc-like diverticula grow out from the utricular parts of the primordial membranous labyrinths.
- Soon the central parts of these diverticula fuse and disappear.
- The peripheral unfused parts of the diverticula become the semicircular ducts, which are attached to the utricle and are later enclosed in the semicircular canals of the bony labyrinth.
- Localized dilatations, the ampullae, develop at one end of each semicircular duct.
- Specialized receptor areas-cristae ampullaresdifferentiate in the ampullae and the utricle and saccule (maculae utriculi and sacculi).
- From the ventral saccular part of the otic vesicle, a tubular diverticulum-the cochlear duct-grows and coils to form the membranous cochlea.
- A connection of the cochlea with the saccule, the ductus reuniens, soon forms.
- The organ of Corti differentiates from cells in the wall of the cochlear duct.
- Ganglion cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) migrate along the coils of the membranous cochlea and form the spiral ganglion (of cochlea).
- Nerve processes extend from this ganglion to the spiral organ, where they terminate on the hair cells.
- The cells in the spiral ganglion retain their embryonic bipolar condition.
- Inductive influences from the otic vesicle stimulate the mesenchyme (mesoderm) around the otic vesicle to condense and differentiate into a cartilaginous otic capsule.
- With the enlargement of the membranous labyrinth, vacuoles appear in the cartilaginous otic capsule and soon coalesce to form the perilymphatic space.
- The membranous labyrinth is now suspended in perilymph (fluid in the perilymphatic space).
- The perilymphatic space, related to the cochlear duct, develops two divisions:
- scala tympani
- scala vestibuli.
- The cartilaginous otic capsule later ossifies (25 weeks) to form the bony labyrinth of the internal ear.
- The internal ear reaches its adult size and shape by the middle of the fetal period - 20-22 weeks.

\section*{Development of Middle Ear}
- Tubotympanic recess develops from the first pharyngeal pouch.
- The proximal part of the tubotympanic recess forms the pharyngotympanic tube (auditory tube).
- The distal part of the recess expands and becomes the tympanic cavity, which gradually envelops the small bones of the middle ear-auditory ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes), their tendons and ligaments, and the chorda tympani nerve.
- It has been suggested that, in addition to apoptosis in the middle ear, an epithelium-type organizer located at the tip of the tubotympanic recess probably plays a role in the early development of the middle ear and tympanic membrane.

C, Later stage, showing the tubotympanic recess (future tympanic cavity and mastoid antrum) beginning to envelop the ossicles. D, Final stage of ear development showing the relationship of the middle ear to the perilymphatic space and the external acoustic meatus. Note that the tympanic membrane develops from three germ layers: surface ectoderm, mesenchyme, and endoderm
- Expansion of the tympanic cavity gives rise to the mastoid antrum, located in the petromastoid part of the temporal bone.
- The mastoid antrum is almost adult size at birth; however, no mastoid cells are present in neonates.
- By 2 years of age, the mastoid cells are well developed and produce conical projections of the temporal bones, the mastoid processes.
- The middle ear continues to grow through puberty.
- The tensor tympani muscle, attached to the malleus, is derived from mesenchyme in the first pharyngeal arch and is innervated by trigeminal nerve (CN V), the nerve of this arch.
- The stapedius muscle is derived from the second pharyngeal arch and is supplied by facial nerve (CN VII), the nerve of this arch.
- The signaling molecules FGF-8, endothelin-1, and Tbx1 are involved in middle ear development.

\section*{Middle Ear bones}
- 1st and 2nd pharyngeal arch cartilage (mesoderm) --> ossicles
- 1st (Meckel's): epitypanum ossicles
- Head of malleus, body and short process of incus
- 2nd (Reichert's): mesotympanum ossicles
- Long process malleus, long process incus, stapes superstructure
- Stapes footplate: otic capsule

\section*{Development of External Ear}
- The external acoustic meatus, develops from the dorsal part of the first pharyngeal groove.
- The ectodermal cells at the bottom of this funnel-shaped tube proliferate to form a solid epithelial plate, the meatal plug.
- Degeneration of the central cells of this plug forms a cavity that becomes the internal part of the external acoustic meatus.
- The meatus, relatively short at birth, attains its adult length in approximately the $9{ }^{\text {th }}$ year.
- Tympanic membrane develops from three sources:
- Ectoderm of the first pharyngeal groove
- Endoderm of the tubotympanic recess, a derivative of the first pharyngeal pouch
- Mesenchyme of the first and second pharyngeal arches which forms collagen in the membrane

- The auricle (pinna), develops from mesenchymal proliferations in the first and second pharyngeal arches - auricular hillocks surrounding the first pharyngeal groove.
- The earlobule (earlobe) of the auricle is the last part of the auricle to develop.
- The auricles begin to develop at the base of the neck.
- As the mandible develops, the auricles assume their normal position at the side of the head.
- The parts of the auricle derived from:
- the first pharyngeal arch are supplied by its nerve, the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve;
- the parts derived from the second arch are supplied by cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus, especially the lesser occipital and greater auricular nerves.
- The nerve of the second pharyngeal arch, the facial nerve, has few cutaneous branches; some of its fibers contribute to the sensory innervation of the skin in the mastoid region and probably in small areas on both aspects of the auricle.

\section*{CONGENITAL DEAFNESS}
- Approximately 3 in every 1000 newborns have significant hearing loss, of which there are many subtypes.
- Most types of congenital deafness are caused by genetic factors.
- Mutations in the GJB2 gene are responsible for approximately $50 \%$ of nonsyndromic recessive hearing loss.
- Congenital deafness may be associated with several other head and neck defects as a part of the first arch syndrome.
- Abnormalities of the malleus and incus are often associated with this syndrome.
- A rubella infection during the $7^{\text {th }}$ and $8^{\text {th }}$ weeks, can cause defects of the spiral organ and deafness.
- Congenital fixation of the stapes results in conductive deafness in an otherwise normal ear.
- Failure of differentiation of the annular ligament, which attaches the base of the stapes to the oval window (fenestra vestibuli), results in fixation of the stapes to the bony labyrinth.

\section*{AURICULAR ABNORMALITIES}
- Severe defects of the external ear are rare, but minor deformities are common.
- There is a wide variation in the shape of the auricle.
- Almost any minor auricular defect may occasionally be found as a usual feature in a particular family.
- Minor defects of the auricles may serve as indicators of a specific pattern of congenital anomalies.
- For example, the auricles are often abnormal in shape and low-set in infants with chromosomal syndromes such as trisomy 18 and in infants affected by maternal ingestion of certain drugs (e.g., trimethadione).

Low-set slanted ear. This designation is made when the margin of the auricle or helix (arrow) meets the cranium at a level inferior to the horizontal plane through the corner of the eye.

\section*{Absence of the Auricle}
- Anotia (absence of the auricle) is rare but is commonly associated with the first pharyngeal arch syndrome.
- Anotia results from failure of mesenchymal proliferation.

\section*{Auricular Appendages}
- Auricular appendages (skin tags) are common and may result from the development of accessory auricular hillocks.
- The appendages usually appear anterior to the auricle, more often unilaterally than bilaterally.
- The appendages, often with narrow pedicles, consist of skin but may contain some cartilage.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-115.jpg?height=1098&width=1120&top_left_y=452&top_left_x=1264)

\section*{Microtia}
- Microtia (a small or rudimentary auricle) results from suppressed mesenchymal proliferation
- This defect often serves as an indicator of associated birth defects, such as an atresia of the external acoustic meatus (80\% of cases) and middle ear anomalies.
- The cause can be both genetic and environmental.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_fd42ce4c481fc4ad278dg-116.jpg?height=1207&width=928&top_left_y=433&top_left_x=1360)
- Preauricular Sinuses and Fistulas
- Pit-like cutaneous depressions or shallow sinuses are occasionally located in a triangular area anterior to the auricle.
- The sinuses are usually narrow tubes or shallow pits that have pinpoint external openings.
- Some sinuses contain a vestigial cartilaginous mass.
- Preauricular sinuses may be associated with internal anomalies, such as deafness and kidney malformations.
- The embryologic basis of auricular sinuses is uncertain but it may relate to incomplete fusion of the auricular hillocks or to abnormal mesenchymal proliferation and defective closure of the dorsal part of the first pharyngeal groove.
- Other auricular sinuses appear to represent ectodermal folds that are sequestered during formation of the auricle.
- Bilateral preauricular sinuses are typically familial.
- The majority of sinuses are asymptomatic and have only minor cosmetic importance; however, they can become infected.
- Auricular fistulas (narrow canals) connecting the preauricular skin with the tympanic cavity or the tonsillar fossa are extremely rare.

A child with an auricular fistula relating to the first pharyngeal arch. Note the external orifice of the fistula below the auricle and the upward direction of the catheter (in sinus tract) toward the external acoustic meatus.

\section*{Atresia of External Acoustic Meatus}
- Atresia (blockage) of this canal results from failure of the meatal plug to canalize .
- Usually the deep part of the meatus is open, but the superficial part is blocked by bone or fibrous tissue.
- Most cases are associated with the first arch syndrome.
- Often abnormal development of both the first and second pharyngeal arches is involved.
- The auricle is also severely affected and defects of the middle and/or internal ear are sometimes present.
- Atresia of the external acoustic meatus can occur bilaterally or unilaterally and usually results from autosomal dominant inheritance.
- Absence of External Acoustic Meatus
- Absence of the external acoustic meatus is rare; usually the auricle is normal.
- This defect results from failure of inward expansion of the first pharyngeal groove and failure of the meatal plug to disappear.
- Congenital Cholesteatoma
- This is a fragment of keratinized epithelial cells that is retained after birth.
- The "rest" appears as a white cyst-like structure medial to and behind the tympanic membrane.
- It may be that the rest consists of cells from the meatal plug that was displaced during its canalization.
- It has been suggested that congenital cholesteatoma may originate from an epidermoid formation that normally involutes by 33 weeks gestation.
- Choleseatomas can exhibit growth and invasion of neighboring bone.

- A pediatrician is asked to examine a young boy who has arrived from a country with poor access to medical care. The boy has low-set, misshapen ears, an underslung lower jaw, and a severe hearing deficit. The boy's teeth are also poorly aligned.
- What is the common denominator for this set of conditions?

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM I: FUCUS ON FOREGUT \& MIDGUT DEVELOPMENT}

\author{
DR. BEDA OLABU
}

\section*{Intended Learning Outcome:}
1. State the embryonic origin(s) of the gastrointestinal tract and its associated glands
2. Name the parts and state the derivatives of each part of the primordial gut
3. Outline the vascular territories of the GIT and state their embryological basis
4. Describe the development of the esophagus and stomach
5. Outline the stages of midgut development
6. Name and identify common congenital anomalies of foregut and midgut, and explain the embryological basis of each

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- The digestive system consists of the hollow GIT and the extrinsic glands
- Name the components of the hollow GIT in order
- Name the extrinsic glands of the digestive system
- The hollow GIT develops from the primordial gut, that forms during embryonic folding
- Extrinsic glands of the digestive system develop as diverticula from the developing gut, hence retain their connections with the GIT via their ducts

\section*{EMBRYONIC ORIGIN OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM}
- Viewed in the light of the alimentary canal (lumen), tissue components of the gut wall, and the glands (intrinsic and extrinsic)
- During embryonic folding, the dorsal part of the yolk sac is longitudinally incorporated into the embryo

\section*{Development of Reproductive System}

Sex differentiation depends on the testis determining factor (TDF) gene on Y chromosome. In the presence of this factor, male sex organs develop, in its absence female sex organs develop.

\section*{GONADS}

Gonads do not acquire male or female characteristics until week 7 of development.

\section*{Embryonic sources}

Three sources share in development of gonads:
1-Genital ridges of the intermediate cell mss of mesoderm (urogenital ridge).
2-Coelomic epithelium of the genital ridge.
3-Endoderm of the wall of the yolk sac.
On the $5^{\text {th }}$ week, genital ridges appear as a pair of longitudinal projections medial to the mesonephros. Primordial germ cells appear in the wall of the yolk sac and migrate by ameboid movements along the dorsal mesentery of the hindgut, arriving in the genital ridges at week 5-6. The primordial germ cells have an inductive influence on development of gonads. During the arrival of germ cells, the coelomic epithelium of the genital ridges proliferates and penetrates the underlying mesoderm forming primitive sex (gonadal) cords in both male and female embryos (fig.1). The indifferent gonads consist of an outer cortex and inner medulla. At this stage (week 7) it is impossible to differentiate between male and female gonads (fig.2).

\section*{TESTES}

If the embryo is genetically male, primordial germ cells carry XY sex chromosomes. Under the influence of Y chromosome whose genes encode testis determining factor (TDF), the primitive sex cords penetrate deep toward the hilum of the gonad to form medullary cords. These cords break up into a network which gives rise to the rete testis.

In the $12{ }^{\text {th }}$ week, other sex cords proliferate and lose contact with the surface epithelium. They become U-shaped and enclose germ cells. Their ends become continuous with rete testis through tubuli recti (fig.3). Testis cords are now composed of primitive germ cells and Sertoli cells. Interstitial cells of Leydig are derived from mesoderm of the genital ridge. They lie between testis cords and start secreting testosterone which reaches peak at 8-12 weeks. Testes now become able to influence sexual differentiation of the genital ducts and external genitalia.

Testis cords remain solid until puberty, when they acquire a lumen, thus forming the seminiferous tubules. Seminiferous tubules will join the rete testis and in turn the efferent tubules. These efferent ductules are remnants of the mesonephric tubules and they function as the link between the rete testis and the ductus deferens ( derivative of the mesonepohric or Wolffian duct).The genital ridge mesoderm forms a dense layer of fibrous connective tissue, tunica albuginea, around the testis. Tunica albuginea sends trabeculae to divide the testis into compartments.

\section*{Descent of the testes}

Early in development the testis was high in the abdomen and is attached together with the mesonephros by a urogenital mesentery to the posterior abdominal wall. With degeneration of the mesonephros the attachment serves as a mesentery for the testis-, mesorchium. Extending from the caudal pole of the testis is a mesodermal condensation known as gubernaculum which terminates in the scrotal swelling. As gubernaculum reaches the inguinal region it passes between the differentiating internal and external oblique muscles. Meanwhile, a peritoneal sac, processus vaginalis, forms an evagination which follws the course of the gubernaculum and lies in front of it toward the scrotum. Shortening of gubernaculum assisted by hormones (androgens and gonadotrophins) and differential growth of the posterior abdominal wall help descent of the testis. Shortening of gubernaculum pulls and guides the testis through the anterior abdominal wall into the inguinal canal to the scrotum (fig.4). The testes reach the deep inguinal ring by the $7^{\text {th }}$ month and superficial inguinal ring by the $8^{\text {th }}$ month of pregnancy. After birth and up to one year the narrow canal connecting the processus vaginalis with the peritoneal cavity is obliterated leaving vestigue of processus vaginalis. The testis is then covered by the two layers (parietal and visceral) of the tunica vaginalis. In addition the testis become ensheathed in layers derived from the anterior abdominal wall through which it passes. Fascia transversalis forms internal spermatic fascia, internal oblique forms cremasteric muscle and fascia, and external oblique forms external spermatic fascia.

\section*{Factors which help descent of the testes}

1-Hormones (androgens and gonadotrophins).
2-Shortening of gubernaculums.
3-Atrophy of the mesonephros allows caudal movements of the testis.
4-Atrophy of the paramesonephric ducts in male enables the testes to move trans abdominally to reach the inguinal canal.

5-Enlagement of the fetal pelvis.
6-Elongation of the trunk.
7-Increased abdominal pressure from growth of abdominal viscera.

Fig.4. Descent of the testis and formation of the inguinal canal.

\section*{Anomalies of the testes}

1-Inversion of the testis which may be polar or anterior.
2- Ectopic testis is maldescended testis due to abnormal path guided by abnormal band of gubernaculum. It may be in the anterior abdominal wall, femoral triangle, perineum or at root of penis (fig.5).

3- Cryptorchism is failure of descent of one or the two testes. During the $1^{\text {st }}$ postnatal year most of the undescended testes descend into the scrotum. Cryptorchism is the commonest anomaly in the neonate that occurs in about $30 \%$ of premature male babies and in $3 \%$ of full term male babies. It is due to abnormal androgen production. The testis remains in the abdomen, pelvis, inguinal canal or is retractile (fig.6). An undescended testis is unable to produce mature sperms because of the higher temperature in the abdominal cavity. It is advised to surgically correct the anomaly before 18 months to avoid later infertility and possibility of tumor formation.

4- Congenital hydrocele (fig.7.A \& B) is due to irregular obliteration of the passageway between the peritoneum and the processus vaginalis leaving a small cyst along its course. These cysts may secrete fluid resulting in hydrocele of the testis or spermatic cord.

5- Congenital inguinal hernia (fig. 7 C ) is descent of a loop of intestine into the scrotum due to failure of obliteration of the connection between the peritoneal cavity and the processus vaginalis.

\section*{OVARY}

In female embryo with an XX genotype and an absence of Y, primitive sex cords dissociate into clusters of cells which contain primitive germ cells. These clusters are located in the medulla forming rudimentary rete ovari and later disappear replaced by vascular stroma or ovarian medulla. Coelomic epithelium proliferates and by week 7 gives a second generation of sex cords named cortical cords which penetrate the underlying mesoderm but remain close to the surface. These cords form isolated cell clusters surrounding primitive germ cells, Primitive germ cells develop into oogonia and the cell clusters around it form follicular cells. By this the primordial ovarian follicles form. By week 16, as the ovary separates from the regressing mesonephros it will be suspended by a mesentrery- the mesovarium.

\section*{Descent of the ovary}

As the ovary develops in the middle part of the genital ridge, the cranial genital ligament forms the suspensory ligament of the ovary while the caudal genital ligament forms gubernaculum ovari. Gubernaculum ovari travels the inguinal canal toward the genital swelling (labia majora) followed by small processus vaginalis. At that time the uterus is developing and attaches to the gubernaculums (fig.8). This attachment prevents further traction on the ovary, so the ovary does not reach the inguinal canal. The part of gubernaculums between the ovary and uterus forms ovarian ligament and the part between the uterus and labia majora forms the round ligament of the uterus.

\section*{Anomalies of the ovary}

1-Ovarian dysgenesis as in Turner syndrome.
2-Imperfect descent of the ovary.
3-Peristence of the processus vaginalis (hydrocele of the canal of Nuck).

Fig.8.Formation of the ovary and its relation to the developing uterus.

\section*{GENITAL DUCTS}

Development of the genital ducts and external genitalia occurs under the influence of hormones.

In male, Sertoli cells of the fetal testis produce mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) that causes regression of the paramesonephric ducts. The testes produce androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestesterone) that mediates virilization of the mesonephric ducts (vas deferens and epididymis) and modulate differentiation of male external genitalia (growth of penis, scrotum and prostate).
In female, absence of anti-mullerian hormone stimulates the paramesonephric ducts to develop into uterine tubes and uterus. In absence of male androgens, estrogen produced by the placenta and fetal ovaries stimulates differentiation of external genitalia into labia majora, labia minora , clitoris and vagina.

\section*{Development of uterine tubes, uterus and vagina}

Paramesonephric (Mullerian) ducts appear as a pair of longitudinal invaginations of coelomic epithelium anterolateral to the mesonephric ducts (fig.9). Edges of these grooves approach each other and fuse to form mullerian ducts. Cranially the ducts open into the coelomic cavity. The ducts run lateral to the mesonephric ducts but further caudally at the level of the pelvis they cross in front of the mesonephric ducts and genital ducts to become medial to them. Three parts can be recognized in each paramesonephric duct:
a)Cranial vertical portion that opens in the coelomic cavity.
b)Horizontal part that crosses the mesonephric duct.
c)Caudal vertical part that fuses with its partner from the opposite side to form the uterus. The caudal fused tip of the fused ducts is called mullerian tubercle that projects into the posterior wall of the urogenital sinus producing an elevation,- the sinus tubelcle.

With descent of the ovaries the caudal and horizontal parts of the mullerian duct form the uterine tube in both sides. The caudal vertical parts of the two sides fuse to form the uterus and the cervix, and the septum inside disappears. The surrounding mesenchyme gives the muscle and peritoneal covering of the uterus (myometrium and perimetrium). As the horizontal parts of the mullerian ducts move mediocaudally, a broad transverse fold, -broad ligament, is established. The broad ligament invests the uterus and uterine tubes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_19ea864e720f4aaa3156g-11.jpg?height=1872&width=1443&top_left_y=422&top_left_x=384)

Fig.9. Development of the uterine tubes, uterus and vagina

\section*{Development of vagina}

Shortly after the mullerian tubercle has reached the urogenital sinus, two solid outgrowths arise from the pelvic part of the UG sinus called sinovaginal bulbs. These bulbs fuse to form a solid vaginal plate. By the $5^{\text {th }}$ month the vagin is canalized. The wing expansions of the vagina, -vaginal fornices, are of paramesonephric origin. Thus the vagina has a dual embryonic origin, with the upper portion derived from the uterine canal and the lower portion from the urogenital sinus. The lumen of the vagina remains separated from that of the UG sinus by a thin plate known as the hymen. The hymen consists of epithelial lining of the UG sinus and a thin layer of vaginal cells. It develops a small central opening during the perinatal life.
Urethral and paraurethral glands appear as outgrowths from the urethra. Greater vestibular glands form from as outgrowths from the UG sinus.

\section*{Paramesonephric ducts in male}

Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) produced by Sertoli cells causes regtression of paramesonephric ducts in male leaving;
a)Appendix of the testis.
b)Prostatic utricle.

\section*{Development of seminal vesicles and prostate}

Seminal vesicles appear as outgrowths from the caudal end of the mesonephric ducts. The part of the mesonephric duct between duct of the seminal vesicle and urethra becomes the ejaculatory duct.
Prostate appears as multiple outgrowths of the urethra that grow into surrounding mesenchyme. Prostatic glands are developed from endothelial outgrowths and the surrounding mesoderm forms capsule, stroma and smooth muscles.

\section*{Anomalies of paramesonephric ducts in female}

\section*{Anomalies of uterine tubes}

Anomalies of uterine tubes are rare
1-Accessory opening.
2-Duplication.
3-Absence.
4-Atresia.

\section*{Anomalies of the uterus (fig.10)}

1-Agenesis of the uterus; failure of development of mullerian ducts.
2-Rudimentery uterus is a solid mass without a lumen.
3-Infantile uterus is a very small uterus.
The first three anomalies present with primary amenorrhea.
4-Corneate uterus is due to failure of development of one paramesonephric duct. Corneate uterus with rudimentary horn may be presented in some cases.

5-Septate uterus is non-disappearance of the septum between the fused ducts. The septum persists for variable extent.

In females with corneate or septate uterus pregnancy is possible but there is increased incidence of preterm delivary or recurrent abortions.

6-Failure of fusion of the mullerian ducts:
a)Uterus didelphys is a rare anomaly presented with duplication of uterus, cervix and vagina due to complete failure of fusion of the mullerian ducts.
b)Uterus bicornis unicollis is two uterine bodies and one cervix.
c)Uterus bicornis bicollis is two uterine bodies and two cervices.
d)Arcuate uterus is minor degree of imperfect fusion of mullerian ducts.

Fig.11. Anomalies of the vagina.

\section*{Development of external genitalia (fig.12)}

\section*{Indifferent stage}

In the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week mesenchymal cells of the primitive streak migrate around the cloacal membrane to form a pair of elevated folds, the cloacal folds. Cranial to the cloacal membrane the folds fuse to form the genital tubercle.
During the $6^{\text {th }}$ week, cloacal folds are subdivided into urethral (genital) folds anteriorly and anal folds posteriorly. In the mean time another pair of elevations, genital swellings, became visible on each side of the genital folds. By the end of the $6^{\text {th }}$ week with appearance of genital tubercle, genital folds and genital swellings it is impossible to distinguish between male and female embryos. Distinguishing sexes appear during the $9{ }^{\text {th }}$ week but external genitalia are not fully differentiated until the $12{ }^{\text {th }}$ week.

\section*{Male external genitalia}

Development of male external genitalia is under the influence androgens secreted by the fetal testes and is characterized by rapid elongation of the genital tubercle to form phallus. Enlagement of phallus forms the penis and mesenchyme in it develops into the corpora. Phallus pulls urethral (genital) folds forward to form the lateral walls of the urethral groove, the floor of which is the urogenital membrane. Epithelial lining of the groove is endodermal and forms the urethral plate. The two urethral folds close over the urethral plate thus forming the penile urethra. Ectdermal cells from the tip of phallus (glans) penetrate inward to form short epithelial cord. This cord later canalizes to for the external urethral meatus which fuses with the canalized penile urethra. The genital swellings move caudally and fuse to form the scrotum with a septum, scrotal septum, inside. A circular ingrowth of ectoderm at periphery of glans forms the prepuce.

\section*{Female external genitalia}

Estrogen plays an important role in development of female external genitalia. The genital tubercle elongates slightly to form the clitoris. Urethral folds do not fuse except posteriorly where they form frenulum of labia minora, and will form labia minora. Genital swellings fuse only cranially to form mons pubis and posteriorly to form labial commissure The rest of most of the genital swellings remain separate to form labia majora. The urogenital groove forms vestibule of the vagina.

\section*{Congenital abnormalities of the external genitalia}

1-Agenesis of external genitalia is absence of penis or clitoris is very rare. It is due to failure of genital tubercle to develop.

2-Bifid penis and double penis is very rare, usually with ectopia vesica.
3-Micropenis is common with hypopituitarism.
4-Hypospadias.
5-Ep[ispadias.
6-Ambiguous genitalia (intersex, hermaphrodite) is a syndrome in which individuals have characteristics of both sexes.
i-True hermaphrodite (ovitesticular syndrome) is very rare. Individuals have both testes and overies and both are non functioning..
ii-Psudohermaphrodite is a syndrome in which the genotypic sex is masked by phenotypic appearance of the other sex. Male psudohermaphroditism is when the individual has testes while the external genitalia look like those of female. Female psudohermaphroditism is when the individual has ovaries and the external genitalia look like male.

\section*{a)Female psudohermaphroditism}

Individuals are 46,XX and are mainly due to exposure of females to excessive androgens. A common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Administration of androgens or progesterone compounds during pregnancy may cause this syndrome. Adrenogenital syndrome is biochemical absence of hydroxylase enzyme which causes deficiency of hydrocortisone. In turn, there is increase in ACTH which causes hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex and overproduction of adrenal androgens. In female there will be enlarged clitoris and fused labia which look like male external genitalia (fig.13). Uterus, vagina and ovaries are usually present.
In male it causes precocious puberty.
b)Male psudohermaphroditism may result from inadequate production of androgens.

Individual genotype is 46, XY. In the Testicular feminization syndrome (Androgen insensitivity syndrome) individuals are $46, \mathrm{XY}$ but tissues of external genitalia are unresponsive to androgens and develop as females under the influence of estrogens. Since the individual is male and have MIS which suppresses Mullerian ducts, uterus and uterine tubes are absent. The vagina is short and ends blindly. Testes are usually in the inguinal canals with no signs of spermatogenesis (fig.14).

INTRODUCTION TO EMBRYOLOGY \\ Definitions \\ Terminology \\ Developmental Period \\ Significance and Scope of Embryology \\ Review Questions
}

\section*{DEFINITIONS}

Embryology is the study of embryos (G.embryon=is the early developing human). It refers to the prenatal development of embryos and fetuses.

Developmental anatomy is concerned with the changes that cells, tissues, organs and the body as a whole undergo from germ cells to the adult.
Teratology (teratos=monester) is the division of embryology that deals with birth defects..

\section*{TERMINOLOGY}

Oocyte (ovum, egg) is the female germ or sex cell produced in the ovaries. Sperm (seed), Spermatozoon (zoon=animal) is the male germ cell produced in the testes. Zygote (union) is the cell which results from union of a sperm and an ovum during. Cleavage is the series of mitotic divisions of the zygote that results in formation of early embryonic cells or blastomeres.
Morula (L.mulberry) is a solid 12-32 blastomeres in the form of compact ball of cells that occurs 3 to 4 days after fertilization just as the early embryo enters the uterus.
Blastocyst (G.blastos=germ, kystis=bladder) is a morula with fluid filled cavity, happens when it arrives into the uterine cavity.
Implantation is attachment of the blastocyst to the endometrium of the uterus. It begins by the end week 1 and is completed by the end of week 2 after fertilization.
Gastrula (G.gaster=stomach) gastrulation is the transformation of the blastocyst into a trilaminar embryonic disc (gastrula) by week 3. The 3 germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) subsequently differentiate into tissues and organs of the embryo.
Neurula (G.neuron=nerve): neurulation is start development of the neural tube by week 34. The embryo is called neurula.

Primordium (L.primus=first, ordior=to begin): the beginning or first indicator of an organ,e.g.primordium of the upper limb appears as a bud on day 26.
Conceptus (L.conceptio=derivative of a zygote) is embryo and its associated membranes. Fetus (L.unborn offspring).
Trimester is a period of three months during pregnancy. The critical stages of development occur during the first trimester.
Congenital anomalies (congenitus=born with) are abnormalities of development that present at birth.
Abortion (L.aboriri=to miscarry) is premature stoppage of development and expulsion of the conceptus from the uterus, before it is capable of living outside. An abortus is the products of an abortion (embryo and its membranes).

\section*{Developmental periods}

\section*{1-Prenatal period:}
a) Embryonic period: from fertilization to the end of the $8^{\text {th }}$ week.
b) Fetal period: from the end of the $8^{\text {th }}$ week to birth.

\section*{2-Postnatal period:}
a) Newborn or neonate: period of the first four weeks (first month) of postnatal life.
b) Infancy: first year of postnatal development. The body as a whole grows rapidly during the first year; total length increases by one-half and weight is trebled.
3-Childhood: from end of firs year to puberty.
4-Puberty: 12-15 years in girls and 13-16 years in boys. Development of primary and secondary sex characters is apparent.
In females it presents with menstrual cycle, and in males by production of mature spermatozoa.
5-Adolescence: from puberty to 18 years, characterized by rapid physical, mental, emotional and sexual maturation.
6-Adulthood: (adultus=grown up) from 18-25 years with full growth and maturity. The ossification centers complete and fuse.

\section*{SIGNIFICANCE AND SCOPE OF EMBRYOLOGY}

1-Knowledge of embryology help understand:
a) How human life begins.
b) The changes which occur in the prenatal period.
c) How genetic information inherited in the fertilized ovum is expressed and how does it control and monitor the developmental process.
d) The mechanisms underlying the normal and abnormal development.
e) The anatomical facts based on the embryological changes.
f) Variations in human structure.

2-Scope of embryology helps bridge the gap between prenatal, perinatal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics, clinical anatomy and genetics.
3-Knowledge of development of structure and function is essential for helping fetuses and babies under stress. Early diagnosis and intervention is now possible to correct congenital anomalies even during the prenatal period.
4-Techniques based on embryological information carry outstanding prospective in areas of in-vitro fertilization, stem cell research, cloning, molecular biology and genetic engineering.
5-Preventive measures are now considered to prevent congenital anomalies, e.g. genetic counseling.

\section*{Spermatogenesis}

Definition: Spermatogenesis is the sequence of events by which spermatogonia are transformed into spermatozoa.
Site: in the seminiferous tubules of the testes.
Duration: 64 days.
Steps:
Spermatocytogenesis
-In male, differentiation of primordial germ cells begins at puberty. Shortly before puberty, the sex cords acquire a lumen and become seminiferous tubules. At the same time primordial germ cells give rise to spermatogonia.
-Spermatogonia are the basal cells; they are of two types; A cell and B cell. A cells are stem cells that undergo mitosis to provide a continuous reserve of stem cells and a more differentiated B cells. B cells divide by mitosis into 2 primary spermatocytes.
-Primary spermatocytes are large cells that migrate toward the middle zone of the seminiferous tubules and then undergo a prolonged prophase ( 22 days) followed by rapid completion of the first meiotic division (meiosis I) to form two smaller secondary spermatocytes, with half number of chromosomes ( 23 X or Y).
-Secondary spermatocytes soon divide by mitosis (second meiotic division, meiosis II) to form two smaller cells, spermatids.
-Spermatids become embedded in deep recesses of Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells provide support,protection and nutrition for germ cells.
-Spermiogenesis: is the series of changes resulting in transformation of spermatids into spermatozoa. This process include:
-The nucleus of the spermatid condenses to form head of sperm.
-Golgi apparatus coalesces to form acrosomal cap over the surface of the head of sperm. Acrosome contains enzymes that assist penetration of the ovum.
-Centrioles move to the side of the nucleus opposite acrosomal cap. One of the centioles gives rise to an axial filament that grows out and penetrates the cell surface.
-Mitochondria migrate toward the axial filament and become arranged end-to-end around it in the form of a sheath. At the distal end of the mitochondrial sheath is a ring-like structure, the terminal ring. The sheath and the ring lie in the middle piece (body) of the spermatozoon.
-The rest of the cytoplasm is cast off from the developing spermatozoon.
-Mature spermatozoon is 60 micron long and formed of head, neck, middle piece and tail. When fully formed spermatozoa enter the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, from there they are pushed toward the epididymis by contractile elements in the wall of the tubules. Although initially only slightly motile,spermatozoa obtain full motility in the epididymis.

\section*{Notes}
-Each spermatogonium gives rise to 8 spermatozoa. Each spermatozoon contains haploid number of chromosomes ( 23 X or Y ).
-Not all seminiferous tubules are actively producing sperms at the same time. Moreover, areas of the germinal epithelium in a single tubule may be active while other areas are temporarily dormant.
-About 20 days are required for spermatozoa to traverse the 6 meter coiled duct of epididymis. Sperms are nourished by secretions of the lining epithelium of the epididymis, and there they become motile and attain full physiological state which they retain for limited period. If ejaculation does not occur, sperms degenerate.
-The seminal fluid (semen) is the spermatozoa and the secretions of the accessory sex glands. Spermatozoa account for less than $10 \%$ of the seminal fluid. The remainder of the ejaculate consists of secretions of the seminal vesicles (60-80\%), prostate (20\%) and bulbourethral glands ( $10 \%$ ).
-Volume of the ejaculate is $3-5 \mathrm{ml}$. It has characteristic odor and is alkaline in reaction. It is rich in fructose, the source of energy of the motile sperms. Sperms perform undulating movements which propel them forward and rotate sperms around their longitudinal axes. The speed of the sperms is $2-3 \mathrm{~mm} /$ minute. Normal sperms move rapidly and progress in a straight line. Speed of sperms varies with the ph of the environment, they move slower in the acid environment of the vagina but faster in the alkaline environment of the uterus. Immotile and abnormal forms of sperms usually are less than $25 \%$ of the total number.
-Number of sperms is 100 million $/ \mathrm{ml}$, i.e. $500,000,000$ (half billion) /ejaculate.
-For potential fertility at least $40 \%$ of sperms should be motile 2 hours after ejaculation and some still show motility after 24 hours.
-Factors which inhibit spermatogenesis are: heat, ageing, virus infection (mumps), exposure to irradiation, certain drugs, and malnutrition.
-FSH secreted by anterior pituitary activates spermatogenesis.

\section*{Transport of Sperms}

\section*{In male genital ducts}
- Sperms detach from Sertoli cells and lie free in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. Sperms are passively pushed in groups into efferent tubules and duct of epididymis. This is assisted by contractions of smooth muscles in the wall of these ducts. The activity of the ciliated epithelium and fluid absorption create a fluid flow that sweeps spermatozoa toward the epididymis. Efferent ductuli, epididymis and first part of the ductus deferens are the storehouse for sperms. Passage of sperms through tubuli recti and rete testis must be rapid, for sperms are rarely seen in these ducts which show no evidence of secretion. In efferent ductules and epididymis secretions are abundant.
- Friction of glans penis reinforced by psychological factors result in reflex sympathetic impulses to smooth muscles of epididymes, vasa deferentia, seminal vesicles and prostate. Sperms are rapidly transported to the urethra by peristaltic contractions of the thick muscular coat of the vasa deferentia. Sperms together with secretions of the seminal vesicles and prostate are discharged into the prostatic urethra. The fluid is joined by secretions of the
bulbourethral glands and penile urethral glands and ejected from penile urethra assisted by rhythmic contractions of bulbospongiosus muscles which compress the urethra. Meanwhile, the sphincter of the urinary bladder (internal urethral involuntary sphincter) contracts to prevent reflux of seminal fluid into the urinary bladder.

\section*{In female genital ducts}
- Upon arrival, the acidity of the vagina inhibits motility of sperms.
- Path of sperms is against the fluid current set by movements of the cilia of mucus lining of the uterus and uterine tubes. Sperms pass slowly through the cervical canal by movements of their tails. Enzyme vesiculase secreted by the seminal vesicles coagulates the seminal fluid and forms a vaginal plug that prevents backflow of semen into the vagina. During ovulation, cervical mucus increases in amount and becomes less viscid making it more favorable for sperms to move. Fibrinolysin enzyme secreted by prostate liquefies semen to allow spermatozoa free themselves from viscous ejaculate and travel throught the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tube.
- During sexual intercourse, contractions of smooth muscles in the wall of the uterus and uterine tubes assist movements of sperms toward the fertilization site. Prostaglandins in semen stimulate uterine motility.
- Sperms require 5-45 minutes to reach the lateral ends of the uterine tubes. Out of the half billion sperms in the ejaculate only 200-300 reach the fertilization site. Most of sperms degenerate and are absorbed in the female genital tract.
- Fertility ability of sperms is one-two days. After being frozen to low temperature, seminal fluid may be kept for many years and can be reused.

\section*{Abnormal Sperms and Abnormal Semen}
$10-20 \%$ of marriages are sterile, one-third of these the male is the responsible one.
Causes of male infertility:
1- Genetic disorder, e.g. Klinfelter syndrome.
2- Hormonal disturbances, e.g. hypopituitarism.
3- Inflammatory diseases; mumps, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, prostatitis, urethritis.
4- Congenital malformations of male genitalia, e.g. undescended testes, epispadias, hypospadias, and testicular feminization syndrome.
5- Obstruction of seminal ducts.
6- Impotence or premature ejaculation, e.g. psychological factors.
7- Presence of sperm immobilizing antibody.
8- After prostatectomy.
9- Other causes; aging, obesity, diabetes, varicocle, chronic nephritis.

\section*{Abnormal seminal fluid analysis may show:}

Aspermia: failure of formation or emission of sperms.
Azospermia: absence of spermatozoa in semen.
Oligospermia: deficiency in sperm number (less than 20 million $/ \mathrm{ml}$ ).
Necrospermia: sperms are dead or immotile.
Reduced motility of sperms as in varicocele.
Excessive number of abnormal forms: giant or dwarf sperms, bifid head or tail, tapering head, too small or too large head and joined sperms.Abnormal sperms tend to move in circles or in irregular pattern.

\section*{OOGENESIS}

Definition: Oogenesis is the sequence of events by which oogonia are transformed into mature oocytes.
Site: Ovaries.
Duration: Varies from 12 up to 45 years.
Steps:

\section*{1-Prenatal Maturation}
-Early in embryonic life primordial germ cells, arrived at the ovary from the wall of the yolk sac, differentiate into oogonia. By the 3rd month of gestation, oogonia undergo mitosis to give nests of oogonia. Oogonia in one cluster are derived from a single primordial germ cell and are surrounded by a layer of flat epithelial cells, known as follicular cells, originating from surface epithelium covering the ovary.
-Some oogonia differentiate into larger primary oocytes. By the fifth prenatal month, the total number of germ cells in the ovary reaches its maximum, 7 million.
-Immediately after their formation primary oocytes replicate their DNA and enter prophase of the first meiotic division.
-Cell death begins and many oogonia and primary oocytes degenerate.
-By the 7th month the majority of oogonia have degenerated except few near the surface of the ovary. All surviving primary oocytes, however, have entered the first meiotic division, and most of them are individually surrounded by a layer of flat epithelial cells. A primary oocyte together with its surrounding flat epithelial cells is known as primordial follicle. The total number of oocytes at birth is about 1 million.
2-Postnatal Maturation
-Near the time of birth, all primary oocytes have started prophase of the first meiotic division, but instead of proceeding into metaphase they enter the diplotene stage, a resting stage during prophase. Arrested prophase is due to maturation inhibition factor (MIF) secreted by follicular cells.
-No further primary oocytes form after birth.
-From birth to puberty $90 \%$ of primordial follicles containing degenerate. By time of puberty there are only about 40,000 primordial follicles in each ovary. Only about 400 primary oocytes become secondary oocytes that are expelled at ovulations. Ovulation is necessary for the first meiotic division to be completed. LH surge prior to ovulation induces resumption of the first meiotic division.
-The prophase of the first meiotic division extends from prenatal life until ovulation, and thus may last as long as 13 up to 45 years in the fertile life of female.
-During ovulation primary oocyte undergoes first meiosis to give rise to secondary oocyte and a small first polar body, each with haploid number of chromosomes. The first polar body is a small fragment of the ovum and is located between zona pellucida and cell membrane of the primary oocyte, and usually degenerates.
-At completion of the first meiosis, the secondary oocyte enters the second meiotic division (meiosis II) without DNA replication. The second meiotic division is only completed if the secondary oocyte is fertilized. Secondary oocyte will give rise to mature ovum (ootid) and a second polar body, each with haploid number of chromosomes. The second polar body, also a small non- functional cell, soon degenerates and is extruded.
-Each primary oocyte gives rise to one ova.

\section*{CHAPTER 3}

\section*{FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE CYCLES}

At puberty, the female begins to undergo regular monthly cycles known as reproductive or sexual cycles. These cycles are controlled by the hypothalamus. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) produced by the hypothalamus acts on cells of the anterior pituitary gland which in turn secrete gonadotropins; follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and lutinizing hormone (LH). FSH and LH stimulate and control cyclic changes of the ovary (ovarian cycle). FSH and LH stimulate the ovary (follicular cells and cells of the corpus luteum) to secrete estrogen and progesterone hormones. Changes in estrogen and progesterone levels cause cyclic changes in the uterus (menstrual cycle). Estrogens cause uterine endometrium to enter the proliferative phase and stimulate the pituitary to secrete LH. LH surge is needed for final stages of follicle maturation and to induce ovulation. The ovarian and menstrual cycles begin at puberty; continue on monthly basis throughout the fertile life of female and cease after menopause. Fertile life of female extends from 13 up to 48 years. Menarche is the first menstrual cycle. Cessation of the ovarian and menstrual cycles occur during the 9 months of pregnancy and is resumed 6 to 10 weeks after termination of pregnancy, if the woman is not breast feeding her baby.

\section*{OVARIAN CYCLE}

Definition: The ovarian cycle is the monthly changes which occur in the ovary of a fertile female.

\section*{Phases}

\section*{1) FOLLICULAR PHASE}

With each ovarian cycle and under the influence of FSH a number of ovarian follicles (5-15 follicles) begin to grow, but usually only one reaches full maturity, the others degenerate and become atretic. Atretic follicles are replaced by connective tissue forming corpus atreticum. 5-15 primordial follicles begin to grow and the follicular cells become cuboidal. At this stage the follicles are called primary follicles. The follicular cells which are derived from surface epithelium covering the ovary, divide actively to form many layers of cells around the ovum. A hyaline amorphous glycoprotein shell called zona pellucida is interposed between the oocyte and the follicular cells. Zona pellucida is formed by the primary oocyte and the follicular cells. In the immediate vicinity of the follicle, ovarian cortical stroma cells form a capsule around the follicle named theca. Theca is of two layers; theca interna is vascular and contains secretory cells, theca externa is formed of connective tissue and fibroblast like cells. Theca cells produce angiogenesis factor that promotes growth of blood vessels in theca interna which provides nutritive support for follicular development. As one follicle enlarges, it sinks in the medulla of the ovary leaving more primitive follicles in the cortex of the ovary. Follicular (granulosa) cells secrete
fluid rich in glycoprotein in between the cells. Fluid spaces fuse in small lakes and eventually into one single cavity called the antrum. Fluid in the antrum is called liquor folliculi, and the entire follicle is called secondary follicle. Follicular and theca cells increase in number. The follicle becomes so large ( 15 mm ) that it occupies most of the width of the ovary. It forms avascular spot, stigma, on the surface of the ovary. The follicle is now termed tertiary or mature (Graffian) follicle. Growth of the antrum pushes the ovum to one side of the follicle where it rests on a mound of granulosa cells called cumulus oophorus. The ovum is closely surrounded by columnar cells of the cumulus oophorus named corona radiata.

\section*{2) OVULATION}

Definition: Ovulation is rupture of the mature Graffian follicle and liberation of the oocyte into the peritoneal cavity.
Mechanism: The preovulatory follicle continues to grow until it occupies the entire cortical thickness and bulges from the surface of the ovary. LH surge appears to cause the stigma to balloon out forming a vesicle. Prior to ovulation, the oocyte and some cells of the cumulus oophorus detach from the interior of the distended follicle. The follicle ruptures through the wall of the ovary, expelling the secondary oocyte with corona radiata and viscous liquor folliculi. Expulsion of the oocyte is the result of the increased intrafollicular pressure and possibly contraction of the smooth muscles in the theca externa stimulated by prostaglandins. Enzymatic digestion of the follicular wall is one of the principal mechanisms leading to ovulation. Ovulation is triggered by LH surge elicited by high estrogen level in the blood. Ovulation usually follows LH peak by 12-24 hours. LH surge seems to induce resumption of the first meiotic division of the primary oocyte.
Timing: Ovulation occurs around the midcycle; day 14 of a 28 days menstrual cycle.
Symptoms: Ovulation is accompanied by variable amount of lower abdominal pain known as middle pain or mittleschmerz. Basal body temperature shows slight drop immediately before ovulation (ovulation is about to occur) followed by a sustained rise one or two days after ovulation.

\section*{Oocyte transport}

Shortly before ovulation, fimbriae of the fallopian tube cover the surface of the ovary and the oviduct contracts rhythmically. Once the secondary oocyte lies free in the peritoneal cavity it is sucked into the infundibulum of the tube assisted by
a- The fimbriae move back and forth over the surface of the ovary sweeping the ovum into the infundibulum.
b- Beating of cilia of mucosal cells of the fimbriae creates a current of peritoneal fluid towards the tube.
c- The oocyte passes into the ampulla mainly as a result of peristalsis movements of the wall of the fallopian tube characterized by alternate contraction and relaxation toward the uterus.
d- Fluids secreted inside the tube nourish the oocyte and help it to move.
Once in the fallopian tube the corona radiata cells lose contact with the oocyte by withdrawing their cytoplasmic processes from zona pellucida.
Ovum vitality: The ovum remains fertilizable for 12 hours after ovulation. In human the fertilized oocyte reaches the uterine cavity 3-4 days after fertilization. The ovum is a large cell, 140 micron in diameter.

\section*{Clinical Notes}
- Ovulation occurs periodically in most animals, but in some animals, e.g. rats, it occurs at time of sexual excitement or estrus.
- Mammals show variations in timing of ovulation from few days to once yearly.
- In human, ovulation occurs every 4 weeks, usually on the $14{ }^{\text {th }}$ day of a 28 days menstrual cycle. However variations in the timing of ovulation do occur and range from the $8^{\text {th }}$ to the $20^{\text {th }}$ day of the menstrual cycle.
- Ovulation occurs from one ovary at a time. Which ovary ovulates each period is determined randomly. In rare cases the two ovaries may ovulate concomitantly or few days apart. If one ovary is removed, the remaining ovary releases an egg every month.
- There are some menstrual cycles that occur without ovulation. These cycles are termed anovulatory cycles. Consequently the endometrium remains in the proliferative phase until next menstruation begins.

\section*{Causes of anovulatory cycles:}

1- Normally in $10 \%$ of cycles and the mechanism is not clear.
2- During lactation.
3- Girls in their first few cycles.
4- Last cycles before menopause.
5- Use of contraceptive pills (combination of estrogen and progesterone). Hormones in these pills act on the hypothalamus and pituitary glands to inhibit secretion of GnRH, FSH and LH that are essential for ovulation.
6- Ovarian hypofunction.
7- Diminished concentration of gonadotropin hormones.
- Ovulation can be induced by administration of gonadotropins or an ovulatory agent such as clomiphene citrate. These drugs stimulate release of FSH and LH from the pituitary gland resulting in maturation of several ovarian follicles and increased possibility of multiple ovulations. Incidence of multiple pregnancies increases by 10 times when ovulations are induced by these drugs.

\section*{3) LUTEAL PHASE}

Following ovulation the walls of the ovarian follicle and theca folliculi collapse and are thrown into folds. The ruptured follicle undergoes a process of lutinization to form a hormone-producing body termed corpus luteum. Under the influence of LH granulosa and theca cells become polyhedral, vascularized by entry of surrounding vessels and develop cytoplasmic yellowish pigments. They are called lutin cells. Granulosa lutin cells secrete progesterone and theca lutin cells secrete estrogen. Some estrogen is also produced by scattered stroma secretory cells known as interstitial gland of the ovary. The vascular theca interna secretes androgens that pass to granulosa cells which convert them into estrogen.
The corpus luteum continues to secrete estrogen and progesterone for about 12 days. It reaches maximum development 9 days after ovulation. Corpus luteum can be easily recognized as a yellowish projection on the surface of the ovary. If pregnancy does not occur the corpus luteum will not be supported by chorionic
gonadotropins of the placenta (HCG) and degenerates. It is now called corpus albicans. If pregnancy does occur, HCG produced by the syncytiotrophoblast will support the corpus luteum which enlarges and continues to secrete its hormones for 20 weeks (end of the $4^{\text {th }}$ month of pregnancy). It is called corpus luteum of pregnancy and is one-third to one-half the size of the ovary. Removal of the corpus luteum of pregnancy before the $4^{\text {th }}$ month usually results in termination of pregnancy. After the $4^{\text {th }}$ month the luteal cells regress slowly as secretion of progesterone by syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta becomes adequate to maintain pregnancy.

\section*{MENSTRUAL (UTERINE) CYCLE}

Definition: Menstrual cycle is the cyclical changes which occur in the endometrium of the uterus of fertile female. These changes aim at preparation of the endometrium to receive a fertilized ovum. The reproductive years of a woman's life extends from the start of menstruation (menarche) until its cessation (menopause); from 13 up to 48 years.

Duration: 28 days. The cycle may vary from female to female or from cycle to cycle in the same female. A cycle may normally range from 3 weeks to 5 weeks (from about 21 days to 40 days). The intervals between periods are longest in years immediately after menarche and before menopause. A new cycle begins on the first day of bleeding.

Phases The endometrium is a 'mirror'' of the ovarian cycle and responds to fluctuating concentrations of the ovarian hormones and the pituitary gonadotrophins. The menstrual cycle is divided into three phases; mensis (bleeding or menstrual) phase, proliferative phase and secretory phase.

\section*{1) BLEEDING (MENSIS OR MENSTRUAL) PHASE}

The average bleeding phase is 5 days (from 3-7days). Menstrual flow is about 60 ml (from $20-80 \mathrm{ml}$ ) of unclotted (fibrinolytic) blood and the discarded sloughed endometrial tissues. Menstrual blood usually does not clot unless the bleeding is very heavy. By the end of this phase thickness of the endometrium is 0.5 mm . By definition the first day of bleeding is counted as the beginning of each menstrual cycle (day 1 ).

\section*{2) PROLIFERATIVE (ESTROGENIC OR FOLLICULAR) PHASE}

Duration: 9 days.
Proliferative phase is controlled by estrogen hormone secreted by the ovarian follicles.
Variations in the menstrual cycles are due to alterations in the proliferative phase. It starts with repair (early proliferation) of the denuded surface from the basal parts of the endometrial glands which were not shed by menstruation. Repair takes

2-3 days. Epithelium dips down into the loose stroma of the endometrium to form simple tubular glands. The epithelium shows numerous mitoses and the glands increase in length and number, and become dilated. The endometrium becomes more vascular and its thickness reaches 3 mm . This phase is called follicular because the ovarian follicles are developing during it.

\section*{3) SECRETORY (LUTEAL OR PROGESTATIONAL) PHASE}

Duration: 14 days.
Controlled by progesterone hormone secreted by the corpus luteum.
It is called luteal because it coincides with formation, growth and function of the corpus luteum.
Epithelial cells increase in size, and the endometrial glands become tortous, wide and saccular (cork-screw like). Progesterone stimulates the glandular epithelium to secrete glycogen, lipids and mucoplysacharides. The uterine glands become distended with secretions and there is an increase in the connective tissue fluids. Vascularity increases and there are two types of arteries supplying the endometrium; basal arteries which supply the bases of the uterine glands and spiral arteries which supply the superficial parts of the endometrium. The venous network becomes complex and large lacunae develop. Direct arteriovenous anastomoses are prominent feature of this phase. Endometrium in this phase shows three layers:
a- Stratum compactum formed of neck of glands.
b- Stratum spongiosum formed of bodies of glands.
c- Stratum basale formed of bases of glands.
Stratum compactum and stratum spongiosum constitute the superficial functional layer of endometrium supplied by the spiral arteries and is the layer which is shed during menstruation. Thickness of endometrium reaches 5 mm . It is the phase favorable for implantation of the blastocyst where it is usually embedded between openings of the uterine glands.
If pregnancy occurs (about day 6 of the secretory phase or day 20 of the menstrual cycle), the thick endometrium is maintained by progesterone secreted by corpus luteum (upto the $4^{\text {th }}$ month of pregnancy), and progesterone secreted by the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta (til end of pregnancy).
If pregnancy does not take place, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of progesterone and estrogen are lowered and the secretory endometrium enters an ischemic phase which takes about one day. The spiral arteries sensitive to low level of progesterone constrict and the blood supply is cut off the superficial zone of endometrium which is devitalized. Constriction of spiral arteries results in venous stasis and patchy ischemic necrosis (death) in the superficial layer of endometrium. Eventually rupture of the damaged vessels follow and blood seeps into the surrounding connective tissues. As small pieces of endometrium detach and pass into the uterine cavity, the torn ends of vessels bleed into the uterine cavity resulting in loss of about 60 ml of blood. Bleeding starts arterial then venous then mixture arterial and venous. Over 5 days the entire compact layer and most of the spongy layer of endometrium are discarded in mensis. Remnants of the spongy layer and the basal layer undergo regeneration to start repair of the denuded endometrium during the subsequent cycle.

\section*{Clinical Notes}

\section*{-Menopause}

Definition: the time in woman's life when cyclic functions of ovaries and menstrual periods cease.
Timing: Menopause occurs at the end of a woman's last menstrual period. However that fact is established when a woman has had no periods for at least 12 months. The average age is about 50 year but many occur earlier. The last periods tend to vary in duration and amount of flow and rarely ovulatory.
Mechanism: with age ovaries become less responsive to stimulation by FSH and LH. Consequently, ovaries secrete small amount of estrogen and progesterone and egg release stops.
Symptoms: during the time before menopause, ''climacteric', symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, moderate or severe.
a) Hot flashes especially in the head and neck for 1-5 years.
b) Perspiration which may be profuse.
c) Psychologic symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, insomnia and nervousness are probably due to decrease in estrogen level.
d) Dizziness, tingling sensation and pounding of the heart beat.
e) Loss of bladder control.
f) Dryness and inflammation of the vagina.
g) Pain during intercourse.
h) Muscle and joint aches.
i) Thinning of bones (osteoporosis)
j) Increase incidence of cardiovascular disease.

Treatment: estrogen replacement therapy should be considered in some cases keeping in mind the side effects and risk factors of this therapy.

\section*{CHAPTER 4}

\section*{FERTILIZATION}

Definition: Fertilization is fusion of a sperm and an ovum to produce a zygote. Of the $300-500$ million sperms deposited in the vagina, only $300-500$ sperms reach the fertilization site in the Fallopian tube. Only one sperm is needed for fertilization, and the others aid the fertilizing sperm in penetrating the barriers protecting the female gamete. Fertilization is a complex sequence of events that begins with contact between a sperm and an oocyte, and ends with intermingling of maternal and paternal chromosomes at metaphase of the first mitotic division of the zygote.

Site: The usual site of fertilization is the ampulla (widest and longest part) of the uterine tube.

Duration: Fertilization takes 24 hours to be completed.
Chemical signals (attractants) secreted by the ovum and follicular cells guide the sperm to the ovum (sperm chemotaxis). Gamete-specific protein and carbohydrate binding molecules on the surface of the sperm help in sperm-egg recognition.
Phases
1-Capacitation
Freshly ejaculated sperms are unable to fertilize an oocyte. Sperms must undergo a period of conditioning during which the seminal plasma proteins and a glycoprotein coat are removed from the surface of the sperm acrosome. The process of capacitation takes 7 hours. Sperms are capacitated mainly in the uterine tube by a substance secreted in the tube.
2-Acrosome reaction
When capacitated sperms come into contact with the corona radiata, they undergo complex molecular changes that result in development of perforations in the acrosome. Calcium ion, progesterone and prostaglandins play a critical role in acrosome reaction. Acrosome reaction is associated with the release of enzymes (hyaluronidase and acrosin).
3-Passage of sperm through corona radiata
As a result of the action of enzymes released from the acrosome and tubal mucosal enzymes, dispersal of corona radiata cells occurs allowing the sperm to pass through.
4-Penetration of zona pellucida
Zona is a glycoprotein shell surrounding the ovum that maintains sperm binding and induces acrosome reaction. Release of acrosome enzymes cause lysis of the zona pellucida, allowing sperm to penetrate the zona, thereby coming in contact with the oocyte surface.
5-Zona reaction
Once the sperm penetrates the zona pellucida and comes into contact with the oocyte surface a zona reaction takes place. This contact results in release of lysosomal enzymes from cortical granules lining the plasma membrane of the oocyte. These
enzymes cause an alteration in the structure and composition of the zona pellucida known as zona reaction. This change in the properties of the zona pellucida and in the extracellular glycoprotein coat prevents sperm binding and penetration, and inactivate species-specific receptor sites for sperms on the zona surface. These changes make zona impermeable to other sperms. Contents of these cortical granules also cause changes in the plasma membrane that makes it impenetrable to other sperms. Other sperms have been found stuck in the zona pellucida, but only one seems to be able to penetrate the oocyte. By this polyspermy is prevented.
6-Fusion of oocyte and sperm plasma membranes
Since plasma membrane covering the acrosomal head cap has disappeared during the acrosome reaction, actual fusion is accomplished between the oocyte membrane and the membrane that covers the posterior region of the sperm head. Head and tail of the sperm enter the cytoplasm of the oocyte, the sperm's plasma membrane is left behind.
7-Completion of the second meiotic division
Penetration of the oocyte by a sperm activates the oocyte to complete the second meiotic division forming a mature oocyte and a second polar body. Nucleus of the mature ovum becomes the female pronucleus.
8-Formation of male pronucleus
The sperm moves to lie in close proximity to the female pronucleus. Its nucleus becomes swollen and forms male pronucleus, while the tail is detached and degenerates. The oocyte containing two haploid pronuclei is called ootid.
9-Formation of the zygote
Male and female pronuclei loose their nuclear membrane and fuse into a single diploid aggregation of chromosomes, and the ootid becomes a zygote.
10-Preparation for cleavage of the zygote
During growth of male and female pronuclei, they replicate their DNA. Each chromosome is formed of two chromatids joined at the centromere. Immediately after DNA synthesis chromosomes become arranged on a cleavage spindle in preparation of normal mitotic division. Two centrioles from the proximal centriole of the sperm appear on each pole of the spindle. Each of the 23 maternal and 23 paternal chromosome splits longitudinally at the centromere, and sister chromatids move to opposite poles, thus providing each cell of the zygote with normal diploid number of chromosomes and normal amount of DNA. A deep furrow appears on the surface of the cell, gradually dividing the cytoplasm into two cells (two cell stage).

\section*{Results of fertilization}
1) Stimulation of the oocyte to complete the second meiotic division.
2) Restoration of the diploid number of chromosomes, half from the father and half from the mother. Hence, the zygote contains a new combination of chromosomes different from both parents.
3) Determination of genetic characters of the embryo.
4) Determination of sex of the new individual, an X-bearing sperm produces a female embryo and a Y-bearing sperm produces a male embryo.
5) Variations of the human species through mingling of paternal and maternal chromosomes (biparental inheritance).
6) Initiation of cleavage: sperm carries metabolic activating factor that after fusion of the pronuclei stimulates the initial cellular and molecular events
associated with early embryogenesis. Without fertilization the oocyte usually degenerates 24 hours after ovulation.

\section*{Notes}
-The zygote is genetically unique because half of its chromosomes come from the mother and half from the father. The zygote contains a new combination of chromosomes that is different from that in cells of either one of the parents. Meiosis allows independent assortment of maternal and paternal chromosomes among the germ cells. Crossing over which takes place in prophase of first meiotic division offers genetic reshuffle by relocating segments of homologous chromosomes. This mechanism forms the basis of biparental inheritance and variations of the human species.

\section*{-Preselection of embryo's sex}

Various in vitro techniques have been developed to separate X-bearing and Y-bearing sperms in order to get the desired sex. These techniques include
a) Differential swimming abilities of X - and Y - bearing sperms.
b) Different speeds of migration of X - and Y - bearing sperms in an electric field.
c) Microscopic difference in the appearance of X - and Y - bearing sperms.

\section*{Contraceptive Methods}

Contraceptives must be used correctly to be effective. They are more likely to fail when used by people who are younger, have less education, or are less motivated to prevent pregnancy. From $5-15 \%$ of women using contraceptive methods designed for use at time of sexual intercourse (condom, foam, withdrawal) become pregnant. These methods are less effective than oral contraceptives, implants, injectable contraceptives and intrauterine device, which provide longer-term protection. From 0.1 to $3 \%$ of women using these longer-term contraceptives become pregnant.

1- Barrier contraceptives
a) Male condom: is often contains chemical spermicides. Failure rate is from $3-12 \%$.
b) Female condom that lines the vagina. Failure rate is $5-20 \%$.
c) Other barriers, placed in the vagina include diaphragms, cervical caps, and contraceptive sponge.
Oral contraceptives: the 'pill' is a combination of estrogen and progesterone analogue, progestin, that inhibits ovulation but permits menstruation. The pills are taken daily for 21 days. They prevent the release of FSH and LH from the pituitary, so there will be no follicle maturation and no ovulation. Pills are stopped for one week to allow mensis. Contraceptive pills are the most effective method of contraception (failure rate is only 1\%).

Postcoital birth control pill, morning after pills, are prescribed in an emergency situation, e.g. following sexual abuse. Estrogen in large doses is given after sexual intercourse (within 72 hours) for several days usually prevents implantation (not fertilization) by altering tubal motility or interfering with corpus luteum function or by causing abnormal changes in the endometrium.
2- Contraceptive implants, Depo-provera, are plastic capsules containing progestin, implanted subdermally. Capsules release progestin slowly into blood stream which prevents ovulations; they can remain in place for 5 years. Failure rate is very low (less than $0.1 \%$ ). Capsule can be removed if pregnancy is desired.
3- Injectable contraceptives: progesin is injected intramuscularly once every 3 months. Failure rate is very low ( $0.3 \%$ ).
4- Intrauterine device (IUDs) is made of molded plastic. One type releases copper from a copper wire wrapped around the base; the other type releases progesterone. A plastic string is usually attached, so that a woman can check to make sure the device is still in place. The loop releasing progesterone must be replaced every year. Other type releases copper is effective for 10 years. Intrauterine devices prevent conception by causing inflammatory reaction inside the uterus that attracts white blood cells. White blood cells produce toxins that affect sperms preventing them from fertilizing the ovum, or by inhibiting preimplantation stages of development.
5- Tubal ligation and vasectomy prevent conception and in many cases are reversible.
6- Rhythm method (safe period): the couple must abstain from day 8 through day 18 in a regular cycle of 28 days. Failure rate is high, $20 \%$.
7- Coitus interruptus; male withdraws penis from the vagina before ejaculation.

\section*{Infertility}

Definition: Infertility is the inability of a couple to achieve pregnancy after repeated intercourse for one year.
Incidence: about $20 \%$ of couples are infertile, about half of these are due to male factors.
Causes: -in male: problems with sperms; insufficient number and or defective motility.
-in female: defective ovulation, abnormal structure or function of the fallopian tubes, hostile cervix (thick mucus or mucus which contain antibodies to sperms), immunity to sperms and congenital abnormalities of the female genitalia. Female infertility is mainly due to occluded oviducts, mostly due to pelvic inflammatory disease.

\section*{Causes of infertility}
\begin{tabular}{lr} 
Problem area & Percentage \\
-Sperm & $30-40 \%$ \\
-Ovulation & $15-20 \%$ \\
-Fallopian tubes & $25-40 \%$
\end{tabular}
-Cervix
5\%
-Unidentified factors 5-15\%

Problems with the sperms:
a) Prolonged fever or exposure to heat can reduce sperm count and motility or increase abnormal forms in semen.
b) Azospermia, complete absence of sperms, results from serious disorder within the testes or from blocked or missing vasa deferentia. Semen that does not contain fructose indicates that the seminal vesicles are missing or the ejaculatory ducts are blocked.
c) Varicocele prevents proper drainage of blood from the testes thus rising their temperature and reducing the rate of sperm formation.
d) Semen can travel in a wrong direction (retrograde ejaculation): semen backs up into the urinary bladder. This disorder is common in men who have had pelvic surgery particularly prostatectomy.

\section*{Management of infertility}

1- Investigate the cause:
a) Seminal analysis to check count, viability and motility of sperms.
b) Monitoring ovulation by :
i- basal body temperature.
ii-or more accurately detect an increase in LH which peaks in urine 24 hours before ovulation.
iii-A sample from the endometrium 10 days after ovulation is presumed to have occurred would show secretory changes.
c) Hysterosalpingogram to check patency of the fallopian tubes.
d) Ultrasonography to detect anomalies of the female genitalia.

2- Induction of ovulation by clomiphene.

\section*{3- Fertilization techniques:}

In-vitro fertilization (IVF) of human ova:
-Gonadotropins are given to the female to stimulate follicles to mature. -Several oocytes are aspirated from the mature follicles prior to ovulation. (oocyte in late first meiotic division).
-Oocytes are placed in a special culture media with capacitated sperms. -Fertilization and cleavage of zygotes is monitored up to 8-cell stage, then transferred through the cervical canal into the uterus. Pregnancy is enhanced by inserting up to 4 embryos because failure rate is high (up to $80 \%$ failure).

\section*{Cloning}

Definition: Cloning is to get an embryo without fertilization.
Procedure: Three female animals are usually used.
1-Somatic cell provider: the first animal is the animal which needs to be cloned.
2-Ovum provider: the second animal provides denucleated ovum.
3-Surrogate mother: the third animal acts as a surrogate mother in the uterus of which the embryo is implanted.
Steps:
-Somatic cells from the first animal are put in tissue culture to allow cell division.
-Cells are put in a minimum tissue culture; cells stop dividing and become quiescent. These cells are totepotent and behave like embryonic cells (pleuripotential).
-A totepotent cell is put close to a denucleated ovum taken from the second animal.
-Electric shock is applied to stimulate fusion of the two cells (totepotent cell and denucleated ovum).
-The fused cell is put in egg growth medium to allow start cell division.
-Embryo of 4-8 cell stage is implanted in the uterus of the surrogate mother (third animal of the same species).
Dolly is the first sheep cloned in 1997 by Ian Wilmut. Many animals have been cloned since that date. However, in human there are many debates concerning human cloning from the social, ethical and legal aspects. Moreover cloned animals or human may carry great possibility of birth defects.

\section*{CHAPTER 5}

\section*{EARLY EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT}

\section*{Cleavage of Zygote}

Definition: Cleavage or segmentation is rapid and repeated mitotic divisions of the zygote in order to increase the number of embryonic cells (blastomeres).

Site: cleavage occurs as the zygote travels along the fallopian tube toward the uterus.
Duration and steps: 30 hours after fertilization the zygote divides into 2-cell stage. 4 -cell stage is reached by 40 hours and 16-cell stage (morula) is reached by 72 hours. It is noticed that by each cell division blastomeres increase in number but their sizes are reduced. Segmentation is a process of fractioning with no new formed protoplasm. Compaction: after the 8-cell stage, blastomeres are tightly aligned to form compact ball of cells. This is mediated by cell surface adhesion glycoprotein. Compaction is essential for cellular interaction and for segregation of inner from outer cell mass.

\section*{Blastocyst Formation}

The spherical morula (16-32 cells) enters the uterine cavity on day 4 after fertilization. Secretions from the uterine glands diffuse through zona pellucida between its cells to form fluid space called blastocele. As fluid increases, it separates the blastomeres into two parts:
- A thin outer layer - trophoblast (trophe=nutrition) - which gives rise to the embryonic part of the placenta.
- A group of centrally located blastomeres - the inner cell mass - gives rise to the embryo. During this stage the conceptus is called blastocyst or blastula.
After the blastocyst has floated in the uterine cavity for 2 days, the zona pellucida degenerates and disappears, - hatching of the egg. Degeneration of the zona pellucida results from the effects of lytic enzymes released from the sperm acrosome and also from enlargement of the blastocyst. The blastula derives its nutrition from secretions of the uterine glands. This hatching allows the blastula to increase rapidly in size and start the process of implantation.

\section*{Implantation}

Definition: Implantation is embedding of the blastocyst in the endometrium.
Proper site of implantation is in between the endometrial glands near the midline of the upper part of the posterior wall of the uterus.
Duration: from day 6 to day 12 after fertilization.
As implantation is taking place morphological changes occur in the embryoblast that produce bilaminar embryonic disc composed of epiblast and hypoblast. Extraembryonic structures forming during the second week are the amnion, yolk sac, connecting stalk, and chorionic sac.
Steps of implantation:
About day 6 after fertilization, the blastocyst attaches to the endometrial epithelium by its embryonic pole. As soon as it attaches, the trophoblast proliferates and differentiates into two layers:
-an inner cellular layer of cytotrophoblast.
-an outer syncytiotrophoblast; of multinucleated protoplasmic mass in which no cell boundaries can be observed. Cells in cytotrophoblast divide and then migrate into the syncytiotrophoblast. At the embryonic pole syncytiotrophoblast show finger-like processes that expand to invade the endometrium.
Factors which assist invasion of syncytiotrophoblast into endometrium
1-Syncytiotrophoblast produces proteolytic enzymes that cause erosion of the endometrial epithelium. The erosive syncytiotrophoblast invades the endometrial connective tissue.
2-Syncytiotrophoblast displaces endometrial cells in the central part of the implantation site. The endometrial cells promote the proteolytic action of the blastocyst by undergoing apoptosis (programmed cell death) which facilitates more invasion of the trophoblast.
3-Molecular events related to human implantation involves proteolytic enzymes, prostacyclins, cytokines, steroid hormones and growth factors.
4-Connective tissue cells of the endometrium around implantation accumulate glycogen and lipids and assume polyhedral appearance - decidua reaction. The primary function of the decidua reaction is to provide immunologically privileged site for the embryo.

\section*{Sources of nutrition of the implanted blastocyst}

1-On day 9 vacuoles appear in the syncytium, when these vacuoles fuse they form large lacunae. The lacunae soon become filled with a mixture of maternal blood from ruptured endometrial capillaries and cellular debris from eroded uterine glands. This mixture of fluid is termed embryotroph and passes by diffusion to the embryo.
2-Syncytiotrophoblast engulfs degenerated decidua cells providing rich nutrition to the embryo.
3-Communication of the eroded capillaries with the syncytial lacunae establishes the primordial utero-placental circulation as early as day 11 or 12. The lacunar networks are the primordial of the intervillous spaces of the placenta. When maternal blood flows into the lacunae, oxygen and nutritive material are available to the embryo.

The 10-day conceptus is completely embedded in the endometrium. For about 2 days there is a defect in the endometrium that is filled by a closing plug (blood clot). By day 12 completely regenerated epithelium covers the closing plugClinical Notes
-Implantation bleeding may occur at implantation site as a result of increased blood flow into lacunar spaces. Since this bleeding which is usually slight (spotting) occurs around day 28 of the cycle, it may be confused with a normal menstrual bleeding and so cause inaccuracy in determining the expected date of delivery.
-Syncytiotrophoblast secretes human chorionic gonadotrophins (hCG) which enters the maternal blood in the syncytial lacunae. hCG maintains the hormonal activity of the corpus luteum up to the middle of pregnancy and forms the basis of pregnancy test as early as the end of the second week.
Because the implanted embryo represents a foreign body ( $50 \%$ of its genes are paternally derived) it should be rejected by maternal immune system. However, syncytiotrophoblast resists killer cells and transplantation of antigens.
-Inhibition of implantation :Implantation can be inhibited by:
a) Adminstration of large doses of estrgen for several days shortly after unprotected sex, -'morning after pill'.
b) Abortion pill RU 486 interrupts implantation by disturbing the hormonal balance.
c) IUD causes local inflammation which interferes with implantation.

\section*{-Abnormal implantation:}
a) Failure of implantation occurs in about $25 \%$ of cases due to: embryonic genetic disorder, lethal chromosome, poorly developed endometrium or inadequate hormones by the corpus luteum.
b) Ectopic pregnancy is implantation outside the uterus i-In $95 \%$ of cases implantation occurs in the fallopian tube:
Incidence is $1 / 80$ to $1 / 250$ pregnancies. Adhesions or blockage of the uterine tubes due to pelvic inflammatory diseases are the commonest causes. Patient has symptoms and signs of pregnancy, e.g., missed period, and abdominal pain and tenderness (confused with appendicitis), and abnormal bleeding. The case is usually diagnosed by endovaginal sonography. The usual outcome is rupture of the tube and hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity during the first 8 weeks. The affected tube and conceptus should be surgically removed. The commonest site in the tube is the ampulla.
ii-Abdominal implantation is rare. An abdominal pregnancy creates a serious condition because the placenta attaches to abdominal organs (intestine, omentum or in rectouterine pouch) and causes considerable intraperitoneal bleeding.
iii-Very uncommon, the blastocyst develops in the ovary proper, causing primary ovarian pregnancy that usually results in intra-abdominal bleeding.
c) Cervical implantation is unusual; some of these pregnancies are not recognized because the conceptus is aborted during early gestation.

\section*{-Abnormal blastocyst and spontaneous abortions:}

It has been estimated that from $1 / 3$ to $1 / 2$ of all zygotes never develop into blastocysts and implant. Estimates suggest that as many as $50 \%$ of all pregnancies end in spontaneous abortions and half of these losses are due to chromosomal abnormalities. These abortions serve as natural means of screening embryos for defects.

\section*{Bilaminar Germ Disc (Second Week of Development)}

At the $8^{\text {th }}$ day cells of the inner cells mass differentiate into two layers:
a) Epiblast: a layer of highly columnar cells.
b) Hypoblast: a layer of small cuboidal cells adjacent to the blastocele.

Cells of each germ layer form a flat disc and together are known as the bilaminar germ disc. At the same time a cavity appears within the epiblast known as the amniotic cavity. Epiblast cells which line the amniotic cavity are called amnioblasts. At the $9^{\text {th }}$ day flattened cells from hypoblast form a thin membrane known as exocelomic membrane which together with the hypoblast form the lining of the exocelomic cavity (primitive yolk sac).

At the $11^{\text {th }}-12^{\text {th }}$ day a new population of cells derived from the wall of the yolk sac form loose connective tissue extraembryonic (primary) mesoderm which eventually fills the space between trophoblast externally and the amnion and exocelomic membrane internally. Soon large cavites develop in the extraembryonic mesoderm and when they fuse a new space known as extraembryonic celom (chorionic cavity) is formed. The space surrounds the amniotic cavity and primitive yolk sac except when the germ disc is connected to the trophoblast by connecting stalk. The extraembryonic celom separates the extraembryonic mesoderm into two layers; outer somatic (somatopleuric) mesoderm and inner splanchnic (splanchnopleuric) mesoderm.
At the $13^{\text {th }}$ day the trophoblast is characterized by the appearance of villous structures. Cells of the cytotrophoblast proliferate and penetrate into the syncytiotrophoblast, thus forming cellular columns surrounded by syncytium. Cellular columns with syncytial covering become known as primary chorionic villi.
By two-week embryo, the extraembryonic celom expands and forms the chorionic cavity. The trophoblast and its linig of somatic mesoderm are together known as the chorion (chorionic plate). The whole vesicle of the two-week embryo, about $2-3 \mathrm{~mm}$, is known as the chorionic vesicle. The germ (embryonic) disc is 0.2 mm long and eggshaped.

\section*{CHAPTER 6}

\section*{Trilaminar Germ Disc-Gastrula (Three -Week Embryo)}

Rapid development of the embryonic disc during the third week is characterized by:
1) Formation of three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).
2) Formation of notochord.
3) Development of the chorionic villi.

By the end of the third week the embryo is 3 mm long.

\section*{1) Formation of the three germ layers}

Gastrulation is the process by which the three germ layers and axial orientation are established in the embryo. It is the start of shaping the embryo (morphogenesis). It begins with formation of the primitive streak on day 14 as opacity formed by thickened band of epiblast which appears caudally in the median plane of the dorsal aspect of the embryonic disc. The cranial end of the primitive streak forms the primitive node. A narrow groove, - primitive groove - develops in the primitive streak that is continuous with a small depression in the primitive node, -primitive pit. The primitive groove and pit result from inward movements of epiblast cells. With the appearance of the primitive streak it is possible to identify the embryo's cranial and caudal ends, its dorsal and ventral surfaces and its right and left sides. Epiblast cells become flask-shaped, detach and slip beneath. Some cells displace hypoblast cells creating the embryonic endoderm on the roof of the yolk sac. Most of the hypoblast cells are displaced to the wall of the yolk sac. Other cells leave the deep surface of the primitive streak and come to lie between epiblast and the newly formed endoderm to form intrarmbryonic mesoderm. Cells remaining in the epiblast form the embryonic ectoderm. Cells of the epiblast through gastrulation give rise to all three germ layers. Mesenchyme refers to loosely organized embryonic connective tissue. Mesenchymal cells are phagocytic and have ameboid movements. These pleuripotential cells have the ability to migrate, proliferate and differentiate into diverse types of cells. Mesenchymal cells derived from the primitive streak form mesoblasts that organize to form mesoderm. These mesodermal cells spread cranially and laterally to fill the space between ectderm and endoderm. In cephalic direction they pass on each side of the prechordal plate to meet in front of it where they form the cardiogenic plate. The prechordal plate is a circular thickenenig
of the cephalic region of the hypoblast. These columnar hypoblast cells are firmly attached to the overlying epiblast. The prechordal plate is the primordium of the oropharyngeal membrane. The embryonic disc now becoming trilaminar but remains bilaminar at three sites:
-Prechordal plate (oropharyngeal membrane).
-In the midline cranial to the primitive node where the notochordal process is present.
-Cloacal membrane.

\section*{Fate of the primitive streak}

The primitive streak actively forms secondary mesoderm until early in the $4^{\text {th }}$ week (day 19-20) when production of mesoderm slows down. The primitive streak diminishes in size and becomes insignificant structure in the sacrococcygeal region of the embryo. It degenerates by the end of the $4^{\text {th }}$ week.

\section*{Clinical Notes}
-Remnants of primitive streak may persist and give rise to a tumor containing various types of tissue elements of the three germ layers in incomplete stages of differentiation. This tumor is known as sacrococcygeal teratoma.
-Gastrulation may be disrupted by genetic and teratogenic causes. Caudal dysgenesis sirenomelia is a syndrome in which there is insufficient mesoderm formed in the caudal region of the embryo. There is hypoplasia of lower limbs, vertebral anomalies, renal agenesis, imperforte anus and anomalies of the genital organs.

\section*{2) Formation of Notochord}

Some mesenchymal (prenotochordal) cells invaginating in the primitive node and pit move forward in a cephalic direction until they reach the prechordal plate. The notochordal process appears by day 16 and soon acquires a lumen, -notochordal canal. The notochordal process is now a cellular tube that extends from the primitive node to the prechordal plate. The floor of the notochrdal canal fuses with the underlying endoderm. The fused layers gradually undergo degeneration, resulting in the formation of openings which brings the notochordal canal into communication with the yolk sac. Soon the floor of the canal disappears. The remains of the notochordal process form a flattened notochordal plate. The notochordal plate infolds to form the notochord.. The notochord detaches from endoderm which becomes a separate layer. As the primitive streak regresses the notochord is stretched caudally. The notochord is the basis of naming phylum to chordata.

\section*{Fate of the notochord}

The notochord degenerates and disappears as the bodies of vertebrae form, but it persists as the nucleus pulposus of each intervertebral disc.

\section*{Functions of the notochord}

1-Notochord is the primary inducer in early embryo. It induces overlying ectoderm to form the neural tube.

2-It defines the axis of the embryo and gives it its rigidity.
3-It serves as the basis of development of the axial skeleton.
4-It persists as the nuclus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.
5-It shares in formation of the mesenchyme.

\section*{Anomalies of the notochord}

Remnants of notochord may give rise to benign or malignant tumors- chordomas. These tumors occur at the base of the skull and may extend to nasopharynx.

\section*{3) Development of Chorionic Villi}

Shortly after primary chorionic villi appear at the end of the second week, they begin to branch. Early in the third week, mesenchyme grows into the primary villi. The villi at this stage - secondary chorionic villi - cover the entire surface of the chorionic sac. Some mesenchymal cells in the villi differentiate into capillaries and blood cells. They are now called tertiary chorionic villi. The capillaries in the villi fuse to form arterio-capillary networks, which soon become connected with the embryonic heart through vessels that develop in the chorion and connecting stalk. By the end of the third week, embryonic blood begins to flow through the capillaries in the villi. Oxygen and nutrients in the maternal blood in the intervillous spaces diffuse through the walls of the villi and enter the embryo's blood. Carbon dioxide and waste products diffuse back from embryonic capillaries through the walls of the villi into maternal blood. Villi that attach to decidua basalis are stem (anchoring) villi. The villi that grow from the sides of the stem villi are free (branch,terminal or absorbing) villi. It is through the walls of the free villi that the main exchange of material between blood of the mother and embryo (later the fetus) takes place.

\section*{Clinical Note}
-Abnormal growth of trophoblast. Sometimes villi are not vascularized to form tertiary villi. These degenerating villi form cystic swellings named hydatidiform (vesicular) moles, which resemble a bunch of grapes. Moles produce excessive hCG. $3-5 \%$ of moles develop into malignant trophoblastic choriocarcinoma. Mechanism of development of complete hydatidiform moles is fertilization of an oocyte in which the female pronucleus is absent or inactive (an empty oocyte).

\section*{EARLY TISSUE AND ORGAN DIFFERENTIATION}

\section*{Derivatives of Ectoderm}

Neurulation is formation of the neural tube. It starts during the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week and is completed by the end of the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, when closure of the neuropores occurs. During neurulation the embryo is referred to as the neurula.

\section*{Formation of the neural tube}

The neural plate appears as a thickening of the embryonic ectoderm cranial to the primitive node. The neural plate is induced to form by the developing notochord. Once induction has occurred, the elongated slipper-shaped neural plate gradually expands toward the primitive streak. By the end of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week, the lateral edges of the neural plate become elevated to form neural folds, while the depressed midregion forms a groove,- the neural groove. Gradually, the neural folds approach each other in the midline, where they fuse to form the neural tube. Fusion begins in the region of the neck ( $4^{\text {th }}$ somite) and proceeds in a cephalocaudal direction. The cephalic and caudal ends of the tube communicate with the amniotic cavity by the way of the cranial and caudal neuropores. Closure of the cranial neuropore occurs at day 25 and closure of the caudal neuropore occurs at day 27. As the neural folds fuse, neuroectodermal cells at the lateral borders of the folds dissociate and form the neural crests. Neural crest cells give rise to many cells and tissues including spinal and autonomic ganglia, ganglia of cranial nerves, Schwann cells, meninges (pia and arachnoid), melanocytes, suprarenal medulla, bones and connective tissues of craniofacial structures and cells of cardiac cushions. The narrow caudal $1 / 3$ of the neural tube will form the spinal cord and the wider cephalic $2 / 3$ characterized by a number of dilatations form the brain vesicle.

\section*{Clinical Note}

Disturbances of neurulation may result in abnormalities of the brain and spinal cord. Anencephaly (partial absence of the brain) is the most common and most severe neural tube defect. It is due to failure of the neural folds to fuse.

\section*{Summary of derivatives of ectoderm}

Ectoderm germ layer gives rise to organs and structures that maintain contact of the embryo with the outside:
1 -Nervous system.

2-Sensory epithelium of eye, ear and nose.
3-Epidermis of skin including hairs, nails, sweat glands and mammary glands.
4-Enamel of teeth.
6 -Pituitary gland.

\section*{Derivatives of Mesoderm}
. By the $17^{\text {th }}$ day, mesoderm close to the midline on each side of the notochord forms a thick longitudinal column of paraxial mesoderm. This is followed by intermediate mesoderm and lateral mesoderm. Cavities appear in the lateral mesoderm to form intraembryonic coelomic cavity, which divides the lateral cell mass of mesoderm into two layers:
a) Somatic or parietal layer continuous with mesoderm covering amnion.
b) Splanchnic or visceral layer continuous with mesoderm covering yolk sac.

The somatic mesoderm and the overlying ectoderm form the body wall or somatopleure, whereas the splanchnic mesoderm and the underlying endoderm form the gut or splanchnopleure. During the second month the intraembryonic coelom is divided into three body cavities; pericardial, pleural and peritoneal cavities.

\section*{Derivatives of somites}

Early in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week paraxial mesoderm becomes organized into segments or somites. The first pair of somites appears in the cervical region at the $20^{\text {th }}$ day. New somites continue to appear in a craniocaudal sequence at a rate of 3 pairs/day until the end of the $5^{\text {th }}$ week, 44 pairs of somites are recognized. There are 4 occipital, 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 10 coccygeal somites. The first occipital and the last 7 coccygeal somites disappear, while the remaining somites form the axial skeleton, associated musculature and adjacent dermis of skin. During this period (from day 20 to day 35) age of the embryo is expressed in numbers of somites.
By the beginning of the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, cells of the ventromedial walls of somites form sclerotomes which shift to surround the notochord and the spinal cord to form the vertebral column. The dorsolateral walls of somites form dermatomyotomes which constitute myotomes and dermatomes. Each myotome provides musculature of its own segment. Dermatome forms dermis of segmental skin component.

\section*{Intermediate Mesoderm}

Intermediate mesoderm forms the urinary and genital systems.

\section*{Lateral Mesoderm}

Parietal (somatic) mesoderm together with overlying ectoderm forms lateral and ventral body walls. Visceral (splanchnic) mesoderm will form smooth muscles.

\section*{Summary of derivatives of mesoderm}

Mesoderm germ layer is the middle supportive and connective layer and gives rise to:

1-Connective tissues, cartilages, bones and muscles.
2-Heart, blood vessels, blood cells and the spleen.
3-Serous membranes; pericardium, pleura and peritoneum.
4-Dermis of skin.
5-Suprarenal cortex.
6-Urogenital system.

\section*{Derivatives of Endoderm}

Early in the $4^{\text {th }}$ week the embryo undergoes folding. Cephalocaudal folding is caused by the rapid longitudinal growth of the neural tube. Lateral folding is produced by the rapidly growing somites. There are head fold, tail fold and two lateral folds. In the head fold endoderm will form foregut and in the tail fold it will form hindgut. The part in between the foregut and the hindgut is the midgut which communicates with the yolk sac by way of vitelline (vitellointestinal) duct or yolk stalk.
The foregut is bounded by the oropharyngeal membrane which ruptures by end of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week, thus opens a connection between the gut and the amniotic cavity. The hindgut terminates at the cloacal membrane which ruptures by the $3^{\text {rd }}$ month.
The allantois, a sausage-shaped diverticulum, appears early in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week from the caudal wall of the yolk sac. The allantois remains very small in human embryos. The region of the hindgut caudal to allantois expands and forms the cloaca.

\section*{Summary of derivatives of endoderm}

The endoderm germ layer, the inner lining and nutritive layer, gives rise to:
1-Epithelial lining of the gut
2-Epithelial lining of the respiratory tract.
3-Parynchyma of thyroid, parathyroid, liver and pancreas.
4-Stroma of tonsils and thymus.
5-Epithelial lining of urinary bladder and urethra.
6-Epithelial lining of tympanic cavity and auditory tube.

\section*{Folding of the embryo}

Folding of the embryo is a significant event which takes place early during the $4^{\text {th }}$ week. Rapid growth of the neural tube causes longitudinal folding and rapid growth of somites cause transverse folding. Folding occurs at the cranial and caudal ends as head and tail folds, and at the sides as two lateral folds

\section*{Results of folding:}

1-Embryo attains a round body form from a flat disc.
2-The brain is pulled forward and becomes the most cranial organ.
3-Septum transversum, heart, pericardium and oropharyngeal membrane move to a ventral and caudal position. Pericardium becomes ventral to the heart instead of dorsal and septum transversum which was cranial to the heart becomes ventrocaudal to it. Stomodeum (future mouth) lies between the brain and the heart.
4-Endoderm of yolk sac is incorporated in the head fold to form foregut, and in the tail fold to form hindgut. Midgut communicates with the yolk sac by vitelline duct.

5-The connecting stalk shifts from a caudal position to a ventral position and merges with the vitelline duct to form the umbilical cord.
6-The amniotic cavity expands and obliterates most of the extraembryonic coelom. The region of attachment of amnion to the ventral surface is reduced to a narrow region where amnion will form the epithelial covering of the umbilical cord.

\section*{Embryonic Period}

The period from the $3^{\text {rd }}$ to the $8^{\text {th }}$ week is known as the embryonic period or period of organogenesis. By the end of the embryonic period the main organ systems have been established and the main features of the body shape are recognizable. Except for the cardiovascular system, function of most of the systems is minimal. The length of the embryo grows from 3 mm by the end of week 3 to 30 mm by end of week 8 . By the end of the second month the embryo attains human shape. Because the beginnings of most external and internal structures are formed during the $4^{\text {th }}$ to $8^{\text {th }}$ weeks, this is the most critical and sensitive period of development. Disturbances during this period may give rise to major congenital abnormalities.

\section*{Control of Embryonic Development}

Development results from genetic plans in chromosomes. The developmental processes depend upon precisely coordinated interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Several control mechanisms guide differentiation and ensure harmonized development:
1 -Tissue interactions.
2-Regulated migration of cells.
3-Controlled proliferation.
4-Programmed cell death.
Embryonic development is a process of growth and increasing complexity of structure and function. Growth is achieved by mitosis while complexity is achieved by differentiation. Embryonic cells are pleuripotential; able to follow more than one pathway. This potential is very restricted as tissues acquire their specialized feature so that each system of the body has its own developmental pattern.
Interaction is an important factor in making choices to achieve tissue diversity. Interaction depends on one of the interactants called inductions which produce signals. Signals are translated into an intracellular message that influences the genetic activity. Cells of reacting tissue must express appropriate receptor for specific inducing signal molecule.
The ability of a reacting system to respond to inductions is limited in time and also limited in space; interactions may fail if interactants are too widely separated. Failure of interaction can lead to congenital abnormalities.

\section*{Highlights of the Embryonic Period}

The following descriptions summarize the main developmental events and changes in the external form of the embryo during the $4^{\text {th }}$ to $8^{\text {th }}$ week.

\section*{Estimation of Embryonic Age}

It is important to estimate age of the embryo in order to determine:
1 -Gestational age.
2-Time of clinical interference.
3-When to perform techniques like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling( not before 14 weeks and 8 weeks respectively).
4-Sensitivity of the embryo to a drug or teratogen.
5-Age of an embryo recovered after abortion.

\section*{What are the methods of estimating embryonic age?}

\section*{1)Onset of last normal menstrual period (LNMP)}

14 days must be deduced from gestational age to obtain fertilization age. Day of fertilization is more accurate than LNMP, and calculated from time of ovulation if known. Date of birth is calculated as 266 days ( 38 weeks) after estimated day of fertilization or 280 days ( 40 weeks) after onset of LNMP. Expected date of delivery (EDD) follows Nagele's rule: count back 3 months from first day of LNMP and add a year and 7 days. If the first day of LNMP was January, 4, 2007, subtract 3 months :October, 4,2006 , then add a year and 7 days, so EDD will be October 11,2007.
From fertilization to end of embryonic period, age is best expressed in days; thereafter age is expressed in weeks.

\section*{2)External features of the embryo and number of somites}

The embryonic disc is originally egg-shaped (2-week embryo) but soon becomes pear-shaped (early in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week) due to expansion of the cephalic part of the embryo and then slipperlike (late in the $3{ }^{\text {rd }}$ week) as the notochord develops. Early in the $4^{\text {th }}$ week and due to folding the embryo assumes definitive rounded shape. During the $2^{\text {nd }}$ month the external appearance changes due to large size of the head and formation of face, nose, ears, eyes and limbs. During the first month age of the embryo is determined by its greatest length (embryo is straight) and number of somites. Somites start at day 20 and complete by day 35 .
3)Use of ultrasonography to assess size of the chorionic cavity and size of the embryo

During the $2^{\text {nd }}$ month, age of the embryo is determined by crown-rump length (CRL). CRL is measured (while embryo is flexed) from vertix of the skull to midpoint between apices of the buttocks.

\section*{Fetal Period}

The period from beginning of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ month to the end of intrauterine life is known as the fetal period. It is characterized by rapid growth of the body and maturation of organ systems. Growth in length is striking during the $3^{\text {rd }}$, $4^{\text {th }}$, and $5^{\text {th }}$ months ( 5 $\mathrm{cm} /$ month), while increase in weight is most striking during the last 2 months of gestation ( $700 \mathrm{gm} /$ month). The fetus is less vulnerable to the teratogenic effects of drugs, viruses, and radiation, but these agents may interfere with growth and normal functional development especially of the brain and eyes.

\section*{Factors affecting fetal growth}

There are certain substances essential for fetal growth, e.g. glucose, aminoacids, insulin, vitamins and hormones.
Factors which may retard growth of the fetus are either maternal or fetal factors.
1-Maternal factors:
a)Malnutrition.
b)Infections.
c)Smoking and alcohol.
d)Placental insufficiency: degenerative changes in the placenta which impair placental blood flow.
e)Poor health, e.g. hypertension, renal disorders, and cardiac disorders.

\section*{2-Fetal factors:}
a)Genetic disorder; recessive genes.
b)Chromosomal abnormalities, e.g. Down syndrome and trisomy 18 .
c)Multiple pregnancy.

Time of birth: 40 weeks from onset of LNMP (38 weeks from fertilization)
-CRL is 36 cm .
-CHL is 50 cm .
-Weight is $3-3.5 \mathrm{~kg}$.
-Head circumference is about 35 cm
-Head length is $1 / 4$ of CRL.
-Testes are in the scrotum.
-Fingernails extend beyond fingertips.

\section*{Clinical Notes}
-Estimation of fetal age (gestational age) is done in the first trimester by ultrasound measurement of the CRL which can determine the probable age and the expected date of delivery (EDD). In the second and third trimesters, fetal head measurements, foot length and femur length are also used to estimate age.
-Viability of fetus is defined as the ability of the fetus to survive in the extrauterine environment. Fetuses weighing less than 500 gm at birth usually do not survive. Many low-birth weight babies result from intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Fetuses weighing between 1500 and 2500 gm usually survive. They are premature infants. Prematurity is one of the common causes of morbidity and perinatal death. Not all low-birth weight babies are premature. About one third of those with a birth weight less than 2500 gm are small for their gestational age. It is important to distinguish between full-term infants who have a low birth weight because of intrauterine growth retardation (small for date) and preterm infants who are underweight because of a shortened gestation (premature by date).
-Postmaturity is prolongation of pregnancy for 3 or more weeks beyond EDD. It occurs in $5 \%$ of pregnancies. Some infants develop postmaturity syndrome; often overweight, have dry skin, long nails, absent lanugo hair and vernix caseosa, and increased alertness. When delivery is delayed there is a significant increase in mortality. Because of this labour is often induced.

\section*{Procedures of Assessing Fetal Status and Growth}
1)Quickening is detection of fetal movements by the mother or palpated by the doctor. It is the first clue of fetal well being. Detection of fetal heartbeats by auscultation or by monitors may show fetal distress.
2)Ultrasonography is the primary imaging modality in evaluation of the fetus.

Advantages:
-Cheap, carries no risk, and widely available.
-Very informative, can be used in the embryonic and fetal periods.

\section*{Indications:}
a-Estimation of gestational age using measurements as fetal head, biparietal diameter, head circumference, foot length, fetal weight and crown-rump length.
b-Evaluation of chorionic sac and embryonic growth.
c-Guidance during chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis.
d-Evaluation of cephalopelvic proportion.
e-Diagnosis of suspected ectopic pregnancy.
f-Detection of a pelvic mass or uterine abnormality.
g -Detection of multiple births and abnormal presentations.
h -Detection of placental and fetal size and shape.
i-Detection of congenital abnormalities.

\section*{3)Amniocentesis}

Technique: amniotic fluid is sampled by inserting a hollow needle through the mother's anterior abdominal wall and uterine wall into the amniotic cavity by piercing the chorion and amnion. A syringe guided by ultrasonography withdraws amniotic fluid ( $20-30 \mathrm{ml}$ ). Fetal cells from the sample can be obtained, incubated or cultured to study sex chromatin, chromosomal pattern (embryonic karyotype) and detect cases of inborn error of metabolism. Increased amount of alpha-fetoprotein in amniotic fluid is an indication of neural tube defects, gastroschisis and omphalocele. Maternal alphafetoprotein is low when the fetus is Down syndrome, trisomy 18 and in other embryonic chromosomal defects. It is difficult to perform amniocentesis before week 14 because there is little amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis carries little risk ( $0.5 \%$ fetal loss).

\section*{Indications:}
a-Advanced maternal age (mother of 38 years or older).
b-Previous birth of trisomic child.
c-Chromosomal abnormality in either parent.
d-Mother with X-linked recessive disorder (hemophilia).
e-History of neural tube defect in the family.
f-Carriers of inborn errors of metabolism.

\section*{4)Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)}

Technique: Biopsies of chorionic villi may be obtained by inserting a needle guided by ultrasonography through the mother's abdominal and uterine walls into the uterine cavity. CVS can be performed between 10 to 12 weeks of gestation. It allows results of chromosomal analysis to be available several weeks earlier than when done by amniocentesis. Risk of fetal loss is $1 \%$, slightly higher than amniocentesis.

\section*{Indications:}
a-Detection of chromosomal abnormalities.
b-Detection of inborn error of metabolism.
c-Detection of X-linked disorder.

\section*{5)Fetoscopy}

By using fibrooptic lighting instrument, parts of the fetal body can be directly observed. It is possible to scan the entire fetus looking for anomalies. The technique is similar to that of amniocentesis. Fetoscopy is carried out at 17-20 weeks of gestation.

\section*{Indications:}
a-Detection of anomalies during the first trimester.
b-Prenatal treatment of some anomalies.

\section*{6)Computed tomography (CT) and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)}

When planning fetal treatment, CT and MRI may be used to provide more information about an abnormality that has been detected by ultrasonography.
Disadvantages:
-High cost.
-Fixed planes of sections.
-Limited fetal resolution.
CAT is helpful to differentiate between monoamniotic and diamniotic twins.

\section*{CHAPTER 8}

\section*{FETAL MEMBRANES}

Definition: Fetal membranes are structures that have originated from the zygote but do not participate in the formation of the embryo, except for parts of the yolk sac and allantois. Fetal membranes are regarded auxiliary organs that assist in the protection of the embryo and fetus and provide for their respiration, nutrition and excretion.
Fetal membranes include:
1-Amnion.
2-Yolk sac.
3-Allantois.
4-Connecting stalk; the future umbilical cord.
5-Chorion; the future placenta.

\section*{AMNION}

Definition. Amnion is a fluid-filled membranous sac that surrounds the embryo and later the fetus. It is avascular, thin, tough and transparent membrane which forms the wall of a cavity called amniotic cavity. The amniotic cavity contains pale watery fluid termed liquor amnii.
Embryonic origin
During the second week some cells from epiblast, named amnioblasts, enclose and form the roof of the amniotic cavity.

\section*{Development of amnion}

After folding, junction of amnion with the embryo changes from margins of the embryonic disc to a restricted region (future umbilicus) present at the ventral aspect. The amniotic cavity enlarges rapidly at the expense of yolk sac and chorionic cavity. Amnion begins to envelop the connecting stalk and yolk sac stalk, thereby crowding them together and causing the formation of the primitive umbilical cord. At the end of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ month, amnion has expanded to such an extent that it comes in contact with the
chorion. As amnion enlarges, it gradually obliterates the chorionic cavity and forms the epithelial covering of the umbilical cord.

\section*{Sources of amniotic fluid}

1-Initially some amniotic fluid may be secreted by amnioblasts.
2-Most of amniotic fluid is derived from maternal tissue by:
a)Diffusion from decidua parietalis across amniochorionic membrane.
b)Diffusion from blood in intervillous spaces of the placenta.

3-Skin of fetus (before keratinization) makes a major pathway of water and solutes in tissue fluid from fetus to amniotic cavity.
4-Fluid secreted by respiratory tract enters amniotic cavity at a rate of $300 \mathrm{ml} /$ day .
5-From week 11, urine (mostly water as the placenta functions to exchange waste) contributes to amniotic fluid. By late pregnancy 500 ml of urine is added daily.

\section*{Volume of amniotic fluid}

Amniotic fluid increases slowly reaching 30 ml at 10 weeks, 350 ml at 20 weeks, 700 ml at 37 weeks and 1000 ml at term.

\section*{Composition of amniotic fluid}

About $99 \%$ of the fluid is water; the rest is undissolved material; fetal epithelial cells and equal portions of organic and inorganic chemicals (salts). Half the organic constituents are protein; the other half consists of glucose, fats, enzymes, hormones, and pigments. As pregnancy advances, the composition of the amniotic fluid changes as fetal excreta (urine and meconium) are added.

\section*{Circulation of amniotic fluid}
-Large amount passes through amniochorionic membrane into maternal capillaries.
-An exchange of fluid with fetal blood occurs through the umbilical cord.
-Amniotic fluid is swallowed by the fetus and absorbed by the fetal respiratory and digestive tracts. Late in pregnancy the fetus swallows up to 400 ml of amniotic fluid per day. Fluid passes into fetal blood and the waste products in it cross the placental membrane and enter the maternal blood. Excess water in fetal blood is excreted by the fetal kidneys and returned to the amniotic sac through the fetal urinary tract.
-Water content in amniotic fluid changes every 3 hours.
-Large volume of amniotic fluid moves in both directions between the fetal and maternal circulations, mainly through the placental membrane.

\section*{Functions of amniotic fluid}

1-It permits symmetrical external growth of the fetus.
2-Protective function:
a)It acts as a cushion against trauma.
b)It acts as a barrier against infection.

3-It permits normal fetal lung development.
4-It prevents adherence of amniotic membrane to the embryo and fetus.
5-It helps control embryo's- and fetus's body temperature.
6-It enables the fetus to move freely, thereby aiding muscular development in limbs.
7-It is involved in maintaining homeostasis of fetal fluid and electrolytes.
8-Prior to labour:
a)The hydrostatic bag of water helps dilatation of the cervix.
b)It pushes mucus plug known as the 'show'.
c)When it ruptures, the flowing amniotic fluid acts as a lubricant and a natural antiseptic of the birth canal.

\section*{Abnormalities of amnion}
A)Disorders of amniotic fluid volume:

1-Oligohydramnios. Volume of amniotic fluid is less than 400 ml in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ trimester. Causes
i-Placental insufficiency.
ii-Preterm rupture of amniochorionic membrane (due to trauma).
iii-Absence of fetal urine due to renal agenesis or obstructive uropathy.
Complications
i-Fetal abnormalities caused by compression of the uterine wall (pulmonary hypoplasia, limb defects and facial defects).
ii-Compression of the umbilical cord.
iii-Difficult dry labour.
2-Polyhydramnios. Amniotic fluid is more than 2000 ml .
Causes
i-Idiopathic (unknown cause) in 60\% of cases.
ii-Maternal factors in $20 \%$ of cases; maternal diabetes.
iii-Fetal causes in $20 \%$ of cases:
-Multiple pregnancy.
-Severe CNS anomalies; e.g. anencephaly.
-Fetus is unable to swallow amniotic fluid as in the case of esophageal atresia.

\section*{Complications}
i-Premature rupture of membranes which leads to premature labour.
ii-Abnormal fetal presentation.
B)Amniotic band syndrome

Tears in amnion results in amniotic bands that may encircle part of the fetus, particularly the limbs and digits. Amputations, ring constrictions, craniofacial and visceral defects may result. Amniotic band syndrome occurs in 1/1200 live births.

YOLK SAC

\section*{Definitin}

Yolk sac is a membranous sac enclosed by hypoblast cells.

\section*{Origin}

Hypoblast cells.

\section*{Development and fate}
-During the second week, hypoblast cells form the roof of a cavity called primary yolk sac.
-During the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, and due to folding part of the yolk sac is taken inside the embryo to form the gut. The remaining part is called definitive yol sac.
-By the $10^{\text {th }}$ week, yolk sac has shrunk to a pear-shaped remnant of 5 mm and is connected to the midgut by a narrow yolk stalk (vitelline duct).
-By the $20^{\text {th }}$ week, yolk sac atrophies becoming very small and usually not visible.

\section*{Significance of the yolk sac}

1-It has a role in transfer of nutrients to the embryo in early stages of development (during the $2^{\text {nd }}$ and $3^{\text {rd }}$ weeks).
2-Formation of primary (extraembryonic) mesoderm.
3-Blood development first occurs in the mesoderm covering the wall of the yolk sac.
4-During the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, endoderm of the yolk sac is incorporated into the embryo as the primordial gut. It gives rise to epithelium of the respiratory and digestive tracts.
5-Primordial germ cells appear in the endodermal lining of the wall of the yolk sac in the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week and migrate to the developing sex glands to differentiate into spermatogonia and oogonia.

\section*{ALLANTOIS}

\section*{Definition}
is a sausage shaped diverticulum derived from the caudal wall of the yolk sac.

\section*{Origin}

At day 16, a diverticulum appears from the caudal wall of the yolk sac that extends into the connecting stalk.

\section*{Development and fate of allantois}
-In human, allantois remains small and connected to the urinary bladder.
-As a result of folding of the embryo and expansion of the amniotic cavity, the proximal part of allantois is incorporated into the cloaca and the distal part forms one of the contents of the umbilical cord.
-At the end of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ month, allantois involutes to form a thick tube, - the urachus.
-After birth, the urachus becomes fibrous cord,- median umbilical ligament, that extends from the apex of the urinary bladder to the umbilicus.

\section*{Significance of allantois}
-Allantois is involved with early blood formation during the $3^{\text {rd }}$ to the $5^{\text {th }}$ weeks.
-Allantois is associated with development of the urinary bladder. It will form the median umbilical ligament.
-Allantois blood vessels persist as the umbilical vessels.

\section*{UMBILICAL CORD}

\section*{Definition}

A cord containing blood vessels which connects the fetus with the placenta.
Origin
The connecting stalk gives rise to the umbilical cord.

\section*{Development}
-As a result of folding, the connecting stalk moves to the ventral surface of the embryo. The region of attachment of amnion to the ventral surface of the embryo is reduced, and as amnion expands, the line of reflection between it and the ectoderm is oval and known as the primitive umbilical ring.

\section*{Contents of the umbilical cord}

Distally the umbilical cord contains the yolk stalk and umbilical vessels. More proximally, it contains intestinal loop, remnants of allantois, chorionic cavity and yolk sac. The amnion forms the epithelial covering of the umbilical cord. By the end of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ month, the intestinal loop is withdrawn and the coelomic (chorionic) cavity in the cord is obliterated. In addition, the allantois and vitelline duct with its vessels are obliterated. All that remains in the cord from the $4^{\text {th }}$ month until birth are the umbilical vessels surrounded by mucoid connective tissue, -Wharton's jelly.

\section*{Gross picture of the umbilical cord}

At term the average length of the cord is 55 cm (ranges from 30 to 90 cm ). Its diameter is 1 to 2 cm . Because the umbilical vessels are longer than the cord, twisting, bending and false knots are common. False knots are of no significance. The cord attaches near the center of the fetal surface of the placenta. After delivery of the baby the cord is tied off 5 cm from the umbilicus to avoid injury to a non-reduced intestinal loop. The umbilical arteries constrict and eventually become medial umbilical ligaments. The umbilical vein obliterates and become ligamentum teres of the liver. In some cases, the umbilical vessels are used to withdraw blood sample for analysis or to inject drugs or blood transfusion.

\section*{Abnormalities of the umbilical cord}

1-Abnormally long cord (up to 150 cm ).

\section*{Complications}
a)It predisposes to formation of true knots. True knots occur in $1 \%$ of pregnancies and may tighten and cause fetal death from anoxia.
b) It predisposes to looping around a limb or the neck with rare fetal risk.
c)Tendency to prolapse, the cord may be compressed between the presenting part of the fetus and the mother's pelvis causing fetal anoxia. If deficiency of oxygen persists for more than 5 minutes, the baby's brain may be damaged, producing.
2-Abnormally short cord ( 15 cm or less).

\section*{Complications}
a)Premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall during delivery.
b)It may result in difficult labour.

3-Abnormal attachment to the placenta.
a)Battledore placenta: insertion of the cord at the margin of the placenta.
b)Placenta velamentosa: umbilical cord is attached outside the placenta.

4-Persistence of umbilical hernia.

\section*{PLACENTA}

\section*{Definition}

The placenta is the fetal membrane that carries out nutrition, respiration and excretion of the embryo and fetus.

\section*{Origin of the placenta}

The placenta has two components of origin:
-A fetal part that develops from the chorionic sac called chorion frondosum.
-A maternal part that is derived from the endometrium called decidua basalis.
As pregnancy advances, villi on the embryonic pole grow and expand giving rise to bushy chorion or chorion frondosum. Villi on the abembryonic pole degenerate and by the third month this side is smooth and is known as chorion laeve.

The decidua is the functional layer of the endometrium of the pregnant uterus. Decidua over the chorion frondosum, - decidua basalis -, consists of compact layer of large cells, decidual cells, with abundant amounts of lipids and glycogen. The decidual layer over the abembryonic pole is known as decidua capsularis. The rest of the uterine cavity is lined with decidua parietalis. With increase in size of the chorionic vesicle, decidua capsularis becomes stretched and degenerates. Subsequently, chorion laeve comes into contact with decidua parietalis and the two fuse, thereby obliterating the uterine lumen. Hence, the only portion of the chorion participating in the exchange process is the chorion frondosum, which, together with the decidua basalis make up the placenta. Similarly, fusion of the amnion and chorion to form the amniochorionic membrane obliterates the chorionic cavity. It is this membrane that ruptures during labor (breaking of water).

\section*{Development of the placenta}
-During the 2nd week, the syncytial lacunae form the primordial of the intervillous spaces of the placenta. The fluid in the lacunar spaces - embryotrph - passes to the embryonic disc by diffusion and provides nutritive material to the embryo. The communication of the eroded endometrial capillaries with the syncytial lacunae establishes the primordial uteroplacental circulation as early as day 12 . When maternal blood flows into the lacunae, oxygen and nutritive substances are available to the embryo.
-During the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week, capillaries appear in the chorionic villi and they become tertiary villi. Capillaries in these villi fuse to form arteriocapillary networks which soon become connected to embryonic heart through vessels that differentiate in mesenchyme of chorion and connecting stalk. By the end of the $3^{\text {rd }}$ week, embryonic
blood flows slowly through capillaries in the chorionic villi. Oxygen and nutrients in intervillous spaces continue to diffuse through the wall of the villi and enter embryonic blood. Carbon dioxide and waste products diffuse from blood in chorionic capillaries through the wall of the villi into maternal blood. Spiral arteries discharge blood into the intervillous spaces.
-By the end of the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, complex vascular network is established in the placenta which facilitates maternal-embryonic exchanges of gases, nutrients and waste products.
-By the beginning of the $4^{\text {th }}$ month, most of the cytotrophoblast cells have degenerated..
-During the $4{ }^{\text {th }}$ month, as chorionic villi invade the decidua basalis, decidual tissue is eroded to enlarge the intervillous spaces. This erosion produces several wedgeshaped septa, - decidual septa (placental septa) -The decidual septa divide the placenta into irregular convex compartments, -cotyledons- (15 to 20 cotyledons). There is free communication between the placental compartments. Each cotyledon consists of 2 or more stem villi and their many branch villi.
-The placenta is fully formed by the end of the $4^{\text {th }}$ month. The placenta enlarges as the fetus grows. Growth in size and thickness of the placenta continues rapidly until the end of the $5^{\text {th }}$ month of gestation. The fully developed placenta covers 15 to $30 \%$ of the decidua and weighs about one-sixth that of the fetus.

\section*{Full-Term Placenta}

At full term, the placenta has a discoid cake shape, a diameter of $15-25 \mathrm{~cm}$, is 3 cm thick, and has a weight of $500-600 \mathrm{gm}$. At birth, it is torn from the uterine wall, and 30 minutes after birth of the baby, is expelled from the uterine cavity. Viewed from the maternal side, slightly bulging areas, the cotyledons, covered by thin layer of decidua basalis are recognized. Grooves between cotyledons are formed by decidual septa. Much of the decidua remains temporarily in the uterus and is expelled with subsequent uterine bleeds. The fetal surface of the placenta is covered entirely by the chorionic plate. A number of large arteries and veins, the chorionic vessels, converge toward the umbilical cord. The chorion, in turn, is covered by the amnion which give the fetal surface smooth and shiny appearance. Attachment of the umbilical cord to the placenta is usually eccentric and occasionally even marginal.

\section*{Placental Circulation}

It is through the numerous branch villi that the main exchange of material between the mother and the fetus takes place. Circulations of the mother and fetus are separated by placental membrane (barrier). Up to the $4^{\text {th }}$ month the placental membrane is formed of:
1-Syncytiotrophoblast.
2-Cytotrophoblast.
3-Connective tissue (mesoderm) of the villous.
4-Endothelium of the fetal capillaries.
From the $4^{\text {th }}$ month on, the placental membrane becomes much thinner, thus increasing the rate of exchange. It is formed of:
1-Syncytiotrophoblast.

2-Endothelium of fetal capillaries.
The placental membrane is not an actual barrier because there are only few substances that are unable to pass through it. It acts as a barrier for large size molecules and molecules with certain charge such as heparin and some bacteria.

\section*{Functions of Placenta}

The main functions of the placenta are:
1-Transport of gaseous and metabolic products between maternal and fetal blood.
2-Metabolism, e.g., synthesis of glycogen, cholesterol and fatty acids.
3-Production of hormones.

\section*{1-Placental Transfer}

Materials are transported across the placental membrane by one of the following mechanisms:
a)Simple diffusion; substances are moving from areas of higher to lower concentrations until equilibrium is established, e.g., gases, water, glucose, fatty acids, urea, uric acid, and most of the drugs. Vitamins cross the placental membrane and are essential for normal development. Most maternal hormones do not cross the placenta. Unconjugated steroid hormones cross the placental membrane rather freely. Testesterone and synthetic progestins cross the placental membrane and may cause masculinization of female fetuses. Synthetic estrogen crosses the placenta easily and may produce congenital anomalies of the genital system. Infectious agents, e.g., many viruses and some bacteria cross the placenta without difficulty. Viruses such as rubella, variola, varicella, measles, poliomyelitis, HIV, and cytomegalovirus traverse the placenta without difficulty and can cause infections or congenital abnormalities.
b)Facilitated diffusion; there is transport through electrical charges, e.g., electrolytes. c)Active transport against a concentration gradient requires energy, e.g. aminoacids. d)Pinocytosis or endocytosis is engulfment of larger molecules, e.g., immunoglobulins and some proteins. Maternal antibodies are taken up by pinocytosis by the syncytiotrophoblast and transported to fetal blood. In this manner, the fetus acquires maternal immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) against various infectious diseases and obtains passive immunity against diphtheria, small pox, measles and others but not against chickenpox and whooping cough. Passive immunity is important because the fetus has little capacity to produce its own antibodies until birth. Protein hormones do not reach the fetus in significant amounts, except for slow transfer of thyroxine.
e)Other mechanisms:
i-Red blood cells pass into fetal or maternal circulations through microscopic breaks in the placental membrane. If the fetus is Rh-positive and the mother is Rhnegative, fetal red blood cells invading the maternal blood may elicit an antibody response in the mother. Maternal antibodies against fetal antigens then return to the fetus and cause breakdown of red blood cells, known as erythroblastosis fetalis or hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), which may cause intrauterine death, unless fetuses of HDN are delivered early or given transfusions of packed Rhnegative blood cells. Rh immunoglobulin given to the mother prevents the disease.
ii-Cells cross placental membrane under their own power; e.g., maternal leukocytes and treponema pallidum (organism which cause syphilis).
iii-Some bacteria and protozoa such as toxoplasma gondii infect the placenta by creating lesions and then cross the placental membrane.

\section*{2-Metabolism}

The placenta synthesizes glycogen, cholesterol and fatty acids, which serve as sources of nutrients and energy for the fetus.

\section*{3-Endocrine Function}

The syncytiotrophoblast synthesizes protein and steroid hormones.
A)Protein hormones:

1-Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone similar in effect to lutinizing hormone. It is first secreted during the $2^{\text {nd }}$ week. hCG maintains the corpus luteum, preventing the onset of menstrual periods. Its concentraction increases to a maximum by the $8^{\text {th }}$ week and then declines.
2-Human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS), or placental lactogen (hPL) is a growth hormone-like substance that gives the fetus priority on maternal blood glucose and makes the mother somewhat diabetogenic.
3-Human chorionic thyrotropin (hCT).
4-Human chorionic corticotropin (hCACTH).
B)Steroid hormones:

1-Progesterone is essential for maintenance of pregnancy. The placenta forms progesterone from maternal cholesterol.
2-Estrogens are produced in large quantities. Estrogens stimulate uterine growth and development of the mammary glands.

\section*{Placental Abnormalities}

\section*{A) Variations in shape and size}

1-When villi persist on the entire surface of the chorionic sac, a thin layer of the placenta (membranous placenta) attaches to a large area of the uterus. This type of the placenta is called diffuse placenta or placenta membranacea.
2-When villi persist elsewhere, several variations in shape may result:
i-Placenta with two or three lobes; placenta bipartita (bidiscoid) or placenta tripartita.
ii-Placenta has two or three separate lobes; placenta duplex or placenta triplex.
iii-Placenta has small accessory lobe(s); placenta succenturiata.
iv-Failure of placenta to develop over a small area; placenta fenestrata.
v-Placenta with central depression; placenta circumvallata.
B) Abnormal insertion of the umbilical cord

1-Marginal insertion of the cord; battledore placenta.
2-Umbilical cord attaches to membranes outside the placenta; placenta velamentosa.
C) Abnormal site of implantation of the blastocyst close to or overlying the internal os, the abnormality is called placenta previa (fig.8.8). It has varieties:
i-Implantation in the lateral uterine wall; placenta previa lateralis.
ii-Implantation approaching internal os; placenta previa marginalis.
iii-Implantation overlying internal os; placenta previa centralis.
Late pregnancy bleeding may result from placenta previa. The fetus has to be delivered by Cesarean section when the placenta completely obstructs the internal os.
D) Abnormal adherence of the chorionic villi to the uterine wall

1-Chorionic villi adhere to myometrium; placenta accreta (placenta increta).
2-Chorionic villi penetrate the full thickness of the myometrium to the perimetrium (peritoneal covering); placenta pancreta (placenta percreta).
Third trimester bleeding is the common presenting sign of these anomalies. Most patients with placenta accreta have normal pregnancy and labour. After birth the placenta fails to separate from the uterine wall, and attempts to remove it may cause hemorrhage that is difficult to control. Most of these cases end with hysterectomy.
E) Abnormal proliferation of trophoblast may result in vesicular moles or choriocarcinoma. In chriocarcinoma the cells invade the decidua basalis, penetrate its blood vessels and lymphstics and may spread to lungs, bone marrow, liver and other organs. This tumour is sensitive to chemotherapy and cure is usually achieved.
F) Placental insufficiency: degenerative changes in the placenta that progressively reduce the oxygen supply and nourishment of the fetus.
G) Abruptio placentae: premature detachment of the placenta during pregnancy rather than after delivery. Detachment may be complete or incomplete. It occurs in about $1 \%$ of pregnancies and the cause is unknown (hypertensive, diabetic and cocaine addicts are more likely to develop abruptio placenta). It carries risk of serious blood loss of the mother and risk of death of the fetus.

\section*{Parturition (labour)}

Labour is the sequence of uterine contractions that result in dilatation of the cervix and expulsion of the fetus and placenta.

\section*{Factors which trigger labour}
-It seems that the duration of pregnancy and the process of labour are under direct control of the fetus. It is the fetal hypothalamus that initiates the birth process.

\section*{Stages of labour}

\section*{1-Dilatation of the cervix}

Dilatation of the cervix starts when regular uterine contractions occur less than 10 minutes apart. It is the most time consuming stage of labour. It takes 12 hours in nulliparous and 7 hours in multiparous.

\section*{2-Expulsion of the baby}

The fetus descends through the cervix and vagina to the outside. Duration of the second stage varies ( 50 minutes in primigravidas and 20 minutes in multigravidas).

\section*{3-Placental stage}

Uterine contractions begin again shortly after partiurition. Retraction of the uterus reduces the area of placental attachment. A hematoma forms deep to the placenta and separates it from the uterine wall. The placenta and fetal membranes are expelled. The duration of the third stage of labour is 15 minutes.

\section*{4-Recovery}

Myometrial contractions constrict the spiral arteries preventing excessive bleeding. Duration of the fourth stage of labour is 2 hours.

\section*{CHAPTER 9}

\section*{MULTIPLE PREGNANCY (TWINNING)}

Definition: Multiple pregnancy is conception of more than one baby at the same time.
Incidence: Twins occur once in every 90 pregnancies. Triplets is once in 90 X 90 pregnancies, quadruplets once in 90 X 90 X 90 , and quintuplets once in 90 X 90 X 90 X 90 pregnancies. About $2 / 3$ of twins are dizygotic twins (DZ) and $1 / 3$ are monozygotic twins (MZ).

\section*{Contributing factors}

1-Hereditary factors, there is tendency of DZ twins to repeat in families.
2-Previous multiple pregnancy, repetition of multiple birth is about 5 times more likely to occur at the next pregnancy than in the general population.
3-Taller and older mothers have greater chance to have twins, especially DZ twins.
4-Use of gonadotropin hormones increases the incidence of multiple pregnancy.
5-Use of in vitro fertilization increases chances for multiple pregnancy.

\section*{Types of twins}

Twins either originate from the same zygote, - monozygotic (MZ) identical twins-, or originating from two zygotes, - dizygotic (DZ) fraternal twins.

\section*{Risks of multiple pregnancy}

Multiple pregnancy carries risk for the babies and for the mother.
A)Risks for the babies:
i-Perinatal mortality and morbidity: 10-20\% of twins die compared with only $2 \%$ of infants from single pregnancy. Contractions of the uterus after the first twin is delivered shear the placenta away of the second twin. As a result, the second twin tends to have more problems and higher risk of damage and death.
ii-Low birth weight and prematurity.
B)Risks for the mother:
i-Abnormal presentation.
ii-Premature labour and bleeding: Twins tend to stretch the uterus and overstretched uterus tend to start contracting before pregnancy reaches full term. As a result, twins are usually born prematurely. Overstretched uterus does not contract well after delivery causing bleeding in the mother.

\section*{Monozygotic Twins}

\section*{Features}

Monozygotic twins have identical genetic background. They have physical and mental similarities. They are of the same sex, same blood group, same finger prints, and the same external appearance such as hair and eye color.

\section*{Complications of MZ twins}

\section*{1-Intrauterine death.}

2-Conjoined (Siamese) twins: occurs in 1/50,000-1/100,000 pregnancies. Conjoined twins are due to incomplete splitting of the axial area of the germ disc. Conjoined twins may be connected to each other by a common skin bridge or by a common liver bridge. According to the nature and degree of union, they are classified as thoracopagus (joined at the thorax), pygopagus (joined at the pelvis) and craniopagus (joined at the head). Conjoined twins can be separated; however in most conjoined twins anatomical relations do not permit surgical separation.

\section*{Dizygotic Twins}

Dizygotic twins occur when there is shedding of two ova at nearly the same time at one ovarian cycle and the two ova are fertilized by two different sperms. The two ova may come from one or two ovaries.

\section*{Features of DZ twins}

DZ twins have different genetic background and are not alike. They may or may not be of the same sex.

\section*{Complications of DZ twins}
-Erythrocyte mosaicism: Anastomoses of blood vessels of the fused placentas of DZ twins results in erythrocyte mosaicism. Members of the DZ twins have red blood cells of two different types because red cells were exchanged between the circulations of the twins.

\section*{Other types of multiple births}
A)Triplets may be derived from:
-One zygote.
-Two zygotes, identical twins and a singleton.
-Three zygotes (non-identical) of the same or different sex.
Similar combinations occur in quadruplets, quintuplets, sextuplets, and septuplets.
B)Superfecundation (superfetation) is the fertilization of two or more oocytes at different times. It is very rare in human.

\section*{CONGENITAL MALFORMATION}

\section*{Definitions}

Congenital anomalies or birth defects are structural or functional disorders present at birth. Anomalies may be minor or major microscopic or macroscopic.
Teratology is the science which studies the causes, mechanisms and patterns of abnormal development.

\section*{Incidence}
-Single minor defects (small ears or pigments) are present in 15\% of newborns.
-Major anomalies are present in $3 \%$ of newborns. Additional anomalies are detected after birth, $6 \%$ in 2-year, 8\% in 5-year and another 2\% are detected later in life.
-Multiple minor anomalies have a $90 \%$ chance to have one or more associated major anomaly.
-Birth defects are the leading causes of infant mortality, accounting for $20 \%$ of all infant deaths.
-Major anomalies are more common in early embryos (15\%). However most severely malformed embryos are spontaneously aborted during the first 8 weeks. Chromosomal abnormalities are present in $50 \%$ of spontaneously aborted conceptuses.

\section*{Causes of congenital anomalies}
-Unknown causes in $50 \%$ of cases.
-Environmental causes form 10\% of cases.
-Gene mutation in $8 \%$ of cases.
-Chromosomal aberration in $7 \%$ of case.
-Multifactorial (combination of genetic and environmental factors) in $25 \%$ of cases.
