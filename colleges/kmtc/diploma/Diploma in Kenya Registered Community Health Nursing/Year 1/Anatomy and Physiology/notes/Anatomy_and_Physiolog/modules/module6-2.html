                    <p>Sensory input gathered by the sensory (afferent) division of the PNS is further divided into the <b>somatic</b> and <b>visceral</b> sensory divisions.</p>
                    <p><b>Somatic sensory division</b>: Consists of neurons that carry signals from skeletal muscles, bones, joints, and skin. It also includes special sensory signals from the organs of vision, hearing, taste, smell, and balance (sometimes called the special sensory division).</p>
                    <p><b>Visceral sensory division</b>: Consists of neurons that transmit signals from viscera (organs) such as the heart, lungs, stomach, kidneys, and urinary bladder.</p>
                    <p>Sensory input from both divisions is carried from sensory receptors to the spinal cord and/or brain by spinal and cranial nerves.</p>
                    <p><b>Integrative functions</b>: The nervous system analyzes and interprets incoming sensory information and determines an appropriate response.</p>
                    <p><b>Motor functions</b>: Actions performed in response to the integrative functions. Motor output is performed by the motor (efferent) division of the PNS, which is further subdivided into the somatic and autonomic divisions.</p>

                    <p><b>Neurons</b> are excitable cells responsible for sending and receiving signals in the form of action potentials.</p>
                    <p><b>Cell body (soma)</b>: The most metabolically active region of the neuron. It manufactures all the proteins needed for the neuron and contains many organelles.</p>
                    <p><b>Dendrites</b>: Short, branched processes that receive input from other neurons, which they transmit to the cell body in the form of electrical impulses.</p>
                    <p><b>Axon</b>: Each neuron has only one axon (nerve fiber) that can generate and conduct action potentials. The region where the axon originates from the cell body is the <b>axon hillock</b>. The axon may split into multiple branches called <b>telodendria</b>, which end in <b>axon terminals</b>. Axon terminals contain <b>synaptic bulbs</b>.</p>
                    <p>The neuron has three main functional regions: <b>receptive</b> (dendrites and cell body), <b>conducting</b> (axon), and <b>secretory</b> (axon terminal).</p>
                    <p>Neurons can be classified based on their structure:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Multipolar</b>: Single axon, multiple dendrites (99% of neurons in the brain and spinal cord).</li>
                        <li><b>Bipolar</b>: One axon, one dendrite, with a cell body between them (found in the eye, ear, and olfactory epithelium).</li>
                        <li><b>Pseudounipolar</b>: One fused axon that extends from the cell body and divides into two processes. These are sensory neurons that carry information about pain, touch, and pressure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Neurons can also be classified based on their function:</p>

                        <li><b>Sensory (afferent) neurons</b>: Carry information into the CNS.</li>
                        <li><b>Interneurons</b>: Relay information within the CNS between sensory and motor neurons.</li>
                        <li><b>Motor (efferent) neurons</b>: Carry information away from the CNS to muscles and glands.</li>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>Neuroglia</b> provide structural support and protection for neurons. They also maintain the environment around neurons. Astrocytes control calcium (important for learning and memory). Oligodendrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells reside within the CNS, while Schwann cells and satellite cells reside in the PNS.</p>
                    <p><b>Myelination</b>: Occurs when neuroglial cells wrap multiple layers of membrane around an axon. The gaps in the myelin sheath are called <b>nodes of Ranvier</b>. Myelination speeds up action potential conduction (15-20x faster).</p>
                    <p><b>White matter</b>: Composed of myelinated axons. It acts as a highway for action potentials.</p>
                    <p><b>Gray matter</b>: Composed of unmyelinated dendrites and axons. It is involved in reflexes and information processing (memory).</p>
                    <p><b>Regeneration of nervous tissue</b>: Regeneration (replacement of damaged tissue) is nearly nonexistent in the CNS and is limited in the PNS. Neural tissue can regenerate only if the cell body remains intact.</p>
