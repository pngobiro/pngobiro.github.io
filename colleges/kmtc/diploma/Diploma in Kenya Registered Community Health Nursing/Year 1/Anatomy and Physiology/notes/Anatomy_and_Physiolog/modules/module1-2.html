                    <p>Living organisms share distinct properties:</p>
                    <p><b>Cellular Composition</b>: Cells are the basic units of life. The smallest unit that can carry out the functions of life. All organisms are composed of cells.</p>
                    <p><b>Metabolism</b>: Chemicals are substances with unique molecular composition; used in or produced by chemical reactions. Living organisms carry out chemical reactions collectively known as metabolism. Metabolic processes either build up or break down substances depending on the needs of the organism.</p>
                    <p><b>Growth</b>: Building outweighs breaking down processes. Growth can occur in two forms: an increase in the size of individual cells or an increase in the number of cells.</p>
                    <p><b>Excretion</b>: Elimination of potentially harmful waste products created by metabolic processes.</p>
                    <p><b>Responsiveness or Irritability</b>: Sensing and reacting to changes or stimuli in the environment.</p>
                    <p><b>Movement</b>: Movement can occur at various levels, including the movement of the entire organism, individual cells, or materials within cells.</p>
                    <p><b>Reproduction</b>: Reproduction occurs in two forms: individual cells reproduce during growth and to replace damaged or old cells, and the organism itself reproduces to yield similar offspring.</p>

                    <p><b>Chemical Level</b>: The smallest level; the foundation for each successive level. It ranges from tiny atoms to complex chemical structures (molecules) composed of thousands of atoms. (e.g., phospholipid molecule).</p>
                    <p><b>Cellular Level</b>: Groups of many different types of molecules combined in specific ways to form cellular structures (e.g., squamous epithelial cell). </p>
                    <p><b>Tissue Level</b>: Two or more cell types cooperate to perform a common function. Tissues consist of two components: cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix.</p>
                    <p><b>Organ Level</b>: Two or more tissue types combined to form an organ. Organs have a recognizable shape and perform specialized tasks (e.g., esophagus).</p>
                    <p><b>Organ System Level</b>: Organs grouped into organ systems. Two or more organs work together to carry out a broad function in the body.</p>
                    <p><b>Organism Level</b>: Organ systems function together to make up a working human body, which is an organism.</p>
