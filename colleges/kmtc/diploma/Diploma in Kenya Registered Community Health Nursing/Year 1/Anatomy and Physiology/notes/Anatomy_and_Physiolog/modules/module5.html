                    <p><b>Lipids</b>: A group of nonpolar, hydrophobic molecules composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen. They include fats and oils.</p>
                    <p><b>Fatty acids</b>: The basic lipid monomers consisting of 4 to 20 carbon atoms. They may have none, one, or more double bonds between carbons in the hydrocarbon chain.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Saturated fatty acids</b>: Solid at room temperature, have no double bonds between carbon atoms. The carbons are "saturated" with the maximum number of hydrogen atoms.</li>
                        <li><b>Monounsaturated fatty acids</b>: Generally liquid at room temperature, have one double bond between two carbons in the hydrocarbon chain.</li>
                        <li><b>Polyunsaturated fatty acids</b>: Liquid at room temperature, have two or more separate double bonds between carbons in the hydrocarbon chain.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Triglycerides</b>: Three fatty acids linked by dehydration synthesis to a modified 3-carbon carbohydrate, glycerol. They are the storage polymer for fatty acids (neutral fat).</p>
                    <p><b>Phospholipids</b>: Composed of a glycerol backbone, two fatty acid "tails," and one phosphate group "head" in place of the third fatty acid. A molecule with a polar group (the phosphate head) and a nonpolar group (the fatty acid tails) is called <b>amphiphilic</b>.</p>
                    <p><b>Steroids</b>: Nonpolar molecules that share a four-ring hydrocarbon structure called the steroid nucleus. <b>Cholesterol</b> is the steroid that forms the basis for all other steroids in the body.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p><b>Cell Metabolism</b>: The sum of all chemical reactions that a cell carries out. It includes anabolic, catabolic, and oxidation-reduction reactions.</p>
                    <p><b>Transport of substances</b>: Substances the cell has produced or ingested are carried to a variety of destinations.</p>
                    <p><b>Communication</b>: Occurs between the cell and itself, its surrounding environment, and other cells (chemical and electrical signals).</p>
                    <p><b>Cell Reproduction</b>: By cell division, a process necessary for growth and development and the replacement of old and damaged cells.</p>
                    <p>Animal cells have three basic components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Plasma membrane</b>: Surrounds each cell, isolating its internal structures and processes from the external environment.</li>
                        <li><b>Cytoplasm</b>: Consists of both the fluid <b>cytosol</b> (intracellular fluid, ICF) and the <b>organelles</b> and <b>cytoskeleton</b> embedded within it. Cytosol is mainly water with dissolved solutes, inclusions (storage molecules), and proteins. It is the site of many important chemical reactions. Organelles are a variety of cellular machines with very specific functions. The cytoskeleton is a network of protein filaments that supports the cell by creating and maintaining its shape, holding organelles in place, and providing a means of transportation for substances within the cell.</li>
                        <li><b>Nucleus</b>: A roughly spherical organelle enclosed in a phospholipid bilayer (nuclear envelope). It contains most of the cell's DNA and is the primary location for making RNA.</li>

                    <p>Functions of the plasma membrane include providing structural support, a means of communication with surrounding cells, and cell identification.</p>
                    <p>The plasma membrane defines the intracellular space (contains intracellular fluid, ICF, or cytosol) and separates it from the extracellular space (contains extracellular fluid, ECF).</p>
                    <p>The <b>phospholipid bilayer</b>: In order for the plasma membrane to form an effective barrier between the ECF and the cytosol, the molecules making up the membrane must interact with water in both fluid compartments without falling apart and must repel water, keeping the ECF and cytosol separated. The phospholipid bilayer has a hydrophilic, polar phosphate head and hydrophobic, nonpolar fatty acid tails.</p>
                    <p><b>Fluid Mosaic Model</b>: The plasma membrane is a dynamic, fluid structure with multiple components. Some components have the ability to move within the bilayer as the phospholipids move themselves.</p>
                    <p><b>Membrane proteins</b> are a main component of the plasma membrane:</p>
