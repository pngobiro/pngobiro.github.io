           <h3>üìö The Femur</h3>
            <p>The femur is the bone of the thigh and the longest bone in the body, it can be divided into three regions; proximal region, shaft and distal region.</p>
            <p><strong>The Proximal region of the femur:</strong></p>
            <p>The proximal aspect of the femur consists of a head and neck, the greater and lesser trochanters, with two bony ridges connecting the two trochanters; the intertrochanteric line anteriorly and the trochanteric crest posteriorly.</p>
            <p><strong>The Head of the femur</strong> is the rounded, proximal end of the femur, it has a smooth surface and covered with articular cartilage, it articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone to form the hip joint.</p>
            <p><strong>The Neck of the femur</strong> is the cylindrical narrowed region below the head; it connects the head of the femur with the shaft. It is set at an angle of approximately 135 degrees to the shaft. This angle of projection allows for an increased range of movement at the hip joint.</p>
            <p><strong>The Greater trochanter</strong> is an upward, bony projection extending from the base of the neck, it is the most palpable bony projection on the lateral side of the upper thigh.</p>
            <p><strong>The Lesser trochanter</strong> is a small, bony projection extending from the posteromedial aspect of the inferior part of the neck of the femur.</p>
            <p><strong>The Intertrochanteric line</strong> is a bony ridge extends between the two trochanters in an inferomedial direction on the anterior surface of the femur. It serves as the anterior attachment of the hip joint capsule.</p>
            <p><strong>The Intertrochanteric crest</strong> is a bony ridge located on the posterior surface of the femur, it connects the two trochanters (Figure 12.2).</p>
            <p><strong>The Shaft of the femur:</strong></p>
            <p>The shaft of the femur is cylindrical in the middle with posterior flattening and widening in the proximal and distal ends, as it descends the femoral shaft has a slight medial bowing, which brings the knees closer to the body‚Äôs centre of gravity, increasing stability. The linea aspera (Latin for rough line) are roughened ridges on the posterior surface of the shaft of the femur, they are made up of medial and lateral lips, the medial lip originates near the lesser trochanter as the pectineal line, and the lateral lip arises from the greater trochanter as the gluteal tuberosity, the two ridges split inferiorly to form the medial and lateral supracondylar lines, the popliteal surface is a triangular space lies between these two lines (Figure 12.2).</p>
             <p><strong>The Distal region of the femur:</strong></p>
            <p>The distal region of the femur, which articulates with the tibia and patella at the knee joint, is made up of the medial and lateral condyles, the intercondylar fossa, and the patellar surface.</p>
            <p><strong>The Medial and Lateral condyles:</strong> are rounded areas at the end of the femur, they articulate with the tibia and menisci of the knee on the posterior and inferior surfaces, while they articulate with the patella on the anterior surface. The lateral condyle is larger and more prominent than the medial condyle; the prominence of the lateral condyle prevents the lateral dislocation of the patella, while the flatter and smaller medial condyle may result in medial dislocation of the patella. The medial and lateral condyles are connected anteriorly, while they are separated posteriorly by <strong>the Intercondylar fossa.</strong> The medial wall of the intercondylar fossa serve as the point of attachment for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), while the lateral wall of the intercondylar fossa serve as the point of attachment for the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).</p>
            <p><strong>The Medial and lateral epicondyles:</strong> are bony elevations on the outer sides of the condyles, they provide attachment for muscles and supporting ligaments of the knee joint. The medial epicondyle: is located on the outer medial side of the medial condyle, while the lateral epicondyle is located on the outer lateral side of the lateral condyle. The medial epicondyle is the larger than the lateral epicondyle, there is a small bony prominence at the superior margin of the medial epicondyle known as <strong>the adductor tubercle</strong> (Figure 12.3).</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                 <p><strong>The Patella</strong></p>
                <p>The patella (also known as the kneecap) is largest sesamoid bone of the body that, it is thick and flat with triangular shape with its apex pointing downwards and the base upwards. It lies in front of the knee joint within the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which originates from the anterior thigh and passes across the anterior knee to attach to the tibia. The patella articulates with the patellar surface of the femur and thus prevents rubbing of the quadriceps femoris muscle tendon against the distal femur to protect the knee joint from damage. The patella also lifts the tendon away from the knee joint, which increases the leverage power of the quadriceps femoris muscle as it acts across the knee. The patella does not articulate with the tibia. The patellar ligament rises from the apex of the patella and inserts onto the tibial tuberosity on the anterior surface of the tibia (Figure 12.4).</p>
                <p><strong>Functions of the Patella:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint from damage.</li>
                    <li>It prevents rubbing of the quadriceps femoris muscle tendon against the distal femur.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The posterior surface of the patella articulates with the femur, and is marked by two facets:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Medial facet:</strong> articulates with the medial condyle of the femur.</li>
                <li><strong>Lateral facet:</strong> articulates with the lateral condyle of the femur.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p><strong>The proximal end of tibia</strong> has several important landmarks which act as articular surfaces and sites of muscle attachment, <strong>the medial and lateral tibial condyles</strong> are two expanded eminences at the proximal tibia, these two condyles have smooth superior articular surfaces known as <strong>the medial and lateral facets,</strong> the medial facet is oval in shape with slight concavity from side to side, and from front to backward, the lateral facet is nearly circular with concavity from side to side and slight convexity from front to backward. The central portions of the medial and lateral facets articulate with the condyles of the femur, while their peripheral portions support the menisci of the knee joint. There is a bony eminence between the medial and lateral facets known as <strong>the intercondyloid eminence (spine of tibia),</strong> it is the site for attachment of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci. The anterior surfaces of the condyles are continuous with one another, forming a large flattened triangular area; this area ends</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>inferiorly in a bony elevation known as <strong>the tibial tuberosity,</strong> which gives attachment to the patellar ligament. the condyles are separated posteriorly by a shallow depression known as <strong>the posterior intercondyloid fossa,</strong> which gives attachment to part of the posterior cruciate ligament. The medial surface of the medial condyle is prominent and convex; it gives attachment to the tibial collateral ligament. On the posterolateral surface of the lateral condyle there is flat facet directed downward and backward, for articulation with the head of the fibula (Figures 12.7 & 12.8).</p>
                    <p><strong>The Shaft of the tibia</strong> has three borders: the anterior, medial and lateral borders and it has three surfaces: the medial, lateral and posterior surfaces.</p>
                    <p><strong>The anterior border</strong> (also known as the anterior crest) it is the most prominent border, it commences superiorly at the tibial tuberosity, and ends inferiorly at the anterior margin of the medial malleolus. The upper two-thirds of anterior crest is prominent and its lower third is smooth and rounded below; it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg.</p>
                    <p><strong>The medial border</strong> is smooth and rounded at its superior and inferior ends, with prominent central portion; it begins proximally at the posterior part of the medial condyle, and ends distally at the posterior border of the medial malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the tibial collateral ligament of the knee-joint.</p>
                    <p><strong>The lateral border</strong> (also known as the interosseous crest) it begins proximally in front of the articular facet of the fibula, and bifurcates distally to form the boundaries of a triangular surface, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament that connects the tibia and fibula.</p>
                    <p><strong>The medial surface</strong> is subcutaneous along the entire length of its anteromedial aspect, it is smooth, convex surface, and broader superiorly than inferiorly.</p>
                    <p><strong>The lateral surface</strong> is narrower than the medial surface; there is a shallow groove on the upper two-thirds of the lateral surface for the origin of the Tibialis anterior muscle; which covers the lower third of the lateral surface by its tendons.</p>
                    <p><strong>The posterior surface</strong> it is characterized by a smooth triangular area, on its upper third, this triangular are gives insertion to the Popliteus muscle. There is prominent ridge, below this triangular area, known as <strong>the Soleal line,</strong> which extends obliquely downward from the posterior part of the articular facet for the fibula to the medial border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds; it marks the lower limit of the insertion of the Popliteus muscle, and gives origin to part of the Soleus muscle.</p>
                    <p><strong>The distal end of the tibia</strong> is wide to assist with stabilization and weight-bearing. There is strong pyramidal process extends from the medial surface of the distal end of the tibia, known as <strong>the medial malleolus.</strong> It articulates with the tarsal bones to form part of the ankle joint. There is a triangular rough depression on the lateral surface of the distal end of the tibia act as attachment site for the inferior interosseous ligament which connects the tibia to the fibula. The inferior surface of the distal end of the tibia is smooth and articulates with the talus (Figures 12.7 & 12.8). </p>

                     <p><strong>The Fibula</strong></p>
                    <p>The fibula (fibula is Latin for ‚Äúbrooch‚Äù or ‚Äúpin‚Äù) is located lateral to the tibia, with which it is connected proximally and distally. The fibula serves more as an attachment point for muscles rather than a weight-bearing bone, it is the smaller of the two bones of leg, and it is the most slender of all the long bones. The proximal end of the fibula is small, lies toward the posterior portion of the head of the tibia, inferior to the level of the knee-joint and it does not form part of the knee . The distal end of the fibula inclines forward minimally, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the proximal end; the distal end projects below the tibia, to forms the lateral part of the ankle-joint. The fibula can be divided into three main portions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Proximal end of fibula.</li>
                        <li>Shaft of fibula.</li>
                        <li>Distal end of fibula.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Proximal end of fibula</strong> provides an attachment point for the supporting ligaments of the knee joint. It is composed of an irregular quadrate shaped head and a short neck, there is a flat rounded area on the medial surface of the head of the fibula known as a <strong>facet,</strong> it articulates with a complementary facet on the inferolateral surface of the lateral tibial condyle to form the proximal tibiofibular joint. There is an apical projection protrudes from the posterolateral part of the head of the fibula known as <strong>the styloid process of the fibula.</strong> The neck of the fibula is a short bare region lies inferior to the head of the fibula. It provides passage for the common fibular nerve which travels posterolaterally.</p>
                    <p><strong>The shaft of the fibula</strong> is triangular in cross-section and consequently has three borders: anterior, interosseous, and posterior borders and it has three surfaces: lateral, medial, and posterior surfaces.</p>
                    <p><strong>The anterior border of fibular shaft</strong> starts proximally at the head of the fibula and extends distally toward the lateral malleolus, where it diverges into two ridges that surround a triangular subcutaneous surface  above the lateral malleolus.</p>
                    <p><strong>The medial border of fibular shaft</strong> also known as the interosseous border, it is located on the medial aspect of the fibula, it is the point of attachment of the fibrous interosseous membrane of the leg that forms the middle tibiofibular joint. This fibrous septum acts as a barrier between the extensor and fibular muscles.</p>
                    <p><strong>The posterior border of fibular shaft</strong> runs along the back part of the fibula. Its proximal part is slightly rounded; however, it becomes more prominent distally, as it approaches the medial segment of the lateral malleolus.</p>
                    <p><strong>The medial surface of fibular shaft</strong> is located between the anterior and medial borders. This surface provides attachment for the muscles that extend the foot and cause the toes to point upward (dorsiflexion).</p>
                    <p><strong>The lateral surface of fibular shaft</strong> is found between the posterior and anterior borders, it provides attachment for the fibular muscles. This surface is spiral, its proximal part faces laterally; and as it spirals as it passes inferiorly, its distal end faces posterolaterally.</p>
                    <p>The distal end of the lateral surface is continuous with the posterior groove of the lateral malleolus.</p>
                    <p><strong>The posterior surface of fibular shaft</strong> is found between the posterior and medial borders, it provides attachment for the flexor muscles of the foot which are responsible for pointing the toes downward (plantar flexion). The proximal part of this surface is narrower than the distal part (Figures 12.7 & 12.8).</p>
                    <p><strong>The distal end of the fibula</strong> is characterized by a bony projection noted on the lateral surface of the ankle known as <strong>the lateral malleolus.</strong> It is complementary to another bony projection on the medial aspect of the ankle, formed by the tibia, known as <strong>the medial malleolus.</strong> The lateral malleolus, is round and rough anteriorly, and has a broad groove posteriorly. The lateral surface of the lateral malleolus is subcutaneous (only covered by skin) and the medial surface has a triangular area that is convex along the vertical axis. The distal end of the fibula tapers off as an apical projection that articulates with the lateral aspect of the talus at <strong>the talofibular joint.</strong></p>

                    <p>The tarsal bones are group of seven bones form the posterior half of the foot. They are named as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Calcaneus</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>The Talus:</strong> It is the uppermost tarsal bone with an irregular saddle-shape, its main function to transmit the whole body weight from the tibia to the foot. It articulates superiorly with the tibia and fibula at the ankle joint, articulates posteroinferiorly with the calcaneus at <strong>the Talocalcaneal joint</strong> and articulates anteroinferiorly with the navicular bone at the <strong>Talonavicular joint.</strong></p>
                    <p>The talus has three main components: the body, head, and neck.</p>
                    <p><strong>The body of the talus</strong> represents most of the volume of the talus bone, it has a curved smooth upper surface known as <strong>the talar dome,</strong> which is covered with hyaline cartilage. The medial and lateral surfaces of the body of the talus articulate with the medial malleolus of the tibia and lateral malleolus of the fibula respectively.</p>
                    <p><strong>The head of the talus</strong> is the anterior part, it articulates with the navicular bone.</p>
                    <p><strong>The neck of the talus</strong> is a constricted part of the talus and inclined downwards, distally and medially and connects the head of the talus to the body.</p>

                    <p>The calcaneus, also known as the heel bone, is the largest tarsal bone; it is an irregular cuboid shaped bone, forms the foundation of the posterior part of the foot (Figure 12.11). The calcaneus articulates superiorly with the Talus at <strong>the Talocalcaneal joint</strong>, and anteriorly with Cuboid bone at the <strong>Calcaneocuboid joint.</strong></p>
                    <p>It protrudes posteriorly and takes the weight of the body as the heel hits the ground when walking. The posterior aspect of the calcaneus is marked by <strong>calcaneal tuberosity,</strong> to which the Achilles tendon attaches (Figure 12.13).</p>

                    <p>The navicular is a boat-shaped bone located on the medial side of the foot, it helps to connect the talus to the cuneiform bones, it articulates proximally with the talus, distally with the three cuneiform bones, and laterally with the cuboid (Figures 12.9 & 12.14).</p>
                    <p><strong>The Cuboid:</strong></p>
                    <p>The cuboid is cube-shaped bone located on the lateral side of the foot (Figures 12.9 & 12.14). It is the main bone of the mid foot, due to the several articular surfaces it possesses, it articulates with four bones: the calcaneus posteriorly, the lateral cuneiform medially, the fourth metatarsal anteromedially, and the fifth metatarsal anterolaterally.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Cuneiforms:</strong></p>
                    <p>Cuneiform is a latin word means ‚Äòwedge‚Äô, cuneiform bones are group of three wedge shaped tarsal bones composed of medial, middle and lateral cuneiforms, they are located in the medial side of the foot and articulate with the navicular proximally and with the first three metatarsals distally. The wedge shape of the plantar surface of the medial cuneiform bone is an important factor in the forming the shape of the transverse arch of the foot (Figures 12.9 & 12.14).</p>
