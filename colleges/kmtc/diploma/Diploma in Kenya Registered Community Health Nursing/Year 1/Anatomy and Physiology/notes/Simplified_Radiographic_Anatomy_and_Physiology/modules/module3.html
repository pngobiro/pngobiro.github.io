                    <h3>üìö The Scapula</h3>
                    <p>The scapula, also known as the shoulder blade, is a triangular flat bone with three borders; superior, medial lateral borders, and two corners; the superior corner, located between the medial and superior borders, and the inferior corner, located between the medial and lateral borders, there is a shallow depression located at the superior corner known as the glenoid fossa, it articulates with the head of the humerus to form the shoulder joint which is also known as the Glenohumeral joint.</p>
                    <p>The scapula has anterior and posterior surfaces; the anterior surface also known as the costal surface, it is concave in shape and contains a depression over the majority of its surface, known as the Subscapular fossa. There is a small hook-like bony process located on the lateral edge of the superior portion of the anterior surface of the scapula pointing anterolaterally known as the Coracoid process; it plays a role in the stabilization of the shoulder joint. On the superior aspect of the anterior surface there is a large concave depression, medial to the coracoid process, known as The Suprascapular notch; it separates the coracoid process from the superior border of the scapula. The posterior surface of the scapula is convex in shape, it has a protruding bony ridge known as the spine of the scapula it divides the posterior surface into two unequal parts, the superior part is known as The Supraspinous fossa which is much bigger than the inferior part which is known as The Infraspinous fossa. On the lateral end of the spine of scapula, there is an anterolateral bony protuberance arcs over the shoulder joint and articulates with the distal end of the clavicle, it is known as the acromion process (Figures 8.3, 8.4 & 8.5).</p>

                 <h2>The Clavicle</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                 <p><strong>The clavicle,</strong> also known as the collarbone, is a curved long bone, forms the anterior portion of the shoulder girdle. It is located at the anterosuperior part of the thorax, just above the first rib and articulates laterally with the acromion process of the scapula and medially with the manubrium of the sternum. It is the only long bone that lies almost horizontally in the human body.</p>
                <p><strong>Functions of the clavicle:</strong> The clavicle has many important functions.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It serves as a strut to support the scapula superiorly, by the action of the muscles that anchors it from above.</li>
                    <li>It stabilizes the shoulder joint superolaterally, and by this it allows for free motion of the upper limb.</li>
                    <li>It transmits forces coming from the upper limb to the axial skeleton through the sternum.</li>
                    <li>It protects the underlying neurovascular bundle that pass between the trunk and the upper limb.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Anatomical regions of the clavicle:</strong> The clavicle is divided into three regions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The medial region, also known as the sternal end, it is of triangular shape and articulates with the sternum at the manubrium forming the sternoclavicular joint, which is the only direct bony articulation between the axial skeleton and the pectoral girdle of the upper limb.</li>
                    <li>The lateral region, also known as the acromial end, it articulates with the acromion of the scapula forming the acromioclavicular joint, which forms the bony tip of the shoulder.</li>
                    <li>The intermediate region or the shaft is divided into medial two-thirds and lateral one third. The lateral third has two borders and an inferior and superior surfaces; the first border is a concave anterior border gives attachment to the deltoid muscle, and the second border is a convex posterior border gives attachment to the trapezius muscle. The superior surface of the clavicle is flat and rough, it is marked by two impressions; the anterior impression for the attachments of the Deltoid muscle, and the posterior impression for the attachment of the Trapezius muscle; between these two impressions there is small subcutaneous bony portion.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Humerus</h2>
                <div class="content-block">
                <p><strong>The humerus</strong> is the bone of the arm, it extends between the scapula proximally and the radius and ulna distally. The proximal end of the humerus consists of head, anatomical neck, and surgical neck, greater and lesser tubercles. The head is a rounded, smooth area faces medially, it articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the shoulder joint (Glenohumeral joint). The anatomical neck is smooth groove surrounds the articular margin of the smooth area of the head. The Greater tubercle is an expanded bony area located on the lateral side of the proximal humerus. The Lesser tubercle is located on the anterior aspect of the proximal humerus. There is a narrow groove passing between the greater and lesser tubercles known as The intertubercular groove or (bicipital groove) it provides passage for the biceps brachii muscle tendon. The surgical neck is located at the expanded region at the base of the proximal end of the humerus; it represents the connection between the head and the shaft of the humerus, it is a common site of fractures.</p>
                <p>The shaft of the humerus is almost triangular in cut section with 3 surfaces; the anteromedial and the anterolateral surfaces which are separated by a line drawn as a continuation of the crest of the greater tubercle. The third surface is the posterior surface which is located between the medial and lateral borders; there is a roughened, V-shaped area at the lateral side in the midshaft of the humerus known as the deltoid tuberosity, it is the site of attachment for the deltoid muscle. There is a shallow oblique spiral groove found on the posterior surface of the shaft of the humerus known as the radial sulcus, it is the groove for the passage of the radial nerve and deep vessels.</p>
                <p>The distal end of the humerus becomes flattened with prominent bony projections on the medial and lateral sides known as medial and lateral epicondyles of the humerus, with lateral epicondyle is smaller than the medial epicondyle of the humerus. There are roughened bony ridges located above the lateral and medial epicondyles known as the lateral and medial supracondylar ridges, they are areas of attachment for the muscles of the forearm, wrist, and hand. The medial epicondyle give attachment for the strong grasping muscles of the anterior forearm, thus it is larger and more prominent than the lateral epicondyle which gives attachment for the weaker muscles of the posterior forearm (Figure 9.2).</p>
                <p>There are two articulation areas on the distal end of the humerus joining the radius and ulna to form the elbow joint, the medial area is known as the trochlea, it is pulley shaped structure articulates with the ulna. The lateral area is known as the capitulum it is a knob-like structure located on the anterior surface of the distal humerus, it articulates with the radius. There are two small depressions located superior to the trochlea and capitulum; these depressions accommodate the radius and ulna during full flexion of the elbow joint. The coronoid fossa is located superior to the trochlea, it receives the coronoid process of the ulna, and the radial fossa is located superior to the capitulum, it receives the head of the radius during flexion of the elbow joint. On the posterior surface</p>

                    <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                    <p>When studying the humerus, pay attention to the different bony landmarks (tubercles, tuberosity, epicondyles, etc.) and their functional significance. These landmarks serve as attachment points for muscles and ligaments, and their shape and position contribute to the range of motion at the shoulder and elbow joints.</p>
