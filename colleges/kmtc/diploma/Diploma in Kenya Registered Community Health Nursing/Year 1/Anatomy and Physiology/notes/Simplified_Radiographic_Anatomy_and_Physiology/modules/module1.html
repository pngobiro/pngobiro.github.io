                    <p>It is an imaging technique using X-rays to view the internal structure of an object.</p>
                    <p><strong>X-rays:</strong> are high energy, nonvisible and ionizing electromagnetic radiation with short wavelength that can penetrate body parts, during exposure, to produce a radiographic image (Figure 1.1).</p>

                    <p><strong>Radio-opaque structures:</strong> are internal structures of high density. They will absorb the X-ray beam more than other structures, leading to high attenuation of X-ray beam, (e.g. bones and metals). (Figure 1.3)</p>
                    <p><strong>Radio-lucent structures:</strong> are internal structures of low density. They will absorb the X-ray beam less than other structures, leading to low attenuation of X-ray beam, (e.g. soft tissues and air). (Figure 1.4)</p>
                    <p>Bones will appear as white structures because they highly attenuate X-ray beam.</p>
                    <p>Soft tissues will appear as grey structures because they minimally attenuate X-ray beam.</p>

                    <p>CT scanner is a ring-shaped machine uses a motorized x-ray tube that rotates around a circular gantry. During a CT scan imaging, the patient lies on a motorized platform that moves slowly through the gantry while the x-ray tube rotates around the patient and produce narrow fan shaped beams of x-rays through the patient. As the x-rays pass through the patient body they are picked up by special array of digital x-ray detectors, which are located directly opposite the x-ray tube, and transmit these attenuated rays to a computer (Figures 1.9 & 1.10).</p>

                     <p><strong>The basic principle of CT scan:</strong> CT scan is based on the principle that the internal structure of the examined body part can be reconstructed from multiple projections, to build up cross-sectional slices through measurement of the linear attenuation coefficient.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Linear Attenuation Coefficient (¬µ):</strong></p>
                    <p>The linear attenuation coefficient describes the fraction of a beam of x-rays that is absorbed or scattered per unit thickness of the medium.</p>
                    <p>The image of the section irradiated by x-ray is reconstructed from a large number of measurements of attenuation coefficient. It gathers together all the data coming from the elementary volumes of material through the detectors. Using the computer, it presents the elementary surfaces of the reconstructed image from a projection of the data matrix reconstruction, the tone depending on the attenuation coefficients.</p>
                    <p>Because CT scan image is basically a digital image, it consists of a square matrix of elements (pixel), each of which represents a volume element (voxel) of the tissue of the examined part of the patient. It is typically composed of 512 rows, each of 512 pixels, which means that a square matrix of 512 x 512 = 262144 pixels (one for each voxel). In the process of image reconstruction, the value of the attenuated coefficient for each voxel corresponding to the pixels need to be calculated.</p>
                    <p>Before the data are presented on the screen, the conventional rescaling was made into CT numbers, expressed in Hounsfield Units (HU).</p>
                    <p><strong>The Hounsfield scale:</strong> (named for the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning inventor of CT scan, the British physicist Godfrey N. Hounsfield), The Hounsfield unit (HU) scale is the transformation of the linear attenuation coefficient measurement into the radiodensity of distilled water at standard pressure and temperature (STP), it is defined as zero Hounsfield units (HU), while the radiodensity of air at (STP) is defined as -1000 HU, and the radiodensity of dense materials such as bone is approaching +1000 HU In a voxel.</p>
                    <p><strong>CT number:</strong> it is the value of the calculated x-ray absorption coefficient of a pixel in a CT scan image, expressed in Hounsfield units, where the CT number of water is 0 and that of air is -1000 and of bones is +1000.</p>
                    <p>So, the signal transmitted by the detector is processed by the PC in the form of the digital information and the CT image reconstruction.</p>
                    <p><strong>CT image display:</strong> CT scan image is displayed on a black and white monitor with a different shade of gray for each group Hounsfield unit represented (Figure 1.11).</p>
                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="/api/placeholder/600/300"

                        <figcaption>Figure 1.11 The display of a group of Hounsfield units to shade of gray. 10 different shades displayed 300 Hounsfield units in the window width.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Although there are more than 2,000 different Hounsfield values, the monitor can display only 256 shades of gray. And the human eye cannot appreciate more than 40. To overcome these inherent limitations, a gray scale is used in image display. In this system a display processor assigns a certain number of Hounsfield units (HU) to each level of gray. The number of Hounsfield units assigned to each level of gray is determined by the window width.</p>
                    <p><strong>CT Windowing:</strong> also known as grey-level mapping, it is the process in which the CT image grey scale component is manipulated via the CT numbers; in order to clarify the appearance of the picture of the examined structures. The brightness of the image is, adjusted via the window level. The contrast is adjusted via the window width.</p>
                    <p><strong>Window Width:</strong> The window width determines the number of Hounsfield units represented on a specific image. The software assigns shades of gray to CT numbers that fall within the range selected. All values higher than the selected range appear white and any value lower than the range appears black. By increasing the window width, usually referred to as ‚Äúwidening the width,‚Äù more numbers are assigned to each shade of gray.</p>
                     <p><strong>Window Level:</strong> The window level selects the center CT value of the window width (Figure 1.12). The terms window level and window center are often used interchangeably. The window level selects which Hounsfield numbers are displayed on the image.</p>
                    <figure class="content-image">

                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>Windowing:</strong> it is the manipulation of window width and window level to optimize image contrast, the window level should be set at a point that is roughly the same value as the average attenuation number of the tissue of interest, such as lung parenchyma, a window level setting that is intended to display lung parenchyma will be approximately ‚àí600 because air-filled lung tissue measures around ‚àí600 HU. On the other hand wide window width is better for imaging tissue types of wide variety. For example, in chest imaging, it is necessary to see low- density structures such as lung parenchyma as well as high-density structures such as contrast enhanced vascular structures.</p>
                    <p>There are different values of window width and window level for each examined part of human body (Figure 1.13).</p>
                    <p>The following table displays the values of width (W) and level (L) are written as in Hounsfield units (HU).</p>

                    <p>Because CT scan image display is mainly based on tissue density, structures that appear dark on CT scan image are called hypodense, structures that appear bright are called hyperdense, and structures that appear gray are called isodense.</p>

                    <p>It is the medical imaging that applies a magnetic field and radio wave pulses to build up images of the internal anatomical structure and give information about the physiological processes of the human body.</p>
                    <p>MRI does not involve the use of ionizing radiation; it is mainly based on the distribution of hydrogen nuclei within different types of body tissue to produces extremely detailed picture of the body soft tissue (Figures 1.14 & 1.15).</p>

                     <p><strong>MRI scanner components:</strong></p>
                    <p>MRI scanner is tunnel shaped machine composed of the following components:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Large magnet that produces a very strong magnetic field.</li>
                        <li>Radiofrequency coils which produce radiofrequency (RF) signals and receive them from the tissue, they are located within the magnet assembly and relatively close to the patient‚Äôs body.</li>
                        <li>Gradient coils located within the main magnet, they are three different gradient coils, each one of these produce three different magnetic fields that are each less strong than the main field. The gradient coils create a variable field (x, y, z) that can be increased or decreased to allow specific and different parts of the body to be scanned by altering and adjusting the main magnetic field.</li>
                        <li>Patient Table that slides the patient into the MRI machine.</li>
                        <li>Computer System whose major function is to receive, record, and analyze the images of the patient‚Äôs body that have been scanned. The Computer System is composed of a very sensitive antenna that easily detects the RF signals emitted by the patient‚Äôs body while undergoing examination and feeds this information in order to be interpreted to produce an understandable image of the body part being examined. (Figure 1.16)</li>

                    <p>During the scan, the patient lies on a table that slides inside a tunnel-shaped machine. The position at which the patient lies down on the table is determined by the part of the body that is being scanned. Once the part of the body under examination is in the exact centre of the magnetic field, the scanning process is started (Figure 1.17).</p>

                    <p>In normal circumstances, hydrogen protons of the human body spin on their own axis in a manner very similar to the planet earth, with a north-south pole (Figure 1.18). In this respect hydrogen protons behave like small bar magnets distributed in the body with their axes randomly aligned.</p>

                    <p>To obtain an MR image of a human body, the following steps take place:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First, the human body is placed in a uniform magnetic field in the range between 0.5 to 1.5 Tesla. As a result, the human body's hydrogen protons will precess about the magnetic field direction like gyroscopes and line up, creating a magnetic vector along the axis of the magnetic field (Figure 1.19). This behavior is termed as Larmor precession; the frequency of Larmor precession is proportional to the applied magnetic field strength as defined by the Larmor frequency.</li>

                    <ol start="2">
                        <li>Next, a radio-frequency (RF) pulse with a frequency equal to the Larmor frequency is applied perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, causing hydrogen nuclei to gradually tilt perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field as in (Figure 1.20). It has been found that there is specific time required for all hydrogen nuclie of each tissue to be organized in the perpendicular direction or transverse to the direction of the magnetic field; known as transverse relaxation timeT2.</li>

                        <li>The third step when the Radiofrequency pulse stops, the nuclei realign themselves again parallel with the direction of the magnetic field. Returning to equilibrium is referred to as relaxation. During relaxation the nuclei lose energy by emitting their own RF signal (Figure 1.21). This signal is referred to as the free-induction decay (FID) response signal. The FID response signal is measured by a conductive field coil placed around the object being imaged. This measurement is processed or reconstructed to obtain 3D grey-scale MR images on the monitor.</li>

                    <p>Time required for all hydrogen nuclei of each tissue to return to equilibrium again parallel with the direction of the magnetic field and to be organized in this direction is known as longitudinal relaxation timeT1.</p>
                    <p>According to the strength of the bond between hydrogen nuclei of different types of tissues, there are four types of tissues:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Fluids: the strength of the bond between hydrogen nuclei of fluids is not very strong and not very weak, allowing them to move freely.</li>
                        <li>Fats: the strength of the bond between hydrogen nuclei of fats is similar to fluids, allowing them also to move freely.</li>
                        <li>Solids: the liking bond between hydrogen nuclei of solids is very strong, which does not allow them to move freely.</li>
                        <li>Gasses: there no bond liking between hydrogen nuclei of gasses.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p><strong>MRI image display:</strong></p>
                    <p>There are many types of MR images their display depends on many factors:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>T1 weighted MR Image: in this type of image, displayed tissue contrast depends on the longitudinal relaxation time hydrogen nuclei of each tissue. According to tissue characteristics, solids and gasses haven‚Äôt got relaxation time, because the bond between hydrogen nuclei of solids is very strong and there no bond liking between hydrogen nuclei of gasses, there for solids and gasses appear dark in T1 weight image, while fats have short relaxation time because quickly realigns its longitudinal magnetization therefore appears bright on a T1 weighted image. Conversely, fluids has much slower longitudinal magnetization realignment after RF pulse, therefore it has less transverse magnetization after an RF pulse. Thus, fluids has low signal and appears dark (Figure 1.22).</li>
                        <li>T2 weighted MR Image: this type of image depends on the transverse relaxation time  hydrogen nuclei of each tissue after application of the RF pulse, as mentioned above, solids and gasses haven‚Äôt got relaxation time and consequently they haven‚Äôt got transverse relaxation time, so solids and gasses appear dark in T2 weight image, because transverse relaxation basically depends on the net magnetization vector and the radiofrequency pulse, fats and fluids appear bright in T2 weighted image(Figure 1.23).</li>
                        <li>Proton density weighted MR image: The voxel intensity of this type of MR image displayed on MR monitor of a specific tissue type depends on the proton density of the tissue; the higher the proton density, the stronger the FID response signal, Fluids appear white but darker than the fluid signal in T2 images, and Fats appear bright but slightly darker than the fat signal in T1 images (Figure 1.24).</li>
