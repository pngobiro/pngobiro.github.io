![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-11.jpg?height=1867&width=2867&top_left_y=2&top_left_x=463)

\section*{Coverings of the Heart: Anatomy}

Pericardium - a double-walled sac around the heart composed of:
1. A superficial fibrous pericardium
2. A deep two-layer serous pericardium
a. The parietal layer lines the internal surface of the fibrous pericardium
b. The visceral layer or epicardium lines the surface of the heart
[] They are separated by the fluid-filled pericardial cavity

\section*{Pericardial Layers of the Heart}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-13.jpg?height=1493&width=2782&top_left_y=376&top_left_x=476)

\section*{Heart Wall}
[ Epicardium - visceral layer of the serous pericardium
- Myocardium - cardiac muscle layer forming the bulk of the heart
[ Fibrous skeleton of the heart - crisscrossing, interlacing layer of connective tissue
$\square$ Endocardium - endothelial layer of the inner myocardial surface

\section*{Chambers of the Heart}
- Atria - two superior chambers
$\square$ "Receiving chambers"
- Blood from veins enters atria
(1) Ventricles - two inferior chambers
$\square$ "pumping chambers"
- Thick muscular walls to increase force of pumping action
- Left > right
- Separated by interventricular septum
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-16.jpg?height=1874&width=2672&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=12)

\section*{Atria of the Heart}
- Atria are the receiving chambers of the heart
[ Each atrium has a protruding auricle
- Pectinate muscles mark atrial walls
- Blood enters right atria from superior and inferior venae cavae and coronary sinus
[ Blood enters left atria from pulmonary veins

\section*{Ventricles of the Heart}
-Ventricles are the discharging chambers of the heart

QPapillary muscles and trabeculae carneae muscles mark ventricular walls

『Right ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary trunk
© Left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta

\section*{Valves of the Heart}
$\square$ Permit blood flow in one direction during circulation
- Atrioventricular valves (AV valves)
- Also cuspid valves
- Between atria and ventricles
- Semilunar (SL valves)
- Between $R$ ventricle and pulmonary arteries and $L$ ventricle and aorta
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-20.jpg?height=1591&width=2281&top_left_y=157&top_left_x=718)

\section*{Atrioventricular Valves}
[] Tricuspid valve
- Btwn R atrium and ventricle
- 3 flaps of endocardium
[ Connected to ventricular papillary muscle via chordae tendinae
- Bicuspid valve
[] Btwn L atrium and ventricle
- Also called mitral valve
- Two flaps of endocardium

\section*{Semilunar Valves}

\author{
- Pulmonary semilunar valve \\ - Btwn R ventricle and pulmonary trunk
}
- Aorta semilunar valve
[ Btwn L ventricle and aorta

\section*{Coronary Circulation}
- Coronary circulation is the functional blood supply to the heart muscle itself
- Collateral routes ensure blood delivery to heart even if major vessels are occluded

\section*{Coronary Circulation: Arterial Supply}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-25.jpg?height=1506&width=2483&top_left_y=361&top_left_x=634)

\section*{Coronary Circulation: Venous Supply}

\section*{Types of Blood Vessels}
$\square$ Artery - carries oxygenated blood away from the heart
[] "distributors"
- Arteriole: small artery
- Precapillary sphincters: regulate the blood flow into capillaries

\section*{Types of Blood Vessels}
$\square$ Vein - carries deoxygenated blood towards the heart
[] Great ability to stretch (capacitance)
[ Function as reservoirs: blood pools in the valves then is pushed forward from the pumping pressure
[ Venules: small vein

\section*{Types of Blood Vessels}
- Capillaries - arterial system switches to venous system
[] "primary exchange vessels"
- Transport materials to and from the cells
- Speed of blood flow decreases to increase contact time
- Microcirculation: blood flow between arterioles, capillaries and venules

\section*{Types of Blood Vessels}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-30.jpg?height=1371&width=2085&top_left_y=335&top_left_x=561)

\section*{Structure of Blood Vessels}
- Tunica adventitia - outermost layer
- Fibrous connective tissue
[ Holds vessels open; prevents tearing of vessels walls during body movements
[] Tunica media - middle layer
- Smooth muscle and elastic CT
- Helps vessels constrict and dilate
- Tunica intima - innermost layer
- Composed of endothelium
- Semilunar valves present in veins
- One cell thick in capillaries

\section*{Foetal circulation}

\section*{Fetal Circulation}
- Two umbilical arteries carry blood to the placenta
- The placenta allows for exchange of oxygen and nutrients from the mother. Maternal and fetal blood do NOT mix.
- Umbilical vein returns oxygenated blood and enters fetus via the umbilicus
$\square$ Foramen ovale - hole btwn the R and L atria
$\square$ Allows for blood to bypass the $R$ ventricle and pulmonary circulation

\section*{Fetal Circulation}
[ Ductus arteriosus - small vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and the aorta
- Allows for another bypass route from the lungs
**Most of fetal blood is a mixture of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood**
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-36.jpg?height=1839&width=2298&top_left_y=36&top_left_x=27)

\section*{Fetal Circulation}

\section*{Changes After Birth}
(1) Umbilical vein become round ligament
- Umbilical arteries become umbilical ligaments
[ Foramen ovale closes after first few breaths
$\square$ Full closure may take up to 9 months
- Ductus arteriosus contracts as soon as respirations begin
$\square$ Become fibrous cord

\section*{Changes After Birth}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-38.jpg?height=1443&width=1651&top_left_y=350&top_left_x=795)

Respiratory system

\section*{Organization .... and functions}
1. Upper respiratory tract
$\square$ Lower respiratory tract.
$\square$ Conducting portion transports air.
- nose $\qquad$ terminal bronchioles
$\square$ Respiratory portion carries out gas exchange.
- respiratory bronchioles $\qquad$ alveolar ducts $\qquad$ alveoli

\section*{Respiratory System Functions}
1. Supplies the body with oxygen and disposes of carbon dioxide
2. Filters inspired air
3. Produces sound
4. Contains receptors for smell (olfaction)
5. Rids the body of some excess water and heat
6. Helps regulate blood pH
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-42.jpg?height=1874&width=3330&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=2)

\section*{Upper Respiratory Tract}
$\square$ Composed of the nose and nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx (throat), larynx.
- All part of the conducting portion of the respiratory system.

\section*{Upper Respiratory Tract}

\section*{Lower Respiratory Tract}
$\square$ Conducting airways (trachea, bronchi, up to terminal bronchioles).
$\square$ Respiratory portion of the respiratory system (respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli).

Conducting zone of lower respiratory tract

\section*{Trachea}
$\square$ "windpipe".
- 5 to 20 C-shaped tracheal cartilages.
- Cartilage rings reinforce and provide rigidity to the tracheal wall to ensure that the trachea remains open at all times
- Posterior part of tube lined by trachealis muscle

\section*{Trachea}
$\square$ Bifurcates into the right and left primary bronchi.
$\square$ Each primary bronchus projects laterally toward each lung.
[] The most inferior tracheal cartilage separates the primary bronchi at their origin and forms an internal ridge called the carina.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-49.jpg?height=1874&width=3059&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=10)

\section*{Bronchial tree}
- A highly branched system of air-conducting
- Progressively branch into narrower tubes terminating in terminal bronchioles.
$\square$ Incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage: support the walls
- Right primary bronchus is shorter, wider, and more vertically oriented than the left primary bronchus.
- Foreign particles are more likely to lodge in the right primary bronchus.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-51.jpg?height=1874&width=2952&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)

\section*{Bronchial tree}

The primary bronchi enter the hilus of each lung together with the pulmonary vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves.
$\square$ Each primary bronchus branches into secondary bronchi (or lobar bronchi).
Left lung - two secondary bronchi.
Right lung - three secondary bronchi.
- They further divide into tertiary bronchi.
1. Each tertiary bronchus is called a segmental bronchus because it supplies a part of the lung called a bronchopulmonary segment.

\section*{Bronchial Tree}
$\square$ Secondary bronchi $\rightarrow$ tertiary bronchi $\rightarrow$ bronchioles $\rightarrow \ldots \ldots$ terminal bronchioles
[] With successive branching amount of cartilage decreases and amount of smooth muscle increases, this allows for variation in airway diameter
[ Epithelium gradually changes from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to simple cuboidal epithelium in terminal bronchioles

\section*{Conduction vs. Respiratory zones}
- Most of the tubing in the lungs makes up conduction zone
$\square$ Consists of nasal cavity to terminal bronchioles
$\square$ The respiratory zone is where gas is exchanged
$\square$ Consists of alveoli, alveolar sacs, alveolar ducts and respiratory bronchioles
$\square$ Gas exchange can take place in the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts as well as in the alveoli, each lung contains approximately 300 to 400 million alveoli.

\section*{Lungs}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-56.jpg?height=1510&width=1698&top_left_y=359&top_left_x=886)

\section*{Gross Anatomy of the Lungs}
$\square$ Conical shape. Its wide, concave base rests upon the muscular diaphragm.
- Superior region - apex projects superiorly to a point that is slightly superior and posterior to the clavicle.
$\square$ Lungs are bordered by the thoracic wall
$\square$ Midline, the lungs are separated from each other by the mediastinum.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-58.jpg?height=1779&width=2761&top_left_y=12&top_left_x=567)

\section*{Lungs}

Left lung
$\square$ divided into 2 lobes by oblique fissure
[] smaller than the right lung
- cardiac notch accommodates the heart

\section*{Right}
$\square$ divided into 3 lobes by oblique and horizontal fissure
$\square$ located more superiorly in the body due to liver on right side

\section*{Pleura and Pleural Cavities}
- The outer surface of each lung and the adjacent internal thoracic wall are lined by a serous membrane called pleura.
- The outer surface of each lung is tightly covered by the visceral pleura.
- while the internal thoracic walls, the lateral surfaces of the mediastinum, and the superior surface of the diaphragm are lined by the parietal pleura.
- The parietal and visceral pleural layers are continuous at the hilus of each lung.

\section*{Pleural Cavities}

The potential space between the serous membrane layers is a pleural cavity.
- The pleural membranes produce a thin, serous pleural fluid that circulates in the pleural cavity and acts as a lubricant, ensuring minimal friction during breathing.
- Pleural effusion - Too much fluid within pleural space

\section*{Muscles that ASSIST with respiration}

\section*{$\square$ Diaphragm (thoracic)-performs important function in respiration!!}
- The scalenes help increase thoracic cavity dimensions by elevating the first and second ribs during forced inhalation.
[] The ribs elevate upon contraction of the external intercostals, thereby increasing the transverse dimensions of the thoracic cavity during inhalation.
[] Contraction of the internal intercostals depresses the ribs, but this only occurs during forced exhalation.
- Normal exhalation requires no active muscular effort.

\section*{Muscles that ASSIST with respiration}
- Other accessory muscles assist with respiratory activities.
[ Abdominal muscles : (external and internal obliques, transversus abdominis, and rectus abdominis) assist in active exhalation.

\section*{Lymphatic system/circulation}

\section*{The Lymphatic system}
[] Fluids, vessels and tissues
[] Purpose
- Return excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream
$\square$ Transport products of fat digestion from the small intestine to the bloodstream
[ Help defend against disease causing organisms

- return fluid to blood
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-69.jpg?height=1349&width=507&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=1966)

\section*{Lymph circulation}
$\square$ must be returned to blood stream to maintain blood volume and pressure
- antibodies, lymphocytes, and monocytes
- obstruction leads to edema : "elephantiasis"
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_0b0feba075536bcf987cg-70.jpg?height=537&width=711&top_left_y=1143&top_left_x=1839)

\section*{Lymph circulation}
- no central pump
- slow movement
$\square$ lymph is kept moving by:
- contraction of adjacent skeletal muscle and arterial pulsation
- contraction of smooth muscles - peristalsis
