FUNCTIONS:
1.Movement
2.Shape
3.Storage (proteins)

\title{
SKELETAL MUSCLE General organization
}
- Consists largely of elongated cells: the MUSCLE FIBRES.
- The length of a muscle fibre ranges from $1-300 \mathrm{~mm}$.
- The SARCOLEMMA is the cell membrane of the muscle fibre (cell) \& the protoplasm is called the SARCOPLASM.

\title{

\section*{$\square$ Muscle fibres are subdivided into RED \& WHITE}
$\square$ The red fibres have myoglobin

\title{
SKELETAL MUSCLE General organization
}
- Within the sarcoplasm are fibrils (MYOFIBRILS).
- Also in abundance within the sarcoplasm are mitochondria \& inclusions such as glycogen.

$\square$ Myofibrils are not homogenous, but exhibit light \& dark bands.

QUnder EM, a fibril consists of alternating FILAMENTS of proteins called MYOSIN \& ACTIN.

\title{
SKELETAL MUSCLE Fibre arrangement
}

FIBRE ORIENTATION
- Parallel (strap)
- Oblique (Pennate)
- Radial, Triangular or fan shaped.

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE Fibre arrangement}

\section*{STRAP}
- Fibres run almost whole length of muscle \& parallel to its long axis
- E.g. SARTORIUS
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_83f559bd4072ed7012edg-20.jpg?height=1248&width=1031&top_left_y=435&top_left_x=1264)

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE Fibre arrangement}

PENNATE
- Fibres run obliquely to the long axis of the muscle \& attached to a tendon/aponeurosis that is parallel to long axis.
- TYPES: UNIPENNATE, BIPENNATE \& MULTIPENNATE

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE Fibre arrangement}

\section*{UNIPENNATE}
- Fibres attached on tendon on one side only
- E.g. FLEXOR POLLICIS LONGUS
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_83f559bd4072ed7012edg-22.jpg?height=1261&width=1194&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=1211)

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE Fibre arrangement}

\section*{BIPENNATE}
* Fibres attached to both sides of the tendon
- E.g. RECTUS FEMORIS
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_83f559bd4072ed7012edg-23.jpg?height=1254&width=1082&top_left_y=432&top_left_x=1219)

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE Fibre arrangement}

\section*{MULTIPENNATE}
- Several pennate groups lie side by side
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_29_83f559bd4072ed7012edg-24.jpg?height=1253&width=1114&top_left_y=429&top_left_x=1178)

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Functional aspects}
- The greater the cross-section of a muscle, the greater is the force it can produce.
- The longer the fibres, the greater is the range of shortening

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Functional aspects}
- The total force of contraction is a sum of individual fibre effort.
- Pennate muscles have more fibres.
- When the whole distance between the points of attachment is occupied by muscle tissue, then shortening is greater.

\title{
CONTRACTING MUSCLE Adaptation to shortening
}
$\square$ Parallelism of fibres
$\square$ Great length

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Adaptation to power}
$\square$ Structure (MULTIPENNATE e.g. deltoid)
$\square$ Large mass (e.g. Gluteus maximus)

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Effectiveness in joint movement MOMENT about the joint}
- Greater when the pull of the muscle is far removed from the joint it controls.
* Less where the muscle passes close to the joint.

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Effectiveness in joint movement}

\section*{JOINT CROSSING}
- UNI-ARTICULAR muscles cross/act on one joint only
"BI-ARTICULAR muscles cross two joints \& are capable of producing movement at one or both joints.
- MULTI-ARTICULAR cross more than two joints

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Effectiveness in joint movement ACTIVE INSUFFICIENCY \\ - Inability of a muscle to shorten sufficiently.}

PASSIVE INSUFFICIENCY
- Inability to lengthen sufficiently.

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE}

\section*{SOME MUSCLES DO NOT CROSS JOINTS}
1.Cutaneous muscles (face)
2.Articular muscles (articularis genu)
3.Sphincteric muscles (anal sphincters)
4.Tubular (pharyngeal)

\title{
CONTRACTING MUSCLE Group action of muscles
}

Muscles which produce a movement are called PRIME MOVERS

ANTAGONISTS have to be lengthened or shortened to allow movement

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Group action of muscles}

ECCENTRIC ACTION
$\square$ Control of movement through relaxation of an antagonist due to effect of gravity.

CONCENTRIC ACTION
$\square$ Muscle shortens when it acts as a prime mover

\section*{CONTRACTING MUSCLE Group action of muscles}
- When a muscle is capable of moving more than one joint, then at one time, it may be necessary to prevent one of the actions.
- A muscle which does this is called a SYNERGIST or fixator.

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE Attachment to bone}
- Collagen fibres in the connective around fibres extend into the bone as SHARPEY'S FIBRES
- The proximal attachment of a limb muscle is called the ORIGIN and the distal attachment the INSERTION.

\section*{SKELETAL MUSCLE Attachment to bone}
- When the fibrous end is rounded, it is called a

TENDON.
- When flattened or membranous, it is called an APONEUROSIS.
