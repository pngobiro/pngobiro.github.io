                    <ol>
                        <li>It supports the thorax and to protect the vital thoracic and abdominal organs,</li>

                        <li>It provides attachment for the muscles that move upper limb and stabilize their position.</li>

                    <h3>üìö Sternum</h3>
                    <p><strong>Sternum:</strong> is a flat elongated bone located in the anterior part of the thoracic cage. It is anchored to the rib via costal cartilage. The sternum consists of three parts (Figure 7.2):</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The manubrium</li>
                        <li>The body</li>
                        <li>The xiphoid process</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>The manubrium:</strong> it is the broad superior part of the sternum, it is quadrangular in shape. It has a superior shallow, U-shaped border called the jugular notch located between the medial ends of the clavicles. The inferior border of the sternum is oval in shape and covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation with the body of the sternum at the sternal angle. The lateral borders of the sternum are marked by depression for the first costal cartilages.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Body of the Sternum:</strong> it is the long flat central part of the sternum, directed upward and forward, its superior border joins the manubrium at the sternal angle where the cartilage of the second rib is attached to the sternum. At the lateral border of the body of the sternum there are four angular depressions for the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. The inferior border of the body of the sternum is narrow, and articulates with the xiphoid process, at this point there is a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib.</p>
                    <p><strong>The xiphoid process:</strong> it is a small cartilaginous process located at the inferior end of the sternum, which is usually ossified in the adult human.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>The sternal angle:</strong> also clinically known as the Angle of Louis, it is the point where the body of the sternum joins the manubrium; it is about 160 degrees, it can be felt at the anterior wall of the chest at the farthest point of sternal projects, there are two lateral depressions at sternal angle for the attachment of the second pair of costal cartilages, that is why it can be used as a land mark for the second rib. The sternal angle is located at the level of the inferior border of T4 (Figures 7.3& 7.4).</p>

                     <p><strong>Ribs and Costal cartilages</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>ribs</strong> are long bones, flattened and curved. There are twelve pairs of ribs in the thoracic cage; they connect the sternum anteriorly to the upper ten thoracic vertebrae posteriorly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Function of ribs:</strong> As part of the thoracic, the ribs protect the vital thoracic and part of the abdominal organs. They also play a role in breathing, as they move to permit lung inflation during thoracic expansion.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rib Classifications:</strong> there are two types of rib classification:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>According to their anatomical features ribs are classified into: Typical and Atypical ribs.</li>
                        <li>According to their articulation, location and their costal cartilage ribs are classified into: True, Floating and False ribs.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Typical Ribs</strong> include from 3rd up to 9th ribs: A typical rib is mainly composed of: head, neck and body. The head of a typical rib is wedge shaped with two articular facets separated by crest, the inferior facet articulates with the numerically corresponding vertebrae and the superior facet articulates with the vertebrae above. The neck of a typical rib connects the head with the body at a roughed tubercle, with a facet for articulation with the transverse process of the corresponding vertebrae. The body of a typical rib is thin, flat and curved, most markedly at the costal angle where the rib turns anterolaterally; there is a groove in internal surface of the body of a typical rib for the protection of the neurovascular supply of the thorax (Figure 7.5).</p>
