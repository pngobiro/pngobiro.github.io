                    <p>Matter can be combined chemically to form a <b>molecule</b>, which is when atoms of two or more elements are combined by forming chemical bonds. A chemical bond is not a physical structure but rather an energy relationship.</p>
                    <p>A <b>molecule</b> is formed by the chemical bonding between two or more atoms of the same element. A <b>compound</b> is formed when two or more atoms from different elements are combined by chemical bonding.</p>
                    <p>Very large molecules composed of many atoms are called <b>macromolecules</b>.</p>
                    <p><b>Molecular formulas</b> are a way to represent molecules symbolically with letters and numbers to show the kinds and numbers of atoms in a molecule.</p>
                    <p>Chemical bonds are formed when valence electrons in the valence shell (the outermost electron shell) of atoms interact.</p>
                    <p><b>Valence electrons</b> determine how an atom interacts with other atoms and whether it will form bonds with a specific atom.</p>
