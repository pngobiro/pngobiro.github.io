                    <p><strong>Tissue</strong> is an assembly of similar cells with extracellular matrix; they are both from the same embryonic origin that arranged in an orderly pattern to carry out a specific function. The functional grouping of multiple tissues leads to the formation of different body organs.</p>
                    <p>There are four broad categories of tissues:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Epithelial tissue.</li>
                        <li>Connective tissue.</li>

                    <h3>üìö Epithelial Tissues</h3>
                    <p><strong>Epithelial tissues</strong> are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body. They cover the external surfaces of the body such as skin, and form the inner lining of the internal organs that are exposed to the external environment, such as the inner lining of the digestive tract, respiratory tract, urinary tract and reproductive organs. Epithelial tissues form the lining of hollow parts of every organ such as heart and the ventricular system of the brain. They also form the glandular tissue of the body.</p>
                    <p>Epithelial tissues are highly cellular, with little or no extracellular material present between cells.</p>
                    <p>Cells that are making up epithelial tissues are often closely bound together through specialized structures called tight junctions.</p>
                    <p>Epithelial tissues are free from blood vessels and nerves and are supported by a connective tissue called the basement membrane, which are always attached to the inner layer of epithelial tissue.</p>

                    <ol>
                         <li>Epithelial tissues provide protection from physical, chemical, and biological wear and tear.</li>
                        <li>All substances that enter the body must cross the epithelial tissues.</li>
                        <li>Epithelial tissues control permeability and allow selective transfer of materials.</li>
                        <li>Some epithelial cells are capable of secreting mucous and chemical compounds, such as the epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes.</li>
                        <li>Epithelial tissue can be involved in movement of substances, such as the epithelium lining the bronchioles contain cilia that move mucus and trapped microorganisms to improve immune function.</li>
                        <li>Some epithelial tissues can stretch and expand the capacity of the organ, such as the epithelial lining of the urinary bladder.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Types of Epithelial Tissues:</strong></p>
                    <p>There are two types of epithelial tissues classification:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Classification based on and the shape of the epithelial cells.</li>
                        <li>Classification based on the number of cell layers that from the epithelial tissue.</li>

                   <p><strong>Classification of the shape of the epithelial cells:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Squamous epithelial tissue:</strong> consists of extremely thin and flattened cells that resemble the scales of a fish (Figures 3.2 & 3.3).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cuboidal epithelial tissue:</strong> contains cells that are square in shape, as wide as it is tall. (Figures 3.4 & 3.5).</li>
                        <li><strong>Columnar epithelial tissue:</strong> consists of elongated cell of rectangular shape (Figures 3.6 & 3.7).</li>

                    <p>The combination of the two classifications gives the following types of epithelium:</p>
                    <p><strong>Simple Epithelium:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Simple squamous epithelium</li>
                        <li>Simple cuboidal epithelium</li>
                        <li>Simple columnar epithelium</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Stratified Epithelium:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stratified squamous epithelium</li>
                        <li>Stratified cuboidal epithelium</li>
                        <li>Stratified columnar epithelium</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Simple squamous epithelium:</strong> Because this type of epithelial tissue is composed of one layer of flat and thin cells, it is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is needed, such as:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The lining of blood vessels where blood pass for gas exchange.</li>
                        <li>The alveoli of lungs where gasses pass by diffusion.</li>
                        <li>The tubules of kidney where blood is filtered.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p><strong>Simple cuboidal epithelium:</strong></p>
                    <p>This layer have a secretory function and absorptive function, it is present in the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormones and the collecting ducts of the kidney to absorb the components of blood filtration that form urine.</p>
                    <p><strong>Simple columnar epithelium:</strong></p>
                    <p>This layer is active in the absorption and secretion of molecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the female reproductive tract. The cells of this layer are ciliated and involved in the movement of particles; they are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes, where they are involved in the movement of the ovum towards the uterus, and are found in some parts of the respiratory system to remove foreign particles.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stratified squamous epithelium:</strong> It is the most common type of stratified epithelium in the human body. As it is composed of multiple layers, the apical layer of cells are exposed to the external environment, while the inner layer is in direct contact with the basement membrane, these tissues often have a protective role against friction, abrasion and other environmental factors. This layer is mainly found in skin. There are many dead and keratinized cells in the apical layer, providing protection against external environmental factors and prevents loss of water and nutrients.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stratified cuboidal epithelium:</strong> This layer is located around the ducts of many glands, including mammary glands in the breast and salivary glands in the mouth.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stratified columnar epithelium:</strong> This layer is rare, mainly found in the conjunctiva of the eye and in some organs of the reproductive system (Table: 3.1).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tissues</strong> are groups of similar cells working together to perform specific functions. The four main types are epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Epithelial tissues</strong> cover body surfaces, line organs and cavities, and form glands. They are classified by cell shape (squamous, cuboidal, columnar) and layering (simple, stratified).</li>
                    <li><strong>Epithelial tissues</strong> have various functions, including protection, secretion, absorption, and controlling permeability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple squamous epithelium</strong> facilitates rapid passage of substances, while <strong>simple cuboidal</strong> and <strong>columnar epithelia</strong> are involved in secretion and absorption.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stratified squamous epithelium</strong> provides protection against abrasion and is found in areas like the skin.</li>

                    <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                    <p>When studying epithelial tissues, focus on how their structure (shape and layering) relates to their function. For example, the thin, flat cells of simple squamous epithelium are ideal for diffusion, while the multiple layers of stratified squamous epithelium provide protection.</p>

Some cells may have microvilli to increase surface area, and goblet cells may be present to secrete mucus.</li>
                                <li><strong>Epidermis (outer layer of skin):</strong> Most likely stratified squamous epithelium. The multiple layers of flattened cells provide protection against abrasion, dehydration, and infection. The outer layers are typically keratinized for added durability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lining of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs:</strong> Most likely simple squamous epithelium. The extremely thin, single layer of flattened cells facilitates rapid diffusion of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) between the air and the blood.</li>

                    <h3>üìö Connective tissues</h3>
                     <p><strong>Connective tissues</strong> are essential part of body. Their main function is to connect tissues and organs.</p>
                    <p>Connective tissues have three characteristic components:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cells.</li>
                        <li>Ground substance.</li>
                        <li>Protein fibers.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p>Connective tissue is mainly composed of the ground substance in which cells are dispersed in, and crisscrossed by protein fibers.</p>
                    <p><strong>The ground substance:</strong> is the main component of the connective tissue, it is mainly composed of the extracellular material, it is usually fluid in nature such as blood, but it can also be mineralized and become solid, as in bones, the ground substance plays a major role in the functioning of the connective tissue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Protein fibers:</strong> There are three types of fibers in the intercellular matrix of connective tissue: (1) collagen fibers, (2) reticular fibers, and (3) elastic fibers</p>
                    <p><strong>Classification of connective tissues:</strong></p>
                    <p>Connective tissues are classified according to the characteristics of their ground substance and the types of fibers found within it into three main types:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Connective tissues proper:</strong> such as tendons, ligaments and adipose tissue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supportive connective tissues:</strong> such as bone and cartilage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fluid connective tissues:</strong> such as blood and lymph.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p><strong>Connective tissue proper:</strong> it includes two types of tissues:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Loose connective tissues</strong> they commonly lie between other tissues or between organs, binding them together such as Adipose tissue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dense connective tissues:</strong> such as
                        <ol>
                        <li><strong>Tendons:</strong> connect muscles to bones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ligaments:</strong> connect bones to other bones at joints.</li>

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                     <p><strong>Supportive connective tissues:</strong> provide strength and support to the body and protect soft tissues. Fibers of supportive connective tissue are densely packed in the ground substance. Supportive connective tissues include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Bone:</strong> it is the most rigid type of the connective tissues. It has an extremely hard ground substance of calcium salts, deposited around protein fibers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cartilage:</strong> it is a flexible type of connective tissue with special type of cells known as chondrocytes; these cells are dispersed in flexible rubbery gelatinous ground substance known as chondrin.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Fluid connective tissues:</strong> it is liquid in nature with circulating cells in extracellular matrix. There are two type of fluid connective tissue.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Blood:</strong> is a connective tissue composed of cells suspended in a liquid matrix called plasma.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lymph</strong> contains a liquid matrix and white blood cells.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>General Functions of connective tissues:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Connective tissues support and connect other tissues.</li>
                        <li>Protection is a major function of connective tissue, in the form of fibrous capsules and bones that protect delicate organs.</li>
                        <li>Transportation of fluid, gases, nutrients, waste products, and other chemical materials is the function fluid connective tissues, such as blood and lymph.</li>
                        <li>Fatty connective tissue store energy in the form of fat and contribute to the thermal insulation of the body.</li>

                    <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                    <p>When studying connective tissues, focus on how their composition (cells, fibers, ground substance) relates to their function. For example, the dense, regularly arranged collagen fibers in tendons provide high tensile strength, while the fluid nature of blood allows for efficient transport of substances.</p>

                    <h3>üìö Muscular tissues</h3>
                    <p><strong>Muscular tissues</strong> are highly specialized tissues for the production of tension which results in the generation of force that allows movement.</p>
                    <p><strong>Properties of Muscular tissue:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Muscle cells are <strong>contractile:</strong> they can shorten and generate a pulling force.</li>
                        <li>Muscle cells are <strong>excitable:</strong> they contract as a response to stimulation.</li>
                        <li>Muscles cause the <strong>bones to move:</strong> they are attached between two movable bones, when muscles contract between these bones, the bones start to move.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p><strong>Types of Muscular tissue:</strong> Muscular tissue is classified according their structure and function into three types:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Skeletal muscles.</li>
                        <li>Cardiac muscles.</li>
                        <li>Smooth muscles.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>The Skeletal muscles:</strong> are attached to the bones and their contraction leads to skeletal movement. 40% of body mass is made up of skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles generate heat as a byproduct of their contraction and thus participate in thermal homeostasis. Shivering is an involuntary contraction of skeletal muscles in response to low body temperature (Figure 3.10).</p>

                    <p><strong>The Cardiac muscles:</strong> form the contractile walls of the heart; they contract on their own intrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation. They pump blood through the body and under involuntary control (Figure 3.11).</p>

                    <h3>üìö The Nervous Tissue</h3>
                    <p><strong>Nervous Tissue</strong> is an excitable tissue and capable of sending and receiving electrochemical signals that provide the body with information.</p>
                    <p>There are two main classes of cells that make up nervous tissue:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The neuron</li>
                        <li>The neuroglia</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p><strong>The neurons:</strong> have got a characteristic morphology helps them to play their role as conducting cells, with three main parts (Figure: 3.13).</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The cell body includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus.</li>
                        <li>The dendrites branch off the cell body and appear as thin extensions.</li>
                        <li>The axon a long tail extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer known as myelin, which is formed by accessory cells.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <figure class="content-image">
                        <img src="/api/placeholder/600/300"

                     <p><strong>Myelin</strong> is a fatty white substance that surrounds the axon of some nerve cells, forming an electrically insulating layer.</p>
                    <p>The main purpose of a myelin sheath is to increase the speed at which impulses propagate along the myelinated fiber. Nerve pulses move as waves along unmyelinated fibers, but they "hop" or propagate by salutatory conduction, in myelinated fibers (Figure 3.14).</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p><strong>The Synapse:</strong> is the gap between nerve cells, or between a nerve cell and its target, such as a muscle or a gland, across which impulses are transmitted by chemical compounds known as neurotransmitters (Figure 3.15).</p>
                    <figure class="content-image">

                     <p><strong>The neurotransmitters:</strong> are chemical compounds known as chemical messengers, they transmit signals across the synapse, there are many different neurotransmitters including: dopamine, adrenaline, histamine and serotonin.</p>
                    <p><strong>The neuroglia:</strong> also known as glial cells. The word ‚Äúglia‚Äù comes from the Greek word for glue. long ago it was believed that neuroglia are glue like material that does not play any role in neuro-transmission, however recent advances have demonstrated that neuroglia are special types of non-neuronal cells that are part of the nervous system but does not convey pulses, they primarily support the neurons and play a key role in synapse formation and maintenance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Functions of Neuroglia:</strong> they have many vital functions, including:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Formation of myelin.</li>
                        <li>Provide nutrition for neurons, including oxygen.</li>
                        <li>Provide a general support structure for neurons.</li>
                        <li>Neuroglia provide protection for neurons by:</li>
                        <li>Destroying pathogens.</li>
                        <li>Formation of the blood-brain barrier, the membrane that separates the circulatory system from the brain.</li>
                        <li>Digest the parts of dead neurons.</li>
                        <li>It is very important to know that neuroglia do not convey nerve pulses.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Types of neuroglia:</strong> There are six main types of neuroglia:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Astrocytes.</li>
