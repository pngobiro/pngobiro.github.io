                    <p><b>Chemical notation</b> is a series of symbols and abbreviations used to demonstrate what occurs in a reaction. The chemical equation is the basic form of chemical notation and has two parts: <b>reactants</b> (the starting ingredients that will undergo the reaction) and <b>products</b> (the results of the chemical reaction).</p>
                    <p><b>Energy</b> is the capacity to do work or put matter into motion or fuel chemical reactions. There are two general forms of energy:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Potential energy</b>: Stored energy that can be released later to do work.</li>
                        <li><b>Kinetic energy</b>: Potential energy that has been released or set in motion to perform work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Energy is found in three forms in the human body: chemical, electrical, and mechanical.</p>
                    <p>Endergonic reactions require an input of energy. Products contain more energy than reactants.</p>
                    <p>Exergonic reactions release energy. Products have less energy than reactants.</p>
                    <p>Three fundamental processes that occur in the body to maintain homeostasis are: breaking down molecules, converting the energy in food to a usable form, and building new molecules.</p>
                    <p><b>Catabolic reactions</b> (decomposition reactions) occur when larger substances are broken down into smaller substances (AB ‚Üí A + B). These reactions are usually exergonic.</p>
                    <p><b>Exchange reactions</b> occur when one or more atoms from reactants are exchanged for one another (AB + CD ‚Üí AD + BC).</p>
                    <p><b>Oxidation-reduction reactions</b> (redox reactions) are a special kind of exchange reaction that occurs when electrons and energy are exchanged instead of atoms. The reactant that loses electrons is oxidized, while the reactant that gains electrons is reduced. Redox reactions are usually exergonic.</p>
                    <p><b>Anabolic reactions</b> (synthesis reactions) occur when small, simple subunits are united by chemical bonds to make larger, more complex substances (A + B ‚Üí AB). These reactions are endergonic.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                  <p>For a reaction to occur, atoms must collide with enough energy to overcome the repulsion of their electrons. This energy is called the <b>activation energy</b>. The following factors increase the likelihood of strong collisions:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><b>Concentration</b>: Higher reactant concentration increases the chance of successful collisions.</li>
                    <li><b>Temperature</b>: Higher temperature increases the kinetic energy of atoms, leading to more forceful and effective collisions.</li>
                    <li><b>Particle size and phase</b>: Smaller particles move faster than larger ones. Reactant particles in the gaseous phase have higher kinetic energy than those in the liquid or solid phase.</li>
                    <li><b>Catalyst</b>: A catalyst increases the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><b>Enzymes</b> are biological catalysts. Most are proteins with the following properties:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Speed up reactions by lowering the activation energy.</li>
                    <li>Highly specific for individual substrates (substances that bind to the enzyme's active site).</li>
                    <li>Do not alter the reactants or products.</li>
                    <li>Not permanently altered in the reactions they catalyze.</li>

                    <p><b>Inorganic compounds</b> generally do not contain carbon bonded to hydrogen. They include water, acids, bases, and salts.</p>
                    <p><b>Organic compounds</b> are defined as those that contain carbon bonded to hydrogen.</p>
                    <p><b>Water</b> (H2O) makes up 60-80% of the mass of the human body and has several important properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>High heat capacity: Absorbs heat without significantly changing temperature itself.</li>
                        <li>Carries heat with it when it evaporates.</li>
                        <li>Cushions and protects body structures because of its relatively high density.</li>
                        <li>Acts as a lubricant between two adjacent surfaces.</li>
                        <li>The body's primary solvent. Water is often called the universal solvent because so many solutes will dissolve in it entirely or to some degree.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Water is a polar covalent molecule. The oxygen pole is partially negative (Œ¥-), and the hydrogen pole is partially positive (Œ¥+). This allows water to interact with certain solutes, surround them, and keep them apart.</p>
                    <p>Water is only able to dissolve hydrophilic solutes (those with fully or partially charged ends). "Like dissolves like."</p>
                    <p>Solutes that do not have full or partially charged ends are known as hydrophobic and do not dissolve in water (e.g., oils, fats - uncharged nonpolar covalent molecules).</p>
