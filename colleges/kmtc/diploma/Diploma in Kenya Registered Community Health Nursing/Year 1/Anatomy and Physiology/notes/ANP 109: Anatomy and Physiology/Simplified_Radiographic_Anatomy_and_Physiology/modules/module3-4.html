                <h3>üìöThe Hip Joint</h3>
                <p>The hip joint is a ball and socket synovial joint, formed by the articulation between the acetabulum of the hip bone and the head of the femur.</p>
                <p>It represents a connection between the lower limb and the pelvic girdle, thus it is designed for weight-bearing and stability rather than of movement.</p>
                <p>The acetabulum is a cup shaped socket located on the inferolateral aspect of the hip bone, it is deepened by a fibrocartilaginous collar known as <strong>the acetabular labrum.</strong> The head of femur is hemispherical structure with smooth surface and covered with articular cartilage; it completely fits into the cavity of the acetabulum (Figure 13.1).</p>
                 <figure class="content-image">

                        <figcaption>Figure 13.1 Hip joint</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                 <p>An articular cartilage surrounds the articular surfaces of the head of the femur and the acetabulum; it is much stronger at weight bearing areas. There is strong, fibrous capsule attached to the edge of the acetabulum proximally, and on the distal part it is attached to the intertrochanteric line anteriorly and to the neck of the femur posteriorly.</p>
                <p>There is group of inner and outer ligaments attached to the hip joint to increase its stability; the inner ligaments are <strong>the head of femur ligament</strong> and <strong>transverse acetabular ligament,</strong> while the outer ligaments are <strong>Iliofemoral, Pubofemoral,</strong> and <strong>Ischiofemoral ligaments.</strong> Although these ligaments are strong and tough, they are loose enough to accommodate the high range of hip joint movement (Figure 13.1).</p>

                    <h3>üí° Pro Tip</h3>
                    <p>The hip joint is much more stable than the shoulder joint, due to the deeper socket (acetabulum) and stronger ligaments. However, this stability comes at the cost of some mobility compared to the shoulder.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <p><strong>The knee joint</strong></p>
                <p>The knee joint is a synovial hinge joint, formed by articulations between the patella, femur and tibia. It mainly allows for flexion and extension as well as small degree of medial and lateral rotation. Knee joint is composed of two articulations, <strong>the tibiofemoral articulation,</strong> connecting the distal femur to the proximal tibia, and the <strong>patellofemoral articulation,</strong> connecting the anterior portion of distal femur to the patella, knee joint is an unstable joint, thus it requires a great deal of support from tendons and muscles (Figure 13.2).</p>

                 <p><strong>Menisci:</strong></p>
                <p>The term "meniscus" is a Greek word means "crescent‚Äù, menisci of the knee joint are two crescent-shaped pads of fibrocartilaginous tissue lie between femur and tibia, they serve to disperse body weight and reduce friction during movement.,.</p>
                <p>The medial and lateral menisci sit between the tibiofemoral articulations, where they mainly articulate with the tibia. The thicker parts of menisci face the outer edges and they wedge into the centre of the tibiofemoral articulation to allow even distribution of pressure on the tibia. The medial meniscus is more C-shaped while the lateral is more circular. The medial meniscus is fixed to the medial collateral ligament and the joint</p>
                <p>capsule while the lateral meniscus does not have any extra attachments (Figure 13.3), rendering it fairly mobile. <strong>The transverse ligament</strong> (meniscomeniscal ligament) connects the anterior convex margin of the lateral meniscus to the anterior end of the medial meniscus; it holds the menisci in place during knee extension. <strong>The meniscofemoral ligaments</strong> attach the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus to the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle</p>

                <p><strong>Ligaments:</strong></p>
                <p>There are three major ligaments in the knee joint which are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Patellar ligament</li>
                    <li>Collateral ligaments</li>
                    <li>Cruciate Ligaments</li>
                </ol>
                 <p><strong>Patellar ligament:</strong> is the continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon distal to the patella. It attaches to the tibial tuberosity.</p>
                <p><strong>Collateral ligaments:</strong> are two strap-like ligaments:</p>
                <p>Medial collateral ligament</p>
                <p>Lateral collateral ligament</p>
                <p>They play major role in stabilizing the hinge motion of the knee joint by preventing excessive medial or lateral movement.</p>
                <p><strong>Medial collateral ligament:</strong> is a wide and flat ligament, located on the medial side of the knee joint, it is attached proximally to the medial epicondyle of the femur, and attached distally to the medial condyle of the tibia.</p>
                <p><strong>Lateral collateral ligament:</strong> is located on the lateral side of the knee joint, it is thinner and rounder than the medial collateral ligament, it is attached proximally to the lateral epicondyle of the femur, and attached distally to the lateral surface of the fibular head.</p>
                <p><strong>Cruciate Ligaments:</strong> ‚Äòcruciate‚Äô is a latin term means ‚Äúcross‚Äù, cruciate ligaments are two ligaments, anterior and posterior, they cross each other as they extend from the femur proximally and the tibia distally.</p>
                <p><strong>Anterior cruciate ligament:</strong> it is attached proximally to the intercondylar fossa of the femur and distally to the anterior intercondylar region of the tibia where it blends with the medial meniscus. It acts to prevents anterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur.</p>
                <p><strong>Posterior cruciate ligament:</strong> it is attached proximally to the anteromedial femoral condyle and distally to the posterior intercondylar region of the tibia. It acts to prevent posterior dislocation of the tibia onto the femur (Figure 13.3 & 13.4).</p>

                   <p><strong>Knee joint bursae:</strong> there are multiple bursae surrounding the knee joint, they facilitate movement and reduce friction where tendons or muscles pass over bony prominences. They can be either communicating or non-communicating with the knee joint itself. There are four bursae anterior to the knee joint:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Suprapatellar bursa: located between the femur and quadriceps femoris muscle.</li>

                    <h3>üìö The Tibiofibular Joints</h3>
                    <p>The proximal and distal tibiofibular joints refer to two articulations between the tibia and fibula of the leg. These two joints play a major role in stability and weight-bearing rather than movement (Figures 13.6 & 13.7).</p>
                     <p><strong>The Proximal Tibiofibular Joint:</strong></p>
                    <p>The proximal tibiofibular joint is a plane type synovial joint formed by articulation between the head of the fibula and the lateral condyle of the tibia.</p>
                    <p>The articular surfaces of the proximal tibiofibular joint are lined with hyaline cartilage and contained within a joint capsule.</p>
                    <p>The joint capsule receives additional support from:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Anterior and posterior superior tibiofibular ligaments which span between the fibular head and lateral tibial condyle.</li>
                    <li>Lateral collateral ligament of the knee joint.</li>
                    <li>Biceps femoris ‚Äì provides reinforcement as it inserts onto the fibular head (Figure 13.7).</li>

                    <p><strong>The Distal Tibiofibular joint:</strong> also known as (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is fibrous joint formed by articulation between the fibular notch of the distal tibia and the fibula.</p>
                    <p>As it is a fibrous joint, the distal tibiofibular joint does not have a joint capsule, it is supported by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interosseous membrane which spans the whole length of the tibia and fibula.</li>

                            <li>The <strong>medial and lateral menisci</strong> are C-shaped fibrocartilaginous discs located between the femoral condyles and the tibial plateau. They act as shock absorbers, distribute weight, and improve the congruency (fit) between the articulating surfaces of the femur and tibia.</li>
                                  
<li>The <strong>anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)</strong> prevents anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur, while the <strong>posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)</strong> prevents posterior displacement of the tibia. They cross each other within the knee joint, hence their name ("cruciate" means "cross-shaped").</li>
                            <li>The <strong>proximal tibiofibular joint</strong> is a plane synovial joint between the head of the fibula and the lateral condyle of the tibia. It allows for a small amount of gliding and rotation. The <strong>distal tibiofibular joint</strong> is a fibrous joint (syndesmosis) between the fibular notch of the tibia and the distal fibula. It allows for very little movement and primarily provides stability to the ankle joint.</li>

                <div class="content-block">
                     <p><strong>The Ankle Joint</strong></p>
                    <p>The ankle joint is a hinge type synovial joint formed by articulation between three bones; the bones of the leg (tibia and fibula) and the foot bone (talus). The tibia and fibula are strongly bound together by tibiofibular ligaments, and they form a bracket shaped socket known as a mortise into which the dome of the talus fits.</p>
                    <p>The medial malleolus of the tibia extends inferiorly to articulate with the talus on its medial aspect, and the lateral malleolus of the fibula articulate with the talus on its lateral aspect laterally.</p>

                    <p><strong>The ankle joint Ligaments:</strong> There are two main groups of ligaments; medial and lateral groups, which originate the medial and lateral malleoli respectively, they mainly stabilize the ankle joint, and act as a guide to direct the motion of the ankle joint by attaching the lateral malleolus to the bones below the ankle joint, and they are also responsible for resistance against over-inversion and over-eversion stress of the foot.</p>
                    <p><strong>Medial Ligament:</strong> also known as the deltoid ligament, it consists of four ligaments, which fan out from the medial malleolus and attached to the talus, calcaneus and navicular bones. Their primary action is to resist over-eversion stress of the foot (Figure 13.11).</p>
                    <p><strong>Lateral Ligament:</strong> it originates from the lateral malleolus and is consists of three distinct ligaments (Figure 13.12):</p>
                    <p>Anterior Talofibular: it spans between the lateral malleolus and lateral aspect of the talus.</p>
                    <p>Posterior Talofibular: it spans between the lateral malleolus and the posterior aspect of the talus.</p>
                    <p>Calcaneofibular: it spans between the lateral malleolus and the calcaneus.</p>
                    <p>The primary action of the lateral ligament is to resist over-inversion stress of the foot.</p>
