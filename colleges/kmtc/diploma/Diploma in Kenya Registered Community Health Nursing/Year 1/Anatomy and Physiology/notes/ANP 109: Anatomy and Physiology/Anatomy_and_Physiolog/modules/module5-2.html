                    <p><b>Diffusion</b>: The movement of solute molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration (down the concentration gradient) until <b>equilibrium</b> is reached.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Simple diffusion</b>: Involves mostly nonpolar solutes (e.g., oxygen, carbon dioxide, lipids, hydrocarbons) that are able to pass straight through the phospholipid bilayer without the need for membrane proteins.</li>
                        <li><b>Facilitated diffusion</b>: Involves charged or polar solutes (e.g., ions, glucose) that cross the phospholipid bilayer with the help of a membrane protein (either a carrier or a channel).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Osmosis</b>: Involves the movement of solvent (water) across a membrane from an area of lower solute concentration (higher water concentration) to an area of higher solute concentration (lower water concentration). Water moves across the plasma membrane either through water channels (<b>aquaporins</b>) or directly through the membrane itself in small amounts.</p>
                    <p><b>Osmotic pressure</b> is the driving force exerted by solute molecules that causes water to move from an area of low solute concentration to an area of high solute concentration.</p>
                    <p><b>Hydrostatic pressure</b> is the force that fluids exert, pushing on a surface.</p>

                    <p><b>Active transport</b> requires energy in the form of ATP to move solutes against their concentration gradients (from low to high concentration). Both primary and secondary active transport use plasma membrane carrier proteins called <b>pumps</b>.</p>
                    <p><b>Primary active transport</b>: A pump in the plasma membrane binds and transports a solute against its concentration gradient using the energy from the hydrolysis of ATP.

                    <p><b>Secondary active transport</b>: Uses ATP indirectly. ATP is used to create and maintain a concentration gradient of one substance. Then, the potential energy of that gradient is used to power the transport of another substance against its gradient.</p>
