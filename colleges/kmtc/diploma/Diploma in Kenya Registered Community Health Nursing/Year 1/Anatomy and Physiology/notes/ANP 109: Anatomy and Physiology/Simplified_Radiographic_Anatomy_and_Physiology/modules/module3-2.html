                 <h3>üìö Radius and Ulna</h3>
                    <p>Radius and ulna are the bones of the forearm. They extend from the elbow proximally to the wrist distally.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Radius:</strong></p>
                    <p>It is the lateral of the two bones of the forearm; it extends from the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel to the ulna. The proximal end of the radius is a disc-shaped structure known as <strong>the head of the radius.</strong> The superior surface of the head of the radius articulates with the capitulum of the humerus as part of the elbow joint, and the lateral margin of the head of the radius articulates with a shallow depression on the medial side of the proximal ulna known as <strong>the radial notch of the ulna</strong> at the proximal radioulnar joint. A narrow region lies immediately distal to the radial head known as <strong>the neck of the radius.</strong> Inferiorly there an oval-shaped, bony protuberance acts as a muscular attachment point located on the medial side of the radius known as <strong>the radial tuberosity.</strong> On the medial side of the shaft of the radius there is small ridge forms <strong>the interosseous border of the radius,</strong> it is for the attachment of interosseous membrane. The interosseous membrane is a sheet of dense connective tissue extends between the radius and ulna to unite these two bones. The distal end of the radius expands to form a rectangular end; it has two smooth facets, for articulation with the scaphoid and lunate carpal bones at the radiocarpal joint or wrist joint. On the medial surface of the distal end of the radius, there is shallow concavity known as <strong>the ulnar notch of the radius,</strong> it articulates with the head of the ulna, to form the distal radioulnar joint. The lateral side of the distal end of the radius has a projection known as <strong>the styloid process of the radius;</strong> it provides attachment for ligaments that support the lateral side of the wrist joint.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Ulna:</strong></p>
                    <p>It is the medial bone of the forearm; it extends, parallel to the radius, from the medial side of the elbow to the medial side of the wrist. At the proximal end of the ulna there is wrench shaped area known as <strong>the trochlear notch</strong>, it articulates with the trochlea of the humerus at the medial side of the elbow joint. The lower margin of the trochlear notch is formed by a boney prominence known as <strong>the coronoid process,</strong> and the upper margin of the trochlear notch is formed by a boney tip extends from <strong>the olecranon process</strong> which form the posterior and superior portions of the proximal ulna.</p>
                    <p>Inferior to the trochlear notch there is a roughened area known as <strong>the ulnar tuberosity,</strong> it is the attachment area for brachialis muscle. Inferolateral to the trochlear notch, is the location of <strong>radial notch of the ulna,</strong> it is the articulation site between the proximal radius and ulna, to form the proximal radioulnar joint.</p>
                    <p>On the lateral side of the shaft of the ulna, there is a ridge for the attachment of the interosseous membrane of the forearm, it is known as <strong>the interosseous border of the ulna.</strong> At the distal end of the ulna there is small, rounded bony prominence known as <strong>the head of the ulna.</strong> On the posterior side of the head of the ulna there is short bony</p>

                <p>Shoulder joint, also known as Glenohumeral joint, it is the multiaxial ball-and-socket synovial joint formed by the articulation of the head of the humerus with the glenoid cavity of the scapula, which is deepened and slightly enlarged by the glenoid labrum, a fibrocartilage ring attaching to the outside margin of the glenoid fossa (Figure 10.1).</p>

                    <p><strong>The capsule of the shoulder joint:</strong></p>
                    <p>As a synovial joint, the shoulder joint has a capsule surrounds the joint cavity and encloses synovial fluid that lubricates the articular surfaces of the joint, it is attached medially to the outer margin of the glenoid fossa and laterally to the anatomical neck of the humerus, just distal to the head of the humerus. This capsule is loose inferiorly, and lies in folds during full adduction of the arm, these folds allow for abduction of the arm, during which they become taught (Figure 10.2).</p>

                    <p>The bursa is a fluid filled sac provides cushioning between joint structures to protect the joint capsule from wear. The glenohumeral joint has a number of bursae that protect the joint capsule from excessive wear from overlying structures. The most common of which is the subacromial bursa which lies between the acromion process of the scapula and the supraspinatus muscle. Subscapular bursa protects the joint capsule and the muscle tendon of the supraspinatus muscle from wear from the acromion process during arm abduction. Subscapular bursa lies between the tendon of subscapularis muscle and the scapula. It reduces wear and tear on the subscapularis tendon during shoulder joint movement (Figure 10.3).</p>

                   <p><strong>Elbow joint</strong></p>
                    <p>The elbow is the joint connecting the upper arm to the forearm. It is classed as a hinge-type synovial joint. It is the articulation point of the humerus and the radius and the ulna. The elbow joint consists of two separate articulations:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Humeroulnar joint between the trochlea on the medial aspect of the distal end of the humerus and the trochlear notch on the proximal ulna.</li>
                        <li>Humeroradial joint between the capitulum on the lateral aspect of the distal end of the humerus with the head of the radius.</li>
                    </ol>
                     <p>These two joints give the elbow its characteristic hinge like properties. The rounded surfaces of the capitulum of the humerus rotate against the concave surfaces of the head of the radius, and the wrench shape of the trochlear notch of the ulna moves around the trochlea of the humerus (Figure 10.6).</p>

                    <p>The pelvic girdle is formed by the two hip bones; it connects the bones of the lower limb to the axial skeleton. The bones are firmly attached to the axial skeleton via the sacrum of the vertebral column; they also converge anteriorly to attach to each other. The pelvic girdle is part of the bony pelvis which is composed of the two hip bones, the sacrum and the coccyx (Figure 11.1). The bones of the pelvis are strongly attached to each other to form a strong immobile, weight-bearing structure providing a stable foundation for the upper body as the pelvis transfers the body weight from the vertebral column, through the pelvic girdle into the lower limbs.</p>

                    <p>The ilium is the widest, largest and the superior of the three parts of the hip bone. The body of the ilium forms the superior part of the acetabulum (acetabular roof). Immediately above the acetabulum, the ilium expands to form the wing.</p>
                    <p>The ilium has two surfaces provide muscular attachment. The inner surface has a concave shape produces <strong>the iliac fossa.</strong> The external surface has a convex shape.</p>
                    <p>The ilium has a superior thickened margin known as <strong>the iliac crest;</strong> it extends anteriorly from a bony prominence known as <strong>the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)</strong> to a posterior bony prominence known as <strong>the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS).</strong> There is an indentation on the posteroinferior aspect of the ilium known as <strong>the greater sciatic notch;</strong> it lies between the posterior inferior iliac spine (above), and the ischial spine (below).</p>
                   <p><strong>The Pubis:</strong></p>
                    <p>The Pubis: is the most anterior portion of the hip bone. It consists of:</p>

                    <p><strong>The Pubic body:</strong> is located medially, it articulates with the opposite pubic body at the <strong>pubic symphysis.</strong> Its superior aspect is marked by a rounded thickening known as the <strong>pubic crest,</strong> which extends laterally as the <strong>pubic tubercle.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>The Superior pubic ramus:</strong> extends laterally from the body to form part of the acetabulum.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Inferior pubic ramus:</strong> projects towards the ischium. Together, the superior and inferior rami enclose part of the <strong>Obturator foramen,</strong> through which the obturator nerve, artery and vein pass through to reach the lower limb.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Ischium:</strong></p>
                    <p>The Ischium forms the posteroinferior part of the hip bone; it is composed of</p>
