\section*{Introduction}
- largest \& most complex joint of the body
- Patients commonly presents knee pain/ swelling/ deformity/ instability or any of the above combinations.
- Injured more frequently than any other joint
- Vulnerable to injury in practically all activities.
- Stability depends almost entirely on its associated ligaments and muscles

\section*{Properties of the Knee Joint}

Weight bearing (fixed) - foot in contact with ground and the limb is supporting body weight
- Femur moves on a fixed tibia- Deep knee bends
- Non Weight bearing (free) - foot free of ground and the limb is unable to support weight of body
- Tibia free to move on a fixed femur

\section*{Bursae-Ant, ant \& med}
- Prepatellar- superficial to the patella/ housemaid's knee
- Subcut.Infrapatellar- superficial to the lower part of the tuberosity of the tibia/Clergyman's
- Deep Infrapatellar- Deep to the ligamentum; swelling not pronounced
- Suprapatellar- Supported by the Articularis genu muscle during knee movements

\section*{Bursae- Lateral}
- Deep to lateral head of the Gastrocnemius (GN) (may communicate with joint)
- between the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of the Biceps;
- between the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of the Popliteus
- Popliteus bursa- between the lateral condyle of the tibia and tendon of the Popliteus

\section*{Bursae- Medial superficial}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-07.jpg?height=508&width=610&top_left_y=1&top_left_x=1870)
- GN bursa-Deep to medial head of the GN
- Semimembranosus (SM) bursa- between the tendon of the (SM) and medial head of GN. Freq. a prolongation of the GN bursa (often communicates with the joint)
- Occasionally, bursa between the tendon of the (SM) the tendon of Semitendinosus (ST)

\section*{[Classification- complex \& Compound}

\section*{Knee Anatomy}
- The Knee Joint is the largest \& complex joint in the body .
- It consists of 3 Joints:
1) Medial Condylar Joint : Between the medial condyle "of the femur" \& the medial condyle "of the tibia" .
2) Latral Condylar Joint : Between the lateral condyle "of the femur" \& the lateral condyle "of the tibia" .
3) Patellofemoral Joint : Between the patella \& the patellar surface of the femur.
- The fibula is NOT directly involved in the joint .

\section*{Surface anatomy}
- Slight gap on each side of the corresponding to space between femoral and tibial condyles
- The joint lies deep to the apex of the patellar
- The articular capsule lies very superficial along the depressions seen on either side of the patellar ligt.

\section*{Femoral condyles}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-12.jpg?height=1299&width=2246&top_left_y=473&top_left_x=92)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-13.jpg?height=574&width=2322&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=0)
Central portions of the medial and lateral facets articulate with the condyles of the femur,
While their peripheral portions support the menisci of the knee-joint
Between the articular facets, is the intercondyloid eminence (spine of

Intercondyloid eminence
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-13.jpg?height=575&width=728&top_left_y=1218&top_left_x=0) tibia),
Spine is the only bony stability factor which prevents sideways gliding of femur onto the tibia.

\section*{Patellofemoral joint}
- Articulation between the femur and patella is a plane joint where the patella glides on the femoral trochlea
- Vastus medialis is indispensible to the stability of the patellar
- Forces in this joint vary with activity

\section*{Q angle}

Determining Q-Angle

A measure of the axis of pull of the quadriceps tendon \& that of the ligament of the patella.
- Normal AlignmentSlight valgus position
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-15.jpg?height=1366&width=830&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=1521)

- Somewhat greater in females than males. The normal Q angle is < 20deg in men; 25deg in women.
- A greater than normal means the patella will track in a lateral direction rubbing against the lateral femoral condyle causing Patella pain

\section*{Capsule- 4 special features}
- Anterior- Deficient; Replaced by patella and ligamentum patella
- Antero-Superior- Capsule perforates, when the infant walks, to communicate with the suprapatellar bursa
- Postero-lat- Gap for passage of tendon of popliteus
- Posterior- Occasional gaps for other bursae

\section*{Synovial Membrane}
- largest in the body.
- Lines the capsule except posteriorly where it is reflected anteriorly by the cruciate ligts, to form a common vascular invagination
- Deficient anteriorly

\section*{Ligaments- Stability role}
- The cruciate ligaments enable the knee to both roll and slide for maximum motion while maintaining contact and stability.
- While the collateral ligaments provide side-to-side stability.
- Medial stability is provided mainly by the MCL,

\section*{Ligaments- Lateral stability}

- Named anterior and posterior, from the position of their attachments to the tibia
- Both indispensable to A/P stability in flexion

\section*{Cruciate ligament}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-29.jpg?height=708&width=626&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=1387)

ACL injuries occur when bones of the leg twist in opposite directions under full body weight
prevents anterior movement of the tibia on the femur.
- checks external rotation of the tibia in flexion and to a degree checks hyperextension of the knee.
- PCL
stronger, shorter and less oblique in its direction.
- Prevents posterior displacement of tibia on femur.

\section*{Properties of menisci}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-30.jpg?height=328&width=708&top_left_y=91&top_left_x=1776)
- Composed of fibrocartilage and covers the sup. surface of the tibial condyles.
- Act as swabs to lubricate the joint cavity
- Adapt or increase the contact surface area (congruent) between the round femoral condyles and the relatively flat tibial plateau on the medial side, and the convex tibial plateau on the lateral side

\section*{Properties of menisci}
- play an important role in load transmission
- shock absorbers for the knee by spreading compression forces from the femur over a wider area on the tibia
- Additional sensory function for better stability of the knee joint
- Flexion/ extension occur in the upper compartment
- Rotations in the lower compartment (fruit bat has no menisci nor popliteus muscle)

\section*{menisci}

- peripheral border is thick, vascular, convex, and attached to the capsule of the joint; inner border is thin, avscular, concave, and free.
- Nourished by synovial fluid

\section*{menisci}
- The upper surfaces of the menisci are concave, their lower surfaces are flat, and rest upon the head of the tibia;
- Each covers peripheral two-thirds of the articular surface of the tibia.

\section*{Relations of Knee}
- Anterior, antero-medial \& antero-lateral
- Quadriceps femoris muscles
- Ligamentum patellae complex
- Posterior, postero-medial \& postero-lateral-
- Boundaries of Popliteal fossa
- Contents of Popliteal fossa.

\section*{Important subcut. relations}

- Sural nerve, br of tibial
- Post. cut,. Nerve of the thigh
- Small saphenous vein
- Medial
- Great saphenous vein
- Infra-patellar branches of saphenous nerve
- Lateral- Common peroneal nerve

\section*{Movements}
- the axis around which motion takes place is not a fixed one, but shifts forward during extension and backward during flexion;
- the commencement of flexion and the end of extension are accompanied by rotatory movements associated with the fixation of the limb in a position of great stability

\section*{Movements}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-37.jpg?height=935&width=959&top_left_y=553&top_left_x=0)

Extension -Quadriceps.F Flexion by the Biceps femoris, Semitendinosus, and Semimembranosus, assisted by the Gracilis, Sartorius, Gastrocnemius, Popliteus, and Plantaris.

\section*{Rotation}

Rotation outward is by the Biceps femoris, and rotation inward by the Popliteus, Semitendinosus and, to a slight extent, the Semimembranosus, the Sartorius, and the Gracilis.

\section*{Rotation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-39.jpg?height=1153&width=450&top_left_y=463&top_left_x=317)
- The Popliteus at the commencement of the movement of flexion; by its contraction the leg is rotated inward in a fixed femur,
- or, if the tibia be fixed, the thigh is rotated outward, and the knee-joint is unlocked

\section*{Locking- principles}

Permits standing upright with little expenditure of energy in the form of muscle contraction
Articular surface of the medial femoral condyle is longer than the surface on the lateral femoral condyle

\section*{Extension:- Pre-locking}
- Moving into extension from a flexed position
- Articular surface of lateral femoral condyle stops
- Surface for articulation still exposed on medial condyle

\section*{Locking}
- Medial Rotation accompanies final stages of extension
- Accommodates remainder of exposed articular surface on medial femoral condyle
- Promotes greater contact between articular surfaces of femoral and tibial condyles
- Tightens collateral and cruciate ligaments

\section*{Locking}
- Locked position is brought about by medial rotation of the femur on the tibia during final stages of extension
- Promotes maximum contact between articular surfaces of femoral and tibial condyles
- Renders ligaments taut
- Ligaments maintain the joint in the stable (extended) position

\section*{Clinical anatomy of the Leg ]}
- Osteology
- Tibiofibular articulations
- Deep fascia of the leg
- Compartments and applied aspects
- Entrapment of nerves and vessels.
- Applied anatomy.

\section*{Tibia}
- Significant part is subcutaneous
- poor muscle cover (surrounded by tendons).
- A rather proximally placed nutrient foramenposterior tibial artery.
- Commonly fractured bone with poor healing properties
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-49.jpg?height=1701&width=797&top_left_y=1&top_left_x=1702)

\section*{Fibula}
- Strut, key in formation \& stability of AJ
- Good muscle cover - peroneal artery.
- Little contribution in weight bearing in the presence of an intact normal tibia \& therefore may be sacrificed for transplant.
- It may also be used to bear weight in absence of the tibia (tibiarization of the fibula)

\section*{Joints}
- Proximal tibio-fibula joint (synovialplanar)
- Middle tibio-fibula (fibrousinterosseous membrane)
Distal tibio-fibula (fibroussyndesmosis

\section*{extremity syndesmosis (DLES).}
- Key in ankle joint stability.
Anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments
Inferior transverse tibiofibular ligament
Distal portion of the interosseous membrane

\section*{Modifications fascia cruris}
- Anterior \& posterior intermuscular septae that help comparmentalize the leg.
- Retinacula-
- Sup \& inf.extensor retinacula
- Sup \& inf peroneal retinacula
- Flexor retinaculum.
- Prevent bowstringing of tendons.

\section*{Functions of fascia cruris}
- Crucial in venous return of the lower limb.
- Attachment of muscles.
- Allow muscles to function efficiently
- Efficient tendon pulls by avoiding bowstringing.

\section*{_Osteo/musculofascial compartments}

\section*{Compartment syndrome}
- fracture of the tibia or fibula with muscle swelling or blood clot.
- Increase in the intracompartmental pressures results in compression of arteries/veins \& nerves.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-56.jpg?height=498&width=530&top_left_y=644&top_left_x=1967)
- pain, pallor, paralysis, paresthesiae \& pulselessness (5Ps)
- If unattended results in limb death and amputation
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-56.jpg?height=421&width=1379&top_left_y=1454&top_left_x=959)

- The common peroneal nerve is commonly in fractures of the neck of the fibula e.g police baton injury(Policeman's nerve)
- It may also be entrappment in the fibres of peroneus longus muscle in this area.
- The ankle dorsiflexors are denervated.

\section*{Varicose veins}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-59.jpg?height=732&width=680&top_left_y=4&top_left_x=1816)
- Elongated, dilated \& tortuous superficial veins.
- Causes
- Incompetence of the valves at either the sapheno-femoral or sapheno-popliteal junctions or both.
- Incompetent valves in perforators
- Blocked deep veins
- Their association with pregnancy is due to pressure of the gravid uterus on big veins in the Pelvis.

Which of these legs may have varicose veins?
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_9c97980dbc675651c33bg-60.jpg?height=1022&width=2179&top_left_y=656&top_left_x=180)

Answer: All of the above

\section*{Venous cut down}
- Where it is difficult to locate superficial veins for intravenous fluid/blood/drug administration.
- Long saphenous vein runs a finger breadth anterior to the summit of the medial malleolus.
- This vein is surgically accessed her for cannulation.

\section*{Vessels}
- Artery accompanied by a pair of veins, each on either side of the artery (venae commitantes).
- The posterior tibial gives off the peroneal artery that runs along the fibula end of the membrane deep to flexor hallucis longus.
- Before its termination, the popliteal artery gives off sural branches to each head of gastrocnemius muscle. These are end arteries.

\section*{Innervation}
- sciatic nerve EXCEPT two cutaneous nerves
- The posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh \& the saphenous nerve (femoral)
- This explains why loss of the sciatic nerve may indicate leg amputation.

\section*{Dermatomes}
- Clinically assess the level of spinal cord segment or spinal nerve root that is compressed in disease
- Compression of L5 (part of deep peroneal nerve innervates EHL)
- loss/reduced sensation of the skin of lateral aspect of the leg
- +/- weakness in extension of the hallux.

Facial nerve

\section*{Processes}

\section*{The gland is an irregular lobulated mass, sends 'processes' in various directions. These include:}
- Glenoid process, that extends upward behind the temporomandibular joint, in front of external auditory meatus
- Facial process, that extends anteriorly onto the masseter muscle
- Accessory process (part), small part of facial process lying along the parotid duct
- Pterygoid process, that extends forward from the deeper part, lies between the medial pterygoid muscle \& the ramus of mandible
- Carotid process, that lies posterior to the external carotid artery
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_492e7b798cd711352d5eg-07.jpg?height=1121&width=1187&top_left_y=511&top_left_x=1240)

\section*{Capsules}
- The parotid gland is enclosed in two capsules:
- An inner connective tissue capsule
- An outer dense fibrous capsule derived from the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia
- The deep cervical fascia extends upward, reaches the inferior border of parotid gland, splits into the superficial \& the deep layer, to enclose the gland
- Above the gland, the:
- Superficial layer gets attached to the zygomatic arch
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_492e7b798cd711352d5eg-08.jpg?height=677&width=677&top_left_y=510&top_left_x=1741)
- Deep layer gets attached to the tympanic plate of temporal bone
A portion of fascia extending from the styloid process to the angle of mandible is called stylomandibular ligament. It separates the parotid gland from the submandibular gland

\section*{Relations}
- Superficial (lateral):
- Skin \& superficial fascia
- Great auricular nerve
- Parotid lymph nodes

- about a fingerbreadth below the zygomatic arch
- accompanied by the:
- transverse facial vessels \& upper zygomatic branches of facial nerve above
- lower zygomatic branches of facial nerve below
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_492e7b798cd711352d5eg-15.jpg?height=1034&width=1025&top_left_y=452&top_left_x=1324)
- Turns around the anterior border of masseter muscle

\section*{Clinical Anatomy}
- Parotid duct being a superficial structure, is prone to get damaged in injuries, or during surgical procedures on the face
- Parotid neoplasms (malignant) are very invasive and quickly involve the facial nerve causing facial palsy
- Inflammation of parotid gland results in painful swelling because of a tight capsule enclosing the gland. The swollen glenoid process exaggerates this pain on chewing
- Frey's syndrome: a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of localized facial flushing and/or sweating in the area over the parotid gland in response to gustatory stimuli
- This is due to aberrant nerve regeneration after injury (a communication develops between the auriculo-temporal \& greater

\section*{Mandibular nerve}
- Arises from the trigeminal ganglion in the middle cranial fossa.
- Immediately receives the motor root of the trigeminal nerve
- Leaves the cranium Through the foramen ovale into the infratemporal fossa.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_b63cc7346c63efe57df2g-11.jpg?height=1063&width=1425&top_left_y=812&top_left_x=1499)

\section*{Mandibular nerve}
- The mandibular nerve contains GSA and SVE fibers.
- Branches of CN V3 supply the four muscles of mastication but not the buccinator, which is supplied by the facial nerve.

\section*{Branches within the infratemporal fossa is divided int0 3 groups:}

\section*{1 Branches arising from the trunk}

Spinous nerve
Medial pterygoid nerve
2) Anterior branches

Buccal nerve
Masseteric nerve
Deep temporal nerves
Lateral pterygoid nerve
3) Posterior branches

Auriculotemporal nerve

Inferior alveolar nerve
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_b63cc7346c63efe57df2g-14.jpg?height=1817&width=2467&top_left_y=10&top_left_x=408)

The spinous nerve passes through the spinous foramen and enters the cranium. It is a sensory nerve innervating the dura mater.

The medial pterygoid nerve innervates the medial pterygoid muscle, tensor veli palatini muscle and the tensor tympani muscle.

Buccal nerve, masseteric nerve, deep temporal nerves, lateral pterygoid nerve innervate the muscles with the same name except the buccal nerve.

Buccal nerve is sensory and innervates the inner surface of the cheek.

Auriculotemporal nerve
- Supplies sensory fibers to the auricle and temporal region.
- Also sends articular (sensory) filbers to the TMJ.
- Conveys postsynaptic parasympathetic secretomotor fibers from the otic ganglion to the parotid gland.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_b63cc7346c63efe57df2g-16.jpg?height=1013&width=1426&top_left_y=854&top_left_x=1490)

\section*{The inferior alveolar nerve}
enters the mandibular foramen and passes through the mandibular canal, forming the inferior dental plexus, which sends branches to all mandibular teeth on its side.

The terminal branch of the inferior alveolar nerve is the mental nerve which passes through the mental foramen.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_b63cc7346c63efe57df2g-17.jpg?height=1201&width=1141&top_left_y=674&top_left_x=1777)

\section*{Skin of the Neck}
- Normally under tension, with variation in direction of greatest tension.
- in the living face these lines often coincide with wrinkle lines.
- Lines of greatest tension have been termed 'relaxed skin tension lines',
- Surgical incisions are made along these lines for minimal postoperative scarring.
- Susceptible individuals are more prone to keloid scarring in the head and neck region.
- Cutaneous vascular supply and lymphatic drainage
- from the facial, occipital, posterior auricular and subclavian arteries.
- form a rich network within platysma and in the subdermal plexus,
- account for the viability of the various skin flaps raised during block dissection of the neck

Gluck-Sorenson U-shape Apron Incision

\section*{Paralysis of the Platysma}
- Anatomical basis
- results from injury to the cervical branch of the facial nerve
- causes the skin to fall away from the neck in slack folds.
- Prevention
- preserve the cervical branch of the facial nerve.
- careful suturing of the skin and edges of the platysma.
- Clinical significance
- the skin wound is distracted (pulled in different directions) by the contracting platysma muscle fibers,
- a broad ugly scar may develop.

\section*{Congenital Torticollis}
- results from a fibrous tissue tumor (L. fibromatosis colli) of the SCM before or shortly after birth.
- causes the head to tilt toward, and the face to turn away from, the affected side
- Clinical significance
- the position of the infant's head necessitates a breech delivery.
- Injury to SCM when an infant's head is pulled too much during a difficult birth, tearing its fibers (muscular torticollis)
- Anatomical Basis
- Formation of a hematoma with entrapment of a branch of the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) which denervates part of the SCM.
- The stiffness and twisting of the neck results from fibrosis and shortening of the SCM.
- Solution
- Surgical release of the SCM from its inferior attachments to the manubrium and clavicle inferior to the level of CN XI

\section*{Spasmodic Torticollis}
- Clinical significance
- cervical dystonia (abnormal tonicity of the cervical muscles) usually begins in adulthood.
- Anatomical basis
- It may involve any bilateral combination of lateral neck muscles, especially the SCM and trapezius.
- Characteristics
- sustained turning, tilting, flexing, or extending of the neck
- Shifting the head laterally or anteriorly can occur involuntarily
- The shoulder is usually elevated and displaced anteriorly on the side to which the chin turns.

\section*{Suprahyoid Neck Spaces}
- Pharyngeal Mucosal Space
- Parapharyngeal Space
- Masticator Space
- Parotid Space
- Carotid Space
- Long space from skull base to arch of aorta
- Retropharyngeal Space
- Long space from skull base to about T3 level in chest
- Danger Space
- A potential space composed of fat, extends down to the mediastinum
- Perivertebral Space

\section*{Infrahyoid Neck Spaces}
- These spaces continue largely unchanged from above the hyoid:
- Carotid Space
- Retropharyngeal Space
- Danger Space
- Perivertebral Space
- Two new major spaces
- Visceral Space
- Posterior Cervical Space

\section*{Subclavian Vein Puncture - Infraclavicular Approach \\ - Landmarks}

- middle part of the clavicle
- jugular notch in the manubrium
- sternoclavicular joint
- Anatomical basis
- The needle puncture is inferior to middle of the clavicle and is advanced medially toward the jugular notch until the right venous angle
- Here the internal jugular and subclavian veins merge to form the brachiocephalic vein.
- Clinical Significance
- puncture the pleura and lung, resulting in pneumothorax.
- If inserted too far posteriorly, it may enter the subclavian artery.

\section*{Intravenous access to External Jugular Vein}

\section*{Prominence of the External Jugular Vein}
- Purpose
- May serve as an internal barometer.
- Anatomical basis
- Normal EJV pressure usually visible above the clavicle for only a short distance.
- venous pressure rises (e.g. in heart failure), prominent vein throughout its course along the side of the neck.
- Clinical Significance

- Diagnostic signs of heart failure, SVC obstruction, enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes, increased intrathoracic pressure.

\section*{Severance of the External Jugular Vein}
- Surface Anatomy
- along the posterior border of the SCM where it pierces the roof of the lateral cervical region (e.g., by a knife slash)
- Clinical significance
- Negative intrathoracic pressure sucks air into the vein resulting in a venous air embolism
- Anatomical basis

- Lumen is held open by the tough investing layer of deep cervical fascia

\section*{Lesions of the Spinal Accessory Nerve}
- Causes
- Penetrating trauma, such as a stab or bullet wound.
- Surgical procedures in the lateral cervical region.
- Tumors at the cranial base
- cancerous cervical lymph nodes.
- Fractures of the jugular foramen where CN XI leaves the cranium.
- Clinical picture
- a unilateral lesion usually does not produce an abnormal position of the head.
- weakness in turning the head to the opposite side against resistance.
- weakness and atrophy of the trapezius, impairing neck movements.
- inability to elevate and retract the shoulder
- difficulty in elevating the upper limb superior to the horizontal level.
- Reduced normal prominence in the neck produced by the trapezius
- Drooping of the shoulder

\section*{Phrenic Nerve Injury}
- Results in paralysis of the corresponding half of the diaphragm
- A phrenic nerve block produces a short period of paralysis of the diaphragm on one side (e.g., for a lung operation).
- A surgical phrenic nerve crush (e.g., compressing the nerve injuriously with forceps) produces a longer period of paralysis (sometimes for weeks after surgical repair of a diaphragmatic hernia).
- accessory phrenic nerve must also be crushed

- Regional anesthesia cervical plexus block
- injected at several points along the posterior border of the SCM, mainly the nerve point of the neck
- Anesthesia of the upper limb - a supraclavicular brachial plexus block
- injected around the supraclavicular part of the brachial plexus, superior to the midpoint of the clavicle.

Why is this procedure NOT performed on persons with pulmonary or cardiac disease?

\section*{Ligation of the External Carotid Artery}
- Purpose
- to control bleeding from one of its relatively inaccessible branches.
- Clinical significance
- decreases blood flow through the artery and its branches but does not eliminate it.
- Anatomical basis
- Blood flows in a retrograde direction from the other side through communications between its branches and across the midline.
- the descending branch of the occipital
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_6f19efa458c6cc276c9fg-23.jpg?height=1145&width=1524&top_left_y=376&top_left_x=1747) artery provides the main collateral circulation
- anastomosing with the vertebral and deep cervical arteries.

\section*{Surgical Dissection of the Carotid Triangle}
- Purpose
- surgical approach to the carotid system of arteries.
- Anatomical basis
- provides access to the IJV, the vagus and hypoglossal nerves, and the cervical sympathetic trunk.
- Clinical significance
- Damage or compression of the vagus and/or recurrent laryngeal nerves may produce an alteration in the voice because these nerves supply laryngeal muscles.

\section*{Carotid Pulse}
- Surface anatomy
- in a groove between the trachea and the infrahyoid muscles.
- Usually easily palpated just deep to the anterior border of the SCM at the level of the superior border of the thyroid cartilage.
- Is routinely checked during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_6f19efa458c6cc276c9fg-25.jpg?height=898&width=1026&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=1715)
- Clinical Significance
- Absence of a carotid pulse indicates cardiac arrest.

\section*{Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity}
- Is exceptional responsiveness of the carotid sinuses in various types of vascular disease
- external pressure on the carotid artery may cause
- slowing of the heart rate,
- a fall in blood pressure,
- cardiac ischemia
- fainting (syncope) from sudden and critical decrease in cerebral perfusion
- Clinical Significance
- Checking carotid pulse is not recommended for people with cardiac or vascular disease.
- Alternate sites, such as the radial artery at the wrist, should be used

\section*{Internal Jugular Pulse}
- Surface Anatomy
- pulsations are transmitted through the surrounding tissue and may be observed beneath the SCM superior to the medial end of the clavicle.
- Anatomical basis
- Because there are no valves in the brachiocephalic vein or the superior vena cava, a wave of contraction passes up these vessels to the inferior bulb of the IJV.
- The pulsations are especially visible when the person's head is inferior to the lower limbs (the Trendelenburg position).
- Clinical Significance
- The internal jugular pulse increases considerably in tricuspid valve disease because of increase in pressure in the pulmonary circulation and the right side of the heart.
- Use the right IJV because it runs a straighter, more direct course to the right atrium than does the left

\section*{Internal Jugular Vein Puncture}
- Surface Anatomy
- palpate the common carotid artery and insert the needle into the IJV just lateral to it at a $30^{\circ}$ angle
- aim at the apex of the triangle between the sternal and the clavicular heads of the SCM (lesser supraclavicular fossa)
- directed inferolaterally
- Clinical Significance
- Catheterization for central

\section*{CLINICAL ANATOMY OF THE SCALP}

MBChB/BDS/MMED/MDS
- Definition
- Anatomy and its clinical aspects

\section*{Defn / Description}

It is the soft tissue covering of the norma verticalis (vault of the skull)

\section*{It extends:}
- Posteriorly, from the superior nuchal lines of the occipital bone
- Anteriorly, from the supraorbital margin of the frontal bone
- Laterally, over the temporal fascia, to the zygomatic arches

\section*{SCALP}

S - SKIN (Layer 1)
C - CONNECTIVE TISSUE (DENSE) (L2)

A - APONEUROSIS (GALEA) (L3)
L - LOOSE CONNECTIVE TISSUE (L4)

P - PERICRANIUM (L5)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_a52fbea2cbfba1db092cg-04.jpg?height=1192&width=1825&top_left_y=331&top_left_x=1384)

\section*{Scalp Proper}
- Encompasses layers 1,2,3.
- Considered as one unit
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_a52fbea2cbfba1db092cg-06.jpg?height=1251&width=2093&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=650)

\section*{Layer 1 - Skin}
- It is thick, hairy with numerous sebaceous and sweat glands.
- Obstruction of the ducts of the sebaceous glands by secretions form Sebaceous cysts.
- Dandruff - dermatology
- Hair transplants
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_a52fbea2cbfba1db092cg-08.jpg?height=932&width=1344&top_left_y=682&top_left_x=995)

\section*{Layer 2 - Connective tissue}
- It is a fibro-fatty layer which is adherent to the skin and to the underlying aponeurosis by fibrous septa.
- It is richly supplied with vessels and nerves that run within it. The arteries freely anastomose with each other. Alternative/collateral blood supply.
- Wounds of the scalp bleed profusely because of:
1. The abundant arterial anastomoses.
2. Arteries do not retract when lacerated because they are held open by the dense connective tissue.

\section*{Layer 3 - Epicranius and Aponeurosis}
- Galea aponeurotica
- Deep scalp wounds gape widely when the epicranial aponeurosis is divided due to tension of the aponeurosis produced by the tone of the occipito-frontalis muscle.

\section*{Layer 4 - Loose connective tis...~}

Sub-aponeurotic space
-limited in front and behind by the origins of the occipitofrontalis muscle
-extends laterally as far as the attachment of the aponeurosis to the temporal fascia
-Has loose areolar tissue with important emissary veins
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_a52fbea2cbfba1db092cg-11.jpg?height=1136&width=1328&top_left_y=508&top_left_x=1743)

\section*{Importance of layer 4}

Dangerous layer:
-Scalp infections can spread through the emissary veins to the intracranial venous sinuses to cause Venous Sinus thrombosis.
(Emissary veins - valveless veins that connect the superficial veins of the scalp with the diploic veins of the skull bones and, through them, with the intracranial venous sinuses).
-Blood (sub-aponeurotic haematoma) or pus can spreads to the eye lids and the root of the nose because of the attachment of the frontalis into the skin and not to the bone
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_26_a52fbea2cbfba1db092cg-13.jpg?height=1306&width=2353&top_left_y=308&top_left_x=363)

\section*{Layer 5 - Pericranium}
- It is the periosteum covering the outer surface of the skull bones
- At the sutures between individual skull bones, the periosteum on the outer surface of the bones is continuous with the periosteum on the inner surface of the skull bones
- Sub-periosteal/cephalo-haematomas

\section*{Surgical utility:}

\section*{Flaps}
