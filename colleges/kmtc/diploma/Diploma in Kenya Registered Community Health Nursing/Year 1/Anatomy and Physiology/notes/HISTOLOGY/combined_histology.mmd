\title{
Introduction to Histology
}

\author{
By \\ Martin Inyimili.
}

\section*{Objectives}
t By the end of the lecture, the student should be able to:
Ø Define Histology

Ø Outline the various stages of preparing slides.

Ø Scientific basis of the various stages of preparing slides.

\section*{What is Histology.}
t Is the scientific study of the fine details of cells and tissues using a microscope to look at specimens of tissue that have been carefully prepared using special techniques called Histological techniques.
t Is Greek word -"histos= tissue" and "logos=study".
t Histopathology: microscopic examination of biological tissues to observe the appearance of diseased cells and tissues in very fine details.
t Histo-chemistry: study of the identification and distribution of chemical compounds within and between biological cells using histological techniques such as staining, indicators and light.

\section*{Uses of histology}
t Education- in teaching abs to help students appreciate the microstructures of biological tissues.
t Diagnosis - to inform treatment options
t Research
t Forensic investigations (Autopsy)- to determine possible causes of sudden death.
t Archeology - for tissues recovered from archeological sites ie bone and teeth, provide insights into history and past events

\section*{Steps in slide preparation}
t Tissue collection and preparation
t Fixation
t Processing
t Embedding
t Sectioning
t Staining
t Mounting
t Microscopy.

\section*{Sample preparation}
t Tissues are obtained from closest relatives of man= olive baboon
t 3 months Quarantine = observation for zoonoses
t Darting/anaesthesia
t Perfusion- washing with normal saline and introducing a fixative(mainly formaldehyde) through the carotid artery.
t Immersing the animal in 10\% formal saline.
t Purpose of fixation:
ü Preserve the tissue in a life-like manner as possible
ü Kills the tissue to avoid postmortem changes= autolysis and putrefaction
ü Cross-linking thus adding strength to the tissue

\section*{Cont'd}
t Tissues are obtained in cubes of 1 cm , some times less
t Larger tissues do not fix well as the fixative and embedding media do not penetrate to all the sections.
t Trim wit a sharp blade to obtain regular and fine edges
t Put tissues in specimen bottles and label them ready for processing

Tissue harvesting and trimming.

\section*{Tissue Processing}
t the purpose is to remove water and replace it with a medium capable of solidifying to allow the sections to be cut. This medium is wax
t Has three stages = Dehydration, Clearing and Infiltration.
t Dehydration is done using ascending grades of alcohol from $70 \%$ to absolute, since water is immiscible with wax.
t Clearing is replacing alcohol with a clearing agent like xylene, picric acid, cedar wood oil, etc.
t Infiltration is filling the tissue air spaces with molten wax
$\varnothing$ Done in the oven at 600 C for 8-14 hours

\section*{Typical processing schedule}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Process & Solution & & Time \\
\hline Dehydration & 70\% alcohol & 60 mins & \\
\hline Dehydration & 90\% alcohol & 45 mins & \\
\hline Dehydration & Absolute alcohol & 45 mins & \\
\hline Dehydration & Absolute alcohol & 45 mins & \\
\hline Dehydration & Absolute alcohol & 60 mins & \\
\hline Clearing & Xylene & 60 mins & \\
\hline Clearing & Xylene & 60 mins & \\
\hline Clearing & Xylene & 60 mins & \\
\hline Infiltration & Paraffin Wax & 30 mins & \\
\hline Infiltration & Paraffin Wax & 60 mins & \\
\hline Infiltration & Paraffin Wax & 90 mins & \\
\hline Blocking Out & Paraffin Wax & n/a & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Cont'd}
t Processing can be done in two way: manually or by an automatic tissue processor. Below is an automatic tissue processc

\section*{Embedding}
t Tissues are placed into molds along with liquid embedding material such as wax, agar or gelatin which is then hardened.
t Hardening is done by cooling for wax and agar while curing(heating) is done for gelatin and resins e.g. epoxy.
t Orientation of tissue is done during this process
t Cooled blocks now have a tissue and wax and can be stored for longer periods of time- can provide reference in medicine

Embedding station. Notice the tissue orientation on the left

\section*{sectioning}
t Involves 'cutting' and floating
t Sectioning is done using a microtome and a ribbon is obtained.
t For light microscopy, a steel knife mounted in a microtome is used to cut 4-micrometre-thick tissue sections which are mounted on a glass
t For transmission electron microscopy, a diamond knife mounted in an ultra-microtome is used to cut 50-nanometerthick tissue sections which are mounted on a 3-millimeterdiameter copper grid.
t Individual sections are floated on a warm water bath and sections 'fished out' on a slide containing an adhesive, probably egg albumin.
t Slides are arranaed onto racks and allowed to drv in the oven

Rotary Microtome.

\section*{staining}
t Biological tissues have little inherent contrast in both light and electron microscopy.
t Staining is required for:
ü Tissue contrast
ü Highlight particular features of interest.
t There are several kinds of stains
t Three basic staining methods
ü Hematoxylin and Eosin (H/E)
ü Masson's trichrome
ü Weigert's elastic stain.
t Hematoxylin and Eosin(H/E) stain is commonly used.
t Cellular architecture
t Hematoxylin is basic and stains the nuclei blue while Eosin is acidic and stains the cytoplasm red or pink

\section*{H/E staining. Nuclei appears dark stained while cytoplasm appears pink.}

\section*{Masons Trichrome stain}
t Has three stains
ü Iron Hematoxylin
ü Ponceau de xylidine (ponceau)
ü Either light green or aniline blue.
t Highlights colagenous fibres and muscle
t Iron Heamatoxylin = nuclei black/dark blue
t Ponceau = muscle, RBCs, fibrin and some cytoplasmic granules
t Light green/aniline blue= collagen, mucin and reticulin fibres

Masson's Trichrome staining. Notice the collagen fibres staining green and muscle red

\section*{Mounting}
t Involves putting a coverslip on the stained tissue.
t Requires an adhesive resin-either water based or resin (water insoluble)
t Mainly DPX used
t Has to have the following characteristics:
ü Same refractive index as that of glass.
ü Not easily oxidized by air.
ü Durable
ü Note: avoid introducing air bubbles between the slide and the coverslip.

\section*{CELL MEMBRANE}
- The cell membrane is selectively-permeable( ions and organic molecules), controls the movement of substances in and out of cells.
- It consists of the phospholipid bilayer, consisting of hydrophobic tails and hydrophilic heads with embedded proteins, which are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion, ion conductivity and cell signaling.
- The plasma membrane also serves as the attachment surface for the extracellular glycocalyx and cell wall and intracellular cytoskeleton

\section*{Function}
- The cell membrane surrounds the protoplasm of a cell and, in animal cells, physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment.
- Fungi, bacteria and plants also have the cell wall which provides a mechanical support for the cell and precludes passage of the larger molecules.
- The cell membrane also plays a role in anchoring the cytoskeleton to provide shape to the cell, and in attaching to the extracellular matrix and other cells to help group cells together to form tissues.
- The barrier is differentially permeable and able to regulate what enters and exits the cell, thus facilitating the transportof materials needed for survival.
- The movement of substances across the membrane can be either passive, occurring without the input of cellular energy, or active, requiring the cell to expend energy in moving it. The membrane also maintains the cell potential.

A typical animal cell. Within the cytoplasm, the major organelles and cellular structures include:
(1) nucleolus
(9) Mitochondria
(2) nucleus
(10) Vacuole
(3) ribosome
(11) Cytosol
(4)vesicle
(12) Lysosome
(5) rough endoplasmic reticulum
(13) Centriole
(6) Golgi apparatus
(7) cytoskeleton
(8) smooth endoplasmic reticulum
- The cytoplasm has three major elements
1. cytosol
2. organelles
3. inclusions
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_d7e5df6a5d7323e05c67g-09.jpg?height=1608&width=2332&top_left_y=162&top_left_x=103)
- 1) nucleolus (2) nucleus (3) ribosome (4)vesicl e (5) rough endoplasmic reticulum (6) Golgi apparatus (7)cytoskeleton (8) smooth endoplasmic reticulum (9) mitochondria (10)vacuole (11) cy tosol (12) lysosome (13) centriole.

\section*{Cytosol}
- Cytosol makes up about $70 \%$ of the cell volume and is composed of water, salts and organic molecules.
- The cytoplasm also contains the protein filaments that make up the cytoskeleton, as well as soluble proteins and small structures such as ribosomes
- The inner, granular and more fluid portion of the cytoplasm is referred to as endoplasm.

\section*{nucleolus}
- This is a non-membrane bound structure composed of proteins and nucleic acids found within the nucleus Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is transcribed and assembled within the nucleolus

\section*{Neucleus}
- A membrane enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells .
- It contains most of the cell's genetic material organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins such as histones, to form chromosomes.
- The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome
- The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes
- To control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression - control center of the cell.
- The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope a double membrane

\section*{Ribosomes}
- components of cells that make proteins from all amino acids
- DNA is used to make RNA, which, in turn, is used to make protein

\section*{Vesicle}
- A vesicle, like liposome can be visualised as a bubble of liquid within another liquid, a supramolecular assembly made up of many different molecules.
- More technically, a vesicle is a small membraneenclosed sac that can store or transport substances.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_d7e5df6a5d7323e05c67g-17.jpg?height=1669&width=2243&top_left_y=84&top_left_x=192)

\section*{Rough endoplasmic reticulum}
- synthesize proteins
- smooth endoplasmic reticulum synthesize lipids and steroids, metabolize carbohydrates and steroids, and regulate calcium concentration, drug detoxification, and attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins.
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum solely regulate calcium levels.

\section*{Golgi body or the Golgi complex}
- an organelle found in most eukaryotic cells
- The Golgi apparatus processes and packages macromolecules, such as proteins and lipids after their synthesis and before they make their way to their destination;
- it is particularly important in the processing of proteins for secretion.

\section*{a mitochondrion}
- is a membrane-enclosedorganelle found in most eukaryotic cells These organelles range from 0.5 to 10 micrometers ( $\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) in diameter.
- described as "cellular power plants" because they generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy
- Also involved in a range of other processes, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, cell death, as well as the control of the cell cycle and cell growth.

\section*{Vacuole}
- membrane bound organelle are filled with water containing inorganic and organic molecules including enzymes in solution or engilfed solids
- Vacuoles are formed by the fusion of multiple membrane vesicles and are effectively just larger forms of these.

\section*{Functions of vacuoles}
- Isolating materials that might be harmful or a threat to the cell
- Containing waste products
- Maintaining internal hydrostatic pressure or turgor within the cell
- Maintaining an acidic internal pH
- Containing small molecules
- Exporting unwanted substances from the cell

\section*{Lysosomes- suicide bags (Autolysis)}
- cellular organelles which contain acid hydrolase enzymes to break up waste materials and cellular debris.
- Lysosomes digest excess or worn-out organelles, food particles, and engulfedviruses or bacteria.
- Lysosomes fuse with vacuoles and dispense their enzymes into the vacuoles, digesting their contents via the use hydrolytic enzymes

\section*{Centriole}
- centriole is a barrel-shaped cell structure-found in most animal eukaryotic cells, though absent in higher plants and most fungi.
- The walls of each centriole are usually composed of nine triplets of microtubules (protein of the cytoskeleton).
- A pair of centrioles, arranged perpendicularly and surrounded by an amorphous mass of dense material (the pericentriolar material0 constitutes the compound structure known as the centrosome
- Centrioles are involved in the organization of the mitotic spindle and in the completion of cytokinesis

\section*{CYTOSKELETON}
- is a cellular "scaffolding" or "skeleton" contained within the cytoplasm and is made out of protein.
- The cytoskeleton is present in all cells; it was once thought to be unique toeukaryotes, but recent research has identified the prokaryotic cytoskeleton.
- It has structures such as flagella, cilia and lamellipodiaand plays important roles in both intracellular transport (the movement of vesicles and organelles, for example) and cellular division
- Eukaryotic cells contain three main kinds of cytoskeletal filaments, which are microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.
- The cytoskeleton provides the cell with structure and shape, and by excluding macromolecules from some of the cytosol it adds to the level of macromolecular crowding in this compartment

- Play a major role in the process of wound healing and respond to an injury by proliferating and enhanced fiber formation.

\section*{Adipocytes predominate in adipose tissue}

Very active cells with many functions:
- Triglyceride storage and glucose metabolism (insulin and glucagon receptors)
- Secretion of many bioactive molecules: leptin (regulates satiety) angiotensinogen (blood pressure) steroids (glucocorticoids \& sex hormones) growth factors (e.g. insulin-like growth factor, tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ ) cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6)

\section*{HISTOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION OF THE LIVER, PANCREAS AND GALL BLADDER}

Obimbo MM,

\section*{LECTURE OBJECTIVES}
- At the end of this practical lecture, the learner should be able to:
- Define the concept of different liver lobules and recognize them in histological sections
- Understand the structure of hepatic cords and liver sinusoids
- Identify the cells of the liver tissue: hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, endothelial cells and lto cells
- Discuss the functions and ultrastructural features of hepatocytes
- Discuss the production of bile
- Describe the histological features of the gallbladder
- Describe the histophysiology of the exocrine pancreas

\section*{Liver histology}
- Liver surrounded by thin connective tissue - Glisson capsule
- Septa divide the liver into lobes and lobules
- The portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct enter the liver through the porta hepatis
- Portal triads are a key feature of the organization of the liver

\section*{Liver histology ctd..}
- Parenchyma, consisting of organized plates of hepatocytes, separated by sinusoidal capillaries.
- Blood vessels, nerves, lymphatic vessels, and bile ducts travel within the connective tissue stroma.
- sinusoidal capillaries (sinusoids), are found between the plates of hepatocytes.
- Perisinusoidal spaces (spaces of Disse), lie between the sinusoidal endothelium and the hepatocytes.

\section*{Liver lobule}
- Described in 3 ways:
- Classic liver lobule:
${ }^{\circ}$ a six-sided prism delimited by interlobular connective tissue. Portal triads in corners. In cross sections, the lobule is filled by cords of hepatic parenchymal cells, hepatocytes, which radiate from the central vein and are separated by vascular sinusoids.

- Portal lobule
- Based on the major exocrine function of the liver which is bile secretion.
- Its outer margins are imaginary lines drawn between the three central veins that are closest to that portal triad

- Liver acinus
- Represents functional unit of the liver
- The hepatocytes in each liver acinus are arranged in three concentric elliptical zones in respect to arterial supply
- Zone I is closest to the short axis and the blood supply from penetrating branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery.
- Zone 3 is farthest from the short axis and closest to the terminal hepatic vein (central vein).

Zone 2 lies between zones 1 and 3
- The zonation is important in the description and interpretation
of patterns of degeneration, regeneration, and specific toxic relative to the degree or quality of vascular perfusion of the hepatic cells.

\section*{Hepatic cell types}
- Hepatocytes
- Predominant cell type in the liver.
${ }^{\circ}$ An estimated $80 \%$ of the liver mass is made of these cells.
- The hepatocytes are round in shape containing a nucleus and an abundance of cellular organelles associated with metabolic and secretory functions.
- Ultrastructure? Relate to functions?
- Hepatic stellate cells (of Ito)
- Lie within the space of Disse.
- Stellate cells store vitamin A in characteristic lipid droplets.
- In addition, many stellate cells in the normal liver express alpha-smooth muscle actin.
- In chronic liver injury, the stellate cell differentiates into a myofibroblast-like cell
- Kupffer cells
critical component of the mononuclear phagocytic system and are central to both the hepatic and systemic response to pathogens.
- Capillary endothelial cells
- The discontinuous sinusoidal endothelium has a discontinuous basal lamina that is absent over large areas.
- The discontinuity of the endothelium is evident in two ways:
- Large fenestrae, without diaphragms, are present within the endothelial cells
- Large gaps are present between neighboring endothelial cells.

\section*{Billiary tree}
- The system is lined by cholangiocytes
- Bile contains both organic components like lecithin, cholesterol and bilirubin and inorganic components (bile salts).
- The bile produced by the hepatocyte flows through the bile canaliculi, bile ductules, and bile ducts.
- The common hepatic duct, after receiving the cystic duct from the gallbladder, continues to the duodenum as the common bile duct (ductus choledochus).

\section*{Gall bladder}
- Can store 30 to 50 ml of bile.
- The wall of the gallbladder consists of four layers:
- Mucosa
- Muscularis Externa
- Perimuscular connective tissue
- Serosa / Adventitia
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_735ac97d1bc598b037b9g-11.jpg?height=1408&width=1345&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=1985)

\section*{Pancreas}
- Is both an exocrine and endocrine gland.
- The exocrine part produces about 1.5 I of pancreatic juice every day.
- The endocrine part (Islet of Langerhans), accounts for $\sim 1 \%$ of the pancreas

\section*{Exocrine pancreas}
- tubuloacinar glands.
- A single layer of pyramidal shaped cells forms the secretory acini.
- The apical cytoplasm is filled with secretory vesicles containing the precursors of digestive enzymes.
- The first portion of the duct system extends into the centre of the acini, lined by small centroacinar cells.
- These cells form the first part of intercalated ducts.
- Intercalated ducts empty into interlobular ducts then into the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung)

\section*{Pancreatic enzymes}
- Trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase hydrolyse proteins into smaller peptides or amino acids;
- ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease split the corresponding nucleic acids;
- pancreatic amylase hydrolyses starch and glycogen to glucose and small saccharides;
- pancreatic lipase hydrolyses triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides;
- cholesterol esterase breaks down cholesterol esters into cholesterol and a fatty acid.
