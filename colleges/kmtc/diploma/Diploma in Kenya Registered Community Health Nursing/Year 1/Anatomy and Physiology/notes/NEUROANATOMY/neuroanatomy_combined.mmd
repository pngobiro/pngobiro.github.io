Schwann cels
- surround all axons of neurons in the PNS creating a neurilemma around them. Neurilemma allows for potential regeneration of damaged axons
- creates myelin sheath around most axons of PNS

Satellite cells
- support groups of cell bodies of neurons within ganglia of the PNS

CEREBRAL TOPOGRAPHY AND CORTICAL FUNCTIONAL AREAS
}

\author{
Dr Mwachaka \\ Dept Human Anatomy
}

\section*{Objectives}
- To review the features of the cerebral cortex
- To understand the functional areas of cerebral cortex
- To understand the basic connection fibres of the brain
- To name some pathologies associated with the cerebral cortex

\section*{Case 1}
- A 52 yr AA hypertensive and diabetic, man awakens and can not express himself. His entire right side is numb and weak. Neurologic exam shows a right hemiparesis (face, arm and leg are equal). Hemianesthesia is present and there is a Broca's aphasia.
- What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 2}
- A 68 year old man with non-valvular atrial fibrillation awakens one day and notices difficulty seeing on his right side; he has no difficulty with speech, walking, strength, sensation or coordination or headache. The neurologic exam reveals a right homonymous hemianopsia.
-What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 3}

A 40 year old is shot in the head through the left orbit. He undergoes bifrontal craniotomy for bullet removal and brain debridement. Following surgery, he is alert and attentive with no aphasia or memory impairment. He has no motor coordination, gait, or hearing disturbance. He makes an uneventful recovery but his wife calls the neurosurgeon very upset. He refuses to return to work or pay any bills, goes to bars, refuses to go to church and sexually abuses a 6 year old girl and is arrested for indecent exposure.

What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 4}
- A 7 year old boy falls off a swing and hit his head on a rock and is knocked unconscious for ten minutes. Upon awakening he is neurologically intact but does not remember the accident. Several hours later, he develops a headache, vomits and develops right sided weakness.
-What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 5}
- A 54-yr woman was seen by a neurologist because her sister had noticed a sudden change in her behavior. The patient stated that after waking up about a week ago, she noticed that the left side of her body did not feel as if it belonged to her. Later, the feeling worsened, and she became unaware of the existence of her left side. Her sister told the neurologist that the patient now neglects to wash the left side of her body.
-What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{What is basal ganglia?}
- A group of subcortical nuclei engaged primarily in motor control, AND
- motor learning
- Executive functions and behavior
- emotions.

What are the COMPONENTS of the basal ganglia?

\section*{Basal Ganglia}
1. Neostriatum

Caudate nucleus
Putamen
Ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens)
2. Paleostriatum

Globus pallidus external segment (GPe)
Globus pallidus internal segment (GPi)
3. Substantia Nigra

Pars compacta (SNc)
Pars reticulata (SNr)
4. Subthalamic nucleus (STN)

- can be recognized with the naked eye because SNC neurons contain neuromelanin in humans ${ }^{\text {SNC }}$
- Pars compacta: SNC (cell-rich part): dopamine
- Pars reticulata: SNR (cells intermixed with fibers and sparse):

GABA

What are the functions of the basal ganglia?

\section*{Major functions}
1. Basal ganglia are involved in generation of goaldirected voluntary movements:
- Motor control
- Motor pattern selection
2. Motor learning
3. Executive functions and behavior
4. Emotions.

\section*{Basal ganglia connections}

\section*{Basal ganglia loops - motor and non-motor}

Release of DA in substantia nigra, as well as in striatum is required for control of movement by the basal ganglia

Motor behavior is determined by the balance between direct/indirect striatal outputs

Hypokinetic disorders
- insufficient direct pathway output
- excess indirect pathway output

Hyperkinetic disorders
- excess direct pathway output
- insufficient indirect pathway output

b. Steady on the right leg
c. Unsteady on the left leg
d. ataxic gait

\section*{Cerebellar lesions}

Are usually vascular, may be traumatic or tumour.
Manifestations of unilateral cerebellar lesions : 1-ipsilateral incoordination of (U.L) arm = intention tremors : it is a terminal tremors at the end of movement as in touching nose or button the shirt.

2-Or ipsilateral cerebellar ataxia affects (L.L.)
leg, causing wide-based unsteady gait.
Manifestations of bilateral cerebellar lesions (caused by alcoholic intoxication, hypothyrodism, cerebellar degeneration \& multiple sclerosis) 1dysarthria: slowness \& slurring of speech.
2-Incoordination of both arms. = intention tremors.
3-Cerebellar ataxia : intermittent jerky movements or staggering ,wide-based, unsteady gait

4-Nystagmus: is a very common feature of multiple sclerosis. It is due to impairment coordination of eye movements /so, incoordination of eye movements occurs and eyes exhibit a to-and-fro motion.

Combination of nystagmus + dysarthria + intension tremors

\section*{What's the functional difference between basal ganglia and cerebellum?}

\section*{Basal ganglia lesions produce contralateral signs.}

\section*{Cerebellar lesions produce ipsilateral signs.}

Most movement disorders produced by cerebellar and basal ganglia pathology disappear during sleep.

Cerebellar and basal ganglia signs are usually not present if the corticospinal tract is damaged.
1. It compares cortical willful

with muscle tension, joint position, \&
tone (via ipsilateral spinocerebellar tracts)
2. Advises the cortex on how much, how many, how fast
3. The motor cortex sends the revised

The BASAL GANGLIA are the autopilot for procedural movements.

The CEREBELLUM is the refiner of finely controlled movements (particularly of fingers).

\section*{Clinical notes}

1-Unilateral lesion interrupting the corticobulbar tract (upper motor neuron lesion) produces mild form of paresis because of the bilateral cortical control of the motor cranial nerve nuclei. There is deviation of the tongue to the opposite side of the lesion and marked weakness of the lower facial muscles of the opposite side of the lesion (angle of the mouth deviates to the same side of the lesion).
2-Bilateral lesion involving corticobulbar fibers produces a syndrome known as pseudobulbar paralysis. This syndrome is characterized by paralysis of muscles of swallowing, chewing, speaking and breathing.
3-Lesion of the corticospinal tract rostral to motor decussation produces contralateral loss of voluntary movements that is more marked in the distal parts of the extremities. Lesion of the corticospinal tract caudal to the motor decussation results in ipsilateral paralysis below the level of the lesion. It is also a spastic upper motor neuron lesion. In spastic hemiplegia there is an increase in the deep reflexes (hyperreflexia). Babinski sign is positive.
4-Types of paralysis; hemiplegia is paralysis of one side of the body, monoplegia is paralysis of one limb only, diplegia is paralysis of two corresponding limbs (arms or legs), quadriplegia is paralysis of all 4 limbs, paraplegia is paralysis of the two lower limbs. Alternating hemiplegia is contralateral paralysis of the body due to upper motor neuron lesion of the pyramidal tract in the brain stem, associated with lower motor ipsilateral paralysis of one or more of the motor cranial nerves.

\section*{CEREBELLUM}

Objectives
-Definition and phylogeny of cerebellum.
-External features of the cerebellum.
-Composition and internal structures.
-Cerebellar input and output.
-Anatomical basis of cerebellar lesions

Definition, position and function: The cerebellum (little brain) is the largest part of the hindbrain, 150 gm in weight.. It is located in the posterior cranial fossa covered by the tentorium cerebelli. Supported by its peduncles, the cerebellum overhangs the superior and inferior medullary vela (the roof of the fourth ventricle). The function of the cerebellum is entirely motor. It maintains balance, influences posture and muscle tone and it coordinates movements.

\section*{External features}

The cerebellum is formed of two cerebellar hemispheres joined by a narrow median zone called the vermis. Anterior and posterior notches are present as deficiencies anteriorly and posteriorly between the two hemispheres.

\section*{Surfaces}

On the superior surface the superior vermis can not be demarcated from the superior surface of the hemisphere. The vermis seen on the inferior surface is called inferior vermis and is separated from the inferior aspect of the cerebellum by deep median hollow termed vallecula cerebelli. The inferior vermis consists of three small lobules named nodule, uvula and pyramid.

\section*{Cerebellar fissures and lobes}

The cerebellar surface is highly convoluted with the folds or folia separated by numerous transverse fissures. Fisures vary in depths and some are used as landmarks to divide the cerebellum into lobes. Only three deep fissures are of significance:
Horizontal fissure sweeps from the anterior to the posterior notches. It separates the superior and inferior surfaces of the cerebellum. The anterior part of the fissure receives the middle cerebellar peduncle (laterally located) with which both the superior (medially located) and inferior (middle located) cerebellar peduncles are closely assossiated.
Primary fissure is a V-shaped fissure cutting the superior vermis at the junction of its anterior $2 / 3$ with its posterior $1 / 3$. The fissura prima curves laterally to meet the horizontal fissure. The part in front of primary fissure is termed the anterior lobe; the part behind is the middle lobe.
Posterolateral fissure is present on the undersurface of the cerebellum separating the flocculonodular lobe from the rest of the cerebellum.

\section*{Composition of the}

\section*{The cerebellum Gerisebrellum}

\section*{1-Cerebellar cortex}

The cerebellar cortex is formed of three layers

\section*{1-Molecular layer}

It is the outer layer that underlies the pia mater. It contains dendritic arborizations of Purkinje cells, axons of granule cells, and stellate and basket cells. Stellate and basket cells make inhibitory synapses with Purkinje dendrites to limit the area of the cortex excited by climbing and mossy fibers.
2-Purkinje cell layer: Dendrites of Purkinje cells are flattened in the molecular layer. Their axons make inhibitory synaptic contacts on neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei which originate most of cerebellar efferent fibers.
3-Granule cell layer contains granule cells, Golgi type II cells and cerebellar glomeruli.

\section*{Cerebellar fibers}

Fibers enter the cerebellum as clmbing fibers (originate from inferior olivary nucleus) and mossy fibers (all other afferents). Mossy fibers are excitatory fibers which synapse with granule cell dendrites in the form of rosettes. Each rosette forms the core of a glomerulus. Each axon of mossy fibers may affect thousands of granule cells. Dendrites of granule cells, and dendrites and axons of Golgi type II cells synapse with mossy fibers. The output is via axons of granule cells. Unmyelinated axons of granule cells ascend into the molecular layer where they divide and run parallel to long axis of folia. They run at right angles to and through dendritic expansions of Purkinje cells, making excitatory synaptic contacts with several Purkinje cells. Climbing fibers are excitatory terminating on cerebellar nuclei and on dendrites of Purkinje cells. Relationship of climbing fibers and Purkinje cells is one to one.
It appears that all afferent pathways ultimately converge on Purkinje cells. Purkinje axons are the only way out of the cerebellum. Purkinje axons send recurrent collaterals back to synapse with adjacent Purkinje cells and to Golgi Type II neurons.

\section*{Cerebellar nuclei and peduncles}

2-Deep white matter is made up of afferent and efferent fibers that run to and from the cerebellar cortex.
3-Three pairs of deep nuclei (fig.3-3) which receive afferents and are the primary source of efferent fibers from the cerebellum to the other parts of the brain. From medial to lateral the cerebellar nuclei are:
a)Fastigial nucleus.
b)Nucleus interpositus, formed of globose and emboliform nuclei
c) Dentate nucleus.

4-Three pairs of peduncles that convey afferent and efferent fibers. They are inferior, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, which join the cerebellum to the medulla, pons and midbrain, respectively.

\section*{Phylogeny of cerebellum}

\section*{Phylogeny (developmental history) of the cerebellar lobes}

1-Archicerebellum (flocculonodular lobe or vestibulocerebellum) is the original part of the cerebellum concerned with maintenance of balance. It has connections with the vestibular and reticular nuclei. The influence of the archicerebellum upon the lower motor neurons is mediated by vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts. Lesion of this lobe (caudal vermis syndrome) produces disturbance in equilibrium and trunk ataxia (patient walks as drunk, unable to maintain upright posture).
2-Paleocerebellum (anterior lobe or spinocerebellum) is phylogenetically intermediate. Paleocerebellum influences muscle tone and posture. Afferents are mainly the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts that carry information from muscles, joints and cutaneous receptors to cerebellar cortex of the ipsilateral vermis and paravermal zones. Efferents pass to nucleus interpositus, in turn project to inferior olivary nucleus and contralateral red nucleus. Decussated rubrospinal tracts facilitates flexor muscle tone. Lesion of this lobe (rostral vermis syndrome) causes hypotonia, and trunk and leg ataxia.
3- Neocerebellum (posterior lobe, or cerebrocerebellum). With evolution, further cerebellar expansion with addition of a larger middle lobe forms between archicerebellum and paleocerebellum. The neocerebellum is concerned with muscular coordination including force, speed and curved movements. Afferents are principally pontocerebellar fibers which are influenced by cerebral cortex, involved in planning and execution of movement. Pontocerebellar fibers decussate and by means of middle cerebellar peduncle terminate in the lateral zones of the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Efferents from neocerebellar cortex are directed to dentate nucleus which in turn project to the contralateral ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus and red nucleus (dentatothalamic and dentatorubral fibers). The ventral lateral nucleus of thalamus projects to cerebral cortex, particularly the motor cortex of frontal lobe. The neocerebellum thus exerts its coordinating role in movement through the action on cerebral cortical areas giving rise to corticnuclear, and corticospinal pathways. Lesion of this lobe causes hypotonia, pendulum muscle jerks, and incoordination of the upper limbs (dysdiadochokinesia and intention tremors), lower limbs (cerebellar ataxia), and speech (dysarthria), and eyes (nystagmus).

\section*{Blood supply of cerebellum}

-Cerebellum is formed of $\mathbf{3}$ phylogenetic lobes; flocculonodular (archicerebellum), anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) and posterior lobe (neocerebellum).
-Cerebellum has 3 main fissures; primary, posterolateral and horizontal.
-Cerebellar cortex is formed of $\mathbf{3}$ layers; molecular, Purkinje and granular layers.
-White mater contains 3 pairs of nuclei; fastigial, interpositus and dentate nuclei.
-Cerebellum is longitudinally organized into 3 zones; vermian, paravermian and lateral zones.
-Cerebellar peduncles are 3; inferior, middle and superior.
-Major cerebro-cerebellar decussations are 3; pontocerebellar, dentatothalamic and dentatorubral.
-Cerebellar neurotransmitters are 3; GABA (utilized by Purkinje cells and is inhibitory), glutamate (used by granule cells and is excitatory) and aspartate (used by climbing fibers and is inhibitory or excitatory).
-Cerebellar functions are 3; maintain balance, influences muscle tone and coordinates movements.
-Cerebellar dysfunctions present 3 main signs; hypotonia, dysequilibrium and dyssynergia (dysarthria, dysmetria, nystagmus and intention tremors). A midline lesion (tumor) leads to loss of postural control; as a result it is impossible to stand or sit without toppling over. Unilateral lesion of a cerebellar hemisphere causes unsteady gait and intention tremors on the same side of the body. Bilateral lesion or cerebellar ataxia (alcohol intoxication, degenerative disease or multiple sclerosis) causes slow slurred speech, unsteady (drunk) gait and incoordination of both arms.

\section*{Definition of basal ganglia (nuclei)}

The term basal ganglia is applied to a collection of masses of gray matter situated within each cerebral hemisphere in close relation to the diencephalon but separated from it by the internal capsule. Basal ganglia represent subcortical nuclei derived from telencephalon.

\section*{Amygdaloid nucleus}

The amygdaloid nucleus is considered part of the limbic system and recently excluded from the basal ganglia. It is situated in the temporal lobe close to the uncus of the parahippocampal gyrus. It lies in front and above the tip of inferior horn of lateral ventricle. It is fused with the tip of the tail of caudate nucleus. stria terminalis emerges from its posterior aspect, and runs as a bundle of nerve fibers posteriorly in the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle medial to the tail of caudate nucleus. The stria terminalis follows the curve of the caudate nucleus and comes to lie in the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle where it occupies the groove between caudate nucleus and thalamus. The stria terminalis end in lateral and preoptic hypothalamic nuclei. Amygdaloid nucleus receives afferents from the lateral olfactory tract, reticular formation, septal nuclei, and limbic and sensory cortex. It projects efferents to dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus, hypothalamus (via stria terminalis), habenular nuclei (via stría medullaris thalami), and sensory and limbic association cortices.

\title{
Function and dysfunction of amygdaloid nucleus
}

\section*{Function of amygdaloid nucleus}

The amygdaloid nucleus is considered part of the limbic system which produces activities associated with feeding and nutrition. It regulates visceral activity and emotional behavior. Its stimulation may cause aggressive behavior.
Destruction of the amygdaloid nucleus results in KluverBucy syndrome; characterized by psychic blindness (visual agnosia), loss of fear and anger, increase appetite and sexual activity, and decrease aggressiveness and decrease emotional instability. There is no disturbance in memory. Precise stereotactic lesion of the amygdaloid nucleus in man reduces emotional excitability and brings about normalization of behavior in patients with severe emotional disturbances

\section*{Connections of corpus striatum}

\section*{Afferents}

1-Corticostriate fibers are projected from the greater part of the cortex, particularily the sensorimotor cortex to the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Fibers project bilaterally crossing the midline through the corpus callosum and enter the caudate nucleus via the subcallosal fasciculus, and the putamen via the external capsule. More anterior regions of the frontal lobe and other association cortices project mainly to the caudate nucleus while motor regions project mainly to the putamen. For this, the putamen is considered the motor part of the straitum and the caudate having the most associative functions.
2-Thalamostriate fibers arise from the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. Fibers traverse the internal capsule and enter putamen.
3-Nigrostriate fibers exert modulatory (mostly inhibitory) effect on the striatal neurons. Dopamine regulates the releases of other neurotransmitters from axon terminals. Dopaminergic neurons are rich in melanin pigments.

Efferents
1-Striopallidal fibers pass from the caudate nucleus ventrally via the internal capsule to reach putamen, and from the putamen fibers project medially to the globus pallidus.
2-Strionigral fibers project mainly from the caudate nucleus to substantia nigra.
It should be noted that the two output nuclei of the basal ganglia are the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. These outputs use GABA as a neurotransmitter to inhibit their targets. The main input to these nuclei is from the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus.

Afferents
1-Striopallidal fibers come from putamen and caudate nucleus.
2-Nigropallidal fibers project from substantia nigra to globus pallidus. Some fibers reach the caudate nucleus and the remaining fibers continue to the putamen and globus pallidus.
3-Subthalamopallidal fibers project from the subthalamic nucleus to globus pallidus through the subthalamic fasciculus.

\section*{Efferents}

1-Pallidothalamic fibers: Fasciculus lenticularis and ansa lenticularis reach the prerebral field of Forel in the subthalamus. Some of the fibers synapse with subthalamic nucleus and nucleus of the prerubral field. It is noticed that the lenticular fasciculus traverses the internal capsule whereas the ansa lenticularis sweep around the posterior limb of the internal capsule forming a loop (ansa) to reach the prerubral field. The remaining fibers reach ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus through the thalamic fasciculus. Pallidothalamic fibers constitute the main outflow from the basal ganglia. VA and VL thalamic nuclei project excitatory fibers to the motor cortex (primary motor and supplementary motor cortex).
2-Pallidotegmental fibers descend to terminate in brain stem tegmentum in the pedunculopontine nucleus which lies at the boundary between midbrain and pons. This region has been termed the mesencephalic locomotor region in lower mammals, since it is involved in the regulation of quadrupedal progression.
3-Other efferents of the globus pallidus include; a)Subthalamic nucleus, b)Red nucleus, c)Midbrain RF, d)Epithalamus and Hypothalamus, and e)Inferior olivary nucleus.

Globus pallidus project to midbrain reticular formation. This is a part of the brain stem reticular formation and so is connected with the cells that give rise to the reticulspinal tract. This represents a more direct route than through the thalamus for the basal ganglia output to reach the lower motor neurons. Limbic component of basal ganglia is implicated in emotional behavior.

\section*{Functions of basal ganglia \\ 1-Definition and function of the extrapyramidal system:}

The extrapyramidal system consists of all motor pathways of the brain that influence LMNs but do not send their axons directly into the pyramidal tract. This includes the circuitry of the basal ganglia, and the reticulospinal, rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, olivospinal and, tectospinal tracts. Signs of pyramidal diseases differ from the causes and signs of extrapyramidal diseases.
2-The phylogenetic series illustrate a gradual increase in the dependence of volitional movement on the pyramidal tract. Volitional motor activity is extrapyramidal in submammalia, mixed pyramidal/extrapyramidal in subhuman mammalia and essentially pyramidal in human.
-In man the corpus striatum maintains a postural background for voluntary activities, reinforcing and steadying movements and postures of cortical origin, but is incapable of initiating such movements. The cerebral cortex projects to lower motor neurons through two main channels; (a)long fibers in the pyramidal tract concerned with fine isolated skilled movements, and (b)short fibers passing to extrapyramidal nuclei concerned with mechanisms for postural adjustments and gross movement patterns that are largely reflex in character.
-Recent concepts of the role of the basal ganglia consider their function to facilitate movements that are appropriate and to inhibit unwanted movements that are inappropriate. When a movement is initiated, the cerebral cortex discharges ecitatory impulses to neostriatum. The striatum has two routes by which it controls activity of the globus pallidus; direct and indirect. The direct pathway inhibits the medial segment of the globus pallidus. Since medial globus pallidus output neurons are themselves inhibitory, this leads to disinhibition of the motor thalamus. The increased activity of the thalamic neurons causes excitation of the cerebral cortex. The effect of activation of the direct pathway is to facilitate ongoing movements. The indirect pathway involves the subthalamic nucleus. Efferents from the striatum terminate in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus inducing inhibition. The main projection of the lateral pallidum is to the subthalamic nucleus which becomes disinhibited. Activation of the subthalamic nucleus causes activation of the medial segment of the globus pallidus and, in turn, inhibition of the motor thalamus and cortex. The result is inhibition of the unwanted movements.
3-Corpus striatum plays a role in mentation (lesion of caudate results in impairment of cognitive functions), emotion and behaviour (lesion of nucleus accumbens impairs affective behaviour), planning and sequencing skills (lesion of pallidum produces depression, apathy and reduces planning and skills).

\section*{Clinical Notes}

1-Diseases of the extrapyramidal system are associated with dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) and disturbances of muscle tone. Positive disturbances (tremor, athetosis, chorea and ballism) are believed to be the result of release phenomena. For example the subthalamic nucleus normally exerts regulating influences upon the globus pallidus. A lesion in the subthalamic nucleus releases the globus pallidus from this controlling influence which is expressed by bursts of irregular forcefull ballistic movements. In Parkinsonism, lack of dopamine (dopamine stimulates medial pallidum and inhibits lateral pallidum) causes underactivity of the direct pathway and overactivity of the indirect pathway. These changes exacerbate the abnormal overactivity of the medial pallidum inducing dyskinesia.
2-Rigidity or increased muscle tone is a manifestation of extrapyramidal lesion. Rigidity is present in antagonistic muscle groups i.e. in both extensor and flexor muscles. Rigidity is cog-wheel or clasp knife (passive movements are interrupted by jerks).
3-A unifying feature of its lesion is absence of muscle paralysis and absence of sensory loss.
4-Depression, apathy, impairement of cognitive functions an disturbed affective behavior are common manifestations of basal ganglia lesions.

Homeobox genes give signals for segregation of the brain into forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain.
- Retinoic acid regulates homeobox gene expression and craniocaudal patterning.
- FGF-8 is a key signaling molecule inducing subsequent gene expression that regulates differentiation.
- Transcription factor FOXG1 regulates development of cerebral hemispheres and specification within the forebrain.
- Lateral patterning is controlled by BMP4\&7.
- SHH induces NKX2,1 gene that regulates development of hypothalamus.
- FGF-8 induces WNT1 expression that regulate regions of the cerebellum.

This region secretes FGF-8 in a circumferential ring that induces expression of engrailed 1 and 2(EN1 and EN2) in gradients anteriorly and posteriorly from this area. EN1 regulates development of the dorsal midbrain, and both genes participate in formation of the cerebellum. WNT1, another gene induced by FGF-8, also assists in development of the cerebellum. $N$, notochord; $P$, prechordal plate.

\section*{Origin of nervous system}

NS is ectodermal in origin, develops early in the 3rd week from the neural plate, a slipper-shaped thickened area between primitive knot and prechordal plate.

\section*{Formation of the neural tube (neurulation)}

Neurulation is the process by which the embryo internalizes its developing nervous system.

By day 18, the neural plate invaginates along its central axis to form a longitudinal groove, neural groove with neural fold on each side. The neural folds approach each other and fuse forming the neural tube. Formation of the neural tube begins in the region of the 4th to 6th somites (cervical region) and proceeds in a cranial and caudal directions until only small areas remain open at both ends of the tube, cranial and caudal neuropores. Neuropores communicate neural canal with amniotic cavity. The neural tube soon detaches and the free edges of the surface ectoderm fuse..

Nature Reviews | Neuroscience

The cranial broad $2 / 3$ of the neural tube as far as the 4th somite represents the brain, and the caudal narrow $1 / 3$ represents the spinal cord. Closure of the cranial neuropore is bi-directional. Final closure of the cranial neuropore occurs on the 25th day. Closure of the caudal neuropore occurs on the 27th day. Neurulation is then complete and the CNS is represented by a closed tubular structure. The neural canal is converted into the ventricular system of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord. The brain shows three dilatations:
-forebrain (prosencephalon)
-midbrain(mesencephalon)
-hindbrain (rhombencephalon).

Formation of the neural crest
As neural folds fuse, some neuroectodermal cells along lateral border of neural folds lose epithelial affinity, dissociate, migrate dorsolaterally and undergo mesenchymal transition. Cells form flattened mass, neural crest, between the neural tube and the overlying ectoderm. They separate into right and left parts. Cells disperse within mesenchyme and differentiate giving:
1-ganglia(spinal, autonomic and cranial).
2-Neurolemma (Schwann) cells and satellite cells.
3-Involved in development of pia and arachnoid.
4-Melanocytes.
5-Suprarenal medulla.
6-CT, skeletal and muscular components of head region including mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arches.
7-Cushions of the heart.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF SPINAL CORD}

\section*{Neuroepithelial, mantle\& marginal layers}

Neural tube caudal to 4th pair of somites develops into the spinal cord. The wall of the neural tube is lined by psudostratified columnar neuroepithelial cells. Cells are connected by junctional complexes at the lumen. These cells divide rapidly giving more neuroepithelial cells. Some of the dividing cells differentiate into primordial neurons, neuroblasts. Neuroblasts form a zone around the neuroepithelium known as mantle layer. The mantle layer forms the gray mater. Nerve fibers emerging from neuroblasts form the outermost layer known as marginal layer. This layer obtains a white appearance as a result of myelination of fibersforming white mater of spinal cord.

\section*{Basal, alar, roof and floor plates}

As a result of continuous addition of neuroblasts to the mantle layer, each side of the neural tube shows a ventral and a dorsal thickening. Differential thickening of the lateral walls of the neural tube produces a shallow longitudinal groove on each side called sulcus limitans which separates the ventral from the dorsal thickenings. The ventral thickenings, the basal plates, form the ventral and lateral gray horns of the spinal cord whose cells are motor and autonomic neurons. Neurocytes of the anterior horn migrate and develop first before the posterior horn. The dorsal thickenings, alar plates, form the dorsal gray horns of the spinal cord whose cells constitute the sensory neurons. Dorsal and ventral midline portions of the neural tube, known as roof and floor plates, do not contain neuroblasts and serve as pathway for fibers crossing from one side to the other. Neuroblast proliferation thickens the gray mater of the alar and basal plates in the shape of an $\mathbf{H}$. The crossbar of the H-surrounds the central canal.
- As a result of continuous growth of basal plates, they extend forward on each side of the the midline forming a deep groove called anterior median fissure. Alar plates increse in size and extend medially compressing the posterior portion of the neural tube which come into apposition and fuse to form the posterior median septum.

\section*{Histogenesis of neuroepithelium}

\section*{-Nerve cells}

Neuroblasts are derived from mitoses of neuroepithelial cells. Initially neuroblasts have central processes extending to the lumen (transient dendrite), but when they migrate into the mantle layer these processes disappear. Neuroblasts are temporarily rounded and apolar. With further differentiation, two new processes appear on the opposite sides of the cell body thus forming bipolar neuroblast. One process elongates to form the primitive axon, while the other process shows arborizations to form the primitive dendrite. The cell is then known as a multipolar neuroblast and later neuron.

\section*{Glial cells}

The majority of glioblasts are formed by neuroepithelial cells after production of neuroblasts has ceased. Glioblasts migrate into the mantle and marginal layers. In the mantle layer, they differentiate into astroblasts and then into protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes. Protoplasmic astrocytes are found mainly in the gray mater while fibrous astrocytes are found mainly in the white matter. Another type of supporting cells derived from glioblasts, the oligodendroblasts give rise to oligodendrocytes. Oligodendroglia, found mainly in the white mater, form myelin sheath around nerve axons. In the marginal layer a third type of supporting cells derived from mesenchyme is known as microglia. Microglia are phagocytic cells.

\section*{Ependymal cells}

When neuroepithelium ceases to produce neuroblasts and glioblasts, its cells differentiate into ependymal epithelium which line the central canal of the spinal cord in the form of simple columnar partially ciliated epithelium.

\section*{Spinal ganglia}

Unipolar neurons in the spinal ganglia are derived from neural crest cells. Axons of these cells are at first bipolar, but the two processes soon unite in a Tshaped fashion. The peripheral processes pass in the spinal nerve to sensory endings. The central processes enter the spinal cord and constitute the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves. These central processes penetrate the dorsal portion of the neural tube and end in the dorsal horn cells or ascend through the marginal layer to higher centers.

\section*{Spinal nerves}

Motor nerve fibers appear during the 4th week from neurons located in the basal plates (ventral horns). Motor nerve fibers form bundles known as ventral roots. Dorsal roots originate from cells in the dorsal root (spinal) ganglia. Peripheral processes from spinal ganglia join ventral roots to form the spinal nerve trunk. Almost immediately the spinal nerve divides into dorsal and ventral primary rami. The dorsal rami innervate dorsal axial muscles, vertebral joints and skin of the back. The ventral rami innervate the limbs, ventrolateral body walls, and form the major nerve plexuses (cervical, brachial and lumbosacral).

\section*{Myelination}

Myelination of peripheral nerves is done by Schwann (neurolemma) cells which migrate peripherally and wrap themselves around axons forming neurolemma sheath. Myelin is formed by repeated coiling of Schwann cell membrane around the axon. Myelin surrounding nerve fibers inside the spinal cord is formed by oligodendroglia. Motor roots are myelinated before the sensory roots. Although myelination begins during the 4th month of intrauterine life, some motor fibers descending from the brain centers are myelinated by the end of the first year and most of them by the end of 2nd year. However, some nerve fibers in the cerebrum get myelinated at 10 and up to 20 years of age.

\section*{Position changes of the spinal cord}

The spinal cord in 3-month embryo extends the entire length of the vertebral canal. Because the vertebral column and dura mater grow faster than the neural tube, the caudal end of the spinal cord comes to lie at a higher level. In 6-month fetus, the cord lies at the level of S1. In the newborn the spinal cord terminates at level of L3. In the adult, the cord terminates at level of lower border of L1. As a result of this recession, spinal nerve roots especially those of the lumbar and sacral segments run obliquely from the spinal cord to their corresponding levels of the vertebral column. Nerve roots inferior to the lower end of the cord (conus medullaris) form cauda equina. The dura and arachnoid end at level of S2. The pia extends from the tip of the conus medullaris piercing arachnoid and dura to attach to the 1st coccygeal vertebra in the form of a long fibrous thread known as filum terminale which indicates the line of regression of the caudal end of the embryonic spinal cord.

\section*{Anomalies of the spinal cord}

Most of the anomalies of the spinal cord result from abnormal closure of the neural tube during the 4th week of development. Neural tube defects (NTDs) also affect tissues overlying the spinal cord: meninges, vertebral arches, muscles and skin. The incidence of severe neural tube defects is approximately 1 in 1000, but varies in different populations.

Causes of neural tube defects are mostly multi-factorial. Hypothermia, hyperthermia, Valproic acid (anticonvulsant drug), Hypervitaminosis A and Folic acid deficiency are major factors..
Diagnosis of neural tube defects is by
-Ultrasonography.
-Increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels in amniotic fluid or serum of the mother.

1-Spina bifida refers to splitting of the vertebral arches. This term denotes nonfusion of the primordial halves of the vertebral (neural) arches, which is common to all types of spina bifida.
a)Spina bifida occulta refers to defect in the vertebral arches that does not involve the underlying neural tissue. The defect is covered by skin and is represented by a small dimple with a tuft of hair arising from it. Spina bifida occulta is usually present at L5 or S1 and it occurs in 10\% of people producing no symptoms.

\section*{Varieties of spina bifida}

b)Spinal dermal sinus is a skin dimple associated with a sinus at the sacral region. The dimple indicates the region of closure of the caudal neuropore. Dimple may connect with dura by a fibrous cord.
c)Spina bifida cystica is protrusion of spinal cord and or the meninges through a defect in the vertebral arches. It occurs once in every 1000 births. When the protruding sac contains meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, the anomaly is spina bifida with meningocele. If spinal cord and or nerve roots are included in the sac, anomaly is spina bifida with meningomyelocele. Meningomyelocele is more common and more severe than meningocele. Spina bifida cystica shows varying degrees of neurological deficits depending on position and extent of the lesion. There is usually loss of sensation with muscular paralysis. Sphincteric paralysis is common with lumbosacral meningomyelocele. There is saddle anesthesia when the sphincters are involved.

d)Spina bifida with myeloschisis (rachischisis) is the most severe type of spina bifida. The spinal cord is open because the neural folds fail to fuse. The spinal cord is represented by a flattened mass of nervous tissue.
2-Amyelus is absence of the spinal cord.
3-Duplication of the spinal cord.
4-Syringomyelocele is gross dilatation of the central canal plus meningomyelocele.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF BRAIN}

\section*{Brain vesicles}

The neural tube cranial to the 4th pair of somites develops into the brain. After closure of the cranial neuropore, the brain shows three primary vesicles:
- forebrain (prosencephalon)
- midbrain (mesncephalon)
- hindbrain (rhombencephalon)

During the 5th week the forebrain partly divides into two secondary brain vesicles, telencephalon and diencephalon. The midbrain does not divide. The hindbrain partly divides into two secondary vesicles; metencephalon and myelencephaalon. Each of the five secondary brain vesicles has a wall, a lumen and contains a cavity.

\section*{Brain flexures}

During the 4th week the brain grows rapidly and bends ventrally with the head fold. Folding of the embryo and unequal growth of the different parts of the brain produce brain flexures. These flexures are in order:
1-Midbrain flexure is the first to appear in the midbrain region and is ventrally curved.
2-Cervical flexure is between the hindbrain and the spinal cord and is ventrally curved.
3 -Pontine flexure appears in the region of the metencephalon and is dorsally curved.
4-Forebrain flexure is the last to appear in the forebrain and is dorsally curved.

\section*{Differences in development between the brain and the spinal cord}

1-Sulcus limitans extends cranially to the junction of the midbrain and forebrain. Alar and basal plates are recognizable only in the midbrain and hindbrain. In the forebrain alar plates are increased and basal plates disappear.
2-Pontine flexure causes:
a-thinning of the roof of hindbrain.
b-movement of nuclei of medulla and pons; sensory nuclei move laterally and motor nuclei move mediailly.
3-Migration of neuroblasts causes gray mater to present mainly on the surface of the cerebrum and cerebellum (cerebral and cerebellar cortices).
4-Flexions as well as evaginations and protuberances explain why the final form of the brain differs from the simple linear tube. The brain undergoes flexions that fit it more compactly into the skull.

\section*{HINDBRAIN (RHOMBENCEPHALON)}

The pontine flexure divides the hindbrain into caudal myelencephalon and rostral metencephalon. Myelencephalon bocomes the medulla oblongata and metencephalon becomes the pons and cerebellum. The cavity of the hindbrain becomes the 4th ventricle and central canal in the medulla.

\section*{MYELENCEPHALON (MEDULLA OBLONGATA)}

The caudal part of myelencephalon (closed medulla) resembles the spinal cord. The neural canal forms the central canal. Unlike those of the spinal cord, neuroblasts from alar plates migrate into the marginal zone to form isolated gracile (medially) and cuneate (laterally) nuclei. The ventral area of the medulla contains a pair of bundles - pyramids, corticospinal tracts descending from the developing cerebral cortex.
The rostral part of the myelencephalon (open medulla) is wide and flat. The pontine flexure causes:
1-lateral walls of medulla move laterally as pages of an open book.
2-the roof plate to become stretched and greatly thinned.
3-cavity of the myelencephalon (4th ventricle) becomes diamond.

4-alar plates become lateral to basal plates; sensory nuclei of the medulla develop lateral to motor nuclei.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_de4314b1bb1d6294700bg-065.jpg?height=1385&width=2118&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=191)

Neuroblasts of the alar (sensory) plates differentiate into 4 columns on each side arranged from lateral to medial:
a-Special somatic afferent (SSA) neurons receive impulses from the inner ear by the way of vestibulocochlear nerve, represented by vestibular and cochlear nuclei.
b-General somatic afferent (GSA) neurons receive sensory impulses from face, represented by spinal trigeminal nucleus.
c-Special visceral afferent (SVA) neurons receive taste impulses from tongue, palate, oropharynx and epiglottis (carried by facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves) and are represented by the gustatory nucleus.
d-General visceral afferent (GVA) neurons receive sensory impulses from the viscera carried by IX and
$X$ cranial nerves to nucleus solitarius.

Neuroblasts of the basal plates develop into motor nuclei and organize into 3 cell columns on each side from lateral to medial:
a-General visceral efferent (GVE) neurons supply involuntary muscles (of respiratory tract, GIT and heart) by the way of parasympathetic fibers in the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves and are represented by dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and inferior salivary nucleus.
b-Special visceral efferent (SVE) neurons supply muscles derived from the pharyngeal arches and are represented by nucleus ambiguous (shared by cranial nerves IX, X, XI).
c-General somatic efferent (GSE) neurons represented by the hypoglossal nucleus. Some neuroblasts of the alar plates migrate ventrally and form neurons of the olivary nuclei (cerebellar relay nuclei).

\section*{Choroid plexuses and cerebrospinal fluid}

The stretched roof plate of the myelencephalon consists of a single layer of ependymal cells covered by vascular mesenchyme, the pia mater. The ependyma and pia combined are known as tela choroidea. A number of vascular invaginations project into cavity of the 4th ventricle. These tuft-like invaginations form the choroid plexus which secretes the cerebrospinal fluid. Thin roof of the 4th ventricle evaginates in 3 locations and rupture to form a median and 2 lateral apertures (foramen of Magendie and foramina of Luschka) which permit CSF to enter the subarachnoid space.

Similar choroid plexuses develop in roof of the 3rd ventricle and medial walls of the lateral ventricles. Choroid plexuses secrete ventricular fluid which becomes the CSF. The site of absorption of CSF into the venous system is through the arachnoid villi, which are protrusions of arachnoid into the dural venous sinuses. These villi consist of a thin layer derived from epithelium of arachnoid and

\section*{METENCEPHALON}

Walls of the metencephalon form pons and cerebellum, and its cavity forms superior part of the 4th ventricle.

\section*{PONS}

Pontine flexure causes divergence of the lateral walls of the pons which spreads the gray substance in the floor of the 4th ventricle. As in the medulla the alar plates develop into 4 groups of nuclei:
a-SSA neurons receive sensations from inner ear, part of vestibulocpchlear complex.
b-GSA neurons receive sensations from the face which reach trigeminal sensory nuclei.
c-SVA neurons receive taste, represented by gustatory nucleus.
d-GVA neurons receive sensations from viscera and represented by nucleus solitarius.

The basal plates of the metencephalon consist of 3 groups of motor nuclei arranged from lateral to medial:
a-GVE neurons supply secretomotor parasympathetic fibers (in facial nerve) to lacrimal and salivary glands, and represented by the lacrimal nucleus and superior salivary nucleus.
b-SVE neurons innervate muscles derived from 1st and 2nd pharyngeal arches (muscles of mastication and facial expression), represented by trigeminal motor nucleus and facial motor nucleus.
c-GSE neurons are represented by abducent nucleus.

Nerve fibers connecting the cerebral and cerebellar cortices with the spinal cord pass through the marginal layer of the ventral metencephalon. This region is called the pons or bridge. Pons contains pontine nuclei originate from alar plates of myelencephalon and metencephalon. Axons of pontine nuclei grow transversely to enter the developing cerebellum of the opposite side forming the transverse pontine fibers and middle cerebellar peduncle.

\section*{CEREBELLUM}

The cerebellum develops from the rhombic lips, two thickenings of the dorsal parts of the alar plates of the metencephalon. Rhombic lips enlarge and fuse in the midline to form the vermis. Lateral expansions of the rhombic lips form the cerebellar hemispheres. As rhombic lips enlarge and fuse they overgrow the rostral part of the 4th ventricle and overlap the pons and medulla.

By the 4th month fissures appear on the surface of the cerebellum. A transverse fissure separates the nodule from the vermis and lateral flocculus from the hemisphere. Flocculonodular lobe (archicerebellum) is the most primitive part of the cerebellum connected mainly with the vestibular apparatus and is concerned with balance. Primary fissure separates the anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) from the posterior lobe (neocerebellum).

The anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) receives input from the spinal cord proprioceptive sensory modalities and is concerned with regulation of muscle tone. The posterior lobe (neocerebellum) receives cortico-pontocerebellar pathway and projection from the inferior olivary nucleus, and is concerned with coordination of sequence, strength and velocity of willed movements.

Some neuroblasts of the alar plates migrate to the marginal zone and develop into Purkinje cells. Others migrate to the surface and differentiate into neurons of the external granular layer. By the 6th month, cells of the external granular layer differentiate to various cell types of the cerebellar cortex including granule cells, basket cells, and stellate cells. The cerebellar cortex reaches its definitive size after birth. Some other neuroblasts give rise to cerebellar nuclei present in the white mater of the cerebellum. The largest of these nuclei is the dentate nucleus. With further development axons of neurons of the cerebellar nuclei grow out into the midbrain to reach the forebrain forming the superior cerebellar peduncle. Inferior cerebellar peduncle is formed by sensory fibers from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei and olivary nuclei. Middle cerebellar peduncle is formed by pontocerebellar fibers. The superior and inferior medullary vela are formed by the roof plate of the 4th ventricle.

\section*{MESENCEPHALON (MIDBRAIN)}

The midbrain undergoes lesser changes compared with the hindbrain and forebrain. The neural canal narrows to become the cerebral aqueduct, which connects the 3rd and 4th ventricles.
Waves of neuroblasts from the alar plates migrate into the overlying marginal zone of the tectum (roof) of the midbrain and aggregate to form 4 large groups of neurons, the paired superior and inferior colliculi which are concerned with visual and auditory reflexes. Here, they become arranged in stratified layers.

The basal plates of the midbrain contain two groups of motor nuclei: (a) somatic efferent (GSE) neurons represented by the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei which innervate the eye musculature; and (b) a small general visceral efferent neurons (GVE) represented by Edinger-Westphal nuclei, which innervate the sphincter pupillary muscles. Neuroblasts from the basal plates give rise to groups of neurons in the tegmentum of the midbrain: red nucleus, reticular nuclei and substantia nigra.
The cerebral peduncles (crura cerebri) are formed by fibers growing and descending from the cerebral cortex (corticopontine, corticobulbar and corticospinal) and passing through the ventral marginal layer of the developing midbrain to lower centers in the brain stem and spinal cord.

\section*{PROSENCEPHALON (FOREBRAIN)}

During the 4th week of development a lateral diverticulum appears on each side of the prosencephalon (forebrain) named optic vesicles. The part of prosencephalon cranial to optic vesicles forms the telencephalon (cerebrum) and the rest forms the diencephalon.

\section*{DIENCEPHALON}

The diencephalon develops from the median portion of the forebrain (prosencephalon) and consists of roof plate and two alar plates but lacking basal and floor plates.
The alar plates forming the lateral walls of the diencephalon proliferate and show three swellings that become epithalamus, thalamus and hypothalamus. The thalamus is separated from epithalamus by epithalamic sulcus, and from the hypothalamus by the hypothalamic sulcus.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_de4314b1bb1d6294700bg-092.jpg?height=1059&width=2311&top_left_y=322&top_left_x=104)

Thalami develop rapidly on each side and bulge into the cavity of the 3rd ventricle, reducing it into a narrow cleft. As a result of proliferative activity, expansion of the thalamus is so great that the two thalami fuse in the midline forming the interthalamic adhesion (connexus). The thalamus differentiates into groups of nuclei that relay sensations and information to the cerebral cortex. The visual and auditory impulses relay in the lateral and medial geniculate bodies of the thalamus (metathalamus).

Hypothalami form the lower portion of the alar plates of the diencephalon. The Hypothalamus differentiates into a number of nuclei that serve as regulation centers of visceral functions (digestion, body temperature, sleep and emotional behavior), homeostasis and endocrine activities. A pair of nuclei, mamillary bodies form a distinct protuberance on the ventral surface of the hypothalamus.

Epithalamus develops from the roof and dorsal portion of the diencephalon. The Pineal body (epiphysis) develops from the most caudal part of the roof plate as an epithelial thickening in the midline that evaginates dorsally and becomes a solid organ located at the diencephalic-midbrain junction. The pineal body manufactures melatonin and releases it in a cyclic manner. It mediates some cyclic functions, such as sleep cycle, reproductive cycles and puberty. It serves as a channel through which light and darkness affect endocrine and behavioral rhythm. The rest of epithalamus forms habenular nuclei and habenular commissure. The habenular complex mediates olfactory stimuli and feeding behavior.
-Subthalamus is an alar plate derivative of the diencephalon, located ventral to thalamus and lateral to hypothalamus. Some of its neuroblasts migrate into the telencephalon to form the globus pallidus.
-optic stalks evaginate from the diencephalon ventrally in the median plane and bifurcate.
-neurohypophysis (posterior pituitary) evaginates ventrally in the median plane near the junction of the diencephalon with the midbrain and does not bifurcate. The neurohypophysis meets another evagination, Rathke's pouch, which comes and separates from ectoderm of mouth roof. Stalk of neurohypophysis remains continuous with the neuraxis as the pituitary stalk.
The roof plate of the diencephalons is formed of a single layer of ependymal cells covered by pia vascular mesenchyme which invaginates the roof to

\section*{Development of Pituitary Gland}

Source
Pituitary gland is ectodermal in origin and develops from two sources:
- 1)Rathke's pouch is an upgrowth from ectodermal roof of the mouth.
- 2)Infundibulum is a downgroth from the diencephalon.
- The double origin explains why the pituitary is composed of two completely different tissues.

\section*{Stages of development of pituitary gland \\ Infundibulum of diencephalon (downgrowth from floor of forebrain)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_de4314b1bb1d6294700bg-100.jpg?height=1364&width=2192&top_left_y=435&top_left_x=194)
- The oral ectoderm gives the adenohypophysis (pars distalis, pars tuberalis and pars intermedia). The neuroectoderm gives rise to neurohypophsis (pars nervosa, infundibular stem and median eminence).
- By the middle of the $4^{\text {th }}$ week, a diverticulum from the roof of the mouth projects up and lies adjacent to the floor of the diencephalon. Meanwhile a downgrowth from the diencephalon descends down named the infundibulum.
- By the $5^{\text {th }}$ week Rathke's pouch constricts from the roof of the mouth and comes in contact with the infundibulum.
- During the $6^{\text {th }}$ week, the connection of Rathke's pouch with the oral cavity degenerates. The stalk of Rathke's poch passes between chondrification centers of the developing presphenoid and basisphenoid bones of the base of the skull. Rathke' pouch is now a vesicle that flattens itself around the anterior and lateral surfaces of the infundibulum. During further development cells in the anterior wall increase rapidly in number to form the anterior lobe of adenohypophysis.
- A small extension of the anterior lobe, pars tuberalis, grows along the stalk of the infundibulum and surrounds it. The posterior wall grows slower than the anterior wall and develops into pars intermedia, which in human has little significance. The cavity of the vesicle is reduced to a narrow cleft, the residual cleft.
- Meanwhile infundibulum has differentiated into the stalk and pars nervosa. Neuroglia of the pars nervosa differentiate into pituicytes. Nerve cells in hypothalamic nuclei give rise to many nerve fibers that grow inferiorly via the stalk int pars nervosa carrying neurosecretions whose activity begin in late fetal life.
- During the $3^{\text {rd }}$ and $4^{\text {th }}$ months, cells of pars distalis differentiate into chromophobes and chromophils (acidophils and basophils). Cells become arranged in columns around blood sinusoids. The gland becomes vascularized and a portal system of blood vessels is established.

\section*{Anomalies of pituitary}

\section*{glably}

Nremnant of the stalk of Rathke's pouch may persist and form pharyngeal pituitary in the roof of the oropharynx.
- 2-Craniopharyngioma

Remnant of Rathke's stalk gives a tumour which develops in the pharynx or basisphenoid mostly in or superior to sella turcica. It may cause pituitary dysfunction, diabetes insipidus, hydrocephalus or growth failure.
3-Absence of the pituitary is incompatible with life. Infants born without anterior lobe have maldeveloped adrenals, thyroid and gonads. Congenital absence of specific cells is recognized, e.g. absence of growth hormone is autosomal recessive trait recognized by dwarfism.

\section*{TELENCEPHALON}

The telencephalon, the most rostral of the brain vesicles, consists of two lateral outpocketings, the cerebral vesicles, and a median portion, the lamina terminalis. The cerebral vesicles are the primordial of the cerebral hemispheres. The cavity of each cerebral hemisphere is the lateral ventricle which communicates with the 3rd ventricle through the interventricular foramen (of Monro).

The cavity of the median portion of the telencephalon forms the extreme anterior part of the 3rd ventricle. In the region where the cerebral hemisphere is attached to the roof of the diencephalon, the wall is very thin and consists of a single layer of ependymal cells covered by pia-vascular mesenchyme (tela choroidea). The choroid plexus protrudes into the lateral ventricle along a line known as transverse or choroid fissure. Above the choroid fissure the medial wall of the hemisphere is thickened forming the hippocampus. Inrolling of the medial hemispheric wall create the transverse (choroid) fissure.

Basal Ganglia and Limbic System $\qquad$
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_de4314b1bb1d6294700bg-108.jpg?height=1532&width=1904&top_left_y=210&top_left_x=247)

As the cerebral hemispheres expand, they cover successively the diencephalons, midbrain and hindbrain. The two hemispheres meet each other in the midline at the interhemispheric fissure flattening their medial surfaces. The mesenchyme trapped in this longitudinal fissure gives rise to falx cerebri.

The basal ganglia (corpus striatum) appear during the 6th week as a prominent swelling in the floor of each cerebral hemisphere. Due to the presence of large basal ganglia, the floor of the hemisphere expands slower than its thin cortical walls; consequently the hemisphere becomes semicircular or C-shaped. This semicircular shape is due to downward and forward expansion of the caudal part of the hemisphere to form the temporal lobe. In doing so, a lateral (Sylvian) fissure is forming between the temporal and frontal lobes. Evagination of the temporal pole extends the temporal (inferior) horn of the lateral ventricle and increases the depth of the lateral (Sylvian) fissure.

Similar extensive evagination of the frontal and occipital poles extends the lateral ventricle in their directions to form anterior and posterior horns. Growth vectors in the cerebral wall force the hippocampal formation to migrate backward, downward, and forward in a semicircular arc, extending the transverse (choroid) fissure on the medial surface of the temporal lobe. As the cerebral cortex differentiates, fibers projecting to and from it pass through the corpus striatum dividing it into caudate nucleus and lentiform nucleus. This fiber pathway is called internal capsule. At the same time, the medial wall of the hemisphere and the lateral wall of the diencephalon fuse, and the caudate nucleus and thalamus come into close contact.

Caudate nucleus becomes elongated and C shaped, conforming to the outline of the lateral ventricle which is also C-shaped. Pear-shaped head and body of caudate lie in the floor of the anterior horn and stem of the lateral ventricle, whereas tail of caudate makes a U-shaped turn to reach the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. As growth in the region overlying the corpus striatum is slow, the area between the frontal and temporal lobes become depressed- the insula. This region is later overgrown by adjacent lobes and by the time of birth is completely covered.
-Neurons of the globus pallidus originate in the subthalamus and migrate into white mater of the telencephalon to form the medial segment of the lentiform nucleus (globus pallidus).

\section*{Development of the cerebral cortex}

In contrast with the spinal cord, gray mater of the brain is mainly peripherally situated. Histogenesis within the brain is characterized by cell migration. Cells of the mantle layer start migrating into the marginal zone in the 2nd month of gestation in the form of waves of neuroblasts that reach a subpial position and then differentiate into mature neurons. Cortical neuroblasts direct their axons inward. Successive waves of cortical neuroblasts leave the germinal zone at later times. Neurons for inner cortical layers migrate to the cerebral surface first. The next wave of neuroblasts migrates through earlier formed layers of cells until they reach a subpial position. Earlier formed neuroblasts obtain a deep position, while the newly arrived ones obtain a more superficial position in the cerebral cortex until neuroblasts cease to divide.

The four outer layers of cortical neurons develop after the inner two, in an inside-out sequence. The cortex shows its final 6 lamina by the 8th month of gestation. In their migration, neuroblasts are guided by radial glial cells. At birth, the cortex has a stratified appearance due to differentiation of the cells in different layers. The most common types of neurons in the cerebral cortex have pyramidal, stellate or fusiform shape. Less common types, the neurons of Martinotti and the horizontal neurons of Cajal have polygonal or fusiform shape. The cerebral cortex is made up of several layers which vary in number from 3 layers in the primitive cortex (hippocampus or archicortex) to 6 layers in dominant neocortex. The various types of stellate neurons, and Cajal and Martonitti neurons are cortical interneurons whose axons remain within the cerebral cortex.
-Axons from cell bodies (mainly from pyramidal cells) in the cortex pass centrally to form white mater of the cerebrum. The outer 4 cortical layers (layers I,II,III and IV) tend to be receptive and internuncial in function. The inner two layers ( V and VI ) tend to be projective in function. Cortical commissural and association axons arise mainly from neurons in layers II and III.
-Cytodifferntiation of the cerebral cortex is complex and is controlled by genetic, neurotropic, growth and hormonal factors.

Fissures alter the ventricular contour. These fissures are: interhemispheric (longitudinal) fissure, sylvian or lateral fissure, and transverse or choroid fissure. After the fissures appear, the cerebral surface remains smooth until sulcation commences in week 16. During later months, surface of the cerebral hemisphere grows so rapidly that many convolutions- gyri separated by sulci appear on the surface. Sulci indent the outer surface of the cerebrum but do not alter the ventricular contour. By the 7th month several sulci appear on the surface including the central and occipital sulci. Timetable of sulcation can be used to estimate the gestational age. Sulci and gyri permit a considerable increase in the surface area of the cerebral cortex. As the brain grows the gyral pattern becomes more complex. At birth the brain is about $25 \%$ of its adult volume.

Postnatal growth of the brain is due to:
1-increase in neuronal sizes.
2-proliferation of neuronal processes.
3-proliferation of astrocytes.
4-myelination of nerve fibers.

Development of white mater of cerebrum White mater of the cerebrum is composed of:
1-Axons, which run in organized tracts.
2-Glia:
a)Oligodendrocytes provide myelin.
b)Astrocytes provide scaffolding.

3-Blood vessels.
Destinations of cortical axons
Cortical axons may synapse on other cortical neurons or on infracortical neurons. The developing efferent axons are classified according to their destinations into:

1-Association fibers. Axons of cortical neurons synapse on ipsilateral cortical neurons associating functions of these neurons. Short association fibers associate near by gyri, e.g. arcuate bundle. Long association fibers connect lobes or surfaces of the hemisphere, e.g. superior longitudinal bundle connects frontal and occipital lobes and inferior longitudinal bundle connects occipital and temporal lobes. The bundles receive and give axons along their course.

2-Cerebral commissures. These are axons that cross the midline to synapse on contralateral neurons (mirror-image points). Anterior commissure is located in front of anterior column of the fornix and connects olfactory bulbs together. Hippocampal commissure connects the posterior columns of fornix together. Corpus callosum is the largest commissure which appears during the 4th month and connects neocortical areas together. Corpus callosum initially lies in the lamina terminalis, but fibers are added to it as the cortex enlarges. Posterior commissure is present inferior to the pineal body and connects pretectal and collicular areas of the two sides of midbrain. Habenular commissure forms the superior stalk of the pineal body and connects habenular nuclei together. Optic chiasma develops in the ventral part of lamina terminalis. It consists of fibers from the medial halves of the retinae which cross to join optic tract of the opposite side.

3-Projection fibers. Cortical axons that synapse on infra-cortical neurons project the cortical influence onto the lower centers, e.g. internal capsule. Projection fibers end ipsilaterally and contralaterally.

Approximate time when various tracts appear
End of first month
-spinal trigeminal tract
-fasciculus solitarius
End of second month -posterior commissure
-thalamic peduncles
-inferior cerebellar peduncle
-internal capsule

Third month -anterior commissure
Fourth month -corpus callosum
Fifth month $\quad$-pyramidal fibers

\section*{Phylogeny of the cerebral cortex}

\section*{(1) Evolution of the cortical laminae}
-In primitive animals the cerebral neurons tend to have reticular pattern. This pattern persists as paleocortex in subsequent animals (including human) in the olfactory areas.
-In higher submammals, e.g. reptiles, more neurons migrate to the cerebral surface where they start to laminate. In mammals, the cortex of 3 layers is present in the hippocampal formation and is called archicortex.
-Allocortex (archicortex and paleocortex) forms the inner ring of the three concentric rings of the hemisphere.
-Neocortex (isocortex) is formed of 6 layers of neurons:
a)Mesocortex is the limbic cortex which is the second concentric ring of the cerebrum and is formed of the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri.
b)Ecocotex is phylogenitically new and covers most of the cerebral surface. Overgrowth of ecocortex accounts for increasing brain size in higher animals. Ecocortex is also called supralimbic cortex.

\section*{(2) Increase number of cortical neurons}
-Animals are arranged in series of increasing intelligence in proportion to the increasing number of neurons in their cerebrum, a phylogenetic process called encephalization.
-Two evolutionary events have markedly increased the number of cerebral neurons while limiting the head circumference to a manageable size: a)Cortex formation, which coats the cerebral hemisphere with many layers of neurons. b)Fissuration (sulcation), which infolds the spherical surface to increase its area relative to its circumference, enabling the greatest area to fit into the smallest space.

\section*{(3) Evolution of the semicircular (C-shaped) cerebral hemisphere}
a)Laterally: is by downward and forward evagination of the temporal lobe. Evagination of the temporal pole extends the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, and lengthens and deepens Sylvian fissure. By this cerebral hemispheres have c-shaped as viewed externally.
b)Medially: is by invagination of the roof plate and inrolling of the hippocampus which create the transverse fissure. Growth vectors in the cerebral wall force the hippocampus to migrate backward, downward and forward in a semicircular arc, extending the transverse fissure forward in the medial wall of the temporal lobe as the choroid fissure. Migration of hippocampus matches the semicircular configuration of the temporal lobe. The fornix strings out along the pathway of migration of the hippocampus retaining its anchor to the anterior commissure and mammillary body. The same process draws out the tail of caudate nucleus to curve and reach the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle.

\section*{Congenital malformations of the brain}

Incidence: 3 : 1000 births.

\section*{Causes}

1-Genetic mutations or chromosomal abnormalities: as the cases of mental retardation with Down syndrome and Prader Willis syndrome.
2-Environmental factors: exposure to teratogens as hyperthermia, irradiation, drugs (alcohol,valproic acid), viruses and toxoplasmosis.
3-Nutritional: in foliate deficiency or hypervitaminosis A.
4-Birth trauma: which may result in mental retardation.
5-Multifactorial: combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Mechanisms
1-Defective closure of the neural tube, particularily defective closure of the cranial neuropore.
2-Alteration of morphogenesis or histogenesis due to exposure to teratogens or due to developmental failure of associated structures (notochord, somites, mesenchyme and skull).
Diagnosis
1-Ultrasonography.
2-Increased alpha-fetoproteins in amniotic fluid or serum of mother.

1-Cranium bifidum. Defect in occipital bone. If opening is small, only meninges protrude (meningocele), If large, part of the brain (meningoencephalocele) and even part of the ventricle (meningohydroencephalocele) penetrate through the opening into the meningeal sac.
2-Anencephaly (without a brain). Most of the brain and skull vault are missing. It results from failure of closure of rostral neuropore during the 4th week of development. The malformed brain tissue is exposed from the cranium - exencephaly. A rudimentary brain stem is always present in living infants; meroanencephaly is a better name for this anomaly (meros=part). Infants survive for only few hours after birth. Meroanencephaly occurs once every 1000 births, more common in female infants. It is associated with polyhydramnios because the fetus lacks the neural control of swallowing. It is suspected when there is elevated level of alpha-fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid. It is diagnosed by ultrasonography, radiology and fetoscopy.

3-Microcephaly is small size cranial vault due to small sized brain (microencephaly). Growth of the calvaria is largely dependent on growth of the brain. Facial skeleton is of normal size. The causes of microcephaly may be genetic (autosomal recessive), teratogenetic (exposure to rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, ionizing radiation, and maternal alcohol abuse) or due to premature closure (synostosis) of the sutures of the skull. Impaired mental development occurs in more than half the cases. Microcephaly can be detected in utero by ultrasound.

4-Hydrocephalus is abnormal accumulation of CSF within ventricular system of the brain due to: (a) impaired circulation, (b) impaired absorption, (c) increased secretion (by choroid adenoma).
Varieties
a)Obstructive (non-communicating) hydrocephalus

Blockage of CSF flow is within the ventricular system, commonly due to aqueductal stenosis which may result from fetal viral infection or transmitted as X-linked recessive trait. Stenosis impairs circulation from 3rd to 4th ventricles. Lateral and 3rd ventricles are dilated. The brain is squeezed between the ventricular fluid and skull bones leading to its atrophy. Increased expansion of the brain causes widening of the spaces between skull bones and the head becomes very large.
b)Communicating (non-obstructive) hydrocephalus

Obliteration of the CSF circulation is in the subarachnoid space beyond the ventricular system and all ventricles are enlarged; due to
1)Subarachnoid hemorrhage (associated with prematurity).
2)Obliteration of subarachnoid cisterns.
3)Malformation of arachnoid villi.
4)Failure of opening of the 3 apertures of the 4th ventricle.

\section*{5-Holoprosencephaly}

The foreorebrain remains holospheric. The prosencephalon fails to give two outpocketings and the prosencephalic cavity is a single holoventricle without a subdivision into lateral and third ventricles. Usually, there are associated defects of the corpus callosum, olfactory lobe (arhinencephaly), and facial anomalies. There is normal sulcation of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Genetic factors (Patu syndrome, trisomy 13), mutaion in SHH which regulates midline CNS structures. Maternal diabetes and alcohol abuse can destroy embryonic cells of the median plane resulting in failure of the forebrain to evaginate or invaginate. Defective cholesterol synthesis due to defective 7-DHC reductase may be the cause as the case of Smith-Lemli-Optiz syndrome. Cholesterol is necessary for SHH to act. Mutation in transcription factor TGF-1 can be a cause for HPE

6-Hydranencephaly. Cerebral hemispheres are represented by membranous sacs with remnants of cerebral cortex. Brainstem is intact. Infants appear normal at birth; however the head grows excessively after birth due to CSF accumulation. There is failure of mental and cognitive development. The cause of this rare and severe anomaly is occlusion of blood flow to areas supplied by the internal carotid artery, or from encephalitis in utero caused by rubella, herpesvirus,
cytomegalovirus
Or toxoplasmosis.

\section*{7-Mental retardation}

8-16 week is critical period for brain development. By the end of week 16, most neuronal proliferation and cell migration to the cerebral cortex are completed. Cell depletion or damage during this period results in mental retardation. Mental retardation may not be associated with brain abnormalities.

Congenital impairment of intelligence may result from
a)Genetic mutation or chromosomal defects (trisomy 13,18,21).
b)Maternal alcohol abuse.
c) Exposure to irradiation during 8-16 w .
d)Inborn error of metabolism (phenylketonuria).
e)Exposure to infectious agents; rubella, toxoplasmosis.
f) Cretinism.
g)Microcephaly.

Mental retardation during postnatal period may result from:
a)Cerebral trauma.
b)Cerebral infections (encephalitis, meningitis).
c) Exposure to toxins (lead, mercury).
d)Birth injuries.

8-Cerebral palsy is one of the most crippling conditions of childhood. This central motor deficit may be due to prenatal factors or birth trauma.
9-Schizencephaly is a rare disorder in which large clefts occur in the cerebral hemispheres. Mutation of homeobox gene EMX2 is responsible for this case.

10-Porencephaly is a wide defect in the cerebral hemisphere and is associated with mental deficiency and cerebral palsy.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM}

Peripheral nervous system consists of nerves (spinal, cranial and visceral) and ganglia (spinal, cranial and autonomic).

\section*{Spinal ganglia}

All sensory cells (somatic and autonomic) of PNS are derived from neural crest cells, and located outside the CNS. These cells are at first bipolar, but the two processes unite to form a single process,so become psudounipolar. These unipolar cells have a peripheral process terminating in a sensory ending (receptor) and a central process entering spinal cord. The cell bodies are invested by a capsule of modified Schwann cells -satellite cells- derived from neural crest cells. Outside satellite cells is a layer of connective tissue derived from mesenchyme.

\section*{Spinal nerves}

Motor fibers of spinal nerves arise from the basal plates (ventral horns) of the developing spinal cord. Fibers grow and emerge as rootlets along the ventrolateral surface of the spinal cord and are called ventral root of the spinal nerve. Fibers of the dorsal root are formed by axons of cells of the spinal ganglion which grow toward the spinal cord opposite the dorsal horns (alar plates) of gray mater. Peripheral processes of spinal ganglion cells grow toward ventral nerve root and fuse with it to form spinal nerve trunk which divides immediately into dorsal ramus (supplies muscles and skin of the back) and ventral ramus (supplies muscles and skin of limbs and ventrolateral body wall). Nerves from spinal cord segments opposite a limb bud grow into this bud to supply its muscles. Skin of limbs is also supplied in a segmental manner.

Cranial ganglia
-Sensory ganglia of the cranial nerve are derived from neural crest cells. They contribute to ganglia of cranial nerves for the pharyngeal arches (V,VII,IX,X).
-Parasympathetic ganglia of cranial nerves III,VII,IX and $X$ are derived from neural crest cells.

Cranial nerves
By the 4th week of development, nuclei of all 12 cranial nerves are developed. Except the olfactory and optic nerves, all arise from the brain stem.

\section*{DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM}

\section*{Sympathetic Nervous System}

In the 5th week, cells originating in the neural crest of the thoracic region migrate on each side of the spinal cord behind the dorsal aorta and form bilateral chain of segmentally arranged sympathetic ganglia interconnected by nerve fibers. Together, they form sympathetic trunks located on each side of the vertebral column (paravertebral chain). From this position in the thorax, neuroblasts migrate toward the cervical and lumbosacral regions, thus extending the sympathetic chains to their full length.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_de4314b1bb1d6294700bg-158.jpg?height=1193&width=1350&top_left_y=137&top_left_x=575)

Figure 19.43 Relation of the preganglionic and postganglionic nerve fibers of the sympathetic nervous system to the spinal nerves. Note the origin of preganglionic fibers in the visceroefferent column of the spinal cord.

Although, initially, the ganglia are arranged segmentally, this arrangement is later obscured in the cervical region, by fusion of the ganglia. Some neural crest cells migrate ventral to the aorta and form preaortic (prevertebral) ganglia such as coeliac and mesenteric ganglia. Other neural crest cells migrate to the area of the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, where they form terminal ganglia in autonomic plexuses located near or within these organs. Other neural crest cells migrate retroperitoneally to form scattered paraganglia -chromaffin cells. These widely scattered groups of chromaffin cells constitute the chromaffin system. These cells are similar to cells of the suprarenal medulla.

Preganglionic sympathetic axons arise from lateral horn cells of the thoracolumbar segments of the spinal cord and exit with the ventral roots of spinal nerves. Axons enter the nerve trunk and take one of four courses:
a-They may form white rami communicants to synapse with postganglionic neurons in sympathetic ganglion at the same level of the nerve trunk. White rami are found only in the thoracolumbar region of the spinal cord.
b-They may ascend or descend to synapse with ganglia of the sympathetic chain at higher or lower levels.
c-They may bypass paravertebral chain to synapse in a prevertebral ganglion.
d-They may pass through sympathetic chain without synapsing , forming splanchnic nerves to the viscera.

From a sympathetic ganglion, the postsynaptic (postganglionic) axon may rejoin an adjacent nerve trunk by way of a gray ramus communicans, or travel rostrally or caudally in the sympathetic chain to another nerve trunk. Gray rami communicants are present at all levels of the spinal cord. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers are distributed with spinal nerves to peripheral blood vessels, sweat glands and hairs.

\section*{Parasympathetic Nervous System}

Parasympathetic neurons are located in the brain stem and in the sacral region of the spinal cord (craniosacral). The presynaptic (preganglionic) parasympathetic fibers from nuclei in the brain stem travel via the oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to relay in ganglia derived from neural crest cells. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers innervate sphincter pupillae, lacrimal and salivary glands, heart and the viscera. The sacral preganglionic parasympathetic axons arise from the sacral segments of the spinal cord (S2-S4). They exit through ventral roots forming the sacral plexus, and then enter the pelvic splanchnic nerves which with the sympathetic axons form pelvic plexus and then run to postganglionic neurons (terminal ganglia) located in the wall of pelvic viscera.

\section*{Congenital aganglionic megacolon (Hirschsprung disease)}

Incidence: 1:5000 births, male more than female :4/1
Mechanism: Failure of neural crest cells to migrate into wall of large colon. Consequently, no parasympathetic ganglia form in the affected areas. Rectum and sigmoid colon are involved in most of the affected infants. Ascending and transverse colon are affected in 10-20\% of cases. The colon is dilated above the affected region, which has a small diameter due to tonic contraction of noninnervated vasculature. The affected segment is constricted and paralyzed, which results in distention of the proximal, normally innervated bowel.

\section*{Basal Ganglia}

You have just read about the different motor-related cortical areas. Premotor areas are involved in planning, while MI is involved in execution. What you don't know is that the cortical areas involved in movement control need "help" from other brain circuits in order to smoothly orchestrate motor behaviors. One of these circuits involves a group of structures deep in the brain called the basal ganglia. While their exact motor function is still debated, the basal ganglia clearly regulate movement. Without information from the basal ganglia, the cortex is unable to properly direct motor control, and the deficits seen in Parkinson’s and Huntington's disease and related movement disorders become apparent.

Let's start with the anatomy of the basal ganglia. The important "players" are identified in the adjacent figure. The caudate and putamen have similar functions, and we will consider them as one in this discussion. Together the caudate and putamen are called the neostriatum or simply striatum. All input to the basal ganglia circuit comes via the striatum. This input comes mainly from motor cortical areas.

Notice that the caudate (L. tail) appears twice in many frontal brain sections. This is because the caudate curves around with the lateral ventricle. The head of the caudate is most anterior. It gives rise to a body whose "tail" extends with the ventricle into the temporal lobe (the "ball" at the end of the tail is the amygdala, whose limbic functions you will learn about later).

Medial to the putamen is the globus pallidus (GP). Anatomically, the putamen and globus pallidus are shaped like a lens. For this reason, they are referred to as the lenticular nucleus. This term is still in use, even though the functions of the putamen and globus pallidus are different. The globus pallidus has two
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-01.jpg?height=1077&width=1139&top_left_y=1576&top_left_x=569)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-02.jpg?height=925&width=1055&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=215)
parts, a lateral, external (or outer) segment and a medial, internal (or inner) segment. Let's call them GP(external) and GP(internal).

GP(internal) contains the output neurons of the basal ganglia circuit. They project to ipsilateral motor thalamus, VA and VL. We'll discuss the connections of GP(external) later.

One of the pathways that conveys information from GP(internal) to motor thalamus is the ansa lenticularis. The "ansa" is evident in level 16 as a thick fiber bundle, associated with the globus pallidus, that loops under (ventral) the posterior limb of the internal capsule (ansa = L. loop, handle). While not apparent in this section, the ansa lenticularis then heads dorsally to reach the ipsilateral motor thalamic nuclei (VA/VL).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-02.jpg?height=741&width=1112&top_left_y=1310&top_left_x=802)

LEVEL 16

In addition to the ansa lenticularis (often called the jug handle), information from the more caudal part of globus pallidus can also reach the VA/ VL via the lenticular fasciculus. Globus pallidus fibers in the lenticular fasiculus pass through (rather than under) the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The fibers then travel on top of the subthalamic nucleus (level 14) before looping dorsally and rostrally (level 15) towards VA/VL. While en route to the thalamus, the ansa and lenticular fasciculus fibers join other (e.g.,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-03.jpg?height=955&width=1139&top_left_y=203&top_left_x=829) cerebellothalamic) fibers that are also headed for VA/VL. This combined bundle is obvious in fiber stained sections and is called the thalamic fasciculus.

All cortical areas involved in the planning and execution of movements project to the striatum (caudate and putamen). Striatal neurons receiving these cortical inputs then project to the globus pallidus, which in turn projects to the VA/VL. VA/VL in turn projects to motor cortex. So, the caudate, putamen and globus pallidus act on the motor thalamus, which acts on the motor cortex. There are no descending pathways that go from the basal ganglia directly to the spinal cord.

ALL OF THIS CIRCUITRY IS ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE BRAINUNCROSSED.

Thus, the basal ganglia affect function mediated by the ipsilateral motor cortex. Since motor cortex controls the movements of the contralateral body....

So, what happens between striatum, which receives the inputs, and GP(internal), which provides the output? There are two important pathways through which striatal information reaches GP(internal) - the direct pathway and the indirect pathway. These two pathways have opposite effects on motor activity and help explain many clinical symptoms of basal ganglia diseases.

In the direct pathway, striatal cells project directly to GP(internal). That was easy. The consequence of this pathway is to increase the excitatory drive from thalamus to cortex. Let's see how this is accomplished. The cortical projections to the striatum use the excitatory transmitter glutamate. When they are activated, these cortical projections excite striatal neurons. This excitatory input is enough to turn on the striatal cell. This striatal cell uses the inhibitory transmitter GABA and its axon passes to, and inhibits, a cell in GP(internal). The cells in GP(internal)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-04.jpg?height=1264&width=942&top_left_y=455&top_left_x=960) that project to VA/VL also use GABA. So, the cortical signal excites striatal neurons, which results in MORE inhibition from striatum to GP(internal). More inhibition of GP(internal) means LESS inhibition of motor thalamus (VA/VL). Since the motor thalamus receives LESS inhibition, the VA/VL cells will INCREASE their firing (VA/VL cells are not just receiving the inhibitory pallidal input, but have other excitatory inputs [one source you already know is cerebellar]). This decrease in inhibition is called dis-inhibition. Though not the same as direct excitation, it similarly leads to an increase in activity. So the end result of cortical excitatory input to striatal neurons at the head of the direct pathway is INCREASED FIRING OF VA/VL NEURONS AND IN TURN MOTOR CORTEX.

The cellular components just described comprise the DIRECT PATHWAY. Think about this pathway as turning the motor system UP. That is, cells in VA/VL and the motor cortex INCREASE their firing. This results in increased activity in the corticospinal tract and eventually the muscles.

\section*{REMEMBER, THE DIRECT PATHWAY TURNS UP MOTOR ACTIVITY.}

Now let's turn to the Indirect Pathway. Instead of projecting to GP(internal), the striatal neurons of the indirect pathway project to GP(external). Now we need to add another nucleus. This is the subthalamic nucleus. This nucleus lies just above the rostral portion of the substantia nigra (levels 13, 14). Cells in GP(external) project to the subthalamic nucleus. Cells in the subthalamic nucleus then project to GP(internal), which in turn projects to VA/VL. So, the indirect pathway is striatum to GP(external) to subthalamic nucleus to GP(internal) to VA/VL to motor cortex.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-05.jpg?height=700&width=839&top_left_y=200&top_left_x=1131)

A key thing to remember is that the projection neurons in cortex, subthalamic nucleus and VA/VL thalamus use glutamate; their effects are excitatory. The projection neurons in striatum and both segments of globus pallidus use $\mathbf{G A B A}$; their effects are inhibitory. So, applying the pluses (excitation) and minuses (inhibition) in the indirect pathway reveals that the consequence of the indirect pathway is to decrease the excitatory drive from thalamus to cortex. Let's take a more detailed look at the circuitry and see how this is accomplished.

In the indirect pathway, cortical fibers excite striatal neurons that project to GP(external). The increased activity of the GABAergic striatal neurons decreases activity in GP(external). The GABAergic cells in GP(external) inhibit cells in the subthalamic nucleus, so the decrease in activity in GP(external) results in less inhibition of cells in the subthalamic nucleus. That is, subthalmic neurons are dis-inhibited and increase their activity. The "return" projection from the subthalamic nucleus to GP(internal) is excitatory, so the increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus results in more excitation to cells in GP(internal). Thus, the end result of actions of the indirect loop is an increase in activity of the GABAergic cells in GP(internal) that project to VA/VL or an INCREASE in INHIBITION of the thalamic neurons.

The Indirect Pathway turns DOWN the motor thalamus and, in turn, motor cortex. Thus, it TURNS DOWN motor activity.

\section*{INDIRECT PATHWAY TURNS DOWN MOTOR ACTIVITY}

\section*{DOPAMINERGIC and CHOLINERGIC Modulation of Direct and Indirect Pathways}

Now comes the good stuff. Striatal neurons are modulated by two important neuromodulatory systems. Each of these systems differentially affects the direct and indirect pathways, thereby altering their balance and the amount of motor activity that is produced.

First, let's add the substantia nigra to the system. As you now know from the brain stem lectures, DOPAMINE is produced by cells in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc). Nigrostriatal axon terminals release dopamine into the striatum. Dopamine has an EXCITATORY effect upon cells in the striatum that are part of the Direct Pathway. This is via D1 receptors. Dopamine has an INHIBITORY effect upon striatal cells associated with the Indirect Pathway. This is via D2 receptors. In other words, the direct pathway (which turns up motor activity) is excited by dopamine while the indirect pathway (which turns down motor activity) is inhibited. Both of these effects lead to increased motor activity.

\section*{DOPAMINE EXCITES THE DIRECT AND INHIBITS THE INDIRECT PATHWAY}

\section*{THE EFFECT OF THE DOPAMINERGIC NIGROSTRIATAL PROJECTION IS TO INCREASE MOTOR ACTIVITY}

Now we need to add one last set of cells to the circuitry of the basal ganglia. There is a population of cholinergic (ACh) neurons in the striatum whose axons do not leave the striatum (called interneurons or local circuit neurons). These cholinergic interneurons synapse on the GABAergic striatal neurons that project to GP(internal) AND on the striatal neurons that project to GP(external). The cholinergic actions INHIBIT striatal cells of the Direct pathway and EXCITE striatal cells of the Indirect pathway. Thus the effects of ACh are OPPOSITE the effects of dopamine on the direct and indirect pathways so the ACh effects on motor activity are opposite those of dopamine.

\section*{Disorders of the Basal Ganglia: Hypokinesia}

Now that we know the major circuits in the basal ganglia, let's take a look at some basic disorders and why they occur. Damage to the basal ganglia causes two different classes of syndromes, one characterized by an increase in movement (hyperkinetic) and the other characterized by decreased movement (hypokinetic). The most well known hypokinetic syndrome is Parkinson's disease, and it generally affects the elderly population. While hypokinesia (reduced movement) is the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease, three other signs (rigidity, tremor and loss of postural reflexes) accompany this decrease in movement.

In Parkinson's disease, rigidity is present in all muscle groups, both flexor and extensor, so that the resistance to passive movement is intense and consistent through the entire range of motion, so-called lead-pipe rigidity. This is often accompanied by cogwheeling, which refers to jerky, ratchet-like movements of the joints. Unlike the spasticity linked to upper motor neuron lesions, there is no change in the tendon reflexes and all muscles are affected although there is a tendency for the patients to maintain a flexed posture in both arms and legs. The tremor of Parkinson's patients is a static or resting tremor, which refers to the involuntary $4-5 \mathrm{~Hz}$ movements when the limb is held at rest but disappears during a voluntary movement. This contrasts sharply with the intention tremor of cerebellar signs. The loss of postural reflexes results in balance problems, which can manifest as unstable, stooped, or slumped-over posture and a shuffling walk of small steps followed by the need for quicker steps to maintain balance. It is difficult to explain all these symptoms with the knowledge that we currently have, but we can certainly account for the hypokinesia.

As you know, dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta are lost in Parkinson's disease. The degenerating nigral dopaminergic cells accumulate deposits of protein called Lewy Bodies. This is a histological hallmark of the disease.

Let's consider a lesion in the SN pars compacta as it relates to the direct pathway. The SN lesion takes away the dopaminergic drive on the direct pathway. The direct pathway turns up motor activity, and dopamine is excitatory to striatal neurons at the head of the direct pathway. When you take away the dopamine, activity in the direct pathway goes down, and motor activity goes down. Also, compounding this reduction in dopamine facilitation, ACh interneurons are still inhibiting the striatal cells at the head of the direct pathway. So there is a double whammy on the direct pathway --- loss of the excitation from dopamine AND ongoing and now unopposed inhibitory ACh input. Again, the end result is MORE inhibition reaching the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-08.jpg?height=1259&width=911&top_left_y=1295&top_left_x=992) VA/VL. That is, the motor thalamus and
cortex are less active!
Now let's walk through a lesion of the SNc as it relates to the Indirect Pathway. Dopamine normally inhibits the indirect pathway, and the indirect pathway turns down motor activity. Take away the dopamine inhibition and the indirect pathway increases its activity. The loss of dopaminergic inhibition to the indirect pathway is compounded by the now un-opposed excitatory actions of the cholinergic interneurons that drive the indirect pathway. Thus a SNc lesion increases activity in the indirect pathway, which turns DOWN motor activity.

The results of losing dopamine on both the Direct and Indirect Pathways is a reduction in the activity of VA/VL and, in turn, motor cortical neurons. This results in hypokinetic symptoms such as akinesia (no movement) or bradykinesia (slow movement). With Parkinson's disease, think of it this way; the turning up system
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-09.jpg?height=1356&width=1015&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=940) (direct pathway) is less active, and the turning down system (indirect pathway) is more active. The result is turning down of motor activity or hypokinesia.

Since the hypokinetic (Parkinson's) patients have decreased levels of dopamine in the striatum and substantia nigra pars compacta, they can be treated symptomatically with dopaminergic agonists, such as L-dopa. This is a precursor of dopamine that crosses the blood brain barrier. Parkinson's patients can also be treated with drugs that decrease the level of acetylcholine in the striatum. Remember, that ACh inhibits striatal cells that project into the Direct Pathway. If a cholinergic antagonist reduces this inhibition, then the "turning up" pathway can be more active. Also remember that ACh cells are excitatory on striatal cells projecting into the Indirect Pathway. If this excitation is blocked by anticholinergic drugs then the "turning down" pathway will not be as active.

\section*{HYPOKINETIC PROBLEMS (e.g., Parkinson's Disease) CAN BE HELPED BY: RAISING DOPAMINE LEVELS or LOWERING ACh LEVELS IN THE STRIATUM}

There has been considerable interest generated by the discovery that a "synthetic heroin" drug of abuse contains a substance (MPTP or N-methyl, 4-phenyl, 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine) that causes neurological symptoms virtually indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease. Perhaps the natural disease is caused by chronic exposure to environmental chemicals similar in structure to MPTP. MPTP itself seems to be harmless, but it is converted to a toxic derivative MPP+ by monoamine oxidase B enzymes in the brain. Studies indicate that monoamine oxidase B inhibitors may help slow the course of the disease. There has also been considerable interest in using transplants of dopaminergic cells into the striatum of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease as a means of alleviating its symptoms. Success in a very limited number of patients has been reported from implants from either the adrenal medulla or fetal dopamine-secreting cells.

It has also been demonstrated that some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be reduced or alleviated by placing stimulating electrodes in the thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, or pallidum. The improvement gained from these electrical stimulating techniques depends on the location of the stimulation. Thalamic stimulators seem to be effective in reducing tremor, but do little for akinesia. Pallidal stimulation seems to have a more all-encompassing therapeutic effect. It is not immediately apparent from the neural circuits why electrical stimulation would actually improve the situation. One explanation of some effects may be that the high frequency stimulation may actually block or reduce neuronal firing for a short period of time. This is a very active area of research. While these stimulators, transplants and various drug therapies have come a long way in improving the lives of people with basal ganglia disorders, there is a great deal more to learn.

\section*{Disorders of the Basal Ganglia: Hyperkinesia}

While the loss of dopamine from the substantia nigra results in hypokinetic symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease, hyperkinetic problems are caused by other pathologies of the basal ganglia. Two classic hyperkinetic disorders are hemiballism and Huntington's chorea. Hemiballism is characterized by wild, flinging movements of the body, and it results from lesion in the subthalamic nucleus. The excitatory input to GP(internal) is lost following such lesions. The result is LESS inhibition reaching the VA/VL (the subthalamic nucleus normally increases the inhibition in the pallidal-VA/VL projection). Thus, the VA/VL is turned up, as is motor cortex, and there is uncontrollable hyperactivity of the motor system.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-10.jpg?height=1048&width=762&top_left_y=1536&top_left_x=1061)

Huntington's chorea is characterized by involuntary choreiform movements which show up as rapid, involuntary and purposeless jerks of irregular and variable location on the body. They are spontaneous and cannot be inhibited, controlled, or directed by the patient. Huntington's chorea is an inherited disease that usually shows up in the fourth decade. Disease onset is slow and hard to diagnose, but usually general irritableness and explosive behavior precede motor symptoms. Later, there is memory loss and attention deficit, followed by restless or fidgety hands. Finally, the disease progresses with facial movements and constant jerky movements of all parts of the body. Despite the continual movements, there may be hypotonia. The initial cause of these uncontrollable movements is the loss of GABAergic cells in the striatum that project only to GP(external), the head of the indirect pathway. This loss shows up on MRI as degeneration in the caudate nucleus. The loss of this inhibition on the head of the indirect pathway (which turns down motor activity) means that VA/VL is turned up, as is the motor cortex, and there is uncontrollable hyperactivity of the motor system. In addition to the loss of striatal GABAergic cells of the indirect pathway, the striatal cholinergic cells also begin to die. The loss of both types of cell causes less inhibition of VA/VL and increased motor output.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-11.jpg?height=1020&width=1678&top_left_y=1023&top_left_x=266)

How can these hyperkinetic problems be treated? Remember that the indirect pathway is turned down, and the direct pathway is dominating. The hyperkinesia can be reduced by bringing the contributions of the direct and indirect pathways more into balance. One approach is to replace the lost cholinergic input to the striatum. ACh turns DOWN motor activity by inhibiting the direct pathway. If there are any surviving striatal-GP(external) neurons, ACh would excite them and thus increase activity in the indirect pathway, also leading to a decrease in motor activity.

The same cholinergic agonists will help hemiballism. Again, there is hyperactivity of the motor thalamus because the pallidal inhibition upon the VA/VL is decreased due to the loss of the
subthalamic nucleus. Think about what you could do to decrease activity in the direct pathway (which normally turns things up). You could slow the direct pathway down by increasing the amount of ACh reaching those striatal neurons that project into the direct pathway. This means there is less inhibition flowing out of the striatum to GP(internal), and more inhibition of VA/VL. The end result is less movement, i.e., reduction of the hyperkinesia. As an alternative, you could also decrease activity in the direct pathway by reducing its activation from dopamine with a dopaminergic antagonist.

\section*{Both treatments DECREASE activity in the Direct Pathway (the "turning up" system) and INCREASE activity in the Indirect Pathway (the "turning down" system)}

In summary, the basal ganglia are clearly involved in motor function. They receive major input from motor cortex and act, via motor thalamus, on the motor cortex. Also, basal ganglia problems lead to motor deficits. What is less clear is the role of the basal ganglia under normal circumstances. One clue to basal ganglia function is that there are no descending projection to motor neurons in spinal cord or brainstem. Thus, the basal ganglia act on cortical neurons that orchestrate the motor commands.

A common thread of the many hypotheses about basal ganglia function builds on the "turn up - turn down" effects of the direct and indirect pathways. Any movement you make requires that certain motor commands (i.e., raise arm) be executed and opposing commands (i.e., lower arm) be suppressed. There is evidence that actions of the direct pathway promote the proper execution commands and the indirect pathway suppresses commands related to opposing movements.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_28_4c20a3cc42cb926081fbg-12.jpg?height=1307&width=901&top_left_y=962&top_left_x=1032)

Another hypothesis is that the basal ganglia are important for performing a sequence of movements smoothly, and the direct and indirect pathways may play a role in this. Performing a motor sequence requires that the movements be executed in the proper order. Thus, the direct pathway may "turn up" the appropriate movement commands when it is their turn while the indirect pathway may "turn down" the commands when it is not their turn.

The basal ganglia play a special role in motor function, and basal ganglia problems lead to particular motor deficits. These deficits differ from those associated with lower and upper motor neuron damage. As a review, let's look at the results of lesions involving different aspects of the motor system.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Lower Motor Neuron & Upper Motor Neuron & Basal Ganglia \\
\hline Paralysis & Paresis (weakness) & No paralysis \\
\hline Muscle atrophy & No atrophy & No atrophy \\
\hline Areflexia \& atonia & Hyperreflexia, hypertonia, spasticity & Parkinson's: rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia Huntington's: chorea, hyperkinesia \\
\hline Ipsi deficit in spinal cord & Contra deficit above decussation Ipsi deficit below decussation & Contra \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Also, while we have emphasized the motor function of the basal ganglia, I would like you to note that other behaviors are affected by similar but separate neural loops through the basal ganglia. These include an oculomotor loop that plays a role in eye movement control and limbic and prefrontal loops that appear involved in emotion and cognitive function. As our understanding of these other loops increases, we may be able to alter the course of particular diseases.

Finally, some National Board stuff. The term "basal ganglia" usually includes the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and amygdala. We use the term more loosely to refer to a group of nuclei that are anatomically interconnected and have important motor functions. These are the caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nuclei. The amygdala is technically part of the basal ganglia (due to its developmental origin), but functionally is part of the limbic system (emotions and visceral stuff!) so it will be discussed as part of that system later in the course. The striatum and the globus pallidus are collectively known as the corpus striatum. Finally because of their close proximity, the globus pallidus and putamen are often called the lenticular (lens shaped) nuclei, although the two structures are quite distinct anatomically and physiologically.
