\section*{Objectives}
- To review the features of the cerebral cortex
- To understand the functional areas of cerebral cortex
- To understand the basic connection fibres of the brain
- To name some pathologies associated with the cerebral cortex

\section*{Case 1}
- A 52 yr AA hypertensive and diabetic, man awakens and can not express himself. His entire right side is numb and weak. Neurologic exam shows a right hemiparesis (face, arm and leg are equal). Hemianesthesia is present and there is a Broca's aphasia.
- What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 2}
- A 68 year old man with non-valvular atrial fibrillation awakens one day and notices difficulty seeing on his right side; he has no difficulty with speech, walking, strength, sensation or coordination or headache. The neurologic exam reveals a right homonymous hemianopsia.
-What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 3}

A 40 year old is shot in the head through the left orbit. He undergoes bifrontal craniotomy for bullet removal and brain debridement. Following surgery, he is alert and attentive with no aphasia or memory impairment. He has no motor coordination, gait, or hearing disturbance. He makes an uneventful recovery but his wife calls the neurosurgeon very upset. He refuses to return to work or pay any bills, goes to bars, refuses to go to church and sexually abuses a 6 year old girl and is arrested for indecent exposure.

What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 4}
- A 7 year old boy falls off a swing and hit his head on a rock and is knocked unconscious for ten minutes. Upon awakening he is neurologically intact but does not remember the accident. Several hours later, he develops a headache, vomits and develops right sided weakness.
-What is the anatomical basis for this presentation?

\section*{Case 5}
- A 54-yr woman was seen by a neurologist because her sister had noticed a sudden change in her behavior. The patient stated that after waking up about a week ago, she noticed that the left side of her body did not feel as if it belonged to her. Later, the feeling worsened, and she became unaware of the existence of her left side. Her sister told the neurologist that the patient now neglects to wash the left side of her body.
