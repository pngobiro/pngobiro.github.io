\section*{Clinical notes}

1-Unilateral lesion interrupting the corticobulbar tract (upper motor neuron lesion) produces mild form of paresis because of the bilateral cortical control of the motor cranial nerve nuclei. There is deviation of the tongue to the opposite side of the lesion and marked weakness of the lower facial muscles of the opposite side of the lesion (angle of the mouth deviates to the same side of the lesion).
2-Bilateral lesion involving corticobulbar fibers produces a syndrome known as pseudobulbar paralysis. This syndrome is characterized by paralysis of muscles of swallowing, chewing, speaking and breathing.
3-Lesion of the corticospinal tract rostral to motor decussation produces contralateral loss of voluntary movements that is more marked in the distal parts of the extremities. Lesion of the corticospinal tract caudal to the motor decussation results in ipsilateral paralysis below the level of the lesion. It is also a spastic upper motor neuron lesion. In spastic hemiplegia there is an increase in the deep reflexes (hyperreflexia). Babinski sign is positive.
4-Types of paralysis; hemiplegia is paralysis of one side of the body, monoplegia is paralysis of one limb only, diplegia is paralysis of two corresponding limbs (arms or legs), quadriplegia is paralysis of all 4 limbs, paraplegia is paralysis of the two lower limbs. Alternating hemiplegia is contralateral paralysis of the body due to upper motor neuron lesion of the pyramidal tract in the brain stem, associated with lower motor ipsilateral paralysis of one or more of the motor cranial nerves.

\section*{CEREBELLUM}

Objectives
-Definition and phylogeny of cerebellum.
-External features of the cerebellum.
-Composition and internal structures.
-Cerebellar input and output.
-Anatomical basis of cerebellar lesions

Definition, position and function: The cerebellum (little brain) is the largest part of the hindbrain, 150 gm in weight.. It is located in the posterior cranial fossa covered by the tentorium cerebelli. Supported by its peduncles, the cerebellum overhangs the superior and inferior medullary vela (the roof of the fourth ventricle). The function of the cerebellum is entirely motor. It maintains balance, influences posture and muscle tone and it coordinates movements.

\section*{External features}

The cerebellum is formed of two cerebellar hemispheres joined by a narrow median zone called the vermis. Anterior and posterior notches are present as deficiencies anteriorly and posteriorly between the two hemispheres.

\section*{Surfaces}

On the superior surface the superior vermis can not be demarcated from the superior surface of the hemisphere. The vermis seen on the inferior surface is called inferior vermis and is separated from the inferior aspect of the cerebellum by deep median hollow termed vallecula cerebelli. The inferior vermis consists of three small lobules named nodule, uvula and pyramid.

\section*{Cerebellar fissures and lobes}

The cerebellar surface is highly convoluted with the folds or folia separated by numerous transverse fissures. Fisures vary in depths and some are used as landmarks to divide the cerebellum into lobes. Only three deep fissures are of significance:
Horizontal fissure sweeps from the anterior to the posterior notches. It separates the superior and inferior surfaces of the cerebellum. The anterior part of the fissure receives the middle cerebellar peduncle (laterally located) with which both the superior (medially located) and inferior (middle located) cerebellar peduncles are closely assossiated.
Primary fissure is a V-shaped fissure cutting the superior vermis at the junction of its anterior $2 / 3$ with its posterior $1 / 3$. The fissura prima curves laterally to meet the horizontal fissure. The part in front of primary fissure is termed the anterior lobe; the part behind is the middle lobe.
Posterolateral fissure is present on the undersurface of the cerebellum separating the flocculonodular lobe from the rest of the cerebellum.

\section*{Composition of the}

\section*{The cerebellum Gerisebrellum}

\section*{1-Cerebellar cortex}

The cerebellar cortex is formed of three layers

\section*{1-Molecular layer}

It is the outer layer that underlies the pia mater. It contains dendritic arborizations of Purkinje cells, axons of granule cells, and stellate and basket cells. Stellate and basket cells make inhibitory synapses with Purkinje dendrites to limit the area of the cortex excited by climbing and mossy fibers.
2-Purkinje cell layer: Dendrites of Purkinje cells are flattened in the molecular layer. Their axons make inhibitory synaptic contacts on neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei which originate most of cerebellar efferent fibers.
3-Granule cell layer contains granule cells, Golgi type II cells and cerebellar glomeruli.

\section*{Cerebellar fibers}

Fibers enter the cerebellum as clmbing fibers (originate from inferior olivary nucleus) and mossy fibers (all other afferents). Mossy fibers are excitatory fibers which synapse with granule cell dendrites in the form of rosettes. Each rosette forms the core of a glomerulus. Each axon of mossy fibers may affect thousands of granule cells. Dendrites of granule cells, and dendrites and axons of Golgi type II cells synapse with mossy fibers. The output is via axons of granule cells. Unmyelinated axons of granule cells ascend into the molecular layer where they divide and run parallel to long axis of folia. They run at right angles to and through dendritic expansions of Purkinje cells, making excitatory synaptic contacts with several Purkinje cells. Climbing fibers are excitatory terminating on cerebellar nuclei and on dendrites of Purkinje cells. Relationship of climbing fibers and Purkinje cells is one to one.
It appears that all afferent pathways ultimately converge on Purkinje cells. Purkinje axons are the only way out of the cerebellum. Purkinje axons send recurrent collaterals back to synapse with adjacent Purkinje cells and to Golgi Type II neurons.

\section*{Cerebellar nuclei and peduncles}

2-Deep white matter is made up of afferent and efferent fibers that run to and from the cerebellar cortex.
3-Three pairs of deep nuclei (fig.3-3) which receive afferents and are the primary source of efferent fibers from the cerebellum to the other parts of the brain. From medial to lateral the cerebellar nuclei are:
a)Fastigial nucleus.
b)Nucleus interpositus, formed of globose and emboliform nuclei
c) Dentate nucleus.

4-Three pairs of peduncles that convey afferent and efferent fibers. They are inferior, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, which join the cerebellum to the medulla, pons and midbrain, respectively.

\section*{Phylogeny of cerebellum}

\section*{Phylogeny (developmental history) of the cerebellar lobes}

1-Archicerebellum (flocculonodular lobe or vestibulocerebellum) is the original part of the cerebellum concerned with maintenance of balance. It has connections with the vestibular and reticular nuclei. The influence of the archicerebellum upon the lower motor neurons is mediated by vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts. Lesion of this lobe (caudal vermis syndrome) produces disturbance in equilibrium and trunk ataxia (patient walks as drunk, unable to maintain upright posture).
2-Paleocerebellum (anterior lobe or spinocerebellum) is phylogenetically intermediate. Paleocerebellum influences muscle tone and posture. Afferents are mainly the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts that carry information from muscles, joints and cutaneous receptors to cerebellar cortex of the ipsilateral vermis and paravermal zones. Efferents pass to nucleus interpositus, in turn project to inferior olivary nucleus and contralateral red nucleus. Decussated rubrospinal tracts facilitates flexor muscle tone. Lesion of this lobe (rostral vermis syndrome) causes hypotonia, and trunk and leg ataxia.
3- Neocerebellum (posterior lobe, or cerebrocerebellum). With evolution, further cerebellar expansion with addition of a larger middle lobe forms between archicerebellum and paleocerebellum. The neocerebellum is concerned with muscular coordination including force, speed and curved movements. Afferents are principally pontocerebellar fibers which are influenced by cerebral cortex, involved in planning and execution of movement. Pontocerebellar fibers decussate and by means of middle cerebellar peduncle terminate in the lateral zones of the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere. Efferents from neocerebellar cortex are directed to dentate nucleus which in turn project to the contralateral ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus and red nucleus (dentatothalamic and dentatorubral fibers). The ventral lateral nucleus of thalamus projects to cerebral cortex, particularly the motor cortex of frontal lobe. The neocerebellum thus exerts its coordinating role in movement through the action on cerebral cortical areas giving rise to corticnuclear, and corticospinal pathways. Lesion of this lobe causes hypotonia, pendulum muscle jerks, and incoordination of the upper limbs (dysdiadochokinesia and intention tremors), lower limbs (cerebellar ataxia), and speech (dysarthria), and eyes (nystagmus).

\section*{Blood supply of cerebellum}

Three pairs of cerebellar arteries for superficial anastomoses:
1-Posterior inferior cerebellar arteries (vertebral arteries).
2-Anterior inferior cerebellar arteries (basilar artery).
3-Superior cerebellar arteries (basilar artery).

\section*{Cerebellar triads}
-Cerebellum is formed of $\mathbf{3}$ phylogenetic lobes; flocculonodular (archicerebellum), anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) and posterior lobe (neocerebellum).
-Cerebellum has 3 main fissures; primary, posterolateral and horizontal.
-Cerebellar cortex is formed of $\mathbf{3}$ layers; molecular, Purkinje and granular layers.
-White mater contains 3 pairs of nuclei; fastigial, interpositus and dentate nuclei.
-Cerebellum is longitudinally organized into 3 zones; vermian, paravermian and lateral zones.
-Cerebellar peduncles are 3; inferior, middle and superior.
-Major cerebro-cerebellar decussations are 3; pontocerebellar, dentatothalamic and dentatorubral.
-Cerebellar neurotransmitters are 3; GABA (utilized by Purkinje cells and is inhibitory), glutamate (used by granule cells and is excitatory) and aspartate (used by climbing fibers and is inhibitory or excitatory).
-Cerebellar functions are 3; maintain balance, influences muscle tone and coordinates movements.
-Cerebellar dysfunctions present 3 main signs; hypotonia, dysequilibrium and dyssynergia (dysarthria, dysmetria, nystagmus and intention tremors). A midline lesion (tumor) leads to loss of postural control; as a result it is impossible to stand or sit without toppling over. Unilateral lesion of a cerebellar hemisphere causes unsteady gait and intention tremors on the same side of the body. Bilateral lesion or cerebellar ataxia (alcohol intoxication, degenerative disease or multiple sclerosis) causes slow slurred speech, unsteady (drunk) gait and incoordination of both arms.

\section*{Definition of basal ganglia (nuclei)}

The term basal ganglia is applied to a collection of masses of gray matter situated within each cerebral hemisphere in close relation to the diencephalon but separated from it by the internal capsule. Basal ganglia represent subcortical nuclei derived from telencephalon.

\section*{Amygdaloid nucleus}

The amygdaloid nucleus is considered part of the limbic system and recently excluded from the basal ganglia. It is situated in the temporal lobe close to the uncus of the parahippocampal gyrus. It lies in front and above the tip of inferior horn of lateral ventricle. It is fused with the tip of the tail of caudate nucleus. stria terminalis emerges from its posterior aspect, and runs as a bundle of nerve fibers posteriorly in the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle medial to the tail of caudate nucleus. The stria terminalis follows the curve of the caudate nucleus and comes to lie in the floor of the body of the lateral ventricle where it occupies the groove between caudate nucleus and thalamus. The stria terminalis end in lateral and preoptic hypothalamic nuclei. Amygdaloid nucleus receives afferents from the lateral olfactory tract, reticular formation, septal nuclei, and limbic and sensory cortex. It projects efferents to dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus, hypothalamus (via stria terminalis), habenular nuclei (via stría medullaris thalami), and sensory and limbic association cortices.

\title{
Function and dysfunction of amygdaloid nucleus
}

\section*{Function of amygdaloid nucleus}

The amygdaloid nucleus is considered part of the limbic system which produces activities associated with feeding and nutrition. It regulates visceral activity and emotional behavior. Its stimulation may cause aggressive behavior.
Destruction of the amygdaloid nucleus results in KluverBucy syndrome; characterized by psychic blindness (visual agnosia), loss of fear and anger, increase appetite and sexual activity, and decrease aggressiveness and decrease emotional instability. There is no disturbance in memory. Precise stereotactic lesion of the amygdaloid nucleus in man reduces emotional excitability and brings about normalization of behavior in patients with severe emotional disturbances

\section*{Connections of corpus striatum}

\section*{Afferents}

1-Corticostriate fibers are projected from the greater part of the cortex, particularily the sensorimotor cortex to the caudate nucleus and the putamen. Fibers project bilaterally crossing the midline through the corpus callosum and enter the caudate nucleus via the subcallosal fasciculus, and the putamen via the external capsule. More anterior regions of the frontal lobe and other association cortices project mainly to the caudate nucleus while motor regions project mainly to the putamen. For this, the putamen is considered the motor part of the straitum and the caudate having the most associative functions.
2-Thalamostriate fibers arise from the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus. Fibers traverse the internal capsule and enter putamen.
3-Nigrostriate fibers exert modulatory (mostly inhibitory) effect on the striatal neurons. Dopamine regulates the releases of other neurotransmitters from axon terminals. Dopaminergic neurons are rich in melanin pigments.

Efferents
1-Striopallidal fibers pass from the caudate nucleus ventrally via the internal capsule to reach putamen, and from the putamen fibers project medially to the globus pallidus.
2-Strionigral fibers project mainly from the caudate nucleus to substantia nigra.
It should be noted that the two output nuclei of the basal ganglia are the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. These outputs use GABA as a neurotransmitter to inhibit their targets. The main input to these nuclei is from the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus.

Afferents
1-Striopallidal fibers come from putamen and caudate nucleus.
2-Nigropallidal fibers project from substantia nigra to globus pallidus. Some fibers reach the caudate nucleus and the remaining fibers continue to the putamen and globus pallidus.
3-Subthalamopallidal fibers project from the subthalamic nucleus to globus pallidus through the subthalamic fasciculus.

\section*{Efferents}

1-Pallidothalamic fibers: Fasciculus lenticularis and ansa lenticularis reach the prerebral field of Forel in the subthalamus. Some of the fibers synapse with subthalamic nucleus and nucleus of the prerubral field. It is noticed that the lenticular fasciculus traverses the internal capsule whereas the ansa lenticularis sweep around the posterior limb of the internal capsule forming a loop (ansa) to reach the prerubral field. The remaining fibers reach ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus through the thalamic fasciculus. Pallidothalamic fibers constitute the main outflow from the basal ganglia. VA and VL thalamic nuclei project excitatory fibers to the motor cortex (primary motor and supplementary motor cortex).
2-Pallidotegmental fibers descend to terminate in brain stem tegmentum in the pedunculopontine nucleus which lies at the boundary between midbrain and pons. This region has been termed the mesencephalic locomotor region in lower mammals, since it is involved in the regulation of quadrupedal progression.
3-Other efferents of the globus pallidus include; a)Subthalamic nucleus, b)Red nucleus, c)Midbrain RF, d)Epithalamus and Hypothalamus, and e)Inferior olivary nucleus.

Globus pallidus project to midbrain reticular formation. This is a part of the brain stem reticular formation and so is connected with the cells that give rise to the reticulspinal tract. This represents a more direct route than through the thalamus for the basal ganglia output to reach the lower motor neurons. Limbic component of basal ganglia is implicated in emotional behavior.

\section*{Functions of basal ganglia \\ 1-Definition and function of the extrapyramidal system:}

The extrapyramidal system consists of all motor pathways of the brain that influence LMNs but do not send their axons directly into the pyramidal tract. This includes the circuitry of the basal ganglia, and the reticulospinal, rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, olivospinal and, tectospinal tracts. Signs of pyramidal diseases differ from the causes and signs of extrapyramidal diseases.
2-The phylogenetic series illustrate a gradual increase in the dependence of volitional movement on the pyramidal tract. Volitional motor activity is extrapyramidal in submammalia, mixed pyramidal/extrapyramidal in subhuman mammalia and essentially pyramidal in human.
-In man the corpus striatum maintains a postural background for voluntary activities, reinforcing and steadying movements and postures of cortical origin, but is incapable of initiating such movements. The cerebral cortex projects to lower motor neurons through two main channels; (a)long fibers in the pyramidal tract concerned with fine isolated skilled movements, and (b)short fibers passing to extrapyramidal nuclei concerned with mechanisms for postural adjustments and gross movement patterns that are largely reflex in character.
-Recent concepts of the role of the basal ganglia consider their function to facilitate movements that are appropriate and to inhibit unwanted movements that are inappropriate. When a movement is initiated, the cerebral cortex discharges ecitatory impulses to neostriatum. The striatum has two routes by which it controls activity of the globus pallidus; direct and indirect. The direct pathway inhibits the medial segment of the globus pallidus. Since medial globus pallidus output neurons are themselves inhibitory, this leads to disinhibition of the motor thalamus. The increased activity of the thalamic neurons causes excitation of the cerebral cortex. The effect of activation of the direct pathway is to facilitate ongoing movements. The indirect pathway involves the subthalamic nucleus. Efferents from the striatum terminate in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus inducing inhibition. The main projection of the lateral pallidum is to the subthalamic nucleus which becomes disinhibited. Activation of the subthalamic nucleus causes activation of the medial segment of the globus pallidus and, in turn, inhibition of the motor thalamus and cortex. The result is inhibition of the unwanted movements.
3-Corpus striatum plays a role in mentation (lesion of caudate results in impairment of cognitive functions), emotion and behaviour (lesion of nucleus accumbens impairs affective behaviour), planning and sequencing skills (lesion of pallidum produces depression, apathy and reduces planning and skills).

\section*{Clinical Notes}

1-Diseases of the extrapyramidal system are associated with dyskinesia (abnormal involuntary movements) and disturbances of muscle tone. Positive disturbances (tremor, athetosis, chorea and ballism) are believed to be the result of release phenomena. For example the subthalamic nucleus normally exerts regulating influences upon the globus pallidus. A lesion in the subthalamic nucleus releases the globus pallidus from this controlling influence which is expressed by bursts of irregular forcefull ballistic movements. In Parkinsonism, lack of dopamine (dopamine stimulates medial pallidum and inhibits lateral pallidum) causes underactivity of the direct pathway and overactivity of the indirect pathway. These changes exacerbate the abnormal overactivity of the medial pallidum inducing dyskinesia.
2-Rigidity or increased muscle tone is a manifestation of extrapyramidal lesion. Rigidity is present in antagonistic muscle groups i.e. in both extensor and flexor muscles. Rigidity is cog-wheel or clasp knife (passive movements are interrupted by jerks).
3-A unifying feature of its lesion is absence of muscle paralysis and absence of sensory loss.
4-Depression, apathy, impairement of cognitive functions an disturbed affective behavior are common manifestations of basal ganglia lesions.
