The neural folds approach each other and fuse forming the neural tube. Formation of the neural tube begins in the region of the 4th to 6th somites (cervical region) and proceeds in a cranial and caudal directions until only small areas remain open at both ends of the tube, cranial and caudal neuropores. Neuropores communicate neural canal with amniotic cavity. The neural tube soon detaches and the free edges of the surface ectoderm fuse..</p>

Cells are connected by junctional complexes at the lumen. These cells divide rapidly giving more neuroepithelial cells. Some of the dividing cells differentiate into primordial neurons, neuroblasts. Neuroblasts form a zone around the neuroepithelium known as mantle layer. The mantle layer forms the gray mater. Nerve fibers emerging from neuroblasts form the outermost layer known as marginal layer. This layer obtains a white appearance as a result of myelination of fibersforming white mater of spinal cord.</p>

Initially neuroblasts have central processes extending to the lumen (transient dendrite), but when they migrate into the mantle layer these processes disappear. Neuroblasts are temporarily rounded and apolar. With further differentiation, two new processes appear on the opposite sides of the cell body thus forming bipolar neuroblast. One process elongates to form the primitive axon, while the other process shows arborizations to form the primitive dendrite. The cell is then known as a multipolar neuroblast and later neuron.</p>

In the newborn the spinal cord terminates at level of L3. In the adult, the cord terminates at level of lower border of L1. As a result of this recession, spinal nerve roots especially those of the lumbar and sacral segments run obliquely from the spinal cord to their corresponding levels of the vertebral column. Nerve roots inferior to the lower end of the cord (conus medullaris) form cauda equina. The dura and arachnoid end at level of S2.

                        <p>Most of the anomalies of the spinal cord result from abnormal closure of the neural tube during the 4th week of development. Neural tube defects (NTDs) also affect tissues overlying the spinal cord: meninges, vertebral arches, muscles and skin. The incidence of severe neural tube defects is approximately 1 in 1000, but varies in different populations.</p>
                        <p>Causes of neural tube defects are mostly multi-factorial. Hypothermia, hyperthermia, Valproic acid (anticonvulsant drug), Hypervitaminosis A and Folic acid deficiency are major factors..</p>

                        <p>1-Spina bifida refers to splitting of the vertebral arches. This term denotes nonfusion of the primordial halves of the vertebral (neural) arches, which is common to all types of spina bifida.</p>
                        <p>a)Spina bifida occulta refers to defect in the vertebral arches that does not involve the underlying neural tissue. The defect is covered by skin and is represented by a small dimple with a tuft of hair arising from it. Spina bifida occulta is usually present at L5 or S1 and it occurs in 10% of people producing no symptoms.</p>

                        <p>c)Spina bifida cystica is protrusion of spinal cord and or the meninges through a defect in the vertebral arches. It occurs once in every 1000 births. When the protruding sac contains meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, the anomaly is spina bifida with meningocele. If spinal cord and or nerve roots are included in the sac, anomaly is spina bifida with meningomyelocele. Meningomyelocele is more common and more severe than meningocele. Spina bifida cystica shows varying degrees of neurological deficits depending on position and extent of the lesion. There is usually loss of sensation with muscular paralysis. Sphincteric paralysis is common with lumbosacral meningomyelocele. There is saddle anesthesia when the sphincters are involved.</p>

                        <p>Some neuroblasts of the alar plates migrate to the marginal zone and develop into Purkinje cells. Others migrate to the surface and differentiate into neurons of the external granular layer. By the 6th month, cells of the external granular layer differentiate to various cell types of the cerebellar cortex including granule cells, basket cells, and stellate cells. The cerebellar cortex reaches its definitive size after birth. Some other neuroblasts give rise to cerebellar nuclei present in the white mater of the cerebellum. The largest of these nuclei is the dentate nucleus. With further development axons of neurons of the cerebellar nuclei grow out into the midbrain to reach the forebrain forming the superior cerebellar peduncle. Inferior cerebellar peduncle is formed by sensory fibers from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei and olivary nuclei. Middle cerebellar peduncle is formed by pontocerebellar fibers. The superior and inferior medullary vela are formed by the roof plate of the 4th ventricle.</p>

                        <p>Thalami develop rapidly on each side and bulge into the cavity of the 3rd ventricle, reducing it into a narrow cleft. As a result of proliferative activity, expansion of the thalamus is so great that the two thalami fuse in the midline forming the interthalamic adhesion (connexus). The thalamus differentiates into groups of nuclei that relay sensations and information to the cerebral cortex. The visual and auditory impulses relay in the lateral and medial geniculate bodies of the thalamus (metathalamus).</p>
                        <p>Hypothalami form the lower portion of the alar plates of the diencephalon. The Hypothalamus differentiates into a number of nuclei that serve as regulation centers of visceral functions (digestion, body temperature, sleep and emotional behavior), homeostasis and endocrine activities. A pair of nuclei, mamillary bodies form a distinct protuberance on the ventral surface of the hypothalamus.</p>
                        <p>Epithalamus develops from the roof and dorsal portion of the diencephalon. The Pineal body (epiphysis) develops from the most caudal part of the roof plate as an epithelial thickening in the midline that evaginates dorsally and becomes a solid organ located at the diencephalic-midbrain junction. The pineal body manufactures melatonin and releases it in a cyclic manner. It mediates some cyclic functions, such as sleep cycle, reproductive cycles and puberty. It serves as a channel through which light and darkness affect endocrine and behavioral rhythm. The rest of epithalamus forms habenular nuclei and habenular commissure. The habenular complex mediates olfactory stimuli and feeding behavior.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The telencephalon, the most rostral of the brain vesicles, consists of two lateral outpocketings, the cerebral vesicles, and a median portion, the lamina terminalis. The cerebral vesicles are the primordial of the cerebral hemispheres. The cavity of each cerebral hemisphere is the lateral ventricle which communicates with the 3rd ventricle through the interventricular foramen (of Monro).</p>
                        <p>The cavity of the median portion of the telencephalon forms the extreme anterior part of the 3rd ventricle. In the region where the cerebral hemisphere is attached to the roof of the diencephalon, the wall is very thin and consists of a single layer of ependymal cells covered by pia-vascular mesenchyme (tela choroidea). The choroid plexus protrudes into the lateral ventricle along a line known as transverse or choroid fissure. Above the choroid fissure the medial wall of the hemisphere is thickened forming the hippocampus. Inrolling of the medial hemispheric wall create the transverse (choroid) fissure.</p>
                        <p>Basal Ganglia and Limbic System</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_05_28_de4314b1bb1d6294700bg-108-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the development of the telencephalon, including cerebral vesicles, basal ganglia, and limbic system components." class="content-image">
                        <p>As the cerebral hemispheres expand, they cover successively the diencephalons, midbrain and hindbrain. The two hemispheres meet each other in the midline at the interhemispheric fissure flattening their medial surfaces. The mesenchyme trapped in this longitudinal fissure gives rise to falx cerebri.</p>
                        <p>The basal ganglia (corpus striatum) appear during the 6th week as a prominent swelling in the floor of each cerebral hemisphere. Due to the presence of large basal ganglia, the floor of the hemisphere expands slower than its thin cortical walls; consequently the hemisphere becomes semicircular or C-shaped. This semicircular shape is due to downward and forward expansion of the caudal part of the hemisphere to form the temporal lobe. In doing so, a lateral (Sylvian) fissure is forming between the temporal and frontal lobes. Evagination of the temporal pole extends the temporal (inferior) horn of the lateral ventricle and increases the depth of the lateral (Sylvian) fissure.</p>
                        <p>Similar extensive evagination of the frontal and occipital poles extends the lateral ventricle in their directions to form anterior and posterior horns. Growth vectors in the cerebral wall force the hippocampal formation to migrate backward, downward, and forward in a semicircular arc, extending the transverse (choroid) fissure on the medial surface of the temporal lobe. As the cerebral cortex differentiates, fibers projecting to and from it pass through the corpus striatum dividing it into caudate nucleus and lentiform nucleus. This fiber pathway is called internal capsule. At the same time, the medial wall of the hemisphere and the lateral wall of the diencephalon fuse, and the caudate nucleus and thalamus come into close contact.</p>
                        <p>Caudate nucleus becomes elongated and C shaped, conforming to the outline of the lateral ventricle which is also C-shaped. Pear-shaped head and body of caudate lie in the floor of the anterior horn and stem of the lateral ventricle, whereas tail of caudate makes a U-shaped turn to reach the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. As growth in the region overlying the corpus striatum is slow, the area between the frontal and temporal lobes become depressed- the insula. This region is later overgrown by adjacent lobes and by the time of birth is completely covered.</p>

                        <p>In contrast with the spinal cord, gray mater of the brain is mainly peripherally situated. Histogenesis within the brain is characterized by cell migration. Cells of the mantle layer start migrating into the marginal zone in the 2nd month of gestation in the form of waves of neuroblasts that reach a subpial position and then differentiate into mature neurons. Cortical neuroblasts direct their axons inward. Successive waves of cortical neuroblasts leave the germinal zone at later times. Neurons for inner cortical layers migrate to the cerebral surface first. The next wave of neuroblasts migrates through earlier formed layers of cells until they reach a subpial position. Earlier formed neuroblasts obtain a deep position, while the newly arrived ones obtain a more superficial position in the cerebral cortex until neuroblasts cease to divide.</p>
                        <p>The four outer layers of cortical neurons develop after the inner two, in an inside-out sequence. The cortex shows its final 6 lamina by the 8th month of gestation. In their migration, neuroblasts are guided by radial glial cells. At birth, the cortex has a stratified appearance due to differentiation of the cells in different layers. The most common types of neurons in the cerebral cortex have pyramidal, stellate or fusiform shape. Less common types, the neurons of Martinotti and the horizontal neurons of Cajal have polygonal or fusiform shape. The cerebral cortex is made up of several layers which vary in number from 3 layers in the primitive cortex (hippocampus or archicortex) to 6 layers in dominant neocortex. The various types of stellate neurons, and Cajal and Martonitti neurons are cortical interneurons whose axons remain within the cerebral cortex.</p>

Sulci indent the outer surface of the cerebrum but do not alter the ventricular contour. By the 7th month several sulci appear on the surface including the central and occipital sulci. Timetable of sulcation can be used to estimate the gestational age. Sulci and gyri permit a considerable increase in the surface area of the cerebral cortex. As the brain grows the gyral pattern becomes more complex. At birth the brain is about 25% of its adult volume.</p>

                        <p>White mater of the cerebrum is composed of:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Axons, which run in organized tracts.</li>

                        <p>Destinations of cortical axons</p>
                        <p>Cortical axons may synapse on other cortical neurons or on infracortical neurons. The developing efferent axons are classified according to their destinations into:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Association fibers. Axons of cortical neurons synapse on ipsilateral cortical neurons associating functions of these neurons. Short association fibers associate near by gyri, e.g. arcuate bundle. Long association fibers connect lobes or surfaces of the hemisphere, e.g. superior longitudinal bundle connects frontal and occipital lobes and inferior longitudinal bundle connects occipital and temporal lobes. The bundles receive and give axons along their course.</li>
                            <li>Cerebral commissures. These are axons that cross the midline to synapse on contralateral neurons (mirror-image points). Anterior commissure is located in front of anterior column of the fornix and connects olfactory bulbs together. Hippocampal commissure connects the posterior columns of fornix together. Corpus callosum is the largest commissure which appears during the 4th month and connects neocortical areas together. Corpus callosum initially lies in the lamina terminalis, but fibers are added to it as the cortex enlarges. Posterior commissure is present inferior to the pineal body and connects pretectal and collicular areas of the two sides of midbrain. Habenular commissure forms the superior stalk of the pineal body and connects habenular nuclei together. Optic chiasma develops in the ventral part of lamina terminalis. It consists of fibers from the medial halves of the retinae which cross to join optic tract of the opposite side.</li>
                            <li>Projection fibers. Cortical axons that synapse on infra-cortical neurons project the cortical influence onto the lower centers, e.g. internal capsule. Projection fibers end ipsilaterally and contralaterally.</li>

Infants survive for only few hours after birth. Meroanencephaly occurs once every 1000 births, more common in female infants. It is associated with polyhydramnios because the fetus lacks the neural control of swallowing. It is suspected when there is elevated level of alpha-fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid. It is diagnosed by ultrasonography, radiology and fetoscopy.</p>

Infants appear normal at birth; however the head grows excessively after birth due to CSF accumulation. There is failure of mental and cognitive development. The cause of this rare and severe anomaly is occlusion of blood flow to areas supplied by the internal carotid artery, or from encephalitis in utero caused by rubella, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus Or toxoplasmosis.</p>

                         <p>In the 5th week, cells originating in the neural crest of the thoracic region migrate on each side of the spinal cord behind the dorsal aorta and form bilateral chain of segmentally arranged sympathetic ganglia interconnected by nerve fibers. Together, they form sympathetic trunks located on each side of the vertebral column (paravertebral chain). From this position in the thorax, neuroblasts migrate toward the cervical and lumbosacral regions, thus extending the sympathetic chains to their full length.</p>

                        <p>Although, initially, the ganglia are arranged segmentally, this arrangement is later obscured in the cervical region, by fusion of the ganglia. Some neural crest cells migrate ventral to the aorta and form preaortic (prevertebral) ganglia such as coeliac and mesenteric ganglia. Other neural crest cells migrate to the area of the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract, where they form terminal ganglia in autonomic plexuses located near or within these organs. Other neural crest cells migrate retroperitoneally to form scattered paraganglia -chromaffin cells. These widely scattered groups of chromaffin cells constitute the chromaffin system. These cells are similar to cells of the suprarenal medulla.</p>
                        <p>Preganglionic sympathetic axons arise from lateral horn cells of the thoracolumbar segments of the spinal cord and exit with the ventral roots of spinal nerves. Axons enter the nerve trunk and take one of four courses:</p>

                        <p>From a sympathetic ganglion, the postsynaptic (postganglionic) axon may rejoin an adjacent nerve trunk by way of a gray ramus communicans, or travel rostrally or caudally in the sympathetic chain to another nerve trunk. Gray rami communicants are present at all levels of the spinal cord. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers are distributed with spinal nerves to peripheral blood vessels, sweat glands and hairs.</p>
                         <h3>Parasympathetic Nervous System</h3>
                         <p>Parasympathetic neurons are located in the brain stem and in the sacral region of the spinal cord (craniosacral). The presynaptic (preganglionic) parasympathetic fibers from nuclei in the brain stem travel via the oculomotor, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to relay in ganglia derived from neural crest cells. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers innervate sphincter pupillae, lacrimal and salivary glands, heart and the viscera. The sacral preganglionic parasympathetic axons arise from the sacral segments of the spinal cord (S2-S4). They exit through ventral roots forming the sacral plexus, and then enter the pelvic splanchnic nerves which with the sympathetic axons form pelvic plexus and then run to postganglionic neurons (terminal ganglia) located in the wall of pelvic viscera.</p>
