                                <span class="item-text">Muscles of facial expression: they are all supplied by the facial nerve. They have only one attachment to bone, or sometimes no attachment at all, the other end of the muscle being inserted into skin or blending with other muscles. The most important are shown in Fig. 67.1, from which their actions can be deduced. The orbicularis oculi has an orbital part which surrounds the eye as a sphincter and closes the eye tightly, while the palpebral part, which is in the eyelid, closes the eye gently as in sleep. The most important function of the buccinator is to keep the cheeks in contact with the gums so that food does not collect in this region. The platysma extends down the neck and over the clavicle and upper part of the chest.</span>

                        <p>Situated mainly behind the mandible but spills over it onto the face. It extends deeply to come into contact with the pharynx and posteriorly it is moulded around the mastoid process and sternomastoid. The parotid duct extends forwards across masseter to enter the mouth opposite the second upper molar. The whole gland is enclosed in dense fascia so that swelling of the gland, as in mumps for instance, is very painful. Three structures pass through the gland (Fig. 67.2). These are, from superficial to deep: the facial nerve, the retromandibular vein (the beginning of the external jugular) and the external carotid artery, with its maxillary and superficial temporal branches.</p>

The cervical branch supplies platysma. Lesions of the facial nerve, for example by tumours of the parotid, cause unilateral drooping of the face with loss of the normal skin creases, and it can be shown up by asking the patient to whistle or close up his eyes tightly.</em></span>
