                         <p>There are 12 thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral and 3-5 coccygeal vertebrae. They are held together by ligaments, intervertebral discs and synovial joints between the articular processes. The weight-bearing portion of the vertebra is the body so that the size of the vertebral bodies increases from above downwards and when one of the bodies is diseased it will eventually collapse. The bodies contain red bone marrow so that the veins that drain them (basivertebral veins) produce large foramina on the backs of the bodies.</p>

                        <p>The upper and lower surfaces of the bodies are covered with hyaline cartilage and are separated by the fibrocartilaginous intervertebral discs. Each disc has a peripheral fibrous ring (annulus fibrosus) and a central more spongy nucleus pulposus which lies nearer to the back than to the front of the disc. The nucleus pulposus is rich in glycosaminoglycans so that it has a high water content, but this diminishes with increasing age. <em>The nucleus may then herniate through the annulus fibrosus, passing backwards (compressing the spinal cord), posterolaterally (compressing a spinal nerve) or upwards (into a vertebral body-a Schmorl's node).</em> The discs are thickest in the lumbar and cervical regions, so that these are the regions of most movement.</p>
                        <p>The vertebrae are also held together by ligaments that join each of the components of the vertebrae (Fig. 71.5) except for the pedicles (the spinal nerves have to pass between these in the intervertebral foramina). Thus there are:</p>

                        <p>In the fetus, the whole developing spine is curved so that it is concave forwards (primary curvature). A few months after birth the baby begins to hold its head up and the cervical spine develops a forward convexity (secondary curvature). Later in the first year the baby begins to stand up and another forward convexity develops in the lumbar region (secondary curvature). The primary curves are mainly due to the shape of the vertebral bodies but the secondary curves are due to the shape of the intervertebral discs.</p>

                        <p><em>Each vertebra develops in three parts-the body and the two halves of the neural arch. These ossify in cartilage and, at birth, the three parts are still separate but they soon fuse. Failure of such fusion gives rise to the condition of spina bifida. This may be symptomless (spina bifida occulta) although the site of the lesion may be marked by a tuft of hair. If the defect is large, the meninges or even the spinal cord may herniate onto the surface (meningocoele) and this may produce neurological symptoms.</em></p>
