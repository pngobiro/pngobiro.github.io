It passes through corresponding foramina in the other cervical vertebra to reach the upper surface of the atlas. Here it turns medially in a groove and then enters the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum. Here it joins its fellow of the opposite side to form the basilar artery. It gives off the anterior and posterior spinal arteries which descend to supply the spinal cord, and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery which supplies not only the cerebellum but also the medulla. The basilar artery passes forwards on the undersurface of the medulla and pons and gives the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, branches to the brainstem and to the inner ear (the internal auditory artery) and ends by dividing into the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries. The latter is joined by the posterior communicating artery (p. 133).</span>
