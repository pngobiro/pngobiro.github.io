                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The pancreas (Figs 19.1 and 19.2)</h3>
                        <p>The pancreas has a: head, neck, body and tail. It is a retroperitoneal organ which lies roughly along the transpyloric plane. The head is bound laterally by the curved duodenum and the tail extends to the hilum of the spleen in the lienorenal ligament. The superior mesenteric vessels pass behind the pancreas, then anteriorly, over the uncinate process and third part of the duodenum into the root of the small bowel mesentery. The inferior vena cava, aorta, coeliac plexus, left kidney (and its vessels) and the left adrenal gland are posterior pancreatic relations. In addition, the portal vein is formed behind the pancreatic neck by the confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. The lesser sac and stomach are anterior pancreatic relations.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">Structure: the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) courses the length of the gland, ultimately draining pancreatic secretions into the ampulla of Vater, together with the common bile duct, and thence into the second part of the duodenum. An accessory duct (of Santorini) drains the uncinate process of the pancreas, opening slightly proximal to the ampulla into the second part of the duodenum.</span>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">Blood supply: the pancreatic head receives its supply from the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. The splenic artery courses along the upper border of the body of the pancreas which it supplies by means of a large branch-the arteria pancreatica magna-and numerous smaller branches.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">Function: the pancreas is a lobulated structure which performs both exocrine and endocrine functions. The exocrine secretory glands drain pancreatic juice into the pancreatic ducts and, from there, ultimately into the duodenum. The secretion is essential for the digestion and absorption of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The endocrine pancreas is responsible for the production and secretion of glucagon and insulin, which take place in specialized cells of the islets of Langerhans.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Acute pancreatitis</h4>
                        <p><em>The presence of gallstones and a history of excessive alcohol intake are the predominant associations for pancreatitis. The mechanism by which these aetiological factors result in pancreatic injury is unknown; however, they both appear to result in activation of pancreatic exocrine pro-enzymes with resultant autodigestion. Even today, the mortality rate for severe acute pancreatitis remains in the region of $20 \%$.</em></p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The spleen (Fig. 19.3)</h3>
                        <p>The spleen is approximately the size of a clenched fist and lies directly below the left hemidiaphragm which, in addition to the pleura, separates it from the overlying 9th, 10th and 11th ribs.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                <span class="item-text">Peritoneal attachments: the splenic capsule is fibrous with peritoneum adherent to its surface. The gastrosplenic and lienorenal ligaments attach it to the stomach and kidney, respectively. The former ligament carries the short gastric and left gastroepiploic vessels to the fundus and greater curvature of the stomach, and the latter ligament carries the splenic vessels and tail of the pancreas towards the left kidney.</span>

                                <span class="item-text">Blood supply: is from the splenic artery to the hilum of the spleen. Venous drainage is to the splenic vein, thence to the portal vein.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">Structure: the spleen is a highly vascular reticulo-endothelial organ. It consists of a thin capsule from which trabeculae extend into the splenic pulp. In the spleen, the immunological centres, i.e. the lymphoid follicles (the white pulp), are scattered throughout richly vascularized sinusoids (the red pulp).</span>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Splenectomy</h4>
                        <p><em>As the spleen is a highly vascular organ, any injury to it can be life-threatening. Under these circumstances splenectomy must be carried out urgently. The technique used differs slightly when the procedure is performed for emergency as opposed to elective indications, but the principles are similar. Splenectomy involves: ligature of the splenic vessels approaching the hilum (taking care not to injure the tail of the pancreas or colon); and dissection of the splenic pedicles-the gastrosplenic (including the short gastric vessels) and lienorenal ligaments. As the spleen is an important immunological organ, postsplenectomy patients are rendered immunocompromised to capsulated bacteria. The latter organisms (e.g. meningococcus, pneumococcus) require opsonization for elimination and splenic lymphoid follicles are the principal sites where this takes place. Hence, following splenectomy, all patients are routinely vaccinated against the capsulated bacteria, and children, who are the group most at risk of sepsis, are maintained on long-term antibiotic prophylaxis.</em></p>
