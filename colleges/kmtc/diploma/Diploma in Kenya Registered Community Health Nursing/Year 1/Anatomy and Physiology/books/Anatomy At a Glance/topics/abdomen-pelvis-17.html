                        <p>In adults, the large bowel measures approximately 1.5 m. The caecum, ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon have similar characteristic features. These are that they possess:</p>

                                <span class="item-text">Sacculations: because the teniae are shorter than the bowel itself the colon takes on a sacculated appearance. These sacculations are visible not only at operation but also radiographically. On a plain abdominal Xray, the colon, which appears radiotranslucent because of the gas within, has shelf-like processes (haustra) which partially project into the lumen.</span>

                        <p>The transverse and sigmoid colon are each attached to the posterior abdominal wall by their respective mesocolons and are covered entirely by peritoneum. Conversely, the ascending and descending colon normally possess no mesocolon. They are adherent to the posterior abdominal wall and covered only anteriorly by peritoneum.</p>

                        <p>The appendix varies enormously in length but in adults it is approximately 5-15 cm long. The base of the appendix arises from the posteromedial aspect of the caecum; however, the lie of the appendix itself is highly variable. In most cases the appendix lies in the retrocaecal position but other positions frequently occur. The appendix has the following characteristic features:</p>

The only blood supply to the appendix, the appendicular artery (a branch of the ileocolic), courses within its mesentery (see Fig. 12.4). <em>In cases of appendicitis the appendicular artery ultimately thromboses. When this occurs, gangrene and perforation of the appendix inevitably supervene.</em></span>

                        <p><em>Appendicectomy is performed most commonly through a grid-iron muscle-splitting incision. The appendix is first located and then delivered into the wound. The mesentery of the appendix is then divided and ligated. The appendix is then tied at its base, excised and removed. Most surgeons still opt to invaginate the appendix stump as a precautionary measure against slippage of the stump ligature.</em></p>
