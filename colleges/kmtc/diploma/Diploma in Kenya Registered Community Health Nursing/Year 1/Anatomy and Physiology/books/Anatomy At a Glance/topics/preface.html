                       <p>The study of anatomy has changed enormously in the last few decades. No longer do medical students have to spend long hours in the dissecting room searching fruitlessly for the otic ganglion or tracing the small arteries that form the anastomosis round the elbow joint. They now need to know only the basic essentials of anatomy with particular emphasis on their clinical relevance and this is a change that is long overdue. However, students still have examinations to pass and in this book the authors, a surgeon and an anatomist, have tried to provide a means of rapid revision without any frills. To this end, the book follows the standard format of the <i>at a Glance</i> series and is arranged in short, easily digested chapters, written largely in note form, with the appropriate illustrations on the facing page. Where necessary, clinical applications are included in italics and there are a number of clinical illustrations. We thus hope that this book will be helpful in revising and consolidating the knowledge that has been gained from the dissecting room and from more detailed and explanatory textbooks.</p>
                        <p>The anatomical drawings are the work of Jane Fallows, with help from Roger Hulley, who has transformed our rough sketches into the finished pages of illustrations that form such an important part of the book and we should like to thank her for her patience and skill in carrying out this onerous task. Some of the drawings have been borrowed or adapted from Professor Harold Ellis’s superb book <i>Clinical Anatomy</i> (9th edn) and we are most grateful to him for his permission to do this. We should also like to thank Dr Mike Benjamin of Cardiff University for the surface anatomy photographs. Finally, it is a pleasure to thank all the staff at Blackwell Science who have had a hand in the preparation of this book, particularly Fiona Goodgame and Jonathan Rowley.</p>
