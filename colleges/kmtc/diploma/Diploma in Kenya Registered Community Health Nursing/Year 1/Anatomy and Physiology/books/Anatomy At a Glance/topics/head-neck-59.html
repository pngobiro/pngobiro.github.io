                        <p>Arises from the brachiocephalic artery on the right and from the arch of the aorta on the left (Chapter 4). Each common carotid passes up the neck in the carotid sheath (Fig. 61.1), along with the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. At the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage it divides into internal and external carotid arteries. There are no branches.</p>

                        <p>Ascends in the neck a little in front of the internal carotid to divide into its two terminal branches, the maxillary and superficial temporal arteries, in the substance of the parotid gland.</p>

It then curls round the lower border of the mandible to reach the face.

It gives off a tonsillar branch in the neck, superior and inferior labial branches and nasal branches.

                        <p>At its origin from the common carotid artery it is enlarged to form the carotid sinus, a slight dilatation which has baroreceptors supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve in its wall. Associated with this is the carotid body, a chemoreceptor supplied by the same nerve. The internal carotid has no branches in the neck. It enters the cranial cavity via the carotid canal in the petrous temporal bone, accompanied by a sympathetic plexus. Within the skull it passes forwards in the cavernous sinus and then turns backwards behind the anterior clinoid process to break up into its three terminal branches.</p>
