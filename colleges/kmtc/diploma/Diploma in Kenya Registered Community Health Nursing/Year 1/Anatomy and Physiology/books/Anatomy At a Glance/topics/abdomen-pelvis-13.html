                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The portal vein (Fig. 13.2)</h3>
                        <p>The portal venous system receives blood from the length of gut from the lower third of the oesophagus to the upper half of the anal canal as well as the spleen, pancreas and gall-bladder. It serves to transfer blood to the liver where the products of digestion can be metabolized and stored. Blood from the liver ultimately gains access to the inferior vena cava by way of the hepatic veins. The portal vein is formed behind the neck of the pancreas by the union of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins. It passes behind the first part of the duodenum in front of the inferior vena cava and enters the free border of the lesser omentum. The vein then ascends towards the porta hepatis in the anterior margin of the epiploic foramen (of Winslow) in the lesser omentum. At the porta hepatis it divides into right and left branches. The veins that correspond to the branches of the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries drain into the portal vein or one of its tributaries. The inferior mesenteric vein drains into the splenic vein adjacent to the fourth part of the duodenum.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Porto-systemic anastomoses</h4>
                        <p>A number of connections occur between the portal and systemic circulations. When the direct pathway through the liver becomes congested (such as in cirrhosis) the pressure within the portal vein rises and under these circumstances the porto-systemic anastomoses form an alternative route for the blood to take. The sites of porto-systemic anastomosis include:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The inferior vena cava (Fig. 13.1)</h3>
                        <p>The inferior vena cava is formed by the union of the common iliac veins in front of the body of L5. It ascends in the retroperitoneum on the right side of the abdominal aorta. Along its course, from below upwards, it forms the posterior wall of the epiploic foramen of Winslow and is embedded in the bare area of the liver in front of the right suprarenal gland. The inferior vena cava passes through the caval opening in the diaphragm at the level of T8 and drains into the right atrium.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The lymphatic drainage of the abdomen and pelvis</h3>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The abdominal wall</h4>
                        <p>Lymph from the skin of the anterolateral abdominal wall above the level of the umbilicus drains to the anterior axillary lymph nodes. Efferent lymph from the skin below the umbilicus drains to the superficial inguinal nodes.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The lymph nodes and trunks</h4>
                        <p>The two main lymph node groups of the abdomen are closely related to the aorta. These comprise the pre-aortic and para-aortic groups.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                             <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">The pre-aortic nodes are arranged around the three ventral branches of the aorta and consequently receive lymph from the territories that are supplied by these branches. This includes most of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, gall-bladder, spleen and pancreas. The efferent vessels from the pre-aortic nodes coalesce to form a variable number of intestinal trunks which deliver the lymph to the cisterna chyli.</span>
                            </li>
                             <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">The para-aortic nodes are arranged around the lateral branches of the aorta and drain lymph from their corresponding territories, i.e. the kidneys, adrenals, gonads, and abdominal wall as well as the common iliac nodes. The efferent vessels from the para-aortic nodes coalesce to form a variable number of lumbar trunks which deliver the lymph to the cisterna chyli.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cisterna chyli</h4>
                        <p>The cisterna chyli is a lymphatic sac that lies anterior to the bodies of the 1st and 2nd lumbar vertebrae. It is formed by the confluence of the intestinal trunks, the lumbar trunks and lymphatics from the lower thoracic wall. It serves as a receptacle for lymph from the abdomen and lower limbs which is then relayed to the thorax by the thoracic duct (p. 11).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The lymphatic drainage of the stomach</h4>
                        <p>Lymph from the stomach drains to the coeliac nodes. For the purposes of description, the stomach can be divided into four quarters where lymph drains to the nearest appropriate group of nodes.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The lymphatic drainage of the testes</h4>
                        <p>Lymph from the skin of the scrotum and the tunica albuginea drains to the superficial inguinal nodes. Lymph from the testes, however, drains along the course of the testicular artery to the para-aortic group of nodes. Hence, a malignancy of the scrotal skin might result in palpable enlargement of the superficial inguinal nodes whereas testicular tumours metastasize to the para-aortic nodes.</p>
