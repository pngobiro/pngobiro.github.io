                        <p>In adults the bladder is a pelvic organ. It lies behind the pubis and is covered superiorly by peritoneum. It acts as a receptacle for urine and has a capacity of approximately 500 mL.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">

                                <span class="item-text">Structure: the bladder is pyramidal in shape. The apex of the pyramid points forwards and from it a fibrous cord, the urachus, passes upwards to the umbilicus as the median umbilical ligament. The base (posterior surface) is triangular. <em>In the male, the seminal vesicles lie on the outer posterior surface of the bladder and are separated by the vas deferens. The rectum lies behind. In the female, the vagina intervenes between the bladder and rectum.</em> The inferolateral surfaces are related inferiorly to the pelvic floor and anteriorly to the retropubic fat pad and pubic bones. The bladder neck fuses with the prostate in the male whereas it lies directly on the pelvic fascia in the female. The pelvic fascia is thickened in the form of the puboprostatic ligaments (male) and pubovesical ligaments to hold the bladder neck in position. The mucous membrane of the bladder is thrown into folds when the bladder is empty with the exception of the membrane overlying the base (termed the trigone) which is smooth. The superior angles of the trigone mark the openings of the ureteric orifices. A muscular elevation, the interureteric ridge, runs between the ureteric orifices. The inferior angle of the trigone corresponds to the internal urethral meatus. The muscle coat of the bladder is composed of a triple layer of trabeculated smooth muscle known as the detrusor (muscle). The detrusor is thickened at the bladder neck to form the sphincter vesicae.</span>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The prostate (Fig. 26.2)</h4>
                        <p>In health the prostate is approximately the size of a walnut. It surrounds the prostatic urethra and lies between the bladder neck and the urogenital diaphragm. The apex of the prostate rests on the external urethral sphincter of the bladder. It is related anteriorly to the pubic symphysis but separated from it by extraperitoneal fat in the retropubic space (cave of Retzius). Posteriorly, the prostate is separated from the rectum by the fascia of Denonvilliers.</p>

                                <span class="item-text">Structure: the prostate comprises anterior, posterior, middle and lateral lobes. On rectal examination a posterior median groove can be palpated between the lateral lobes. The prostatic lobes contain numerous glands producing an alkaline secretion which is added to the seminal fluid at ejaculation. The prostatic glands open into the prostatic sinus. The ejaculatory ducts, which drain both the seminal vesicles and the vas, enter the upper part of the prostate and then the prostatic urethra at the verumontanum.</span>

                        <p>The vas deferens conveys sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory duct from which it can be passed to the urethra. The vas arises from the tail of the epididymis and traverses the inguinal canal to the deep ring, passes downwards on the lateral wall of the pelvis almost to the ischial tuberosity and turns medially to reach the base of the bladder where it joins with the duct of the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The seminal vesicles (Fig. 26.2)</h4>
                        <p>The seminal vesicles consist of lobulated tubes which lie extraperitoneally on the bladder base lateral to the vas deferens.</p>

                        <p>The male urethra is approximately 20 cm long (4 cm in the female). It is considered in three parts:</p>

On either side of the crest a shallow depression, the prostatic sinus, marks the drainage point for 15-20 prostatic ducts.

It comprises a: fundus (part lying above the entrance of the fallopian tubes), body and cervix. The cervix is sunken into the anterior wall of the vagina and is consequently divided into supravaginal and vaginal parts. The internal cavity of the cervix communicates with the cavity of the body at the internal os and with the vagina at the external os. The fallopian tubes lie in the free edges of the broad ligaments and serve to transmit ova from the ovary to the cornua of the uterus. They comprise an: infundibulum, ampulla, isthmus and interstitial part. The uterus is made up of a thick muscular wall (myometrium) and lined by a mucous membrane (endometrium). The endometrium undergoes massive cyclical change during menstruation.</span>
