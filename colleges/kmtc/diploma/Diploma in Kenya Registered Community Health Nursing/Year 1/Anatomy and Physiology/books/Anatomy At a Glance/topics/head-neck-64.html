                        <p>The oesophagus begins at the level of the cricoid cartilage and runs down behind and slightly to the left of the trachea. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is in the groove between the oesophagus and trachea and the thoracic duct is to the left of the oesophagus.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The trachea</h3>
                        <p>The trachea begins at the level of the cricoid cartilage and ends by dividing into left and right bronchi at the level of the manubriosternal joint. The trachea can be palpated in the midline just above the suprasternal notch and can be seen in an X-ray as a dark shadow. The upper part of the trachea is crossed by the isthmus of the thyroid. <em>The trachea, bronchi and lungs develop from a groove in the floor of the embryonic pharynx which normally separates off except at the upper end. Anomalies of the separation process are not uncommon (tracheo-oesophageal fistula), the commonest variety (85%) being that in which the upper segment of the oesophagus ends blindly while the upper end of the lower segment communicates with the trachea.</em></p>

                        <p>These infrahyoid muscles are all supplied by the ansa cervicalis (C1, 2 and 3). Their function is to fix the hyoid bone so that the suprahyoid muscles have a fixed base. Their main importance lies in their close relation to the thyroid gland.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The thyroid gland</h3>
                        <p>The thyroid is an endocrine gland with an extremely rich blood supply (Fig. 64.1). Its isthmus lies across the 3rd, 4th and 5th rings of the trachea and the lobes lie on either side, reaching up as far as the 'pocket' under the attachment of sternothyroid to the thyroid cartilage. It is enclosed in the thin pretracheal fascia and also has its own fibrous capsule. <em>When the gland is enlarged, the strap muscles are stretched tightly over it and the carotid sheath is displaced laterally. An important diagnostic feature is that swellings of the thyroid move on swallowing.</em></p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Developmental anomalies</h4>
                        <p>The thyroid develops as an outgrowth from the floor of the pharynx (thyroglossal duct) in the position of the future foramen caecum of the tongue. It descends ventral to the larynx before dividing into two lobes. The stem of the outgrowth, the thyroglossal duct, normally disappears although it may remain in part. <em>Aberrant thyroid tissue may occur anywhere along the course of the duct or thyroglossal cysts may appear. Such thyroid remnants move upwards when the tongue is protruded. Infection of a persistent thyroglossal duct may occur, when the duct must be excised.</em></p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The parathyroid glands</h4>
                        <p>There are two parathyroids, superior and inferior, on each side. They are about the size of a pea and are embedded in the back of the thyroid (but outside its capsule). They develop from the third (inferior parathyroid) and fourth (superior parathyroid) pharyngeal pouches of the embryo. <em>The thymus also develops from the third pouch and may drag the inferior gland down with it so that the adult gland may lie in the thorax.</em></p>
