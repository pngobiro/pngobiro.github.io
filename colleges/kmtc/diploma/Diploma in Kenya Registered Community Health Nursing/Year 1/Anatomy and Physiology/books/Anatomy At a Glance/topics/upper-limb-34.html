                                <span class="item-text">Type: the shoulder is a synovial 'ball and socket' joint which permits multiaxial movement. It is formed by the articulation of the humeral head with the shallow glenoid fossa of the scapula (see p. 63). The glenoid is slightly deepened by a fibrocartilaginous rim-the glenoid labrum. Both articular surfaces are covered with hyaline cartilage.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">The capsule: of the shoulder joint is lax permitting a wide range of movement. It is attached medially to the margins of the glenoid and laterally to the anatomical neck of the humerus except inferiorly where it extends to the surgical neck. The capsule is significantly strengthened by slips from the surrounding rotator cuff muscle tendons.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="item-text">Stability: is afforded by the rotator cuff and the ligaments around the shoulder joint. The latter comprise: three gleno-humeral ligaments which are weak reinforcements of the capsule anteriorly; a coracohumeral ligament which reinforces the capsule superiorly; and a coracoacromial ligament which protects the joint superiorly. The main stability of the shoulder is afforded by the rotator cuff. The cuff comprises: subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor (see Muscle index, p. 162) which pass in front of, above and behind the joint, respectively. Each of these muscles can perform its own function and when all are relaxed free movement is possible, but when all are contracted they massively reinforce shoulder stability.</span>

                                <span class="item-text">Bursae: two large bursae are associated with the shoulder joint. The subscapular bursa separates the shoulder capsule from the tendon of subscapularis which passes directly anterior to it. The subscapular bursa communicates with the shoulder joint. The subacromial bursa separates the shoulder capsule from the coracoacromial ligament above. The subacromial bursa does not communicate with the joint. The tendon of supraspinatus lies in the floor of the bursa. <em>Inflammation of the bursa due to adjacent inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon caused by impingement of the supraspinatus tendon on the coracoacromial ligament gives rise to severe pain and limitation of shoulder abduction (classically between 60 and $120^{\circ}$) known as the painful arc syndrome.</em></span>

                        <p>The shoulder is a 'ball and socket' joint allowing a wide range of movement. Much of this range is attributed to the articulation of the shallow glenoid with a rounded humeral head. The drawback, however, is that of compromised stability of the joint.</p>

                        <p>Abduction at the shoulder joint is initiated by supraspinatus; deltoid continues it as soon as it obtains sufficient leverage. Almost simultaneously the scapula is rotated so that the glenoid faces upwards; this action is produced by the lower fibres of serratus anterior which are inserted into the inferior angle of the scapula and by the trapezius which pulls the lateral end of the spine of the scapula upwards and the medial end downwards.</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Shoulder dislocation (Fig. 34.3)</h4>
                        <p><em>As has been described above, stability of the shoulder joint is mostly afforded anteriorly, superiorly and posteriorly by the rotator cuff. Inferiorly, however, the shoulder is unsupported and strong abduction, coupled with external rotation, can force the head of the humerus downwards and forwards (sometimes damaging the axillary nerve) to the point that the joint dislocates. This is termed the anterior shoulder dislocation as the head usually comes to lie anteriorly in the subcoracoid position. Sometimes the force of the injury is sufficient to tear the glenoid labrum anteriorly thereby facilitating recurrence. A surgical procedure is always required when the latter has led to repeated dislocations.</em></p>
