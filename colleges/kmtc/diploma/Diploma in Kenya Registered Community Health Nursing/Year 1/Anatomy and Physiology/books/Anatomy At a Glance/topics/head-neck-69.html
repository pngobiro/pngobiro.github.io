                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The eyeball (Fig. 69.4)</h3>
                        <p>The eyeball is composed of three layers. The outermost is a tough fibrous layer, the sclera. Within this is the very vascular choroid and inside this again is the sensory part of the eye, the retina. Anteriorly, the sclera is replaced by the transparent cornea, which is devoid of vessels or lymphatics and can therefore be transplanted. At the corneoscleral junction there is an important venous structure, the sinus venosus sclerae (canal of Schlemm). Behind the cornea, the choroid is replaced by the ciliary body, with its radially arranged ciliary processes, and the iris. The ciliary body contains the circular and radial smooth muscle fibres of the ciliary muscle, supplied by parasympathetic fibres from the ciliary ganglion via the oculomotor nerve. These, when they contract, relax the lens capsule and allow the lens to expand; thus they are used in near vision. The iris contains smooth muscle fibres of the dilator pupillae and sphincter pupillae, supplied, respectively, by the sympathetic system (from the superior cervical ganglion) and the parasympathetic system (from the oculomotor nerve via the ciliary ganglion). The lens lies behind the pupil and is enclosed in a delicate capsule. It is suspended from the ciliary processes by the suspensory ligament.</p>
                        <p><em>The ciliary body secretes the aqueous humour into the posterior chamber of the eye (lying behind the pupil). The aqueous then passes through the pupil into the anterior chamber and is reabsorbed into the sinus venosus sclerae. Any interference with this process can give rise to a dangerous increase in intra-ocular pressure, a condition known as glaucoma.</em></p>
                        <p>Behind the lens the eyeball is occupied by the gelatinous vitreous humour.</p>
                        <p>The retina consists of an inner nervous layer and an outer pigmented layer. The nervous layer has an innermost layer of ganglion cells whose axons pass back to form the optic nerve. Outside this is a layer of bipolar neurones and then the receptor layer of rods and cones. Near the posterior pole of the eye is the yellowish macula lutea, the receptor area for central vision. The optic disc is a circular pale area marking the end of the optic nerve and the site of entry of the central artery of the retina. This divides into upper and lower branches, each of which gives temporal and nasal branches. <em>Since the subarachnoid space and its contained cerebrospinal fluid reach to the back of the eyeball, any increase in intracranial pressure can give rise to changes in the optic disc which are visible through an ophthalmoscope.</em></p>
