                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The breast (Fig. 29.3)</h3>
                        <p>The breasts are present in both sexes and have similar characteristics until puberty when, in the female, they enlarge and develop the capacity for milk production. The breasts are essentially specialized skin glands comprising fat, glandular and connective tissue. The base of the breast lies in a constant position on the anterior chest wall. It extends from the 2nd to 6th ribs anteriorly and from the lateral edge of the sternum to the mid-axillary line laterally. A part of the breast, the axillary tail, extends laterally through the deep fascia beneath pectoralis to enter the axilla. Each breast comprises 15-30 functional ducto-lobular units arranged radially around the nipple. The lobes are separated by fibrous septa (suspensory ligaments) which pass from the deep fascia to the overlying skin thereby giving the breast structure. A lactiferous duct arises from each lobe and converges on the nipple. In its terminal portion the duct is dilated (lactiferous sinus) and thence continues to the nipple from where milk can be expressed. The areola is the darkened skin that surrounds the nipple. Its surface is usually irregular due to multiple small tubercles-Montgomery's glands.</p>

                        <p><em>The axillary lymph nodes represent an early site of metastasis from primary breast malignancies and their surgical removal and subsequent examination provide important prognostic information as well as a basis for choice of adjuvant treatment. Damage to axillary lymphatics during surgical clearance of axillary nodes or resulting from radiotherapy to the axilla increases the likelihood of subsequent upper limb lymphoedema.</em></p>
