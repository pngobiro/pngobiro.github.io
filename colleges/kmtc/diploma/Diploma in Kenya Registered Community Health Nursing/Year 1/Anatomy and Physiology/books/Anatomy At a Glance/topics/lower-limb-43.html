                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The superficial veins of the lower limb (Fig. 43.1)</h3>
                        <p>The superficial system comprises the great and small saphenous veins. These are of utmost clinical importance as they are predisposed towards becoming varicose and consequently often require surgery. They are also the commonly used conduits for coronary artery surgery. - The great saphenous vein arises from the medial end of the dorsal venous network on the foot. It passes anterior to the medial malleolus, along the anteromedial aspect of the calf (with the saphenous nerve), migrates posteriorly to a handbreadth behind patella at the knee and then courses forward to ascend the anteromedial thigh. It pierces the cribriform fascia to drain into the femoral vein at the saphenous opening. The terminal part of the great saphenous vein usually receives superficial tributaries from the external genitalia and the lower abdominal wall (Fig. 43.2). <em>At surgery these help to distinguish the saphenous from the femoral vein as the only tributary draining into the latter is the saphenous vein.</em> Anteromedial and posterolateral femoral (lateral accessory) tributaries, from the medial and lateral aspects of the thigh, also sometimes drain into the great saphenous vein below the saphenous opening.</p>
                        <p>The great saphenous vein is connected to the deep venous system at multiple levels by perforating veins. These usually occur above and below the medial malleolus, in the gaiter area, in the mid-calf region, below the knee and one long connection in the lower thigh. <em>The valves in the perforators are directed inwards so that blood flows from superficial to deep systems from where it can be pumped upwards assisted by the muscular contractions of the calf muscles. The deep system is consequently at higher pressure than the superficial and thus, should the valves in the perforators become incompetent, the increased pressure is transmitted to the superficial system and these veins become varicose.</em></p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                                <span class="item-text">The small saphenous vein arises from the lateral end of the dorsal venous network on the foot. It passes behind the lateral malleolus and over the back of the calf to pierce the deep fascia in an inconstant position to drain into the popliteal vein.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The deep veins of the lower limb</h4>
                        <p>The deep veins of the calf are the venae comitantes of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries which go on to become the popliteal and femoral veins. The deep veins form an extensive network within the posterior compartment of the calf-the soleal plexus from which blood is assisted upwards against gravitational forces by muscular contraction during exercise. <em>Failure of this 'muscle pump' to work efficiently, as occurs, for instance, during long flights in cramped conditions, may cause deep venous thrombosis (DVT).</em></p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Varicose veins</h4>
                        <p>These are classified as:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Primary: due to inherent valve dysfunction.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Secondary: due to impedance of flow within the deep venous circulation. These can occur in pregnancy or due to obstruction caused by pelvic tumours or previous deep venous thrombosis.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In both cases the superficial veins are subjected to increased pressure and become varicose.</p>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The lymphatics of the lower limb (Fig. 43.1)</h3>
                        <p>The lymph nodes of the groin are arranged into superficial and deep groups. The superficial inguinal group lie in the superficial fascia and are arranged in two chains:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Longitudinal chain: these lie along the terminal portion of the saphenous vein. They receive lymph from the majority of the superficial tissues of the lower limb.</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text">Horizontal chain: these lie parallel to the inguinal ligament. They receive lymph from the superficial tissues of the: lower trunk below the level of the umbilicus, the buttock, the external genitalia and the lower half of the anal canal. The superficial nodes drain into the deep nodes through the saphenous opening in the deep fascia.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The deep inguinal nodes are situated medial to the femoral vein. They are usually three in number. These nodes receive lymph from all of the tissues deep to the fascia lata of the lower limb. In addition they also receive lymph from the skin and superficial tissues of the heel and lateral aspect of the foot by way of the popliteal nodes. The deep nodes convey lymph to external iliac and thence to the para-aortic nodes.</p>
                        <p><em>Obstruction of lymphatics results in lymphoedema (Fig. 43.3). This can be congenital, due to aberrant lymphatic formation, or acquired such as post radiotherapy or following certain infections. In developing countries infection with Filaria bancrofti is a significant cause of lymphoedema that can progress to massive proportions requiring limb reduction or even amputation.</em></p>
