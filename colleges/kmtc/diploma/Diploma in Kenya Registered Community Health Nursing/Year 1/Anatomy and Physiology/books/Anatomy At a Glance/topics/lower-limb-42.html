In the groin the femoral vein lies immediately medial to the artery and both are enclosed in the femoral sheath. In contrast, the femoral nerve lies immediately lateral to the femoral sheath. The femoral artery descends the thigh to pass under sartorius and then through the adductor (Hunter's) canal to become the popliteal artery.</span>

Near its origin it gives rise to medial and lateral circumflex femoral branches. These contribute to the trochanteric and cruciate anastomoses (see below). The profunda descends deep to adductor longus in the medial compartment of the thigh and gives rise to four perforating branches. These circle the femur posteriorly perforating, and supplying, all muscles in their path. The profunda and perforating branches ultimately anastomose with the genicular branches of the popliteal artery.</span>

                        <p>This arterial anastomosis is formed by branches from the medial and lateral circumflex femoral, the superior gluteal and, usually, the inferior gluteal arteries. It lies close to the trochanteric fossa and provides branches that ascend the femoral neck beneath the retinacular fibres of the capsule to supply the femoral head.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The cruciate anastomosis</h4>
                        <p>This anastomosis constitutes a collateral supply. It is formed by: the transverse branches of the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries, the descending branch of the inferior gluteal artery and the ascending branch of the 1 st perforating branch of the profunda.</p>

                                <span class="item-text">Course: the femoral artery continues as the popliteal artery as it passes through the hiatus in adductor magnus to enter the popliteal space. From above, it descends on the posterior surface of the femur, the capsule of the knee joint and then on the fascia overlying popliteus to pass under the fibrous arch of soleus where it bifurcates into anterior and posterior tibial arteries. In the fossa it is the deepest structure, rendering it difficult to feel its pulsations. The popliteal vein crosses the artery superficially and the tibial nerve crosses from lateral to medial over the vein. The peroneal branch of the posterior tibial may arise early to form the popliteal trifurcation.</span>

                                <span class="item-text">Course: the anterior tibial artery passes anteriorly from its origin, accompanied by its venae comitantes, over the upper border of the interosseous membrane and then descends over the anterior surface of the membrane giving off muscular branches to the extensor compartment of the leg. The artery crosses the front of the ankle joint midway between the malleoli where it becomes the dorsalis pedis artery. Tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus flank the artery throughout its course on its medial and lateral sides, respectively. Extensor hallucis longus commences on the lateral side but crosses the artery to lie medial by the end of its course. The dorsalis pedis artery passes on the dorsum of the foot to the level of the base of the metatarsals and then between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle to gain access to the sole and complete the deep plantar arch. Prior to passing to the sole it gives off the 1 st dorsal metatarsal branch and via an arcuate branch the three remaining dorsal metatarsal branches (Fig. 42.1).</span>

It is accompanied by its venae comitantes and supplies the flexor compartment of the leg. Approximately midway down the calf the tibial nerve crosses behind the artery from medial to lateral. The artery ultimately passes behind the medial malleolus to divide into medial and lateral plantar arteries under the flexor retinaculum. The latter branches gain access to the sole deep to abductor hallucis. Posterior to the medial malleolus the structures which can be identified-from front to back-are: tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, posterior tibial artery and venae comitantes, the tibial nerve and flexor hallucis longus.</span>

The deep branch runs between the 3rd and 4th muscle layers of the sole to continue as the deep plantar arch which is completed by the termination of the dorsalis pedis artery.

                        <p><em>Atheroma causes narrowing of the peripheral arteries with a consequent reduction in flow. Whilst flow may be adequate for tissue perfusion at rest, exercise causes pain due to ischaemia (intermittent claudication). When symptoms are intolerable, pain is present at rest or ischaemic ulceration has occurred, arterial reconstruction is required. Reconstruction is performed using either the patient's own saphenous vein or a synthetic graft (Dacron or PTFE) to bypass the occlusion. Disease which is limited in extent may be suitable for interventional procedures such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or stent insertion.</em></p>
