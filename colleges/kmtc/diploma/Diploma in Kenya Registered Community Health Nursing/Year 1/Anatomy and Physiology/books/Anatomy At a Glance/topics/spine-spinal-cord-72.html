                        <p>In the fetus, the spine and the spinal cord are the same length but, since the spine grows more quickly than the spinal cord, the lower end of the cord gradually retreats upwards, reaching the level of L3 at birth and the lower border of L1 in the adult. For this reason, too, the anterior and posterior nerve roots become more and more oblique from above downwards so the lumbar and sacral nerve roots form a bundle, the cauda equina, which occupies the lower part of the spinal canal. The posterior root ganglia occupy the intervertebral foramina so that the roots do not unite until after this point. The spinal cord itself ends as the filum terminale, a thin fibrous band which is included in the cauda equina.</p>
                        <p>The spinal cord shows two enlargements in the cervical and lumbar regions, corresponding to the origins of the nerves that make up the limb plexuses. It is for this reason that the vertebral canal is larger in these regions, and they are also the regions of the greatest mobility.</p>

                                <span class="item-text">The meninges: the meninges-the dura, pia and arachnoid-are continuous with those of the cranial cavity so that the subarachnoid space is also continuous and cerebrospinal fluid may be drained from the system or its pressure measured, by lumbar puncture. The subarachnoid space ends at the level of S2.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span class="item-text">The blood supply of the spinal cord: the spinal cord is supplied with blood by spinal arteries that are derived from the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar and lateral sacral arteries. Each artery divides into dorsal and ventral branches that follow the corresponding nerve roots to the spinal cord where they form longitudinally arranged anterior and paired posterior spinal arteries. These longitudinal anastomoses, however, are incomplete and the spinal arteries themselves vary in size. <em>The largest are in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar regions, and the blood supply of the cord may be jeopardized if some of these larger spinal arteries are damaged, for example in resection of the thoracic aorta.</em></span>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The spinal nerves</h3>
                        <p>As has been described in Chapter 2, the spinal nerves from T2 to L1 supply segmental areas of skin and muscles but elsewhere they form plexuses so that the areas supplied by each nerve become more complicated. Each named peripheral nerve may contain components of more than one spinal nerve and each spinal nerve may contribute fibres to more than one peripheral nerve. However, the area of skin supplied by any one spinal nerve (a dermatome) can be mapped out and these are shown in Fig. 72.1. <em>Knowledge of the dermatome map is of great value in diagnosing lesions of the spinal nerves but it must be remembered that these areas are subject to some variation from one person to another and there is also a good deal of overlap. Thus a lesion of, say, T4 may cause little or no loss of sensation because of overlap with T3 and T5.</em></p>
                        <p>Similarly, certain groups of muscles (myotomes) can be recognized as being supplied by particular spinal nerves. For example, C5 supplies the abductors of the shoulder, the flexors of the elbow and the supinators so that a lesion of this nerve or of the upper trunk of the brachial plexus will cause the arm to be held in a position of adduction of the shoulder, extension of the elbow and pronation (Erb-Duchenne paralysis). <em>Similarly, T1 supplies the small muscles of the hand so that a lesion of this nerve, due perhaps to the presence of a cervical rib, will cause global wasting of the hand muscles.</em></p>
