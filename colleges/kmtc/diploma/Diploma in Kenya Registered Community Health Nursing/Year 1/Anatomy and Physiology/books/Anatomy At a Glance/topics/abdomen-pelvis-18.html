                                <span class="item-text">The liver anatomically consists of a large right lobe, and a smaller left lobe. These are separated antero-superiorly by the falciform ligament and postero-inferiorly by fissures for the ligamentum venosum and ligamentum teres. In the anatomical classification the right lobe includes the caudate and quadrate lobes. Functionally, however, the caudate and most of the quadrate lobes are units of the left lobe as they receive their blood supplies from the left hepatic artery and deliver their bile into the left hepatic duct. Hence, the functional classification of the liver defines the right and left lobes as separated by a vertical plane extending posteriorly from the gall-bladder to the inferior vena cava (IVC).</span>

                                <span class="item-text">The liver is made up of multiple functional units-lobules (Fig. 18.2). Branches of the portal vein and hepatic artery transport blood through portal canals into a central vein by way of sinusoids which traverse the lobules. The central veins ultimately coalesce into the right, left and central hepatic veins which drain blood from corresponding liver areas backwards into the IVC. The portal canals also contain tributaries of the hepatic ducts which serve to drain bile from the lobule down the biliary tree from where it can be concentrated in the gall-bladder and eventually released into the duodenum. <em>The extensive length of gut that is drained by the portal vein explains the predisposition for intestinal tumours to metastasize to the liver.</em></span>

                        <p>The gall-bladder lies adherent to the undersurface of the liver in the transpyloric plane (p. 53) at the junction of the right and quadrate lobes. The duodenum and the transverse colon are behind it.</p>
                        <p>The gall-bladder acts as a reservoir for bile which it concentrates. It usually contains approximately 50 mL of bile which is released through the cystic and then common bile ducts into the duodenum in response to gall-bladder contraction induced by gut hormones.</p>

                                <span class="item-text">Blood supply: the arterial supply to the gall-bladder is derived from two sources: the cystic artery which is usually, but not always, a branch of the right hepatic artery, and small branches of the hepatic arteries which pass via the fossa in which the gall-bladder lies. The cystic artery represents the most significant source of arterial supply. There is, however, no corresponding cystic vein but venous drainage occurs via small veins passing through the gall-bladder bed.</span>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                         <h3 class="subsection-heading">The biliary tree</h3>
                        <p>The common hepatic duct is formed by the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts in the porta hepatis. The common hepatic duct is joined by the cystic duct to form the common bile duct. This structure courses, sequentially, in the free edge of the lesser omentum, behind the first part of the duodenum and in the groove between the second part of the duodenum and the head of the pancreas. It ultimately opens at the papilla on the medial aspect of the second part of the duodenum.</p>
                        <p>The common bile duct usually, but not always, joins with the main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) (p. 47).</p>

                         <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cholelithiasis</h4>
                        <p><em>Gallstones are composed of either cholesterol, bile pigment, or, more commonly, a mixture of these two constituents. Cholesterol stones form due to an altered composition of bile resulting in the precipitation of cholesterol crystals. Most gallstones are asymptomatic; however, when they migrate down the biliary tree they can be responsible for a diverse array of complications such as: acute cholecystitis, biliary colic, cholangitis and pancreatitis.</em></p>
