Flexor pollicis longus (FPL) passes through the carpal tunnel in its own synovial sheath and inserts into the distal phalanx. The tendons of flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris pass through the forearm and also insert in the proximal hand (see Muscle index, p. 162).</span>

They are responsible for flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension of the interphalangeal joints. They also perform abduction and adduction movements of the fingers. These movements occur around the middle finger hence adduction is the bringing together of all fingers towards the middle finger, abduction is moving them away from the middle finger. The dorsal interossei each arise from two metacarpals and insert into the proximal phalanges so as to provide adduction (P.AD). The dorsal interossei arise from only one metacarpal and are inserted into the proximal phalanges so as to provide abduction (D.AB). Note that the middle finger cannot be adducted (and hence has no palmar interosseous) but can be abducted in either direction so it has two dorsal interosseous insertions.</span>

On the dorsum of the hand the ED tendon to the index finger is accompanied by the tendon of extensor indicis. The ED tendon to the little finger is accompanied by the double tendon of extensor digiti minimi. The ED tendons of the little, ring and middle fingers are connected to each other by fibrous slips. On the posterior surface of each finger the extensor tendon spreads to form a dorsal digital expansion. This expansion is triangular shaped and at its apex splits into three parts: a middle slip which is attached to the base of the middle phalanx; and two lateral slips which converge to attach to the base of the distal phalanx. The base of the expansion receives the appropriate interossei and lumbricals. The tendons of abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis and longus form the boundaries of the anatomical snuffbox and proceed to insert into the thumb.</span>

                        <p>The hand is required to perform a versatile range of movement extending from a firm grasp, such as that needed to carry heavy bags, to precision gripping such as that required to hold a pencil. For precision grips the thumb is used to oppose the index finger in which the interphalangeal joint is extended and the metacarpophalangeal joint is flexed. The thumb opposition is carried out mainly by opponens pollicis whilst the lumbricals and interossei are responsible for maintaining flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints and extension at the interphalangeal joints. Since the thumb is at right angles to the plane of the fingers, abduction of the thumb is a movement away from the plane of the palm. This is used in testing the integrity of the median nerve (abductor pollicis).</p>
