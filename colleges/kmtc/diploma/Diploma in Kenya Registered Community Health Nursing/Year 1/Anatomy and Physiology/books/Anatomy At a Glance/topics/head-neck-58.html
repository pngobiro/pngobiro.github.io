                                <span class="item-text">VI. The abducent nerve (see Fig. 56.3): leaves the brain at the posterior border of the pons and has a long intracranial course (<em>so is often the first nerve to be affected in raised intracranial pressure</em>) to the cavernous sinus, where it is closely applied to the internal carotid artery, and thence to the orbit via the superior orbital fissure. It supplies the lateral rectus.</span>

                                <span class="item-text">VII. The facial nerve (Fig. 58.1): this leaves the brain near the cerebellum and passes laterally into the internal auditory meatus. It reaches the medial wall of the middle ear and turns backwards and downwards to leave the skull via the stylomastoid foramen. It then traverses the parotid gland, in which it divides into five branches (temporal, zygomatic, buccal, marginal mandibular and cervical) which are distributed to the muscles of facial expression, the platysma and the posterior belly of the digastric. In the middle ear it gives off the greater petrosal branch which carries parasympathetic fibres to the sphenopalatine ganglion and thence to the lacrimal gland. In the middle ear it also gives off the chorda tympani which joins the lingual nerve and is distributed with it. Sensory fibres in the chorda tympani have their cell bodies in the geniculate ganglion which lies on the facial nerve where it turns downwards.</span>

                                <span class="item-text">IX. The glossopharyngeal nerve (see Fig. 65.1): leaves the brain at the side of the medulla and passes through the jugular foramen. It then curves forwards between the internal and external carotid arteries to enter the pharynx between the superior and middle constrictors. It supplies sensory fibres to the posterior one third of the tongue (including taste) and the pharynx. It also gives a branch to the carotid body and sinus.</span>

                                <span class="item-text">X. The vagus nerve (Fig. 58.2): arises from the side of the medulla and passes through the jugular foramen. It is joined by the accessory nerve but the spinal root of the accessory leaves it again almost immediately. The cranial root is distributed with the vagus (hence the name-it is accessory to the vagus). The vagus carries two ganglia for the cell bodies of its sensory fibres. It descends between the internal carotid artery and the jugular vein, within the carotid sheath, and enters the thorax where its further course is described in Chapters 2 and 3. In the neck the vagus (and cranial root of the accessory) gives the following branches:</span>

On the left side it arises from the vagus just below the arch of the aorta and ascends to the larynx in the groove between the trachea and oesophagus.</em> The recurrent laryngeal nerves supply all the muscles of the larynx (except for cricopharyngeus) and are sensory to the larynx below the vocal cords.</span>

The spinal root arises from the side of the upper five segments of the spinal cord, enters the cranial cavity through the foramen magnum and joins the vagus. It leaves the vagus below the jugular foramen and passes backwards to enter sternomastoid, which it supplies. It then crosses the posterior triangle to supply trapezius (see Fig. 61.3).</span>

                                <span class="item-text">XII. The hypoglossal nerve (Figs 59.1 and 65.1): arises from the side of the medulla ventral to the vagus and cranial accessory and passes through the hypoglossal canal. Below the skull it is joined by the anterior ramus of C1 and it then runs downwards and forward, across the carotid sheath and the upward loop of the lingual artery to enter the tongue. It supplies the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue. It gives off the descendens hypoglossi but this is actually composed of fibres from C1. This joins the descendens cervicalis, derived from C2 and 3, to form the ansa cervicalis. From this, branches arise to supply the 'strap muscles', i.e. sternothyroid, sternohyoid, thyrohyoid and omohyoid.</span>
