The foregut extends from the oesophagus to the entrance of the common bile duct into the second part of the duodenum. The midgut extends down to two-thirds of the way along the transverse colon. It largely develops outside the abdomen until this congenital 'umbilical hernia' is reduced during the 8th-10th week of gestation. The hindgut extends down to include the upper half of the anal canal.</p>

The anterior and posterior vagal trunks descend along the lesser curve as the anterior and posterior nerves of Latarjet from which terminal branches arise to supply the stomach.

                        <p>The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is approximately 25 cm long and curves around the head of the pancreas. Its primary function is in the absorption of digested products. Despite its relatively short length the surface area is greatly enhanced by the mucosa being thrown into folds bearing villi which are visible only at a microscopic level. With the exception of the first 2.5 cm, which is completely covered by peritoneum, the duodenum is a retroperitoneal structure. It is considered in four parts:</p>

Internally, in the mid-section, a small eminence may be found on the posteromedial aspect of the mucosa-the duodenal papilla. This structure represents the site of the common opening of the bile duct and main pancreatic duct (of Wirsung). The sphincter of Oddi guards this common opening. A smaller subsidiary pancreatic duct (of Santorini) opens into the duodenum a small distance above the papilla.</span>

                        <p><em>Most peptic ulcers occur in the stomach and proximal duodenum. They arise as a result of an imbalance between acid secretion and mucosal defences. Helicobacter pylori infection is a significant aetiological factor and the eradication of this organism, as well as the attenuation of acid secretion, form the cornerstones of medical treatment. In a minority of cases the symptoms are not controlled by medical treatment alone and surgery is required. 'Very highly selective vagotomy' is a technique where only the afferent vagal fibres to the acid-secreting body are denervated thus not compromising the motor supply to the stomach and hence bypassing the need for a drainage procedure (e.g. gastrojejunostomy).</em></p>
