                        <p>The department of EHS is one of the oldest departments. The first PHO, the then called Sanitary inspector was employed in 1907. The title has undergone several changes to the current PHO and PHT. Currently the department has 4185 certificate holders(PHT's) and diploma(PHO's).</p>
                        <p>PHT's are deployed to be in charge of public health activities at locations and sublocations while PHO's take divisions and districts.</p>
                        <p>In some ways public health is a modern concept of human development in science, although it has roots and entiquity from the beginning of human civilization.</p>
                        <p>Early religions attempted to regulate the behavior that was specifically related to health from the type of food eaten to regulating certain indulgent behaviours such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations.</p>
                        <p>By Roman times, it was well understood that proper diversion of human waste was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The Chinese developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measures of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals.</p>

                                 <p>The science of epidemiology was founded by John Snow's identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in London. Dr Snow believed in the Germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing Miasma Theory.</p>
                                 <p>The modern era of public health didn't begin until the 1880's with Louis Pasteur's Germ theory and production of artificial vaccines.</p>

                        <p>Other public health interventions included latrinization, the building of sewers, the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a land field, providing clean water and draining stagnant water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.</p>
                        <p>This contribution was made by Edwin Chadwick in 1843 who published a report on the sanitation of the working class population in Great Britain at the time. So begun the inspection of the modern public health.</p>

                        <p>The first missionary society in Mombasa in 1888 appears to have been the first to undertake medical work in Kenya. Their main concern was the spread of Christianity which they did simultaneously with medical services. Consequently they laid foundation of curative and preventive medicine.</p>
                        <p>Medical services both in Kenya and Uganda were amalgamated but in 1903 the services were separately developed in the two countries. Active environment work started in Kenya between 1913 and 1920 when the first sanitary inspectors were employed.</p>
                        <p>In 1920, the first director of Medical Services was appointed to advice the government on medical requirement for the whole country and to plan, execute preventive measures against communicable diseases.</p>
