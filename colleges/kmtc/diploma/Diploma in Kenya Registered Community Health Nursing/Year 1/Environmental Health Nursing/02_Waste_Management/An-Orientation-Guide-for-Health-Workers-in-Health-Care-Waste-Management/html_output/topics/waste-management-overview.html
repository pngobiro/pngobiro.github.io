                            <li>The "Duty of Care" principle: stipulates that any person handling or managing hazardous substances or related equipment is ethically responsible for using the utmost care in that task.</li>
                            <li>The "Proximity" principle: recommends that treatment and disposal of waste should take place at the closest possible location to its source in order to minimize risks linked to the transport of waste.</li>
                            <li>The "Precautionary" principle: governs health and safety protection. When the magnitude of a particular risk is uncertain, it should be assumed that this risk is significant, and measures to protect health and safety should be designed accordingly.</li>
                            <li>The "Polluter Pays" principle: implies that all producers of waste are responsible for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of the waste they produce.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Source reduction-purchasing and supplying materials which are less wasteful and/ or generate less medical waste.</li>
                            <li>Stock management-frequent auditing; use of the oldest stock first and checking the expiry date of products during receiving and issuing of commodities.</li>
                            <li>Encouraging the use of recyclable products-using materials that can be recycled both off- and onsite.</li>
                            <li>Centralized purchasing, supply and monitoring of medical goods-reducing the costs and waste.</li>
                            <li>Segregation of waste at the point of generation - sorting the waste into different categories, helping to minimize the quantities of hazardous waste.</li>
                            <li>Reducing the number of unnecessary injections-increased use of oral medication instead of injectable.</li>

                        <p>The segregation of waste has the following advantages:</p>

                            <li>Facilitates the safe handling of the waste.</li>
                            <li>Separates recyclable waste from hazardous waste.</li>
                            <li>Ensures that the waste will be treated according to its hazards.</li>
                            <li>Reduces the overall cost of waste management, including transport, treatment, and disposal.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Segregation categories</h3>
                        <p>Health care workers should segregate HCW immediately at the point of generation according to the type of waste. The national HCW segregation chart has the following categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>General or noninfectious waste.</li>
                            <li>Infectious waste.</li>
                            <li>Highly infectious or anatomical/pathological waste.</li>
                            <li>Sharps waste.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Individual health facilities may include other categories in addition to the above, such as food remains, bottles, etc. This can promote recycling or reuse of materials that may have potential value for resale.</p>

                        <p>Sharp waste must be immediately contained after use in order to prevent injury.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The primary way to contain sharps is by using safety boxes and needle removers when available in the health facility.</li>
                            <li>A safety box is a puncture- and leak-resistant container for disposal of sharps.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Why use a safety box?</h4>
                        <p>Sharps can cut or puncture the skin, and, if they are contaminated, they can cause infections or diseases, including hepatitis B , hepatitis C , and HIV. If not properly disposed of, scavengers may also collect and reuse sharps waste. Reusing syringes and needles results in high risk of infection or disease transmission.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tips on how to use a safety box</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Follow assembly instructions printed on the box.</li>
                            <li>Keep safety box within arm's reach at each place where injections are given.</li>
                            <li>Remove cannula/needle from IV set and place sharp in safety box.</li>
                            <li>Dispose of the used syringe into the small opening in the safety box immediately after use.</li>
                            <li>Do not recap and do not collect syringes for later disposal.</li>
                            <li>Fingers should never be placed inside the box.</li>
                            <li>Close the flap on the small opening of the box when it is three-quarters full. Do not overfill.</li>
                            <li>Fill safety box only once and then destroy.</li>

                        <p>Handling is the process of packing and moving waste materials at the points of generation. It is done by generators and handlers of waste as it entails holding pieces of waste in bins located near the points of waste generation</p>
                        <p>In general, the following measures should be taken when handling HCW:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health workers handling waste must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling waste.</li>
                            <li>Sharps must always be placed in injection safety boxes and never be placed in waste bags.</li>
                            <li>Waste must be contained in colour-coded and well-labelled plastic bags.</li>
                            <li>Waste bags must not be overfilled (fill to approximately three-quarters of capacity).</li>
                            <li>The volume of waste bag should not exceed 55 litres.</li>
                            <li>At the point of waste generation, excess air should be expelled from the bag without compacting the contents, prior to closure using a bag tie.</li>
                            <li>All bags should be held away from the body by the closed top of the bag, and placed directly into a mobile garbage bin or trolley.</li>
                            <li>Where waste bags are sealed and stored pending collection, they should be in a secure place with restricted access.</li>
                            <li>A waste collection schedule should be in place.</li>

                        <p>Storage is the temporary containment of waste in a secured area before collection for treatment and/or disposal. Storage requirements must meet the criteria set by technically trained personnel.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The storage time must not exceed 24 hours.</li>
                            <li>Any storage of waste, including sharps, before treatment or collection for offsite disposal should be in a secure location designated for the purpose.</li>

                        <p>Recommendations for the transfer station/storage area and its equipment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There should be a water supply for cleaning purposes.</li>

                            <li>The storage area should have impermeable, hard-standing floor with good drainage; it should be easy to clean and disinfect.</li>
                            <li>The storage area should afford easy access for staff in charge of handling waste.</li>
                            <li>It should be possible to lock the storage area to prevent access by unauthorized persons.</li>

                        <p>Collection is the assembly of waste packages from different sections to one point. Collection is meant to avoid accumulation and decomposition of waste in an area.</p>
                        <p>Guiding principles in collection of waste include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove waste liner bags from the service point and take them to a storage or disposal area.</li>
                            <li>Waste should not be allowed to accumulate at the point of production. For this reason, a routine schedule for waste collection should be established as part of the HCWM plan.</li>
                            <li>Health care workers should ensure that waste liner bags are tightly closed or sealed when they are about three-quarters full.</li>
                            <li>Light-gauge liner bags can be closed by tying the neck, but heavier-gauge bags probably require a plastic sealing tag of the self-locking type.</li>
                            <li>Liner bags should not be stapled closed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Recommendations to be followed by waste handlers in charge of waste collection:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Waste should be collected daily (or as frequently as required) and transported to the designated central storage site.</li>
                            <li>Liner bags should be labelled at the point of production, indicating the department or ward or point of generation. The liner bags should be replaced immediately with new ones of the same type.</li>
                            <li>The waste containers and trolleys should be regularly cleaned and decontaminated after use.</li>
                            <li>A supply of fresh collection liner bags or containers should be readily available at all locations where waste is produced.</li>
                            <li>The person in charge should ensure that adequate supplies (three months' worth) are available and that procurement is timely to ensure the facility does not run out of the liner bags.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Transportation refers to moving collected wastes from temporary storage area to treatment or disposal site. HCW can be transported to a treatment site within the hospital (known as "onsite") or outside (known as "offsite").</p>
                        <p>When moving waste from one place to another-either onsite or offsite-the following precautions should be taken:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boxes of waste must be kept upright; avoid direct contact of safety boxes with other waste or medical supplies in the same vehicle.</li>
                            <li>Safety boxes must be kept dry.</li>
                            <li>All health workers should be aware of the waste-collection schedule.</li>
                            <li>Waste should be placed in collection points to ensure that the waste handlers do not enter the wards/departments as they move en route.</li>
                            <li>Health facilities should have a clearly defined route for transportation of waste. The transport routes should avoid food preparation and heavily used areas.</li>
                            <li>After transport, decontaminate and clean vehicle surfaces.</li>
                            <li>HCW should be transported in designated vessels only.</li>

                        <p>The common methods of treatment are incineration, steam sterilization, chemical disinfection, autoclaving, and microwave irradiation. Other methods that can be used include encapsulation and inertization, shredding, and placenta maceration.</p>
                        <p>Laboratory infectious products must be pre-treated at the point of generation as per the National Biosafety and Biosecurity Guidelines.</p>

                        <p>Disposal refers to the final discharge of waste and residues or by-product from the treatment of waste. Municipal landfills are a designated site for disposal of municipal waste in a controlled manner to minimize pollution to ground water, land, and air. Disposal can also be done through burial in waste pits, placenta pits, and ash pits. Liquid waste is discharged through the conventional sewer line.</p>
