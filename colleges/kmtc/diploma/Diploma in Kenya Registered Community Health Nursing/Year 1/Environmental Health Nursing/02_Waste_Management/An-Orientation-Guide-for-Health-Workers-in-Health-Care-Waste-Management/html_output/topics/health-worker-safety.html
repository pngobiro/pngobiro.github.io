                        <p>Any health worker who handles wastes is at potential risk of accidental injury or exposure to infections. Consequently, health workers are at risk of infection with bloodborne viruses including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. In addition, they are at risk of contracting other diseases and respiratory infections. Risk of infection for health workers depends on the prevalence of disease in the patient population, the nature and frequency of exposure, and their vulnerability.</p>
                        <p>To eliminate or minimize the risk of infection, health care facilities must institute good health and safety measures and ensure that all health care workers adhere to them.</p>
                        <p>Strategies to protect health workers include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implementing standard precautions.</li>
                            <li>Immunising all health workers against hepatitis B.</li>
                            <li>Providing PPE.</li>
                            <li>Managing exposures in a timely manner.</li>
                            <li>Eliminating unnecessary sharps and injections.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Standard precautions are universally accepted practices adopted to promote safety of the health worker and prevent transmission of infections from person to person, surface to person, or object to person.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hand hygiene is the single most recommended method of infection prevention. The purpose of hand hygiene is to remove soil, blood, other organic material, and transient microorganisms from the skin. Types of hand hygiene practised depend on settings and procedures carried out. Hand-washing is general/routine cleaning of surfaces of the hand using soap and water. The main steps are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wet hands with water.</li>
                            <li>Apply soap.</li>
                            <li>Rub all surfaces.</li>
                            <li>Rinse hands.</li>
                            <li>Dry with single-use towel.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Hand-rubbing</strong> is the use of waterless, alcohol-based sanitizers on hand surfaces to kill transient and resident flora without use of water. Use sanitizers up to a maximum of five times per day.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hand antisepsis</strong> is the use of an antiseptic detergent to clean hands. It may reduce infections in high-risk situations such as contact with highly susceptible patients.</p>
                        <p><strong>Surgical hand scrub</strong> is practiced prior to performing any surgical procedure as a way of removing debris and transient microorganisms on the surface of the hand.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Indications for hand hygiene:</h3>

                        <p>Protective barriers and clothing referred to as PPE provide a physical barrier between microorganisms and the wearer, thereby preventing microorganisms from contaminating hands, eyes, clothing, hair, and shoes. PPE also prevents microorganisms from being transmitted to other patients and staff.</p>
                        <p>PPE reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of acquiring an infection. PPE must be used effectively, correctly, and whenever there is a risk of contact with blood and body fluids. Making PPE available and training health care workers to use it properly are essential.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Assess the risk of exposure to blood, body fluids, excretions, or secretions and choose items of PPE accordingly.</li>
                            <li>Use PPE appropriately.</li>
                            <li>Avoid any contact between contaminated (used) PPE and surfaces, clothing, or people outside the patient care area.</li>
                            <li>Do not share PPE.</li>
                            <li>Remove PPE after use without contaminating yourself and then perform hand hygiene.</li>
                            <li>Disinfect reusable PPE appropriately.</li>
                            <li>Discard disposable used PPE appropriately in designated disposal bags.</li>

                        <p>Health workers are at risk of accidental needle stick or other injuries from sharps. The World Health Organization recommends following the ten steps below after a needle-stick injury:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Allow the wound to bleed freely and wash the area with soap under clean running water (do not squeeze).</li>
                            <li>If blood or body fluids get in your eyes, splash eyes with clean water.</li>
                            <li>Immediately report the incident to a designated person.</li>
                            <li>Retain, if possible, the item involved in the incident; get details of its source for identification of possible infection.</li>
                            <li>Seek additional medical attention in an emergency health department as soon as possible, including evaluating the exposure for its potential to transmit HIV infection (based on body substance and severity of exposure).</li>
                            <li>Get counseling and testing.</li>
                            <li>Initiate PEP immediately or within 72 hours of exposure.</li>
                            <li>Record the incident in the PEP register.</li>
                            <li>Investigate the incident and identify and implement remedial action to prevent similar incidents in the future.</li>
                            <li>Follow up according to guidelines.</li>

                        <p>All biological specimens/body fluids should be considered potentially infectious. The main aim should be to contain, neutralise, and dispose of the material safely.</p>

                            <li>Put on plastic apron, gloves, face protection/mask, if required, and overshoes/boots. (Solutions used to neutralise the spillage will depend on the nature of the substance, and local advice should be sought).</li>
                            <li>Limit the spread of fluid by absorbent disposable towelling. Discard the towels carefully into yellow plastic bags for incineration.</li>

                            <li>Dispose of sharp items into a sharps container.</li>
                            <li>After the necessary disinfectant contact period, collect the absorbed spillage and discard into a yellow plastic bag or sharps box (if there is sharps debris).</li>
                            <li>Remove and discard disposable protective clothing, together with any other contaminated non-sharp disposable materials. Wash and dry hands.</li>

                        <p>Dealing with spillage of a dangerous chemicals (e.g., glutaraldehyde, xylene, and formalin, amongst others):</p>

                            <li>Evacuate non-essential personnel from the area.</li>
                            <li>Attend to persons who may have been contaminated.</li>
                            <li>If the spilled material is flammable:
