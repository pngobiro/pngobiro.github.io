                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Welcome to section three of this unit. In this section you will cover food and principles of food hygiene. Food is essential for growth, development and in the provision of energy. However, food could also be responsible for the spread of some diseases. The aim of food hygiene is to prevent the contamination of food at any stage. These stages are production, collection, storage, sale, preparation and consumption.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe the sources of food</li>
                            <li>Describe methods of food storage</li>
                            <li>Describe preparation and preservation of food</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Sources of Food</h3>
                        <p>Sources of food vary widely. They include rearing, feeding, marketing, crop production and slaughter of animals. Foods that are of animal origin should only be derived from animals that are legally allowed for human consumption, for example, some countries ban game meat. Meanwhile, crop production should follow rules in agricultural practice, which involve spraying crops against pests. Farmers are advised on safe use of pesticides. During food processing certain standards of food hygiene are applied, for example, in milk treatment, drinks and tinned foods. The chemicals used as preservatives are also regulated for the safety of the consumers. The slaughter of animals is governed by several rules and acts, for example, the Meat Control Act, the Veterinary Act and the Public Health Act. Food can be contaminated by excreta, dirty fingers, flies, poisonous insecticides or pesticides on vegetables or chemical preservation of food. It can also be contaminated if it is derived from infected animals, for example, animals with tapeworms or brucellosis. You will now look at the recommended conditions for storing different types of food.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Food Storage</h3>
                        <p>Storage will depend on the type and packaging of the food.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dry Foods</h4>
                        <p>These include foods like maize, beans, and wheat (cereals). Such foods should be stored in dry, airy conditions in improved granaries.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bagged Foods</h4>
                        <p>These foods should be stored on raised shelves at least 18 inches above the floor or ground level. This enables the store to be swept and washed easily. It also allows for easy inspection for pest detection.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Perishable Foods</h4>
                        <p>These are foods that go bad within a short time. Such foods include dairy products, meat and fish. They should be refrigerated to inhibit the multiplication of bacteria.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Food Preservation</h3>
                        <p>This is defined as any method used to treat food for the purpose of prolonging its life without appreciable loss of its quality and appeal. Most human food is of biological origin and there is continuous metabolism to produce the end product. This applies to food of both animal and plant origin, for example, meat, milk, fish, leaves, tubers and seeds. When an animal or plant dies, they lose the mechanism of protection from bacteria, fungi and moulds.</p>
                        <p>Thus, you preserve food in order to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increase its shelf-life, for example, canned foods</li>
                            <li>Render the food safe for consumption, for example, highly perishable foods like milk</li>
                            <li>Conserve the food for use during the periods of scarcity, for instance, dried cereals and vegetables</li>
                            <li>Avail seasonal foods, like fruits, throughout the year</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Principles of Food Preservation</h3>
                        <p>There are 2 principles of food preservation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Principle 1</h4>
                        <p>Destroy organisms responsible for spoilage through heat treatment.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Principle 2</h4>
                        <p>Inhibit the micro-organisms through cold treatment.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Moulds</h4>
                        <p>Affect the surfaces of foods containing high sugar and salt. They also affect dry foods that may become damp due to poor storage.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Yeasts</h4>
                        <p>Affect foods that have acid or sugar in high concentration, for example, dried fruits, and concentrated fruit juices.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bacteria</h4>
                        <p>Affect foods under various conditions apart from dry food.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Heat Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The following are methods of destroying organisms through heat treatment.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cooking</h4>
                        <p>This is a heating process, which aims to produce more palatable food. Cooked food generally keeps longer than raw foods as long as re-contamination is minimised. Cooking destroys or reduces micro-organisms and potential toxins in food. Cooking also inactivates undesirable enzymes in food. It alters the colour, texture and flavour and improves the digestibility of food. On the other hand, cooking may cause degradation of food nutrients, for example, over cooking vegetables destroys vitamin C.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blanching</h4>
                        <p>This is the process where most vegetable foods are heat treated at $70-100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for $2-10$ minutes. This is done by immersing food in boiling water or exposing it to steam. Blanching is used before freezing, canning or drying. This process inactivates enzymes, drives out air bubbles trapped in food, enhances retention of green colours and reduces micro-organisms.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pasteurisation</h4>
                        <p>This is a relatively slow method of heat treatment. Pasteurisation is generally carried out at a temperature of below $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. This method is used to increase the life span of the product. This method reduces organisms that cause spoilage and eliminates pathogens.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sterilisation</h4>
                        <p>In this method heat is used to kill all micro-organisms and their spores at a temperature of above $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The sterilised food must be stored in an airtight container to prevent the entry of and recontamination by micro-organisms.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Canning</h4>
                        <p>In this method, the food is first heated at a temperature that kills all bacteria and it is then sealed up in sterile cans or bottles. This prevents bacteria from getting into it and enables it to remain safe for a long time at room temperature.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cold Treatment and Other Methods</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Freezing</h4>
                        <p>This is the most satisfactory method currently available for long-term preservation of food. When properly done, freezing is effective for retaining the colour, texture, flavour and nutritive value. Food must be deep-frozen at $0-4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ to remain palatable. This keeps food fresh for weeks or months.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Salting</h4>
                        <p>This is the saturation of food with salt or sugar, for example, ham, jam and jelly. The added solute reduces microbial activity due to its dehydrating effect. The salt and sugar solutions are more concentrated than the cytoplasm inside the cell. Therefore, the water passes out of the cell into the concentrate, dehydrating the cell.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Smoking and Drying</h4>
                        <p>Drying and smoking makes food unsuitable for the bacteria to grow and multiply. Fish or meat may be preserved by these methods. A wood rack is made and fish or meat is placed on it. A wood fire, which generates heat and thick smoke, is made under the rack. The heat will dry the fish or meat, and the smoke gets inside the food to act as a preservative. Green vegetables, cereals and legumes can be preserved by drying them in the sun. If food is preserved by drying, it must be stored in a dry place until it is used.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Food Safety</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparation of Food</h4>
                        <p>Adequate personal hygiene must be observed when preparing food in order to prevent disease.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Health</h5>
                        <p>Individuals suffering from respiratory infections such as colds or sore throat should not work with food until they get well. This also applies to people with infected cuts, skin eruptions and diarrhoeal diseases like dysentery and typhoid.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Clothing</h5>
                        <p>Individuals working with food should wear clean washable outer garments. Every worker in the kitchen or washing dishes should wear a clean uniform or apron. These clothes should be worn when the worker is in the premises where food preparation is taking place. This avoids cross-food contamination.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Head Covering</h5>
                        <p>To avoid hair from getting into food, hair bands, caps or nets should be used to cover the head when handling food.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Personal Hygiene</h5>
                        <p>A daily bath is necessary for every individual. Wash hands before handling the food, use clean utensils and avoid habits such as nose picking. Nails should be kept short and clean.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Food</h5>
                        <p>Raw food should be separated from cooked food. All vegetables should be cleaned thoroughly before preparation for cooking. Fruits should be washed before eating. The food should be hygienically prepared and cooked adequately. All food utensils should be cleaned properly after use and left to dry before being stored in a clean place</p>
                        
                        <h5>Environment</h5>
                        <p>The environment pertaining to the preparation of food should be clean throughout. The area should be dust free. This includes the floors and all the surfaces used for food preparation. The facility itself should be clean and with adequate ventilation and lighting.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Common Food Borne Diseases and Their Causes</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Food Safety Regulations</h3>
                        <p>The safety of food is so important that our government has passed laws to protect the public. These laws cover many aspects of food handling and health officers are generally responsible for enforcing these laws. Agricultural personnel assist them, where necessary. You will look at some of the factors that should be considered when preparing or handling food and some of the food-borne diseases.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                             <h4 class="callout-title">Remember:</h4>
                             <p>The Public Health Act Cap 242 is an Act of Parliament to make provision for securing and maintaining health. This act is divided into 15 parts. Each part deals with a specific aspect of public health.</p>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <p>Part 10 of the Act deals 'with protection of foodstuffs'. This part regulates the construction of buildings used for storage of foodstuffs. Secondly, it prohibits residing or sleeping in kitchens or food stores. Part (II) deals with 'milk, meat and other articles of food'. This part prohibits the sale of unwholesome foods. It gives powers to authorised officers to inspect and examine food, seize and recommend disposal at any time. These laws aim at protecting the public and the public health officers are responsible for enforcing them. As a community health nurse you need to work closely with public health officers to apply the food safety regulations.</p>
                        
                        <p>The following are some of the areas that need close supervision.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Meat</h4>
                        <p>Meat is one of the commonest foods that cause problems to the public. Therefore, it is important that inspection of slaughterhouses, cows, sheep, goats and pigs be carried out. The same case applies to butcheries where meat is sold.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Milk</h4>
                        <p>Milk is one of the foods that are easily contaminated and cause problems to the public. Inspection of shops where milk is sold is of paramount importance. The milk should be safe and clean. It should be obtained from healthy cows as it can transmit bovine tuberculosis among other diseases. The room for handling milk should be clean, dustless and separate from the barn. The pails, cans, bottles, coolers and other equipment, which comes into contact with the milk, should be thoroughly cleaned.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Homes</h4>
                        <p>It is the responsibility of the community health nurse to share health messages with community members on food hygiene. These include maintenance of personal hygiene as covered earlier, that is cleaning the utensils, handling them with clean hands, and storing them in clean and dry cupboards or containers.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Farms</h4>
                        <p>The community should follow the regulations on the use of insecticides and pesticides in form of sprays and fertilizers. This will help them to use each of them correctly depending on the age of the crop. Your role as a community health nurse is to encourage the community to adhere to the instructions from the agricultural field educators. Moreover, instructions are given on the respective containers of these pesticides. You should teach the community about regulations of food storage and preservation of different types of food. The harvest should be carried out when the crops are completely ripe or ready to facilitate longer preservation. The cereals and legumes should be dried properly before storage to avoid spoilage. All perishable foods should be consumed at the right time.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Markets</h4>
                        <p>All types of foodstuffs are sold in markets. The markets should be designed in a manner that considers stations where similar types of food should be stored and sold, for example, vegetables of all kinds, dry foods like cereals, fruits and cooked foods. The market should be kept clean and proper refuse disposal maintained. The food sold should be clean and fit for human consumption. This, therefore, explains the importance of inspecting markets by public health officers. These officers have the power to close markets and condemn foods to prevent disease outbreaks.</p>

                        <p>Hotels, restaurants and food shops should also be inspected under hygiene regulations. They require regular inspection by the public health officers. All the food handlers should be supervised and a regular medical examination is mandatory for them to prevent spread of diseases through food handling. Licenses should only be given to hotel owners who have met the requirements. Laboratory examinations may be necessary for food such as pre-cooked meat. The use of uniforms, aprons, head coverings, as described earlier, should be observed in the hotels. Proper personal and environmental hygiene in the hotel premises should be maintained. The hotel should store, preserve, prepare, cook and serve the food according to public health regulations. The law also empowers closure of hotels which do not meet the regulations.</p>
