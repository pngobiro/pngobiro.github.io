                        <p>The provision of good housing is an essential aspect of environmental health. Good housing is a requirement for every human being because it provides shelter and protection from environmental hazards.</p>
                        <p>Think of some health problems that would be associated with the following poor housing conditions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Overcrowding and poor ventilation</li>
                            <li>Unscreened windows</li>
                            <li>Cooking fires on the floor</li>
                            <li>Earth walls and dirty floors</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="table-container">
                            <table class="content-table">
                                <thead>
                                    <tr><th>Housing Condition</th><th>Health Risk</th></tr>
                                </thead>
                                <tbody>
                                    <tr><td>Overcrowding and poor ventilation</td><td>Airborne droplet infections</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Unscreened windows</td><td>Malaria</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Cooking fires on the floor</td><td>Accidents and burns in children</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>Earth walls and dirty floors</td><td>Breeding of flies and bedbugs</td></tr>
                                </tbody>
                            </table>
                        </div>
                        <p>A combination of dampness, lack of light, poor ventilation and overcrowding will contribute to the spread of airborne and droplet infections. Earth floors and walls permit the entry and breeding of flies and bedbugs, while unscreened windows permit entry of mosquitoes.</p>
                        <p>Cooking fires on the floor are hazards to small children. Inadequate space to talk and play, especially in town houses, is one of the reasons why fathers and children leave home thereby adding to social problems. For these reasons it is important to improve the quality of housing. You can help your community live in safe houses, by making simple improvements using locally available materials.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe the types of houses</li>
                            <li>Describe the criteria for an adequate house</li>
                            <li>Describe a suitable building site</li>
                            <li>Describe the characteristics of poor housing</li>
                            <li>Describe how you would involve the community in improving housing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Types of Housing</h3>
                        <p>A house can be permanent, semi-permanent or temporary. These structures will be considered in turn.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Permanent Houses</h4>
                        <p>This type of house has a stone foundation, a cemented floor and plastered walls. The roof is covered with iron sheets, tiles or stones in the case of flats or maisonettes. This type of house has advantages in that it is easy to keep the floor and walls clean. However, the floor should be kept dry to avoid accidental falls. Permanent houses are not cheap to construct and it is necessary to budget for the activity.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Semi-Permanent Houses</h4>
                        <p>This is a type of house whereby the floor is usually cemented but does not necessarily have a stone foundation. The walls are made of iron sheets or sometimes timber. The house is iron roofed. If you work in a rural community then you must have come across this type of a house. It is satisfactory and easy to keep clean. However, appropriate preservatives for timbers have to be used or else termites destroy it. In many places mud bricks are used and they are an appropriate method of improving houses. Since it is less expensive than a permanent house, you have the responsibility of encouraging members of the community to try and acquire at least this type of a house.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Temporary Houses</h4>
                        <p>This type of house may be found in rural and slums areas. The floor is earthen, the walls are made of cardboard, polythene paper, grass or mud. The roof is thatched with the same material as the walls. This type of a house does not provide for privacy and can easily catch fire. Temporary houses are a health hazard and do not meet the requirements for good housing. They should be discouraged as much as possible.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Criteria for an Adequate House</h3>
                        <p>A good house should meet biological, physical and social criteria.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Biological Criteria</h4>
                        <p>Good housing minimises the risk of transmission of diseases. The spread of gastrointestinal infections is minimised by some important factors. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Good water supply</li>
                            <li>Good food storage, preservation and preparation</li>
                            <li>Adequate facilities for washing utensils and well-designed kitchens</li>
                            <li>Adequate methods of refuse disposal</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Physical Criteria</h4>
                        <p>The house should be safe for every occupant. This means that home accidents should be prevented. It is, therefore, necessary that appropriate safety devices be provided for. The house should also be free from air pollution.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Social Criteria</h4>
                        <p>Good housing should be designed to enable the family function effectively in regard to its cultural background. This means that the required privacy for adults should be catered for. It should have a suitable setting for bringing up children.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Characteristics of Adequate Housing</h3>
                        <p>The following are the characteristics of a good house.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Natural Light</h4>
                        <p>The sun provides natural light, which is essential for physical growth, especially in young children. Lighting is also essential for proper vision. The presence of sunlight into the house kills some micro-organisms. This underscores the need for sunlight in the house. Some insects are also driven away by adequate lighting.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Artificial Lighting</h4>
                        <p>This type of lighting is needed at night. The sources are electricity, oil lamps and gas. The type of lighting used should correspond to the purpose for which it is needed in the house.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ventilation</h4>
                        <p>Fresh air is necessary for our health. Ventilation of a house is the removal of impure air and pouring in pure air. This is achieved through windows and door ventilators. Good ventilation in the house is important, because it keeps the air on continuous movement without creating draught, cools the housing and maintains the room temperature at a constant.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Room Separation</h4>
                        <p>The house should have adequate rooms to provide separate accommodation for adults and children. The shelter for animals should be separate from the main house. There should also be separate rooms for food storage and preparation.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Others</h4>
                        <p>The house should have, where possible, cemented floor and plastered walls to protect against insects and should be rodent-proof. It should also have water supply in adequate and reliable quantity and quality. It should have a good latrine and a clean compound. It should be equipped with proper methods of refuse disposal, for example, composting, burning or burying waste. The house should be dry. The cooking arrangements should be satisfactory to avoid home accidents. Generally, there should be an effort to protect against all types of home accidents, for instance, those caused by fire, tools and chemicals.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Remember:</h4>
                            <p>It may not always be possible to meet all the necessary requirements for adequate housing. However, housing can be improved in a number of simple and practical ways.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Suitable Building Sites</h3>
                        <p>The following factors should be considered when selecting a suitable site for a house:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The soil should be suitable for construction.</li>
                            <li>The site should be dry, sunny and exposed to free air.</li>
                            <li>The surroundings should be hygienic and healthy.</li>
                            <li>The site should be away from noisy factories, cinema halls and heavy traffic.</li>
                            <li>It should be on high ground to avoid water from standing and stagnating. This will prevent breeding of mosquitoes.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Characteristics of Poor Housing</h3>
                        <p>A poor house does not protect its inhabitants from environmental hazards. It may have some or all the following negative characteristics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dampness</strong> due to poor drainage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overcrowding</strong> is a common feature in poor housing. This is due to an insufficient number of rooms. Dampness and overcrowding enhance the spread of common respiratory diseases such as colds, influenza, tuberculosis and pneumonia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Earthen floors and walls</strong> encourage breeding of fleas and bed bugs while unscreened windows encourage entry of mosquitoes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unprotected fire places</strong> with poor cooking arrangements cause home accidents with children. Working tools can cause accidents if not properly stored.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water supply and storage</strong>, which lacks hygiene, poses a health hazard for the transmission of water-borne diseases.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proper storage of clean utensils</strong> is often lacking in poor housing. This is accompanied by poor personal hygiene in the preparation and serving of food.</li>
                            <li><strong>The home environment may lack a good latrine</strong>, usually accompanied by improper excreta and inadequate refuse disposal. This increases the chances of getting hookworm infestation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compounds with tall grass, pools of water and sprawling litter</strong> may provide good breeding places for mosquitoes, rodents and other vectors responsible for transmission of many communicable diseases.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Community Involvement in Improving Housing</h3>
                        <p>It is very important to explain to the community the reasons they need to adopt new hygienic practices. If the members of the community are not well convinced, your environmental health measures will fail. This is because new practices mean a change in people's behaviour and they will not be willing to change unless they see personal advantages in it. Avoiding diseases, making more money or just being more comfortable are some of the advantages that must be emphasised to the community. You must make the new idea attractive. The following are only some ways of how to introduce change.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Find out what people think about the problem. Do they see it as a problem? If they do not, then you will have to help them understand that the problem exists and needs to be given attention.</li>
                            <li>Encourage them to think of possible solutions and guide them towards those that are technically possible and suitable for the situation. Encourage community participation.</li>
                            <li>Aim to set an example in your health facility or home.</li>
                            <li>Talk and work with people, encourage them to ask for advice or help in solving their problems, for example, inadequate water supplies, waste disposal, food safety regulations and hygiene, improved housing, controlling of vectors and pests.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The community would enjoy living in good housing. A little effort is needed to improve housing by using locally available resources.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sensitisation</h4>
                        <p>Sensitisation is the process of creating awareness. Community health nurses come in contact with the communities and should make use of these opportunities to share health messages with them. You should start at the health facility then extend your efforts to their homes. The health team will have conducted a community diagnosis so as to have valid information on the problem. The following steps can be followed when trying to involve the community.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Meeting the Health Team Members</h5>
                        <p>The first step involves planning to meet and explain the need for community involvement, with the health team members. Ensure that the relevant consultants and government officers dealing with housing are invited so that they can give pertinent information on housing matters according to the Housing Act. In this meeting, the health team members will deliberate on community sensitisation and identify ways of improving housing in the community. All the health team members should be committed to carrying out their plans for solving the housing problem.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Sharing Health Messages Daily at the Health Facility about Improving Housing</h5>
                        <p>The second step will be to start sensitising the community at the primary health care facility. This will be accomplished by sharing health messages on improved housing. In this way, the patients and clients will get pertinent information on types of houses, criteria for adequate housing, effects of housing on health, characteristics of poor housing and diseases associated with poor housing. This will make the community aware of the problem and the need to improve housing for the family.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Meeting the Community Leaders</h5>
                        <p>The third step is where the community health nurse organises to meet and go over the subject with the community leaders of the area. These leaders include formal leaders in government offices, for example, the District Commissioner, the District Officer, Chief and Assistant Chief. The informal leaders, such as opinion leaders, community own resource persons, leaders of women, men and youth groups should also be involved. Moreover, you should target community-based health workers, traditional birth attendants and community-based distributors of family planning. These leaders will be aware of the problem and the need for improved housing in their community. They will identify and suggest ways of improvement. You should be able to guide them on the techniques of carrying out the health activities. You may use clinical records to confirm the health problem and the need for community involvement.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Identifying Ways of Improvement</h5>
                        <p>Through the previously-mentioned meetings and activities, the health team and the community leaders will identify many ways of improving housing. From their list they will select the best alternative and then plan and organise their resources, that is, manpower, money, materials, and time to carry out the selected activities. Some of these activities will be the provision of outreach clinic services. During the clinic session, the same content on improved housing will be covered in the health messages. During home visits, the nurse, public health technician and community-based health worker should inspect the houses and focus on simple practical ways of improvement. This will enhance the implementation as the solutions are being provided directly at home. A school health service is another community health activity where this knowledge may be imparted for the children to share with their parents. The community health nurse, with her team members, conducts regular supervisory visits to the centres of communitybased health care activities. These supportive visits help the groups to build their selfconfidence and improve their skills. They are encouraged to explore solutions to their housing problems. They also encourage mutual respect and understanding between the health team and community members.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Evaluation of Housing Activities</h5>
                        <p>After the implementation of the housing activities it will be necessary to evaluate the extent of community participation. Community participation builds the confidence of the community members. It enables the members to examine their situation.</p>
                        <p>You are able to obtain information from reports on home visiting, outreach clinic services, also from the public health technician and community-based health workers. The reports can be gathered from the community's formal leaders. The Ministry of Housing will also give their reports.</p>
                        <p>Finally, the patients and clients will also be interviewed on improved housing. It will be necessary for the nurse to carry out a community survey in the area to assess the community participation. This will be carried out at the time suggested for evaluation. The questionnaire will include all the necessary aspects of housing and focusing on new improvements. The findings of this survey will be communicated to the community leaders and the community. This will enable the community to take appropriate action.</p>
