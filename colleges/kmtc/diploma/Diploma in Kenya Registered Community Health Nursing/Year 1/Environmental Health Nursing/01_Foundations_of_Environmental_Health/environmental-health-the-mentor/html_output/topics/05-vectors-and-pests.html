                        <p>This is the final section of unit three. In this section you will learn about vectors and pests.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Objectives</h3>
                        <p>By the end of this section you will be able to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Describe diseases associated with vectors and pests</li>
                            <li>Describe methods of control of vectors and pests</li>
                            <li>Describe how you will involve the community in the control process</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diseases Associated With Vectors</h3>
                        <p>A vector is an organism, usually an insect, which transmits a pathogen from a source of infection to a susceptible host. Insects are controlled because of the role they play in disease transmission, destruction of food and building materials. To control vectors you have to deprive them of suitable breeding places, food and harbour.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mechanical Transmission</h4>
                        <p>In this mode of transmission, the vector carries the infective pathogen or agent on its body or limbs. Alternatively, the infective agent may be ingested by the vector and excreted unchanged in its faeces.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Biological Transmission</h4>
                        <p>The vector acquires the infective agent from the blood or skin tissue of the infected host and the infective organism undergoes some development in the vector. The infective vector may also inoculate the infective agent from its salivary secretion into a new host to cause disease, for example, in the transmission of malaria.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Contamination of Skin or Mucous Membranes</h4>
                        <p>The host may be infected through contamination of skin or mucous membranes by the infective faeces of the vector, for example, louse borne relapsing fever.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Ingestion</h4>
                        <p>The host may acquire infection by ingesting the vector, for example, guinea worm.</p>

                        <p>A pest is an organism, which in a given circumstance adversely affects human health or the economy. Rats and mice are pests and they belong to a group of animals called rodents. Insects such as white ants, weevils, aphids are also pests. Pests have to be numerous in order to cause a serious problem.</p>
                        <p>Insecticides and pesticides are used to eliminate pest infestations. The safest and the most economical methods available are used.</p>

This is transmitted to humans through eating food contaminated with faeces or urine from an infected rodent, bathing in contaminated water or handling infected rats or excreta from rodents.<br>5. A bite from an infected rodent causes a rat bite fever. Their noise is a nuisance in the houses.</td></tr>
                                </tbody>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Methods of Pest Control</h3>
                        <p>The following methods may be used to control pest infestations.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Personal Hygiene</h4>
                        <p>This includes thorough hand washing, which should be practised before preparing or eating food and after visiting the toilet. Short and clean nails should be kept and a daily bath should be taken. Wearing of shoes will prevent infestation by jiggers and hookworms. The hair should be kept short and clean. The use of shampoo, which has a suitable insecticide, is helpful for cases of head lice.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clothing</h4>
                        <p>Clothing should be washed at least once a week and ironed.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bedding</h4>
                        <p>Bedding should be cleaned thoroughly at least weekly and dried well in the sun. If infested with mites and lice it should be boiled and ironed, in order to kill them.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Food</h4>
                        <p>Food stores, cupboards and tables should be kept clean. All foodstuffs should be covered to prevent flies gaining access to them. All food utensils should be kept clean and dry. Make use of the improved methods of preservation of food that have previously been covered.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Environmental Hygiene</h4>
                        <p>The following factors should be considered.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Drainage of Water</h5>
                        <p>The aim of proper water drainage is to destroy all mosquito-breeding sites. Drain any stagnant water or slow moving water around the house. All holes and ditches should be filled to avoid standing water. All receptacles likely to retain water, for example, used cans and tins, bottles, coconut husks, vehicle tyres and so on should be collected and properly disposed of. Slow moving streams should be canalised to facilitate faster water flow. Roof gutters should be cleared regularly to prevent blockage of water flow by leaves and other materials. Clearing of the vegetation around the buildings, and water banks removes damp areas where mosquitoes breed.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Cleanliness</h5>
                        <p>The home or village environment should be kept clean. Animal shelters should be at a reasonable distance away from the main house.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Waste and Excreta Disposal</h5>
                        <p>This should follow the proper methods of waste disposal as described in section two of this unit.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Improved Housing</h4>
                        
                        <h5>Floors and Walls</h5>
                        <p>These should be cemented so that they can easily be swept and washed. The floors should be cleaned after meals to clear all the food on the floor. All the crevices and cracks in the walls and floors should be plastered.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Beds and Other Furniture</h5>
                        <p>People should not sleep on the floor but on raised beds. Beds and mattresses should be regularly taken outside in the sun to kill any lice, mites and bed bugs. Boiling water can be poured on the bed stands for the same purpose. Joineries of furniture with cracks and crevices should be filled up with plastic wood filler.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Buildings and Food Stores</h5>
                        <p>Rat proof buildings and food stores should be constructed. In malaria areas, buildings should be mosquito proof, with wire gauze to cover all ventilation openings, doors and windows. Buildings should be inspected regularly for pests.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Use of Chemical Substances such as Pesticides and Insecticides</h4>
                        <p>Chemicals used to kill the pests are in the form of insecticide sprays, dusting powders, miticides, rodenticides, emulsions, oils and molluscides.</p>
                        <p>Farmers are advised on the safe use of pesticides, for example, spraying vegetables such as cabbages, tomatoes, sukumawiki (kale) and spinach. There are instructions on the containers of these pesticides, which indicate the right age of the plant for specific use of a pesticide. Precautions are also given concerning protective clothing and washing after using the chemicals.</p>
                        <p>After harvesting, the cereals and legumes are dried in the sun and then treated with pesticides in the form of dust or powder. This protects the grains against pests for at least six months.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Remember:</h4>
                            <p>Crop production should follow the rules of agricultural practice, which involves spraying crops against pests.</p>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <p>For cats, dogs and cows, the appropriate insecticide is used to dust or wash them regularly to kill any fleas and ticks. Rodents are controlled by the use of rodenticides, which are available in most shops, for example, Rat & Rat, Rat Rid, Fuko Kill and so on. The floors and walls of houses may also be treated with insecticides regularly. Mattresses and bedsteads can be treated in the same way. Heavily infested buildings should be treated with residual insecticidal sprays. Kerosene is also used to kill bed bugs and white ants when worked into cracks and crevices by use of an applicator like a feather. Insecticides and larvicides in the form of oils and emulsion are sprayed on the water surface to kill insects in water.</p>
                        <p>Molluscides may be applied in water to kill the snails, which spread schistosomiasis.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Community Involvement</h3>
                        <p>Community health nurses and other health workers have the responsibility to share health messages in the community. This facilitates community participation in keeping the environment safe.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) Identification of Resources</h4>
                        <p>You can conduct a community diagnosis. Make an effort to utilise the skills of, and work with the agricultural field officers in the community. Identify the shops or chemists where community members can buy agro-chemicals, for example, rodenticides, insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers. You should also identify and utilise co-operative societies depending on the crops grown in the region, for example, tea, coffee, horticulture, pyrethrum, grains and cereals.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ii) Utilisation of Insecticides</h4>
                        <p>The health team will meet with community leaders including the agricultural field officers. This meeting would be most effective in a chief's baraza where many community members will be present. This will serve to give the implementers, that is, the health and agricultural officers and the community a big moral boost. They will gain confidence in the utilisation of agro-chemicals. The information can also be distributed as the officers visit the homes during their fieldwork.</p>
