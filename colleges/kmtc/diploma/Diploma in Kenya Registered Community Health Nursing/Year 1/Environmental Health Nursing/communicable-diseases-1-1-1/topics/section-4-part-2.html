                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is a disfiguring disease caused by a tiny worm (nematode) called <dfn>wuchereria bancrofti</dfn>. It is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes; the <dfn>culex quinquefasciatus</dfn> found in heavily contaminated water especially in the urban areas and the <dfn>culex pipiens</dfn> and the anopheles mosquito in rural areas. These mosquitoes transmit the worm from person to person in the same way as malaria. The parasitic worm lives in the lymphatic system of the patient causing inflammation of the lymphatic vessels and lymph glands (<dfn>lymphangitis</dfn>, <dfn>lymphadenitis</dfn>), <dfn>filarial fever</dfn>, and eventually <dfn>elephantiasis</dfn> of the arms, legs and genitals. The disease is most frequent in the tropical coastal belts and the lake region.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>The <dfn>microfilariae</dfn> ingested by the feeding mosquito exsheath in the stomach and become first stage larva. They then penetrate the mosquito stomach wall and migrate to the thorax muscles where they moult twice and develop into the infective stage.</p>
                        <p>Mature infective microfilariae migrate to the mouthparts of the mosquito. The extrinsic incubation period takes 10-12 days.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>The presence of mature filarial worms in the lymphatic vessels triggers an inflammatory reaction in the walls of these vessels. When the worms die, more foreign proteins are released causing calcification of the lymphatic walls which eventually leads to obstruction of the flow of lymph fluid. If the obstruction of the lymph flow is extensive, chronic oedema develops in the affected areas of the body. Filariasis progresses through three stages.</p>

                        <p><dfn>Yellow fever</dfn> is an acute viral disease transmitted to human being by the <dfn>aedes aegypti</dfn> mosquito. Yellow fever can spread rapidly, and case fatality rate may reach as high as $30\%$ in non-immune populations. Yellow fever is a disease of forest monkeys (zoonoses) and is transmitted among them by the <dfn>aedes africanus</dfn> mosquito. Humans may be bitten outside the forest by mosquitoes which have acquired the disease from monkeys feeding on bananas and other agricultural plantations. In urban areas, yellow fever is transmitted by the <dfn>aedes aegypti</dfn>. Yellow fever is a disease of tropical African countries, especially in the rain forests.</p>

                        <p>Yellow fever like most other viral haemorrhagic diseases has no specific drug for treatment. You only give supportive treatment and ensure that the patient is nursed in strict isolation using ordinary barrier nursing techniques. You also ensure that the patient has no further contact with the mosquitoes through the use of insecticide treated bed nets and ensuring that the room is well screened. This is to prevent further spread of the disease from the patient to other healthy people.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Trypanosomiasis</dfn> is a tropical disease caused by protozoa called <dfn>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</dfn> (Tbg) and <dfn>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</dfn> (Tbr). The important reservoir of Tbr in the wild is the bushbuck. Trypanosomiasis affects both humans and cattle and is invariably fatal over varying periods of time if not treated.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</dfn> causes an acute, rapidly progressive illness with death from cardiac complications within several weeks or months. Reservoirs include antelope and pigs. Tbr is found in eastern Africa, now mostly in south-east Uganda.</p>
                        <p>Trypanasomiasis spreads very rapidly unless the source (the very first case) is identified early, isolated and treated properly. Trypanasomiasis is found in the same areas in Africa where yellow fever is found.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Trypanosomiasis</dfn> is transmitted by <dfn>tsetse flies</dfn> which live in areas of wooded vegetation. Tsetse flies are usually not found in flat plains, closely cultivated areas or areas densely inhabited by people. There are two important types of tsetse flies known to transmit the disease to humans. There is <dfn>glossina palpalis</dfn>, a riverine type which breeds along rivers and lakes, and <dfn>glossina morsitans</dfn> the woodland type which lives away from water. <dfn>glossina palpalis</dfn> is the main vector of Tb gambiense, while <dfn>glossina morsitans</dfn> is the main vector for Tb rhodesiense and it prefers to bite cattle and game but will also bite humans. Of the two types of tsetse flies, <dfn>glossina palpalis</dfn> (which transmit Tb gambiense parasite) is the main vector in East Africa.</p>
                        <p>Tsetse flies become infected with sleeping sickness parasites when they take a blood meal from infected persons or animals. After a period of time, during which the trypanosomes undergo development changes, the fly is able to transmit the infection when it bites another susceptible animal or person.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>There is considerable variation in the clinical picture of African trypanosomiasis (AT). Within a few days of a tsetse bite, fever develops due to the invasion of the blood stream by the trypanosomes. The incubation period between the tsetse bite and the onset of fever varies from as short as a few hours following the chancre to several weeks. The early stages of trypanosomiasis are characterised by irregular episodes of fever with headaches, malaise, weight loss, muscle and joint pains, pruritus, anaemia, skin rash, and deep hyperaesthesia (Karandel's sign).</p>
                        <p>The clinical features of trypanosomiasis depend on the infecting parasite as follows:</p>

                        <p><dfn>Trypanosomiasis</dfn> presents in the following three stages:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Primary Stage (chancre stage)</h4>
                        <p>Within a few days of the tsetse bite, a painful indurated erythematous nodule may appear at the site of the bite. This <dfn>chancre</dfn> may last for one to two weeks and then resolve spontaneously. The chancre occurs in 70\% of cases in Europeans but is rare in Africans.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blood Stage (systemic illness)</h4>
                        <p>During this stage, the trypanosomes spread to the blood, lymph and lymph nodes. There is fever, which does not follow any typical pattern but recurs at intervals of days or weeks. After the fever resolves, the patient develops anaemia, debilitation and general body weakness. The spleen becomes enlarged as well as the lymph nodes. The cervical lymph nodes especially of the lower back of neck become visibly enlarged in 80\% of patients - this is called <dfn>Winterbottom's sign</dfn>. The other signs and symptoms of trypanosomiasis include:</p>

                        <p>This is the terminal stage of trypanosomiasis. During this stage of the disease, the parasites invade the brain leading to mental deterioration and coma. Convulsions and localised signs such as hemiplegia and facial palsy may occur. Patients are very weak, they sleep during the day but are restless at night. As the disease progresses, the patients become severely ill and die if not treated.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This disease is commonly known as <dfn>Bilharzia</dfn> after Theodor Bilharz who discovered it in Cairo in 1861. The incidence of <dfn>schistosomiasis</dfn> is related to water use. Irrigation schemes or water projects for electricity provide the habitat for the snail vectors. Up to 75\% of schistosomiasis is transmitted by infected humans while 25\% is said to be transmitted by dogs, cows, rats, and baboons. In East Africa, there are two types of schistosomiasis, both of which are named after the causative parasite. They are <dfn>schistosoma mansoni</dfn> and <dfn>schistosoma haematobium</dfn>.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p><dfn>S. mansoni</dfn> is spread in infected stool while <dfn>S. haematobium</dfn> is spread in infected urine. When the schistosome eggs in the urine enter a body of water such as a lake, dam, rice paddy or pond, they hatch into free-swimming larvae called <dfn>miracidia</dfn>. The intermediate host for <dfn>S. mansoni</dfn> is a vector snail of the genus <dfn>biomphalaria pfeifferi</dfn>; while for the <dfn>S . haematobium</dfn> it is <dfn>bulinus africanus</dfn>. The miracidia, after being shed from the ovum, must enter the appropriate snail host within 24 hours or die.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transmission Cycle of Schistosomiasis</h3>
                        <p>Inside the body of the snail host, it takes the miracidia four to seven days to develop and multiply into numerous infective <dfn>cercariae</dfn>.</p>
                        <p>The snail sheds them in water where they can only live for 48 hours unless they infect a human. A human being becomes infected when they enter cercariae-infested water, such as when bathing, swimming, laundering, cultivating or fishing.</p>

                        <p>The cercariae penetrate the skin and enter the bloodstream from where they are carried to the liver or bladder to develop into adult worms. Within four to six weeks, paired adults reach mesenteric and pelvic veins.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Schistosomiasis</dfn> as a disease develops in four stages, each of which is characterised by specific signs and symptoms.</p>

                        <p>The diagnosis of <dfn>schistosomiasis</dfn> is confirmed by finding eggs in stools or urine during a microscopic examination. If this test is found to be negative, a colonic or urinary bladder biopsy can be done. Serological tests are also highly sensitive and yield specific results.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>The zoonotic hosts of <dfn>leishmaniasis</dfn> are mainly dogs and rodents, although in some parts of Kenya humans have become the reservoir as well as host. The parasites of leishmaniasis are transmitted when the sandfly bites an infected person and ingests <dfn>amastigotes</dfn>. On reaching the sandfly's stomach, the amastigotes change into <dfn>promastigotes</dfn>. After four to seven days, they migrate to the foregut where they develop into infective promastigotes. The infective promastigotes are then conveyed in the saliva of the sandfly during feeding.</p>
                        <p>During feeding, the sandfly tears the host's tissue to feed on blood and at the same time deposits infective promastigotes at that site. From here the promastigotes enter the bloodstream and into the <dfn>macrophages</dfn>. On entering the macrophages, the parasites escape detection by the body's defences and are spread to various body tissues.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Visceral Leishmaniasis</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Visceral leishmaniasis</dfn> is found in many areas of the North Eastern region of Kenya in Machakos, Kitui, Masinga, Tseikuru (Mwingi), Makueni, Kibwezi, and Wajir.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features of Visceral Leishmaniasis</h4>
                        <p><dfn>Visceral leishmaniasis</dfn> is characterised by fever, <dfn>splenomegaliy</dfn>, <dfn>hepatomegally</dfn> accompanied by anaemia and weight loss. Visceral leishmaniasis has a rather long incubation period of four to ten months or longer, before definitive signs and symptoms manifest. Most of the patients ($96\%$) are killed by secondary bacterial infections of the lesions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features of Visceral Leishmaniasis</h4>
                        <p><dfn>Visceral leishmaniasis</dfn> is characterised by fever, <dfn>splenomegaliy</dfn>, <dfn>hepatomegally</dfn> accompanied by anaemia and weight loss. Visceral leishmaniasis has a rather long incubation period of four to ten months or longer, before definitive signs and symptoms manifest. Most of the patients ($96\%$) are killed by secondary bacterial infections of the lesions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Cutaneous leishmaniasis</dfn> is found in West Pokot, Turkana, Baringo, Laikipia and Kerio valley. It is characterised by single or several painful chronic ulcers in those parts of the body exposed to sandfly bites, such as arms, legs or face. In the lower hotter areas of Kenya such as Baringo, the vector is the <dfn>P. orientalis</dfn>, while in the highlands of Kenya, the high altitude sandflies, <dfn>P. longipes</dfn> and <dfn>P. pedifer</dfn> are the vectors. <dfn>Phlebotomus longipes</dfn> bites human beings in their houses at night transmitting the parasite <dfn>leishmania aethiopica</dfn>, which is responsible for <dfn>cutaneous leishmaniasis</dfn>.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Picture of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</h4>
                        <p>In about two to eight weeks following a bite from an infected sand fly, a small itchy papule appears at the site of the bite. Over several weeks, the papule grows in size expanding to form a single indolent ulcer or multiple ulcers. The disease may be mistaken for leprosy. There may be enlargement of the local lymph nodes. The lesions begin to heal spontaneously two to twelve months later. Cutaneous leishmaniasis does not spread to other body organs.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</h3>
                        <p>Small lesions may be treated surgically by curettage or by freezing, using liquid carbon dioxide or by infiltrating them with $1-2 \text{ ml}$ sodium stibogluconate. Large disfiguring or multiple skin lesions are treated in the same way as for visceral leishmaniasis using IV or IM sodium stibogluconate <span class="math-inline">$20 \text{ mg/kg}$</span> daily for 20 30 days. The drug of choice for visceral leishmaniasis caused by <dfn>leishmania aethiopica</dfn> is IM pentamidine isothianate $3-4 \text{ mg/kg}$ once or twice a week.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis</h3>
                        <p>This form of <dfn>leishmaniasis</dfn> occurs primarily in the tropics of South America. The disease begins with the same sores noted in localized cutaneous leishmaniasis. Sometimes these primary lesions heal, other times they spread and become larger. Some years after the first lesion is noted (and sometimes several years after that lesion has totally healed), new lesions appear in the mouth and nose, and occasionally in the area between the genitalia and the anus (the perineum). These new lesions are particularly destructive and painful. They erode underlying tissue and cartilage, frequently eating through the septum (the cartilage which separates the two nostrils). If the lesions spread to the roof of the mouth and the larynx (the part of the wind pipe which contains the vocal cords), they may prevent speech. Other symptoms include fever, weight loss, anaemia (low red blood cell count). There is always a large danger of bacteria infecting the already open sores.</p>
                        <p>Treatment is similar to that of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Prevention or early detection and appropriate treatment are preferred. Corrective surgery can be done where need arises.</p>

                        <p>This is a highly infectious disease caused by bacteria called <dfn>yersinia pestis</dfn>. <dfn>Plague</dfn> is a disease of rodents, especially rats and is spread from rat to rat by a rat flea called <dfn>xenopsylla cheopis</dfn>. Plague is a very rare but serious disease because it can spread very rapidly unless the first case is recognised early and appropriate action taken. It is also a serious disease with a high mortality rate (case fatality rate in the absence of treatment can be as high as 60\%).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Plague</dfn> occurs when infected wild rats, especially the sewer rat (<dfn>R. norvegicus</dfn>) die from the disease and their fleas look for substitute domestic rat (<dfn>rattus italia</dfn>) hosts. The domestic rat becomes infected and after it dies the fleas start biting human beings. When the first human is infected, the disease causes <dfn>bubonic plague</dfn>. People working in the fields may also be bitten by fleas from the dead infected wild rats and develop bubonic plague.</p>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The <dfn>louse-borne relapsing fever</dfn> is spread by the human head louse, <dfn>pediculus capitis</dfn>, and the body louse, <dfn>pediculus corporis</dfn>. They transmit spirochaetes of the genus <dfn>borrelia reccurentis</dfn>. The <dfn>tick-borne relapsing fever</dfn> is transmitted by soft ticks (<dfn>ornithodoros moubata</dfn>) which live in cracks and crevices of walls and floors. They transmit spirochaetes of the genus <dfn>borrelia duttoni</dfn>, which cause tick-borne relapsing fever. Children, visitors and pregnant women travelling to endemic areas are more susceptible to the disease. Adults in endemic areas are semi-immune to relapsing fever.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>The disease is transmitted from person to person by the bite of the head louse, body louse or soft tick.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Louse-borne</h4>
                        <p>The human louse transmits <dfn>louse-borne relapsing fever</dfn> from person to person. When the louse feeds on the blood of an infected person, it takes up the bacteria. The bacteria multiply within the body of the louse (but these spirochaete are not found in the saliva or the excreta of the louse). The infection is transmitted to another person only when the louse is crushed on the body surface near a bite wound. The offspring of an infected louse does not carry the spirochaetes. Epidemics of louse-borne relapsing fever are associated with times of war and famine when refugees are crowded together in unsanitary conditions, which promote infestation with human body lice.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tick-borne</h4>
                        <p><dfn>Tick-borne relapsing fever</dfn> is transmitted when a tick sucks blood from an infected person. The spirochaetes are taken up and multiply in the tick's body. In seven days, the spirochaetes appear in the tick's salivary glands and the coxal fluid ready to be transmitted to a new host. The organisms can either be injected directly when the tick feeds on the host, or they can infect a new host by penetrating intact mucous membranes (for example in laboratory infections). Unlike in louse-borne fever where the offspring does not carry the organism, in tick-borne fever the <dfn>borrelia duttoni</dfn> organisms pass into the ovary of the tick, thus automatically infecting the offspring of the ticks (vertical transmission). In this way, a house once inhabited by infected ticks will remain dangerous for up to ten years. In an infected pregnant woman, the spirochaete can cross the placenta to the foetus resulting either in abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery, or congenital infection in the newborn.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>The patient presents with sudden onset of fever which ranges between <span class="math-inline">$39.5^{\circ}\text{C}-40.5^{\circ}\text{C}$</span>. There is rapid pulse, headache, aching joints, vomiting and infected conjunctiva. Often there is potential rash, epistaxis, and herpes labialis. After five to seven days, the temperature drops by crisis. In about $60\%$ of the patients, a less severe relapse of the symptoms occurs five to ten days after the first attack. A second relapse may occur in about $25\%$ of the patients. In untreated cases, there may be up to ten relapses. The fever and clinical symptoms become less severe each time after the relapse. <dfn>Relapsing fever</dfn> has a high mortality rate of 40\%. Common complications of relapsing fever include meningitis, iritis, optic nerve atrophy (blindness), myocarditis and liver failure bleeding.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>You can confirm <dfn>relapsing fever</dfn> by doing a microscopic examination of a thick blood smear for the spirochaetes.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>Treatment should eradicate the spirochaete from the body without eliciting <dfn>Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction</dfn>. Some deaths occur after starting treatment as a result of a severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The antibiotics suddenly kill a large number of spirochaetes which release toxins into the circulation causing the patient to collapse. This reaction is characterised by chills, rapid breathing, elevated temperature (<span class="math-inline">$40-42^{\circ}\text{C}$</span>), confusion, delirium, and sometimes convulsions and coma. The patient then develops very severe hypotension, and may go into heart failure. This complication is however not seen in tick-borne infections. Patients must be nursed flat, given adequate fluids and be confined to bed for at least 24 hours.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Onchocerciasis</dfn> is a chronic disease caused by a filarial worm called <dfn>onchocerca volvulus</dfn>. It lives in the subcutaneous and connective tissue of the infected person. It manifests mainly as skin nodules on bony surfaces, and causes eye lesions which result in blindness. That is why it is also known as <dfn>river blindness</dfn>. The vector for <dfn>O . volvulus</dfn> is the female <dfn>black fly</dfn> of the genus <dfn>simulium</dfn>. In western African countries where the disease is more prevalent, the vector is <dfn>simulium damnosum</dfn>, while in East Africa the vector is <dfn>simulium neavei</dfn>. The disease is found in western Uganda, southern Sudan, and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Blackflies are able to travel up to 80 km in a day.</p>
                        <p>The <dfn>simulium</dfn> fly breeds in fast running well aerated rivers or turbulent areas of a river such as at the waterfalls and rapids. The eggs of the <dfn>simulium</dfn> fly are able to develop into larvae only in water that is rich in oxygen, such as fast flowing rivers. Larvae are attached to submerged plants, rocks and living crabs. The female <dfn>O . volvulus</dfn> worm is only about 0.3 mm in diameter but can be as long as half a meter (<span class="math-inline">$50 \text{ cm}$</span>) long. The male is about 0.2 mm in diameter and <span class="math-inline">$4-13 \text{ cm}$</span> long.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>River blindness is spread from person to person by the bite of an infected blackfly. Black flies feed during the day both inside and outside houses. They usually bite early in the morning or late in the evening. The blackfly takes up microfilariae when it sucks the blood of an infected person. Once in the stomach, the microfilariae penetrate the stomach wall and travel to the thoracic muscles where they develop further for about seven days. They then move to the head of the fly ready to be transmitted to the next susceptible person when the fly feeds.</p>
                        <p>When the fly bites again, it injects the larvae of <dfn>O . volvulus</dfn> into the skin of the healthy host. The larvae mature in the human subcutaneous tissue into adult worms in about one to three years.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>After the adult <dfn>O. volvulus</dfn> has lived in the body of an infected person for about one year, it begins to give birth to microfilariae. One adult female worm can produce up to one million microfilariae every year. The microfilariae of <dfn>O.volvulus</dfn> have a strong liking for the skin and eyes of the infected host. Adult worms live up to 17 years in nodules in the subcutaneous and connective tissue. Most nodules are found on the bony skin surface such as the elbow, skull, ribs, iliac, crests, and shoulder scapula. The disease has four different clinical presentations:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Severe Itching</h4>
                        <p>This is one of the early symptoms and mainly affects the buttocks. The severe itching is often accompanied by skin depigmentation giving rise to a 'leopard skin'.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Skin Nodules</h4>
                        <p>These are caused by the adult worms which you saw earlier like to live in the skin. They contain adult worms and are painless, rubbery, and firm; ranging in diameter from $3 \text{ mm}-3 \text{ cm}$.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dermatitis</h4>
                        <p>This is caused by a reaction to the presence of microfilariae in the epidermis and manifests as itchy papules and macules. Later, the skin becomes loose, scaly, atrophic and depigmented.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Blindness</h4>
                        <p>This is caused by the presence of microfilariae in the cornea and the anterior chamber of the eye. It starts with oedema of conjunctiva; then corneal spots and a pannus begin to develop. Finally cataracts, iritis, sclerosing keratitis, and glaucoma develop leading to blindness. You can differentiate between trachoma and river blindness because in river blindness the pannus start at the lower limbus, while in trachoma it affects the upper limbus.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>The diagnosis is made by examining skin snips from the thighs, buttocks and iliac crests under a microscope for microfilariae.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Onchocerciasis</dfn> is not a fatal disease. If the patient has no serious complaints and is likely to be reinfected, there is no urgency for treatment, since the traditional drugs used have been known to cause severe reactions. However, the following groups of patients do need treatment:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">

                        </ul>
                        <p>Two types of treatment are used in the management of this disease. The first one is to kill the microfilariae. Give the patient oral <dfn>Ivermectine</dfn> (mectizan) <span class="math-inline">$150 \text{ microgram/kg}$</span> single dose repeated once every six to twelve months. The second type of treatment is aimed at killing or removing the adult worms by surgical resection of the nodules.</p>
