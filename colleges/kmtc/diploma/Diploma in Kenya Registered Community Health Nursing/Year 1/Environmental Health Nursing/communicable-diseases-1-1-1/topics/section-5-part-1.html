                        <p>Diseases caused by faecal-oral contamination are those whose causative organisms are excreted in the stool of an infected person and then, by various ways, enter the mouth of a susceptible person. Water that looks clean to the eye may be dangerously polluted. Contaminated food may look, smell and taste delicious and yet harbour dangerous organisms. Food and water transmits diseases if contaminated by infected hands, soil, flies, animals, animal products or polluted water. Flies transmit diseases by vomiting on food or by carrying pathogens from faeces and transferring them to food. Indeed, most of the primary diarrhoeal diseases are caused by direct contamination of food or water by faeces, through flies and fingers.</p>

                        <p><dfn>Enteric fevers</dfn> include <dfn>typhoid fever</dfn> and <dfn>paratyphoid A and B fevers</dfn>. <dfn>Typhoid fever</dfn> is an infectious disease characterised by high continuous fever, malaise and involvement of lymphoid tissue and spleen. Diarrhoea is not a common symptom in typhoid fever.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Paratyphoid fever</dfn> may present like typhoid fever, but in most cases it presents as gastroenteritis or transient diarrhoea. Both are mainly spread by the faecal-oral route through contaminated food, water and milk. Flies are also important in the transmission of enteric fevers.</p>
                        <p>You will now consider each type of disease in turn.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Typhoid Fever</h3>
                        <p>This is an infectious bacterial disease caused by <dfn>salmonella typhi</dfn>.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Typhoid fever</dfn> is endemic in many regions of East Africa, although epidemic outbreaks have occurred when a source of water or food used by many people has been contaminated.</p>
                        <p>The disease has a case fatality rate of $3\%$ with treatment and $10\%$ without adequate antibiotic treatment. Human beings are the only known reservoir and host.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>The incubation period of <dfn>typhoid fever</dfn> is 7-21 days. The disease has a gradual onset which progresses through the following four stages.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">First Week</h4>
                        <p>During the first week and early in the disease, the patient has severe headache, malaise, loss of appetite, body pains and aches and a tendency to nose-bleed.</p>
                        <p>The body temperature rises day by day or in steps to <span class="math-inline">$39.5^{\circ}\text{C}$</span> or higher. Most patients cough because they develop bronchitis and may also complain of constipation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Second Week</h4>
                        <p>In the second week, temperature continues to rise, but the pulse rate is slower than would be expected for that temperature. There is swelling of lymphoid tissue in the intestines as well as <dfn>Peyer's patches</dfn>, necrosis and ulcers, which cause the abdomen to become distended and tender.</p>
                        <p>The high temperature and toxaemia causes mental confusion and disorientation in the patient. Half the patients may develop greenish watery ('pea-soup') diarrhoea and broncho-pneumonia.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Third Week</h4>
                        <p>Body temperature decreases step by step and the patient improves slowly. If there is no improvement, the Peyer's patches in the intestines perforate and toxaemia increases.</p>
                        <p>The patient becomes delirious and incontinent of urine and stool, muscles twitch and coma may precede death.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Fourth Week</h4>
                        <p>For the patients who do not suffer the serious complications of the third week, the fourth week is a period of convalescence.</p>
                        <p>The temperature drops back to normal and the patient recovers gradually.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>The best way to diagnose <dfn>typhoid fever</dfn> is through a blood culture. This may be positive during the first week and for a variable period after this. Stool and urine cultures can also be made although they are only positive after the first week. Other tests which are undertaken include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item">
                                <span class="item-icon">‚Ä¢</span>
                                <span class="item-text"><dfn>Widal test</dfn> during the first and second week, that is indicative of high and rising titres</span>
                            </li>
                            <li class="list-item">

                            </li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>How reliable is the Widal test in typhoid diagnosis?</p>
                        <p>Although the <dfn>Widal test</dfn> is still very useful, especially when two tests are performed four to five days apart after the end of the first week, its interpretation is full of difficulties especially in endemic areas and in people who have had the typhoid vaccine. That is why it is a good idea to also carry out one of the other laboratory tests.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The treatment of <dfn>typhoid fever</dfn> includes the following:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Cholera</dfn> is an intestinal disease which is characterised by sudden onset of profuse watery stools and vomiting, leading to severe dehydration, acidosis and circulatory collapse.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Epidemiology of Cholera</h3>
                        <p>It is caused by a small comma-shaped motile organism called <dfn>vibrio cholerae</dfn>. There are about four substrains of the cholera vibrio, namely, El Tor, Ogawa, Luaba and Hikojima. The El Tor sub-strain causes cholera epidemics in East Africa.</p>
                        <p>Cholera is transmitted through the faecal-oral route, mostly by water which has been contaminated with faecal matter. The vibrios are very sensitive to the hydrochloric acid found in the human stomach, and so a large number of organisms must be ingested for infection to occur.</p>
                        <p>Cholera occurs in all parts of the world where the living conditions are unsanitary.</p>
                        <p>The human being is the reservoir and host. Vibrios prefer brackish (salty) water. In seawater, the organisms can live even longer multiplying in crabs and shrimps. Vibrios also multiply in certain foods such as milk and boiled rice.</p>
                        <p>What is the role and importance of carriers?</p>
                        <p>The reservoir of infection in <dfn>cholera</dfn> is formed mainly by the <dfn>carriers</dfn>. For every clinical case of cholera there may be 50-100 asymptomatic carriers. Although the carriers excrete a smaller number of vibrios than the patients, they form the greatest danger to the community because of their sheer number and freedom of movement.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Cholera</dfn> has a short incubation period of two to three days. The vibrios remain in the digestive tract from where they cause water loss and electrolyte imbalance.</p>
                        <p>What signs and symptoms would lead you to suspect cholera?</p>
                        <p>Unlike typhoid, cholera is not a systemic infection and therefore fever is generally low or absent. <dfn>Cholera</dfn> progresses through the following three stages.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">First Stage</h4>
                        <p>This stage lasts for 3-12 hours. During this stage profuse watery stool is passed by the patient until faecal matter disappears. The stool becomes almost clear fluid with flakes of mucus, giving it the classical rice-water stool appearance. Vomiting follows diarrhoea. Initially the patient vomits food but soon after only clear fluid or rice-water is vomited. The patient develops severe cramps in the abdomen and limbs due to electrolyte loss.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Second Stage</h4>
                        <p>The patient becomes severely dehydrated, the skin is cold, dry and inelastic. Blood pressure drops severely, and it may not be recordable. The pulse becomes weak and rapid, urine production ceases, patient collapses and may go into irreversible shock.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Third Stage</h4>
                        <p>This is the stage of recovery. Some patients recover spontaneously or with treatment. The general condition rapidly improves, diarrhoea becomes less profuse and the patient is able to take oral fluids.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Cholera</dfn> should be suspected in any outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and also through laboratory isolation of <dfn>vibrio cholerae</dfn> from a rectal swab, stool or vomitus specimen.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The management of <dfn>cholera</dfn> is easily done at health centre level and so there is no need to refer patients to hospital. This is because the main cause of death in cholera patients is dehydration. This can occur very quickly and early in an outbreak before the urgency of treatment is recognised. Therefore early rehydration is the most important part of management.</p>
                        <p>Other measures taken in the management of cholera include the following:</p>
