                        <p><dfn>Bacillary dysentery</dfn>, also known as <dfn>shigellosis</dfn>, is an acute bacterial disease of the intestines. It is common especially in areas where the standards of hygiene are low, particularly, where there is scarcity of safe water, improper human excreta disposal, large population of flies and child malnutrition. Once again humans are the only known reservoir.</p>
                        <p>It is caused by a non-motile gram-negative bacilli of the genus <dfn>shigella spp.</dfn> The organisms responsible for outbreaks are:</p>

                        <p>However, the first three organisms are the most common causes of outbreaks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>The mode of transmission of the disease is the faecal-oral route. The organisms are transmitted directly through flies or contaminated hands. Indirect transmission may also occur through dishes which are poorly washed. The shigella multiply in food which when ingested causes dysentery.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>The disease has a short incubation period of one to four days. The onset is sudden with fever, headache, diarrhoea with streaks of blood, and colicky abdominal pains.</p>
                        <p>After a few motions (usually in a few hours) diarrhoea stops and is followed by severe colicky abdominal pain known as <dfn>dysenteric syndrome</dfn>, and painful contractions of the sphincter ani which produce an irresistible urge to defecate (<dfn>tenesmus</dfn>). When the patient goes to the toilet they pass small amounts of purulent mucus and blood. Vomiting may also occur. Toxins produced by the shigella on the wall of the colon may be absorbed into the blood stream resulting in toxaemia. Toxaemia causes high fever and rapid pulse. Dehydration is also common and dangerous as it may cause muscular cramps, oliguria and shock. In infants, rectal prolapse may occur as well as convulsions.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is an infection of the small intestines by protozoa called <dfn>giardia lamblia</dfn>. The disease may be mild (asymptomatic) in some individuals, while in others it may cause diarrhoea, malabsorption of digested nutrients and weight loss.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Giardiasis</dfn> is found in all the countries of the world, but it is more common in developing countries such as Kenya, where the water supply may be contaminated by human faeces or sewerage.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Often, the disease is spread from person to person, especially within families by asymptomatic carriers. Cysts which are excreted in the stool of an infected person remain infectious for up to three months in cold water or four days if the temperature is <span class="math-inline">$37^{\circ}\text{C}$</span>. As soon as the cysts are ingested by a human being, they are activated by the hydrochloric acid in the stomach. <dfn>Trophozoites</dfn> emerge and adhere to the wall of the upper portion of the small intestine. Here they begin to multiply and in about 10-14 days, the symptoms manifest.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>Acute <dfn>giardiasis</dfn> is characterised by sudden onset of nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal distension (bloating sensation), prominent bowel sounds, and diarrhoea with frequent, frothy, yellowish stools with offensive odour. Fatigue, lethargy and weight loss often occur.</p>
                        <p>After about three weeks the symptoms reduce in severity and for many of the patients, this is the beginning of spontaneous recovery. Some patients however, remain symptomatic and continue to lose weight because of ongoing malabsorption of nutrients, mostly fat, vitamin B12 and lactose. The disease may persist for months or years</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis of <dfn>giardiasis</dfn> is often difficult to establish because stool examination rarely reveals motile trophozoites. However, approximately $60\%$ of samples will show cysts. The diagnosis is therefore made through the following ways:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is a protozoal infection mainly of the intestinal mucous membrane in humans caused by <dfn>entamoeba histolytica</dfn>. The disease is found in all parts of the world but more common where sanitary conditions are poor. <dfn>Amoebiasis</dfn> can occur in families or spread through institutions but usually does not occur in epidemics. It can be endemic in a population in which many individuals are asymptomatic cyst-passers with only a few getting the disease.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p>Cysts are passed from person to person by the faecal-oral route, by fingers soiled with faeces either directly into the mouth or via food. Infections may also occur from drinking contaminated water. Amoebiasis can occasionally spread from the bowels to other organs of the body, especially to the liver leading to <dfn>amoebic liver disease</dfn>.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathogenesis</h3>
                        <p>Once the cysts are ingested, the emerging trophozoites take up residence in the intestinal mucosa.</p>
                        <p>The organisms multiply in the mucosa (causing the formation of bottle-shaped ulcers each $1-2 \text{ cm}$ in diameter). Too many such ulcers may cover the large intestine. Some of the ulcers may become perforated leading to severe <dfn>peritonitis</dfn> with shock. In the small intestines, the <dfn>entamoeba histolytica</dfn> may pass through the mucous membrane and enter the liver. After a variable incubation period a <dfn>liver abscess</dfn> may form.</p>

                        <p>Reservoirs of <dfn>hepatitis B virus</dfn> include sexually promiscuous individuals, spouses of acutely infected persons, health care workers exposed to blood, family members of chronically infected persons, anyone who requires repeated blood transfusions.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>How would you diagnose viral hepatitis in a patient?</p>
                        <p>The urine of a person suffering from viral hepatitis is dark and contains bilirubin, while the stool is usually pale. In the blood, both direct and indirect bilirubin levels are raised. In the case of <dfn>hepatitis B</dfn>, diagnosis is made by detecting various immunological markers in the blood. The most important is the hepatitis B surface antigen (<dfn>HBsAg</dfn>) which is present when the virus is in the blood in the acute stage and in the chronic carrier state.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>No specific treatment is available for both <dfn>hepatitis A</dfn> and <dfn>B</dfn>.</p>
                        <p>The patient should be given symptomatic treatment together with diet and bed rest at home to prevent the spread of the disease. If admission is indicated for one reason or the other, you should ensure that the patient is isolated and extra precautions taken during handling and disposal of excreta. Since alcohol increases the risk of cirrhosis, you should advise the patient to avoid alcohol for at least six months.</p>

                        <p>Just like in the other diseases that have been covered, improvement of environmental sanitation will prevent the transmission of <dfn>hepatitis A</dfn>.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Food poisoning</dfn> is a sudden, acute and sometimes life threatening illness which follows ingestion of contaminated food, drink or water. The major causes of food poisoning include intoxication with chemicals, toxins produced by bacterial growth, and a variety of organic substances such as poisonous plants and mushrooms. Food poisoning occurs in small outbreaks and mortality is usually low. In this country, you often hear of severe cases of food poisoning caused by consumption of cheap alcoholic drinks ('Kumi Kumi'). It is also suspected that some cases diagnosed as gastroenteritis in health facilities are actually caused by food poisoning.</p>
                        <p>There are two common types of bacterial food poisoning found in communities.</p>
                        <p>These are:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Staphylococcal Food Poisoning</h3>
                        <p>This type of poisoning is caused by contamination of food (for example, with pus from a septic finger) by an infected person). The staphylococci in the pus multiply and produce toxins when the food is allowed to stand for several hours before being served. Although the bacteria itself is harmless if ingested, the toxins it produces are very poisonous. Following ingestion of the toxin-contaminated food, there is sudden severe abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache and excessive salivation.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>This disease is usually recognised when people who have shared food all fall sick within a short time.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clostridium Botulinum Food Poisoning</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Botulinum poisoning</dfn> occurs when food contaminated with <dfn>botulinum spores</dfn> (from the soil) is kept warm and in tightly covered containers for many hours. The organisms multiply in warm anaerobic (low oxygen) environments especially in protein-rich foods.</p>
                        <p>When such food is contaminated, <dfn>clostridium botulinum</dfn> multiplies and starts producing toxins. The contaminated food may appear spoiled (greenish) and emit an offensive odour. Once a person eats this food, they may suffer a mild illness that requires no medical treatment or a rapidly fatal illness terminating in death within 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>The symptoms of <dfn>botulism</dfn> begin to manifest 12-36 hours after ingestion of toxin contaminated food. The patient presents with the following signs and symptoms:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis is difficult when only one person is affected because the signs of <dfn>botulism</dfn> are similar to those of acute polio, myasthenia gravis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, diagnosis can be made when a group of people who had consumed the same food (especially tinned or canned foods) suffers from the same neurological symptoms without mental confusion or loss of awareness.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The main cause of death in <dfn>botulism</dfn> is respiratory failure.</p>
                        <p>The patient therefore must be managed in a high-dependence unit.</p>
                        <p>A tracheostomy is performed and mechanical respirator used. Cleansing enemas are administered to remove unabsorbed toxin from the colon and botulinum autotoxin serum is given and repeated after two to four hours.</p>
