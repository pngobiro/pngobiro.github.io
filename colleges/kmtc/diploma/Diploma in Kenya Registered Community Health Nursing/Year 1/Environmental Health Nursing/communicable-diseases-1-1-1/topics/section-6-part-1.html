                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Airborne diseases</dfn> have remained a major public health challenge in Eastern Africa. As mentioned in the introduction to this section, the organisms which cause these diseases enter the body through the respiratory tract.</p>
                        <p>When a patient or carrier of pathogens talks, coughs, laughs or sneezes, droplets of fluid are discharged into the air. The smallest of these droplets remain in the air for some time and may be inhaled by a new host. The bigger droplets fall to the ground and mix with the dust.</p>
                        <p>Some organisms survive the drying conditions and may be inhaled with the dust. Once they get into the body, they may affect the immediate organs involved in respiration, for example, nose and lungs, or they may pass through and spread to the blood or other distant organs like the brain or middle ear. Overcrowded conditions such as congested houses, classrooms and public transport vehicles (matatus, buses and commuter trains), make the spread of these diseases very easy. Therefore, good ventilation and good manners such as covering one's mouth when sneezing or coughing can go a long way to reduce transmission of these diseases.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Influenza</h3>
                        <p>This is an acute viral infection of the respiratory tract caused by any one of the three strains of the <dfn>influenza viruses</dfn>, types A, B and C. <dfn>Influenza</dfn> occurs in all countries of the world. It has a high attack rate with high mortality rates, especially among the elderly and those suffering from chronic illness such as diabetes, kidney and heart disease.</p>
                        <p>Influenza viruses are also found in domestic animals (dogs, horses, pigs, ducks and chicken) and wild birds. Influenza spreads rapidly. Mortality is caused by secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                        <p>The viruses are transmitted through secretions from the respiratory tract of an infected person. A susceptible host may be infected by:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>As with many viral diseases, there is no specific treatment. You should prescribe bed rest and give paracetamol to relieve pain and fever. Prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics may also be prescribed to prevent secondary bacterial infections.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                        <p>Since the infective particles are spread by droplets from patients or carriers, an important part of the control of this disease is based on preventing droplets from being inhaled by others. That is, people must not inhale 'second-hand' air.</p>
                        <p>This can be achieved through the following measures:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Measles (Morbili, Rubeola)</h3>
                        <p>This is an acute and highly contagious disease that mainly affects children. <dfn>Measles</dfn> is a major cause of child mortality in less developed countries such as Kenya. Together with pneumonia it accounts for about a quarter of all deaths occurring in hospitals in Eastern Africa.</p>
                        <p>Non-immunised and malnourished children under the age of three years are at high risk of contracting measles. The severity of measles is related to the viral load one gets from the source. That is, children who live in overcrowded dwellings and who are in close contact with the index case for the whole infective period obtain a high dose of the virus. Such children develop severe measles with high case fatality rates.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                        <p>The <dfn>measles virus</dfn> spreads through invisible droplets secreted from the respiratory tract of an infected person. <dfn>Measles</dfn> spreads very easily and fast. The virus infects the skin and the layer of cells that line the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, eyes, mouth and throat. In addition, the measles virus weakens the child's immune system for many weeks after the onset of the illness, leaving the child at risk of other infections.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <p>The clinical features of <dfn>measles</dfn> depends on the nutritional status of the affected child. The skin rash of measles is characteristic and is said to 'match' from one region of the body to another in a systematic way. It begins on the face and neck, then spreads to the chest and abdomen after 24 hours. On the third day, the rash spreads to the arms and lower limbs. Depending on the nutritional status of a child, measles can either be complicated or uncomplicated.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Uncomplicated measles</dfn> generally occurs in well-nourished or slightly underweight children. It presents with the following signs and symptoms:</p>

Give a single dose of vitamin A 200,000iu in order to speed up recovery from measles and prevent the development of complications. Also, advise the mother to bring the child to the clinic everyday for follow up.</p>

                        <p>The only successful method of preventing <dfn>measles</dfn> and its serious complications is immunisation. This should be given to all children from the age of nine months; both the healthy and the sick who have not been previously immunised.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Whooping Cough (Pertussis)</h3>
                        <p>This is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory tract caused by bacteria of the genus <dfn>bordetella</dfn> called <dfn>bordetella pertussis</dfn>. <dfn>Whooping cough</dfn> is also known as <dfn>pertusssis</dfn>.</p>
                        <p>The disease causes production of very sticky mucus that blocks the lumen of the bronchioles. This leads to a persistent cough in an attempt to get rid of the mucus. Usually, the cough occurs after feeding thereby causing the child to vomit. This robs the child of the little breast milk or food they may have eaten thus causing them to be malnourished. Mortality from whooping cough is highest in children aged one year or less.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                        <p>It is spread by droplets from secretions of the upper respiratory tract. The disease can also be spread by direct contact with freshly contaminated objects.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <p>The incubation period of the disease ranges from six to ten days after infection, after which the clinical features appear. In babies aged three months or less, there is no 'whoop' experienced during coughing. As such the diagnosis may be missed.</p>
                        <p>The characteristic 'whoop' is seen in children over three months of age.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Whooping cough</dfn> progresses through three stages as follows.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Catarrhal Stage</h4>
                        <p>This stage begins after the incubation period and lasts for one to two weeks. The patient has slight fever and a cough that is troublesome especially at night. The cough often ends with vomiting. Gradually the cough becomes paroxysmal in character with a running nose.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Paroxysmal Stage</h4>
                        <p>During this stage, the fever and the running nose disappear but the cough becomes more troublesome. The cough occurs in <dfn>paroxysms</dfn>. The child coughs with his mouth open and tongue protruding out. This severe persistent cough causes cyanosis, protrusion of eyeballs, congestion of face and neck veins, sweating, and exhaustion. The patient may vomit suddenly, pass urine or stool, bleed from the nose, bite their tongue or suffer convulsions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Convalescent Stage</h4>
                        <p>Most patients improve gradually within one to three weeks, but some patients may continue to have paroxysms of coughing for months.</p>
                        <p>If <dfn>whooping cough</dfn> is not treated it can lead to a number of complications:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>Diagnosis of <dfn>whooping cough</dfn> is made through a postnasal swab for culture and sensitivity of <dfn>bordetella pertussis</dfn> and clinical symptoms (paroxysmal cough with a 'whoop').</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                           <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon">üí°</span> Remember:</h4>
                           <p>Young babies do not 'whoop'.</p>
                         </aside>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>The management of <dfn>whooping cough</dfn> requires supportive treatment such as good nutrition, plenty of fluid intake and avoidance of factors which provoke coughing. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are also given to kill the pertussis organisms. However, antibiotic therapy does not shorten the paroxysmal stage of the disease. You should also avoid giving sedatives and cough suppressants because they may make the illness worse.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                        <p>Just like in the case of measles, the only way to control <dfn>whooping cough</dfn> is by high immunisation coverage. To prevent whooping cough three doses of the pentavalent vaccine, starting at the age of six weeks is currently being administered. It is given at intervals of four weeks.</p>
                        <p>Why is the administration of the vaccine started so early?</p>
                        <p>This is because very little or no passive immunity is inherited from the mother, yet it is in the first three months of life that whooping cough has a high mortality rate.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mumps (Epidemic Parotitis)</h3>
                        <p>This is an acute viral disease, which usually affects school aged children and is characterised by fever and painful swelling of the salivary glands.</p>
                        <p><dfn>Mumps</dfn> is not a major cause of death, but if contracted after puberty it can cause infertility due to its effect on the testis and ovaries. Other rare complications of mumps include; meningitis, encephalitis, pancreatitis, thyroiditis and unilateral deafness.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                        <p>The virus is transmitted by droplets and by direct contact with the saliva of an infected person, or indirectly through freshly contaminated articles.</p>
                        <p>The incubation period is 17-19 days.</p>

                        <p>There is no rash and the fever and swelling disappear after a few days. However, in some patients complications do develop.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Orchitis</h4>
                        <p>This is a very common complication which occurs in about 20\% of post-pubertal males. <dfn>Orchitis</dfn> is usually unilateral. The fever returns and the testis become swollen and painful. The affected testis may atrophy leading to infertility. In girls, oophoritis may develop. It is less common than orchitis. The child complains of severe lower abdominal pain and vomiting.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pancreatitis</h4>
                        <p><dfn>Pancreatitis</dfn> may occur but it is not common. It presents with severe upper abdominal pain, fever and vomiting.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Meningitis</h4>
                        <p>This is a common complication of <dfn>mumps</dfn>. It presents with fever, headache, vomiting, neck rigidity and spinal rigidity. The condition resolves spontaneously.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Encephalitis</h4>
                        <p>This is rare and may occur with or without meningitis. The patient presents with disturbed behaviour, drowsiness, convulsions, and coma. <dfn>Mumps encephalitis</dfn> is a serious condition, and has a mortality rate of 2\%.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                        <p>It can be prevented by the administration of live attenuated <dfn>mumps vaccines</dfn> where it is available. This live attenuated vaccine is combined with measles and rubella.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chickenpox (Varicella)</h3>
                        <p>This is a mild viral disease characterised mainly by a skin rash. It mainly affects children under ten years of age and its case fatality is very low. The causative organism is the <dfn>Varicella-Zoster Virus</dfn> (VZV). <dfn>Chickenpox</dfn> is highly contagious. An adult person who becomes infected suffers a severe form of the illness. Once a person develops chickenpox they develop immunity against the disease. However, the virus stays within the body and may reappear as <dfn>herpes zoster</dfn> (shingles) when the immunity of a person is weakened, for example in AIDS and diabetes.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                        <p>The virus is spread by droplets from the upper respiratory tract or from the discharges of ruptured lesions on the skin.</p>
                        <p>The incubation period is 14-21 days.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <p>The disease begins with mild fever, sore throat and a sore palate. After two days, a characteristic rash appears on the trunk, and within a few hours, the rash spreads to the face, axilla, and scalp, and sometimes to the arms and legs. The rash vesicles are superficial. The infection usually clears spontaneously and the vesicles usually collapse and dry after three to four days, leaving skin spots but no scars. The spots clear after a while. Complications usually do not occur.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management</h4>
                        <p>The treatment of <dfn>chickenpox</dfn> is symptomatic. Give the patient calamine lotion to relieve itching. A local antiseptic can also be given for infected skin lesions for example chlorhexidine (hibiscrub, hibitane).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Prevention and Control</h4>
                        <p><dfn>Chickenpox</dfn> is a self-limiting non-fatal disease. Healthy school children should be kept off school if there is an outbreak among schoolmates.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Meningococcal Meningitis (Epidemic Meningitis)</h3>
                        <p>This is an acute and dangerous bacterial disease, which occurs sporadically and in epidemics. The causative bacterium is the <dfn>neisseria meningitides</dfn>, also known as <dfn>meningococcus</dfn>. There are two types of meningitis.</p>
                        <p>The first type known as <dfn>meningococcal meningitis</dfn> is spread by droplets from one person to another and may cause epidemics in crowded institutions such as army barracks, boarding schools, prisons and camps.</p>
                        <p>The second type is caused by a variety of other organisms usually occurring as a complication of some other disease in the body, or by direct extension from neighbouring structures such as the middle ear (otitis media). This type of meningitis occurs one case at a time, that is, it is sporadic.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h4>
                        <p>About 20-25\% of people may be healthy carriers of the <dfn>meningococcus</dfn> and the other organisms which cause meningitis, such as, <dfn>haemophilus influenzae type B</dfn> and <dfn>streptococcus pneumoniae</dfn> (pneumococci). Transmission of the <dfn>neisseria meningitides</dfn> occurs by direct contact and by droplets from nasal and throat discharges of infected persons.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Features</h4>
                        <p>When a susceptible host is infected the organism causes blood poisoning (<dfn>septicaemia</dfn>) and <dfn>pyogenic meningitis</dfn>. The onset is sudden with the following signs and symptoms:</p>
