                        <p>In unit three, you covered environmental health and learnt that although the environment can be a source of ill health, you can prevent many diseases and health problems through simple measures such as good personal hygiene and proper waste disposal. However, despite your best efforts, you can still contract diseases from different sources. The common cold is a good example. It takes just one person infected with the flu virus to spread it round to the others in the office or at home. A disease that is passed from one person to another person is called a communicable or transmissible disease.</p>
                        <p>Transmissible diseases include: measles, HIV infection, tuberculosis, chickenpox, gonorrhoea, scabies, malaria, cholera, and roundworms among others.</p>

                        <p>Different diseases are common in different places and at different times. To understand why this happens, you need to consider the disease causative organisms (the agents); the people they infect (the hosts); and the surroundings in which they live (the environment).</p>
                        <p>A delicate balance exists between the agent, the host and the environment and it can change in different ways. For instance, the agent needs a suitable environment in which to grow and multiply and thus be able to spread and infect other hosts. If the environment does not support the agent it dies or transforms to a dormant state. The host (person) is also affected by the environment. For example, a person may live in a hot, wet climate where there are many mosquitoes. However they can change this environment by draining swamps, clearing the vegetation and adding competing hosts such as animals. If the balance is shifted against the agent, the disease will be controlled and the number of cases will go down.</p>
                        <p>When the balance between the agent, the host and the environment is fairly constant, you tend to see approximately the same number of cases of the disease every month. When this happens the disease is said to be <dfn>endemic</dfn>. When the balance is shifted in favour of the agent (organism), for example, when many nonimmune children have been born in an area since the last measles epidemic, a large number of cases of measles may occur in a short time. This is called an <dfn>epidemic</dfn>. Epidemic diseases occur during certain periods or seasons and cause sudden deaths and much suffering in the community.</p>
                        <p>An <dfn>endemic</dfn> disease can be termed as that which occurs in a given population at a constant rate over a period of several years. An <dfn>epidemic</dfn> disease is that which occurs in a population at a higher rate than is usually the normal for that population over a given time interval.</p>
                        <p>Diagrammatically the endemic and epidemic disease patterns can be illustrated as shown on the right.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A person who is invaded by a disease-causing micro-organism is called a <dfn>host</dfn>. An <dfn>infection</dfn> occurs when this micro-organism begins to reproduce (multiply) and grow. When an organism infects a person, there are three possible stages to consider.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Incubation Period</h4>
                        <p>The <dfn>incubation period</dfn> is the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms and signs of an illness. During the incubation period the host does not realise that they have an infection until several days later when detectable symptoms and signs of the illness occur.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Sub-clinical Infection</h4>
                        <p>At this stage, infection does not produce clear signs and symptoms. The host's immune system is trying to fight off the agent. In some cases, the organism is overcome by the host immune cells hence no signs and symptoms are felt and the infection process is terminated.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Clinical Infection</h4>
                        <p>This is the period when the host develops detectable symptoms and signs of an illness. At this time the agent has multiplied within the host overcoming the host's immune system and has started causing abnormal functioning of some body cells and tissues. This produces overt signs and symptoms of the disease. It is important for you to understand these stages because people with symptoms are easier to identify as they come to your health facilities for treatment. People with sub-clinical infections do not allways know they are infected and hence are a danger to other people. They are also difficult to detect in the general population without special tests. An individual who is suffering from a sub-clinical infection is also likely to infect others, as in the case of HIV infection which leads to AIDS after a long period. They are therefore known as <dfn>carriers</dfn>. An individual who develops a clinical or sub-clinical infection is said to be <dfn>susceptible</dfn> to the disease. A susceptible individual is one whose body lacks resistance to the disease. Resistance of the body to a disease occurs due to various immunity mechanisms.</p>
                        <p>Write down the two types of immunity found in our body.</p>
                        <p>Your answer should have included the following two types of immunity:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A disease transmission cycle is a series of steps that a disease-causing organism undergoes in its disease-causing process.</p>
                        <p>Disease-causing organisms are living things that need somewhere to live and reproduce. This may be within inanimate or animate environment (example in rodents, insect, or the human body), which is known as the <dfn>reservoir of infection</dfn>. The human being is the main reservoir of most of the communicable diseases that affect humanity. When an infection spreads to a new host, the place, animal or human from which the organism came from is called the <dfn>source of the infection</dfn>. The way in which an organism leaves the source (the infected host) and passes to a new susceptible host is called the <dfn>route of transmission</dfn>. Each disease-causing organism has particular routes which play a large part in how these organisms spread in the community. For example, some organisms are spread through water and food, while others are spread by vectors like mosquitoes and snails.</p>
                        <p>The diagram above illustrates the differences between the disease transmission cycle in measles, and in malaria where the causative organism passes from human being to mosquito and back to the human being.</p>
