                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Tuberculosis</dfn> (also known as <dfn>Koch's disease</dfn>) is a chronic bacterial infection caused by bacteria that belongs to the family of <dfn>mycobacterium</dfn>. These are <dfn>mycobacterium tuberculosis</dfn>, <dfn>mycobacterium bovis</dfn> and <dfn>mycobacterium avium</dfn>. The lungs are affected in most cases, but other organs such as the skin, bones, brain, lymph nodes, and intestine are also affected (extra-pulmonary tuberculosis). Tuberculosis is found in all parts of the world and affects all age groups and sexes equally. If untreated, tuberculosis causes death and severe disability. After many years of immunising children against tuberculosis with the BCG vaccine, tuberculosis was almost controlled. However, the HIV infection which can lead to AIDS has led to the resurgence of tuberculosis. The cases of AIDS related tuberculosis have risen and continue to rise. The prevalence of tuberculosis increases as social and economic status decrease.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Tuberculosis</dfn> is spread from an infected person to a healthy susceptible host by droplet infection. This happens when a person with pulmonary TB coughs out heavily infected sputum into the air. Though many people may thus become exposed to TB infection, only a few will progress to develop actual disease. This is because the majority have acquired active natural immunity to the disease. However if this immunity is depressed by for example, age or HIV infection, tuberculosis may flare up again and cause obvious clinical disease.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned earlier, there are three organisms that cause tuberculosis.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</h4>
                        <p>This is the main cause of pulmonary tuberculosis and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mycobacterium Bovis</h4>
                        <p>This causes disease in cattle and is spread to humans through infected milk. It also causes extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Mycobacterium Avium</h4>
                        <p>This causes disease in birds. Bird droppings spread pulmonary tuberculosis in individuals whose immunity is depressed (opportunistic mycobacterium).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">How to Diagnose Tuberculosis?</h3>
                        <p>The best way to diagnose tuberculosis is by means of a direct sputum smear examination (<dfn>Acid Fast Bacilli - AFB test</dfn>) in the laboratory.</p>
                        <p>If possible, at least three early morning specimens must be examined within two days.</p>
                        <p>Other tests include skin tests such as the <dfn>Mantoux test</dfn> and chest x-rays.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The Kenya National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Programme (NLTP) coordinate the treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy. The NLTP, which is a Ministry of Health project, has developed the treatment guidelines for these two diseases. Treatment regimen for tuberculosis depends on the type of tuberculosis as well as the age of patient.</p>
                        <p>The drugs used for the treatment of tuberculosis are abbreviated as follows:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Leprosy</dfn> is one of the oldest diseases of human beings. It is caused by a bacteria belonging to the same family as the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis, known as <dfn>mycobacterium leprae</dfn>. Leprosy is a major public health and socio-economic problem because it is a disabling and deforming disease. Leprosy is not a killer disease in that it runs a chronic course and does not significantly reduce the life expectancy of the infected individual.</p>
                        <p>In some communities patients suffering from leprosy are discriminated against or stigmatised due to ignorance and unfounded traditional beliefs. This causes a lot of distress and misery to those infected and their families. In Kenya, leprosy has almost been eradicated except for a few endemic areas in the Coast, Eastern, Nyanza and Western Province.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mode of Transmission</h3>
                        <p><dfn>Leprosy</dfn> has a long incubation period and runs a chronic course if it is not adequately treated at an early stage. The <dfn>mycobacterium leprae</dfn> bacillus multiplies very slowly (dividing only once every 14-30 days). That is why the incubation period is long, about five to eight years. Just like tuberculosis, the leprosy bacillus is transmitted by droplets, by sneezing, coughing, spitting and unhygienic nose cleaning habits. The organism is also suspected to enter the body through broken skin such as small wounds. Leprosy is common among family members of the infected.</p>
                        <p>There are certain factors that increase the incidence of leprosy in the community:</p>

                        <p>The main cause of disability in <dfn>leprosy</dfn> is the destruction of the nerves. Damage to the sensory nerve fibres causes anaesthesia, while damage to the motor nerve fibres causes paralysis. Impaired circulation, loss of sweating and skin atrophy is caused by damage to autonomic nerve fibres.</p>
                        <p>Leprosy patients may get burned or injured on their limbs and fail to notice because of anaesthesia. The patient may walk on an injured foot without realising it.</p>
                        <p>In the eye, the cornea may become anaesthetic so that foreign bodies may enter unnoticed leading to corneal damage. Anaesthetic eyelids may lose the blinking reflex or fail to close the eye (<dfn>lagophthalmos</dfn>) leading to dryness, iritis, adhesions, glaucoma and blindness.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Features</h3>
                        <p>After infection, the <dfn>mycobacterium leprae</dfn> bacilli multiply in macrophages of the skin and the schwann cells of the peripheral nerve fibres. The bacillus has a preference for the relatively cool places in the body such as the face and the limbs. The early signs of leprosy are as follows:</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Reaction Types</h3>
                        <p>Reactions are sudden unexpected changes which occur in all types of patients with <dfn>leprosy</dfn>. These reactions are caused by a change in the balance between the immunity of a patient and the bacilli. There are two main types of reactions, type I or reversal reaction and type II or erythema nodusum leprosum.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Type I Reaction (Reversal Action)</h4>
                        <p><dfn>Type I reaction</dfn> (reversal action) is common in <dfn>Pauci-Bacillary Leprosy</dfn> (PBL). It occurs after a sudden increase in immunity results in a rapidly increased response of the body to the leprosy bacilli. This reaction causes sudden inflammation in places where the leprosy bacilli are present. It causes nerve damage, inflamed and raised red skin lesions and oedema of hands, face or feet.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Type II Reaction (Erythema Nodosum Leprosum)</h4>
                        <p>This appears six months or more after treatment and is caused by a reaction between dead leprosy bacilli and circulating antibodies. Nerve damage is not common in this reaction. Eyes, joints and testes become inflamed, nerve become tender and ulcerating tender nodules appear on the skin. Thus, reaction is usually of sudden onset and tends to recur.</p>
                        <p>Generally, reactions in leprosy are provoked by a number of factors. These include:</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Exercises</h4>
                        <p>It is common knowledge that joints which are not used become stiff, while muscles atrophy and become weak. Also scar tissue tends to retract resulting in contractures. That is why all patients with weak or damaged hands should do suitable exercises. For paralysed muscles, passive exercises help to loosen the stiff joints and lengthen the skin. The exercises should be done for five to ten minutes daily on a regular basis.</p>

                        <p>The cornerstone of <dfn>leprosy</dfn> control is to reduce the number of infective cases and interrupt transmission. These can be achieved through the following preventive measures:</p>
