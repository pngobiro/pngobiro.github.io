                        <ul>
                            <li>The existence of national policy could be traced from the Act of Parliament that made provision for health, safety and welfare of persons in factories and other places, and for matters incidental thereto and connected therewith which came into operation on 1st September 1951</li>
                            <li>However, separate occupational safety and health policy formulated with tripartite participation for the purpose of guiding objectively occupational safety and health issues does not exist.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">2.2. Bodies that review national legislation on OSH</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Factories Act was amended through the Factories (Amendment) Act, 1990 and renamed The Factories and other Places of Work Act in which the bodies that review national legislation on OSH were established.</li>
                            <li>Under this new Act a provision was made for establishment of a committee to advise, consult with and make recommendations on matters relating to the administration of occupational safety and health.</li>
                            <li>The committee operating currently is referred to as National Advisory Committee on Occupational Health and Safety.</li>
                            <li>The director in charge of safety and health in the country is the chairman with one nominee from each identifiable ministry or organization appointed by the Minister by name and by notice in the Gazette.</li>
                            <li>The composition of the members includes those from ministries, social partners, and public universities.</li>
                            <li>Before, for instance, a new legislation on safety and health becomes law the content should be discussed and deliberated upon through meetings, seminars and workshops involving the workers representatives, employers' representatives, the government and other stakeholders in the area of occupational safety and health.</li>
                            <li>At enterprise level safety and health committees are established that are composed of employers and employees representation. This arrangement provides for opportunity for exchange of views on safety and health issues at that level.</li>

                            <li>The Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development has developed a strategic plan for the period 2004/5-2008/9, in which the Development of Occupational Health and Safety Services (DOHSS) strategic plan is included.</li>
                            <li>The department of DOHSS strategic plan constitutes of a national safety and health plan for the specified period.</li>
                            <li>The department's vision, mission, targets and indicators are outlined as follows:</li>
                        </ul>
