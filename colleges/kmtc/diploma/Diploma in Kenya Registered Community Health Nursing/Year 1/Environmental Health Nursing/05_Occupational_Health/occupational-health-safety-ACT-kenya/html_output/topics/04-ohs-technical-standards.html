                        <ul>
                            <li>The safety and health legislation under the Factories and other Places of Work require all factories and workplaces, which regularly employ at least twenty employees to have a safety and health committee with representation from employer and workers.</li>
                            <li>In order to regulate the operations of the committee safety and health committee, rues of 2004, L.N. 31 were established. These rules contain specific functions of the employer and employees.</li>
                            <li>Issues on safety and health are discussed during the regular meetings. The meeting is chaired by the employer or an appointed representative of the employer.</li>
                            <li>It is mandatory under the rules for the members of the committees to be trained on basic occupational health and safety.</li>
                            <li>The training includes information on the safety and health legislation, causes and prevention of accidents and diseases, first-aid techniques, emergency preparedness, and prevention and control procedures, identification of health hazards and control and safe work practices.</li>
                            <li>The establishing of the committee is encouraging promotion of safety and health in the workplace and hence introducing self-regulatory system at the enterprise level.</li>
                            <li>At national level the department of Occupation Health and Safety promotes safety and health by enforcing the Factories and other Places Work Act. This is carried out through regular training on safety and health, participating in national shows and exhibiting safety and health materials and prosecuting for non-compliance.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">4.2. Technical Standards</h3>
                        <p>The Act Cap 514 gives basic national standards on safety and health that is mandatory to be attained.</p>
                        <p>Among these include requirement for</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fencing area to be occupied by worker</li>
                            <li>Frequency of cleaning the workrooms</li>
                            <li>Height of workrooms</li>
                            <li>Attachments required in operating pressurized equipment safety and safety provisions in case of fire.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some of the rules that have been developed setting standards that borrow heavily from ILO codes of practice include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Factories and other Places of Work (Building Operations and works of Engineering Construction) Rules, 1984, L.N. No. 40. This has various standards to be followed during construction, structural alteration, repair or maintenance of a building, the demolition of a building and preparation for laying of the foundation.</li>
                            <li>The Factories and other Places of Work (Docks) Rules LN 306 / 1962.</li>
                            <li>The Factories and other Places of Work (Safety and Health Committees) Rules, 2004, L.N. 31.</li>
                            <li>The Factories and other Places of Work (First-aid) Rules, 1977.</li>
                            <li>The Factories and other Places of Work (Woodworking Machinery) Rules, L.N. 431 / 1959.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note that:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Some companies are applying the ISO 1800 series on occupational safety and health</li>
                            <li>The Kenya Bureau of Standards in conjunction with Directorate of Occupational Health and Safety Services developed safety standards regarding liquefied and compressed gas cylinders.</li>
                            <li>The department would like to increase its capacity to promote ILO-OSH 2001.</li>
