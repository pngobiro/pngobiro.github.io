- The analysis of the occupational injuries and fatalities were not available.
- The estimated, under reporting, could be up to $50 \%$ due to the reluctance of the enterprises report. They say that the reporting will expose them to the department of Occupational Health and Services resulting to prosecutions. Most of the accidents are reported when the employer is seeking for the workman compensation for the injured employee.
- The Factories and Other Places of Work Act requires that where an accident in a factory premises, place of work or location
a. Causes loss of life
b. Disables any person fro more than three days, a written notice of the accident should be sent to an OHSO and in case of a fatal accident within and not later than twenty-four hours of its occurrence.

\section*{11. OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION}

\section*{National Reports:}

The department of Occupational Health and Safety is one of the national institutions responsible for implementation of the various aspects of OSH. Its annual report has been provided in the report.

\section*{Safety and health regulations}

Aspects of regulations listed below have been included in the report:
- Factories and other Places of Work (Safety and Health Committees) Rules 2004
- The Factories (First-aid) Rules, 1977
- The Factories (Docks) Rules.
- The Factories (Electric Power) (Special) Rules.
- The Factories (Woodworking machinery) Rules.
- The Factories (Building Operations and works of Engineering Construction) Rules.
- The Factories (Eyes) Rules.
- The Factories (Cellulose) Rules.

\section*{12. ELEMENTS FOR INPUT IN THE SITUATION ANALYSIS}
- It is important to note that the establishment and development of safety and health is well founded on enacted laws particularly the Factories and other Places of Work Act - Cap 514 and its subsidiary safety and health legislations.
- The department of Occupational Health and Safety Services in the Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development demonstrates a national representation and distribution of the spread of safety and health information in the country.
- The department is represented at provincial and district levels in the country.
- The department has established close collaboration with other ministries and stakeholders interested in safety and health issues.
- A National Advisory Committee on Occupational Health and Safety is in place involving Ministries, Employers' and Employees' organizations, and public universities. The committee is mandated to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on safety and health matters in the country.
- In the department of Occupational Health and Safety Services and in the private sector there are persons with various skills including Occupational hygienists, Occupational medical specialists, Safety Engineering experts and Occupational health nurses.
- Unfortunately the authorized establishment of the professional in the department recommended in 1990 was 168 but the actual number is currently 51 and the recommended number by the department stands at 198. To enable the department handle the situation the director, through the established safety and health committees' rules, is authorized to appoint persons to serve as safety and health advisers and also institutions to train on safety and health matters.
- The number of well trained experts on safety and health is inadequate compared to their demand, especially in the department of DOHSS. The training opportunities have become scarce and it is also seriously underfunded.
- The department recommended for the establishment of Semi Autonomous Agency through the worker Injury Insurance Scheme. This would be a contributory scheme, whose primary objective would be to prevent occupational accidents and diseases and engage in research, training and dissemination of safety and health matters in the country.
- The department has established a reporting format on occupational accidents and diseases in line with the ILO, reporting structure. The capacity to effectively operationalize the system is inadequate. However, the reporting will improve when the Work Injuries Benefits Draft Bill becomes law and administered by the department (DOHSS) under which compensation will be through a "no fault system".
- The department has established occupational hygiene and medical analysis laboratories. However, the present equipment is old and outdated and there is urgent need to provide new and modern equipment.
- The Safety and Health Bill has addressed several areas in more detail than the existing law including employer' and employees' responsibilities, chemical safety, agricultural sector activities and young persons in the workplace. It has recommended areas for the development of regulations and codes of practice affecting safety and health.
- Given the number of the safety and health professionals in the department, the inadequacy of availability of equipment and transport facilities, the effective coverage of the workplaces in the field remains low. This is an area of top priority at present.
- The civil service wage bill is currently $9.0 \%$ of GDP. This is unable to support the increased investments in the economy. The government expects a leaner, efficient, motivated and more productive Public Service.
