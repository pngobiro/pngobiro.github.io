                        <ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The workmen's compensation Act Cap 236 currently is the only Act of Parliament enacted to provide for compensation for injuries suffered by a worker in the course of his/her employment provided the worker remains incapacitated for at least three days.</li>
                            <li>The workmen's compensation service covers any person who enters into or works under a contract of service or apprenticeship with an employer. The employment may be a manual labour or on contract given in writing or oral. The remuneration may be calculated by time or by work done by day, week, month or any specified period.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The Ministry of Labour and Human Resource Development is responsible for the administration of the workmen compensation services through Labour department.</li>
                            <li>However, with the recent review of the core Labour Laws, workmen's compensation Act will be referred as Work Injury Benefit Act (WIBA) and will be administered by the Director of Directorate of Occupational Health and Safety Services (DOHSS) in the same Ministry.</li>
                            <li>With this new arrangement the reporting of work injuries and accidents will be well captured in the most relevant department already charged with the responsibility of prevention of occupational accidents and diseases.</li>
                            <li>The data collected will enable the officers concerned to institute investigation and hence hasten remedial measures to avoid further occurrence of the same.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Occupational Diseases</h4>

                            <li>If any worker complains of ill-health in the workplace the Occupational Medical Specialist in the department of DOHSS may examine him/her for the purpose of finding out whether the worker is suffering from occupational disease or not and finally offer advise on action to be taken.</li>
                            <li>At present the body responsible for compensation does not provide for any support for the implementation of prevention programmes. However, a proposal by the DOHSS to establish Worker Injury Insurance Scheme in place of Workmen's Compensation is still under consideration. It is proposed that the funds collected would be used in accident prevention programmes including research, training and information dissemination activities on OSH.</li>
