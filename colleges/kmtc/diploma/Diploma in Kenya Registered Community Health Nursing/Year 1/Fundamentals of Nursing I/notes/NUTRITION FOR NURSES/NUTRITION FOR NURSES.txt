UNIT 1 INTRODUCTION TO NUTRITION
}

BY KARIMI R.G.

\section*{rejectives}
1.Define various terms in relation to nutrition.
2. Explain the role of nutrition in health and disease.
3.Describe factors that affect nutrition.
4.Classify food.

\section*{What is Nutrition?}
- It is a science that encompasses all the interactions that occur between living organisms and food.
- These interactions include the physiological processes by which an organism,
- Ingests
- Digests
- Absorbs
- Transports and utilize food.
- Nutrition includes the biological actions and interactions of food with the body and their consequences for health and disease.
- It also includes the psychological, social, cultural, economic, and technological factors that influence which foods we eat.
- The biological importance of food is dictated by the nutrients it contains.
- Other aspects of food such as taste, color, smell, texture, presentation and packaging help determine its psychological, cultural, social and personal value.
- Food is material of plant or animal origin that contains essential body nutrients and is ingested and assimilated by an organism to produce energy, stimulate growth and maintain life.
- Assimilation: The conversion of nutrients into the fluid or solid substance of the body by process of digestion and absorption.
- Digestion: The conversion of food in the stomach and intestines into soluble and diffusible products capable of being absorbed by the body.
- Metabolism: The process of life by which tissue cells are destroyed by combustion (catabolism) and renewed from chemical substances carried in the blood and derived from digested food(anabolism).
- Enteral Nutrition: Administering nutrition with liquefied foods into the gastrointestinal tract via a tube.
- Malnutrition: Deficiency of the nutrients required for development and maintenance of the human body.
- Anorexia: Lack of appetite with no desire to eat.
- Nutrient: A source of nourishment, such as food that can be metabolized by an organism to give energy and build tissue.

\section*{Main Factors Affecting Nutrition:}
- Religious
- Cultural
- Environmental

\section*{Importance of maintaining good nutrition}

Good health depends upon the availability of essential nutrients the body requires throughout life.

A well nourished individual is mentally alert, is at maximum of physical capability and has a high resistance to disease.

\section*{Good nutrition is important for:}
- The physical and mental development of children
- Resistance to infection.
- Healthy pregnancies and deliveries
- The ability of the adults to work well.
- The prevention of deficiency diseases

\section*{Food can be classified into three main groups:}
- Energy giving - Carbohydrates (CHO)
- Body building foods - Proteins
- Protective foods - Vitamins

\section*{Nutrients:}

\section*{Carbohydrates; are the main sources of energy}
- They are compounds which contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (CHO).
- To produce energy they are metabolised, in the process they produce carbon dioxide and water.
- One gram of carbohydrate gives 4 calories of energy.
- Humans get most of their CHO in the form of starches and sugars.
- CHO are classified according to to their complexities as:
- 1. Monosaccharide, i.e. simple sugars e.g. glucose
- 2. Disaccharides e.g. cane or beet sugar(sucrose), milk(lactose)
- 3. Polysaccharides e.g. starch, glycogen
- 350 gm of CHO is stored in the form of glycogen in the muscles and liver.
- Glucose is absorbed into the blood through the walls of the intestines and finally carried to the liver.
- Glucose maintains glucose level in the blood
- Excess CHO is converted into fat and stored.
- A minimum of 100 gm of CHO needed daily in the diet.
- Food that reaches the small intestines completely undigested

Dietary Fibre:
What happens to fibre in the body?
1.Food is broken up and mixed with saliva in the mouth.
2. Passes through the oesophagus to reach the stomach.
3. Mixes with digestive juices.

\section*{Dietary Fibre}
- Pushed to the small intestine where fibre remains unchanged.
- Fibre is non calorie diet containing bulk requiring more chewing.
- Makes the stools large in volume, pale in colour, soft in consistency.
- Softness of stools is due to emulsified gas produced by the action of bacteria on fibre.

\section*{Effects of fibre on weight}

Fibre requires more chewing, saliva fills the stomach.
- Fibre is bulk forming with very few calories.

- Fibre gives protection against heart attack by decreasing the intake of lipid and simple CHO which are low fibre diets and risk to the heart.
- Fibre binds cholesterol and reduces its absorption from the intestinal tract.

\section*{How fibre prevents bowel cancer}
- Diet rich in fibre increases the acidity of the stools by fermentation.
- Fermentation reduces bacterial production of carcinogens.

\section*{LIPIDS:}

\section*{Utilization in the body:}
1.Padding around the organs to absorb the shock
2. Protection for the nerves.
3. Insulation of the body to avoid rapid change of temperature by excessive heat loss from its surface.
4. Spares body proteins
5. Carriers of fat soluble vitamins A, D,E,K
6. Increases palatability and the satiety value of foods
7. Distinct flavours of different fruits and vegetables depend on the oils present in them.
8. Fats are concentrated source of energy, each gram gives 9 calories.

Digestion of fats starts in the stomach by gastric lipase enzyme.
The bulk of the fats are digested in the small intestines by bile salts converted into fatty acids and glycerol.

Fats are absorbed in the intestines and circulated through the lymph. Some of the fats are used for supply of energy, the rest for storage i.e. In body organs, abdomen and the skin.

\section*{Fatty acids:}

Grouped under two types:
1.Saturated fatty acids which are high in cholesterol found in animal products e.g. meats and eggs. They are solid at room temp. And are the biggest dietary cause of high LDL 'bad' cholesterol levels and should be limited.
2. Unsaturated fatty acids low in cholesterol found in vegetable oils except palm oil.

\section*{Daily requirements of fats:30gm per day}

\section*{Cholesterol content of foods mq per}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{- White portion of the egg is full of proteins while yellow portion is full of cholesterol}
- If you want to avoid fats, consume skimmed milk, green vegetable and fruits.
- Deficiency of fats and CHO in the diet burns reserve fat of the body to meet requirements of the calories.
- Cooking oils used repeatedly turns black and can be carcinogenic.

\section*{Proteins}
- $1 / 6$ of body weight consists of protein
- $1 / 3$ in the muscles.
- $1 / 10$ in the skin
- $1 / 5$ in cartilage and bones
- Reminder in tissues and body fluids.
- Protein differs from carbohydrates and fats because it contains 16\% nitrogen and a larger molecule.

\section*{Cont'd}
- Proteins are made of 28 simpler substances known as amino acids.
- Most of these are made in the body except 9 (essential) which must come from our diet.
- All amino acids in the diet are broken down and the nitrogen compound released as urea.
- Excess proteins are converted into fats and glycogen. No proteins are stored.

\section*{Essential amino acids}
- 1. Isoleucine
- 3.Leucin
- 4. Lysine
- 6. Methionine
8. Histidine
2. phenylalanine
3. Threonine
5. Tryptophan
7. Valine
9. Arginine

\section*{Functions of proteins}
- Provide material for growth, wear and tear of tissues.
- Maintain acid base balance
- Provide energy and stimulate metabolism.
- Transformed into CHO which may be synthesized to fat.
- Source of certain enzymes and ferments concerned in digestion.
- Antibodies which are body defence against infections are protein in nature.

\section*{Cont'd}

\section*{Protein utilization}
- Digestion starts in the stomach
- HCL of the stomach converts proteins into peptides and amino acids
- $92 \%$ of dietary protein is digested.
- Proteins of plant origin are digested in less quantity due to cellulose than those of animal origin.

\section*{Protein Requirements}
- 1 gm per kg body wt.

Extra proteins may be required to rebuild tissues after the following situations:
1.During growing phase of infancy.
2. Donation of blood.
3. Excessive menstruation.
4. Haemorrhages

\section*{5. In wasting diseases such as TB,HIV/AIDS}
6. Pregnancy and lactation.

\section*{Essential amino acids}
- 1. Isoleucine
- 3 Leucine
- 5.Lysine
- 7 Methionine
2. Phenylalanine

4 .Threonine
6 .Tryptophan
8.Valine.

\section*{Calories(Kilocalories)}
- One kilocalorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kg of water from 15 to 16 degrees Centigrade.
- The energy value of food is as follows;
- Carbohydrates -4 kcal per gm of edible portion.
- Fats-9 kcal per gm of edible portion
- Proteins-4 kcal per gm of edible portion.

\section*{Energy is required by the body for:}
- Basal body metabolism for internal body processes e.g.respiration, digestion etc when the body is at rest.
- Muscular activity.
- Utilisation of food.
- Growth and repair.

\section*{Basal body metabolism}
- It requires 40 cal per hour per squire meter of body surface in males ,37 cal in females.
- Calculation formula:
- Body surface area x $40 \times 24=$ cal per day.
i.e. Taking adult surface area of an adult as 1.75sq meters basic cal requirement will be;
$40 \times 1.75 \times 24=1700 \mathrm{cal}$.
- Extra energy is needed during stages of rapid growth for building tissues such as;
$\checkmark$ Pregnancy.
$\checkmark$ Early childhood.
$\checkmark$ Adolescence.
$\checkmark$ Lactation

\section*{Vitamins}
- Organic substances in food which are required in small amounts to act as catalysts for metabolism.

Availability-if the diet is deficient of dietary fat.

Provitamins-capable of conversion into vitamins. E.g. Carotene for vit A Bacteria in the gut:
- Normal bacteria flora in the gut can synthesize vit K
reduce absorption of vit.

\section*{Biosynthesis in the skin}

Vit D can be synthesized from the skin regularly exposed to the skin.
Requirement of vit E is increased when the intake of polyunsaturated fat is high.
Diet high in CHO or alcohol requires more thiamine for their metabolism.

\section*{UNIT 2 NUTRITION:}
- OBJECTIVES
1. Describe the sources of various foods.
2. Describe dietary requirements of various groups of people.
3. Outline various special diets.

\section*{Feeding different groups}

\section*{Infant feeding}

Breastfeeding is best for baby.
Babies must be breastfed exclusively for 6 months for the first 6 months.
After 6 months wean the baby in 3 stages; 1. Most of the nutrients will come from breast milk start other foods.
2. From ten to 18 months:

Continue with same amount of breast milk, increase the amount of other foods.
The food gradually changes to regular family foods.
- 3. From 2 yrs he gradually takes less breast milk and more family food, breastfeeding is only a snack and for comfort.
- Weaning food must be easy to eat and digest, and well balanced.
- Feed the child 4_5 times a day.

\section*{Diet in anaemia}
- Encourage the patient to take iron supplements as prescribed.
- Encourage the client to include iron rich foods in the diet i.e.
- Green leafy vegetables,liver,meats, eggs
- Encourage the patient to take foods that enhance iron absorption i.e. Foods rich in vit c and calcium

\section*{Diet in ischemic heart disease}

\section*{and hypertension and congestive cardiac failure}
- The heart does not get adequate blood supply owing to narrowing of the coronary arteries by lipids.

\section*{Proteins;}
$1 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body wt in a normal wt. Patient.

\section*{- Fats;}
- Reduce the total amount of fats, mainly saturated fats

Moderate sodium intake
$1000-1500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day
Abstaining from alcohol consumption

\section*{Cont.Ischaemic heart disease}
- $\underline{\mathrm{CHO}}$
- They are responsible for synthesis of cholesterol
- Reduce sugar intake to decrease serum triglycerides.
- Calories;
- Reduce calories and reduce wt.
- Vit C is required for capillary stability,

\section*{Ischemic heart disease cont.}
- Nicotinic acid reduces lipids in the blood.
- Adequate potassium and calcium are necessary to prevent arrhythmias.
- Salt restriction reduces hypertension of heart failure
- Avoid smoking, it produces myocardial oxygen deficiency and increases atherosclerosis and hypertension

\section*{Post operative diet.}
- Bland diet
- It is given to people who cannot handle a regular diet but not serious enough for a liquid diet.
- It is less likely to form gas than regular diets.
- These are;
- Lean meat fish poultry eggs milk,cheese

\section*{Diet in hepatic encephalopathy.}
- The client has elevation of BUN which is a product of protein metabolism
- Common in cirrhosis of the liver.
- The client requires a protein restricted diet.
- Provide enough protein to maintain nutritional status but not that which will allow the build up of waste products from protein metabolism.

\section*{Encephalopathy cont.}

- The patient may be less able to sense vibrations.
- A neurological exam may show signs of;
- Changes in the walk
- Co-ordination problems
- Decreased reflexes an drooping of the eyelids.
- Blood tests are done to measure the amount of Thiamine in the blood.
- Urine tests to see if Thiamine is passing through the urine

\section*{Treatment}
- Replace Thiamine orally or by injection
- Give other vit., they may be deficient.
- Blood tests are done to assess the outcome of the treatment
- When treated early the condition is reversible

\section*{Prevention}
- Eating foods rich in Thiamine e.g. Whole grain cereals especially breastfeeding mothers.
- Cut down or quit alcohol it interferes with absorption of vit B1
- Giving fortified foods e.g. enriched cereals
- Giving Thiamine supplements.

\section*{Complications}
- Coma
- Congestive heart failure
- Psychosis
- Death

\section*{Pellagra}
- It is a condition caused by lack of Vit. B3 (Niacin) in the diet.
- It is common to people who eat mostly maize and generally a poor diet.

\section*{Clinical Features}
- High sensitivity to sunlight(Photophobia)
- Aggression
- Dermatitis, alopecia, oedema
- Smooth, beefy red glossitis,Tongue becomes thick
- Red skin lesions
- Insomnia
- Body weakness

\section*{Pellagra cont...}

- Psycho sensory disturbances i.e. Annoying bright lights, odours intolerance causing nausea and vomiting, diziness after sudden movements
- Psychomotor disturbances(restlessness, tense and desire to quarrel, increased preparedness for motor action)
- Emotional disturbances .

\section*{Causes}
- Lack of Niacin
- Deficiency of Tryptophan (Amino acid )found in animal proteins which the body converts into Niacin
- Diseases which interfere with absorption of Niacin e.g. Diarrhea, alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver.
- Long term use of antituberculous drugs e.g. Isoniazid

\section*{Treatment}
- Supplement the diet with niacinamide by mouth or by injection-dosage $300-500 \mathrm{mg}$ od po, or inj100-250mg bd-tds
- In case of encephalopathic syndrome dosage is 1 gm po or $100-250 \mathrm{mg}$ by inj.
- Give other B complex vitamins

Prevention
- Give foods rich in Niacine.g. Meat
- liver whole grains.

\section*{Rickets}
- It is softening of the bones in children leading to fractures and deformity
Clients at risk
- Breastfed babies whose mothers are not exposed to sunlight
- Breastfed babies who are not exposed to sunlight
- Individuals who do not consume milklactose intolerant

\section*{Rickets cont...}
- If a mother has low vit D levels during pregnancy, the infant may have congenital rickets
Vit D is required for calcium absorption from the gut. Deficiency of VitD causes hypocalcaemia leading to skeletal and dental deformities

\section*{Signs in babies}
- Bones of the skull may be soft
- The fontanelles take a long time to close
- Swelling of the bones in wrists and ankles
- Chest may be deformed, swelling at the ends of the ribs

\section*{Signs in children}
- The skull may look enlarged and square shaped
- The child may learn to walk late
- Toddlers may get bowed legs
- Older children may get knock knees
- Adolescents may complain of pain in the back and legs
- Severe rickets in girls can cause pelvic deformities which can result in difficult childbirth

\section*{Osteomalacia}
- Occurs in women with Vit D deficiency
- The body cannot absorb enough calcium from the food, it uses calcium from the bones
- The bones become soft and break easily

\section*{Symptoms}
- Severe pain in the bones
- Muscle weakness
- Deformity of the pelvis leading to difficulties in childbirth
- Broken bones in people who are old and disabled

\section*{Diagnosis}
- Serum calcium and phosphorus may show low levels
- X-ray of the affected bones may show loss of calcium from the bones or changes in the structure of the bones

\section*{Treatment}
- Increase dietary intake of Vit D and phosphorus
- Expose to ultraviolet B lights
- Give fish oils and Alphacalcidol (Vit D3); Adults and children over 20 kg _1mcgm od, maintenance dose0.251 mcgm od.
- Adjust the dose according to serum calcium levels to prevent hypocalcaemia
- (A lot of Ca may go to the cell depleting the serum of calcium)
- Neonates and preterm babies 50-100 nanogm/kg per day. Children under $20 \mathrm{~kg}-50 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day

\section*{Prevention}

400IU of Vit D for infants and children. Dietary supplementation with Vit D3 for cases at risk;

- Chronic growth problems which can result in short stature
- Seizures due to hypoglycaemia
- Dental defects

\section*{Scurvy}
- It is caused by severe Vit C deficiency
- It is common to people who have no access to fresh foods
- It is due to inadequate production of collagen, an extracellular substance that binds the cells of the teeth and bones and blood capillaries
- It is essential for wound healing
- Destruction of Vit C in foods by overexposure to air or by overcooking, excessive ingestion of Vit C in pregnancy which requires the newborn to acquire large amounts of Vit C at birth
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_05_b9745c5fe631302e33c3g-140.jpg?height=342&width=323&top_left_y=1506&top_left_x=2128)

\section*{Treatment}
- Restore Vit C;
- $100-200 \mathrm{mg}$ of Vit C in mild cases
- 500 mg of Vit C/day in severe form
- Symptoms subside in 2-3 days
- Haemorrhages and bone disorders subside in 2-3 weeks

\section*{Prevention of scurvy}
- Clients unwilling to consume Vit C rich foods can take daily supplements
- Recommended daily allowance is $60 \mathrm{mg} /$ day
- Educate clients on good dietary sources of Vit C
- Educate against too much intake of Vit C,excess doses may cause nausea,diarrhea and renal stones, can also interfere with anticoagulant therapy

\section*{Complications of Scurvy}
- Malabsorption of iron leading to iron deficiency anaemia
- Internal bleeding
- Pathological fractures

\section*{Iodine Deficiency}
- Iodine is required by the thyroid gland for normal production of the thyroid hormones which are necessary for;
- Body metabolism
- Development and functioning of the human brain
- Other processes necessary for human life

\section*{Sources of iodine}
- Sea foods, fish vegetables milk, cereals

Causes of iodine deficiency
- The body does not make its own iodine, it
- must come from the food
- Deficiency of iodine in the food reduces the amount in the blood
- Consumption of goitrogens-substances in the food which reduce the amount of iodine that the thyroid gland takes from the blood e.g.cassava roots and leaves

\section*{Iodine def.cont}
- The severity of iodine deficiency depends on ;
- How much iodine is stored in the body
- How much iodine the food contains
- The presence of goitrogens in the food
- For the unborn baby how much iodine is available in the mothers blood
- For the breastfeeding baby how much iodine is available in the breast milk

\section*{Iodine cont}
- The needs of iodine are higher;
- During growth of infants, children and adolescents when the growth rate is higher
- During pregnancy and lactation

\section*{Iodine deficiency disorders}

\section*{Goitre}

It is a swelling in the thyroid gland which causes a swelling at the neck
- It can be classified as follows;
- I-Palpation Struma-in normal posture of the head it cannot be seen
- II-struma is palpable and can easily be seen
- III-Struma is very big, it causes pressure symptoms
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_05_b9745c5fe631302e33c3g-153.jpg?height=1244&width=1500&top_left_y=462&top_left_x=401)

\section*{Other classifications}
- Diffuse goitre-has spread through all the thyroid gland
- Toxic goitre-associated with high levels of the thyroid hormone
- Nontoxic(simple) goitre-associated with normal or low thyroid hormone, this can further be classified as;
- 1. Endemic 2. Sporadic

\section*{Iodine cont.}
- Non toxic goitres can start in childhood and gradually enlarge during puberty
- Can get bigger during puberty and lactation because the body requires more thyroid hormone
- In men it becomes smaller

\section*{Main symptoms}
- A swelling raging in size from a small nodule to a massive lump in front of the neck below the Adams apple.
- A feeling of tightness in the throat area
- Difficulty in breathing, coughing,sneezing,due to compression of the larynx
- Difficulty in swallowing due to compression of the oesophagus, hoarseness, neck vein distension

\section*{Treatment of Goitre}
- Iodine can reduce the size in young people with smaller goitres
- In adults with large swelling for a long time, iodine may not be effective,sugery may be the only option if it causes difficulties in swallowing and breathing

\section*{Cretinism}
- It is a congenital disease due to lack of thyroid hormone. The child has;
- Protruding tongue, thick lips, coarse brittle hair, flat nose, dwarfism
It is classified into two;
- 1. neurological
- 2. hypothyroid

\section*{Neurological Cretin}
- The baby has damage to the brain and the nervous system
- The effects may be mild to severe with physical handicaps
Clinical features;
- Deafness and mutism(cannot speak)
- Squint-eyes are not straight
- Weakness and stiffness of the legs, severe mental handicap
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_05_b9745c5fe631302e33c3g-160.jpg?height=945&width=891&top_left_y=468&top_left_x=801)

\section*{Causes}
- Maternal deficiency of iodine in early pregnancy when the baby's brain and the nervous system are developing
- There is no treatment ,the baby remains handicapped for life and may die young
- It can be prevented by giving the mother iodine before conception

\section*{Hypothyroid cretin}
- Clinical features;
- Anorexia, failure to gain wt
- Constipation
- Feels cold
- Drowsiness thick dry skin
- Hoarse cry
- Slow mental development

\section*{Cause}
- The mother may be iodine deficient in later pregnancy
- Breastfeeding may protect the baby
- After weaning the baby may get worse
- Treat the child with iodine before 1 yr of age for the treatment to be effective

\section*{Investigations for iodine deficiency}
- History and physical examination
- 24 hr urine collection will show low levels of iodine
- Blood sample will show low levels of thyroid hormone

\section*{Recommended Dietary intake of iodine}
- Adult women and men; $100-200 \mathrm{mcgm}$
- Infants- $40-50 \mathrm{mcgm}$
- Children $1-3 \mathrm{yr}-70 \mathrm{mcgm}$
- Children4-6yr-90 mcgm
- Children $7-10-120 \mathrm{mcgm}$
- Children over $11 \mathrm{yrs}-150 \mathrm{mcgm}$
- Pregnant women- 175 mcgm
- Lactating mothers-200mcgm

\section*{Treatment and prevention of iodine deficiency;}
- Iodized salt is the best long term method to give iodine
- Giving iodized oil by moth in a capsule or 1 ml to children or adults, 0.2 ml to nonbreastfeeding infants, protects for 1-2 yrs
- Giving iodine by inj. Prevents deficiency for $3-5 \mathrm{yrs}$
- Adding iodine to drinking water.

\section*{Effects of iodine deficiency in the community;}
- Delays social and economic development in the community;
1. There are more handicapped people who need care from the community
2. Domestic animals are also iodine deficient, they grow slowly and produce less
3. local people are mentally slower and less energetic and more difficult to motivate

\section*{Cont.}
- 4. Iodine deficient children are difficult to educate, are less likely to get good jobs when they grow up
- 5. Children with cretinism die young, severe ones who survive become a burden to their families and the community
- 6. A large goitre may reduce a persons chances of getting married

\section*{Nutritional Anaemia}
- Def; The blood does not have enough haemoglobin
- It is a condition in which the circulating red blood cell mass is insufficient to serve its function normally
- The task of the red blood cells is to transport oxygen bound Hb form the lungs to the tissues

\section*{WHO definition of anaemia}
- In man- Hb below $13 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Females-Hb below13
- Children 6 months to 6yrs below $11 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{dl}$
- Children 6 to 14 yrs below $12 \mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{dl}$

\section*{Clinical presentation}
- Paleness of the tongue and mucous membranes
- Breathlessness
- Anorexia
- Headaches
- Brittle fingernails
- Abdominal pains
- Angular stomatitis
- Loss of melanin from the skin pigmentation

\section*{Causes}
2. Poor absorption of iron from foods due to;
- Deficiency of Vit C which is also needed for maturation of RBCs in he bone marrow
- Copper deficiency
- High content of phytates in cereals, legumes and nuts, they bind with minerals e.g. Iron zinc, and calcium and interfere with their absorption in the body

\section*{Causes cont}
- Tannin in soya ,coffee and tea
- Calorie deficiency; $13 \%$ of iron is absorbed at $1000 \mathrm{cal}, 28 \%$ at $2000 \mathrm{cal} 40 \%$ at 3000 cal
- Vit B12,folic acid, E and B6 deficiency,
2. Decreased nutrition due to;

Famine,illness,substituting traditional foods with fast foods
3. Increased losses through bleeding

\section*{Causes}
3. Increased needs e.g. Pregnancy

Persons at risk of anaemia

- Adolescents during the growth spurt and menstruating girls
- Pregnant women
- Women with many pregnancies closely spaced
- People with chronic blood loss

\section*{Consequences of iron deficiency}
- Impaired motor development in infants and children
- Poor language development and school achievements
- Poor psychological and behaviour effects e.g. poor attention fatigue, insecurity
- Decreased physical activity in adults
- Reduced earning capacity

\section*{Cont}
- In pregnant women-increased maternal and infant morbidity and mortality
- Premature deliveries
- Low birth wt infants
- Heart failure in severe anaemia leading to death

\section*{Investigations}

History and physical examination

- 4. Control of hookworm and other intestinal parasites

Iron suplementation;Give iron supplements to groups of people at risk
- Recommendation_combined tablet of iron 60 mg and folic acid 400 mg twice a day
- Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months
- Supplement the preterm baby by 2 months of age-has no adequate stores of iron
- Dosag; $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day to a maximum of $15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day until ready for weaning with fortified cereals
Bottle-fed should receive formula containing iron $12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{l}$ and vit E10IU/I
- Children6-24 months; 12.5 mg iron and 50 mg folic acid od

\section*{Dietary modification}
- Improve absorption of iron by increasing the enhancers e.g.Vit C
- Decrease iron absorption inhibitors e.g. Tannin and phytic acid
- Increase calorie intake to increase calorie absorption by 30\%
