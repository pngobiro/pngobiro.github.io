\section*{Basic principles of asepsis}
- The use of sterile equipment for the procedure, which has been stored appropriately until use (e.g. dry, in an appropriate container, and within its expiry date).
- Avoidance of direct contact with the susceptible site.
- A 'non touch' technique - this involves the use of sterile gloves.
- Effective hand hygiene. This means using the twelvestep decontamination technique that ensures all surfaces of the hands are covered. (NHS 2008).
As an addition to this, all clinical staff that undertake ANTT must have sleeves that are short or rolled back, no wrist jewellery/watches, no false nails and no stoned rings.

\title{
Basic principles of asepsis
}
- Effectively cleaned equipment such as dressing trolleys. If in patients' homes, best practice is for any furniture/equipment that can be considered as a working field to be cleaned and dried before use.
- Appropriate use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
- Safe disposal of the used equipment at the end of the procedure.

\section*{Aseptic Dressing Technique}

Three principles of aseptic dressing technique
$\square$ Maintain asepsis
$\square$ Expose the wound for the minimum time
$\square$ Employ an efficient procedure

\section*{Indications for Aseptic Technique:}
- Care of wounds healing by primary intention, e.g. surgical incisions and fresh breaks.
- Suturing of wounds.
- Insertion of urinary catheters.
- Insertion, re-siting or dressing intravenous cannulae or other intravascular devices, such as CVP lines, Hickman lines and Arterial lines.
- Insertion of gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes.
- Insertion of tracheostomy tubes or chest drains.
- Vaginal examination using instruments (e.g. smear taking, high vaginal swabbing, colposcopy).
- Assisted delivery (e.g. forceps and ventouse).
- Biopsies.

\section*{Indications for a clean technique}

When Could a Clean Technique Be Used?
- Dressing procedures for wounds that are healing by secondary intention
such as chronic leg ulcers.
- Tracheostomy site dressings.
- Removing drains or sutures.
- Endotracheal suction.

\section*{INFECTION CONTROL}

\section*{Clean Technique}
- Clean technique refers to practises that reduce the number of infectious agents. These include:
- Personal hygiene, particularly hand washing to reduce the number of infectious agents on the skin.
- Use of barriers to reduce transmission of infectious agents
- Environmental cleaning
- Reprocessing of instruments and equipment between patient uses

\section*{Links in the Chain of Infection}
- Infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites.
- A reservoir that supports the infectious agent, allowing it to survive and multiply.
- A portal of exit that allows the infectious agent to leave the reservoir.
- A mode of spread i.e. through direct or indirect contact or via airborne droplets.
- A portal of entry - often the same route as the portal of exit e.g. the skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal, circulatory, urinary or reproductive system.
- A susceptible host - i.e. a person at risk of infection. People are more vulnerable to infection when the balance of the body's defence system is upset, due to disease or devices that breach the body's defences.
Breaking any link in the chain will assist in preventing the spread of microorganisms (ICNA 2003).

\section*{Chain of infection}

\section*{Techniques used to contribute to breaking the links of the chain}
A)Standard Precautions: hand hygiene; wearing personal, protective equipment; aseptic techniques; safe handling of sharps, waste and linen.
B) Decontamination of patient care equipment
C) Environmental cleanliness - ensuring that standards of hygiene and cleanliness adhere to local and national guidelines.

\section*{means for spread of infection}
- Direct contact - e.g. the hands of others.
- Indirect contact - objects such as instruments, clothes and equipment.
- Dust particles or droplet nuclei suspended in the atmosphere.

\section*{HAND HYGIENE}
- Hand hygiene is a means of achieving a reduction in, or removal of, visible soiling and transient or resident micro-organisms.
- Transient micro-organisms are picked up during daily activities and shed on skin scales. They can be effectively removed, or reduced to a low level by hand washing.
- Resident micro-organisms are permanently resident on the skin and can only be reduced to a low level for a short time.
- Hand washing is the single most important means of preventing the spread of health care acquired infections (HCAls).

\section*{Hand hygiene}
- Clinical Hand Wash: a 30 seconds hand wash using liquid soap or equivalent and pat hands dry using a clean paper towel.
- Surgical Hand Wash: a threeminute surgical scrub using a surgical scrub solution, eg povidoneiodine, and pat hands dry using a clean paper towel.

Document the care given and the condition of the wound.
Report any changes or abnormalities.

\section*{Dressing Changes Using Strict Aseptic Technique}

The nurse shall:
a. Observe the surgical wound dressing every shift and document status;
b. Report any signs of infection or dehiscence to the physician
immediately (redness, swelling, in duration, tenderness, separation of the incision, odor, etc.);
c. Monitor each shift for changes in skin integrity;
d. Ensure patient is turned every two (2) hours while in bed. Document turning, repositioning schedule per flow sheet or in nurses narrative notes;
e. Ensure patient changes positions while in chair or wheelchair every hour;

\section*{Stitches, Clips or Staple Removal}
- Normally stitches, clips or staples are removed within approximately 10 days of the surgical procedure unless otherwise advised by the health professional.

\section*{Staples}
- More rapidly placed
- Less foreign body reaction
- Scalp, trunk, extremities
- Do not allow for meticulous closure

\section*{Staples}
- Staples can be applied more rapidly than sutures. They are associated with a lower rate of foreign body reaction and infections.
- Able to use in scalp, on trunk and extremities. Not over joints.
- Do not allow for meticulous closure

\section*{Bandages}
- Holds a dressing in place over a wound
- Creates pressure that controls bleeding
- Helps keep the edges of the wound closed
- Secures a splint to an injured part of the body
- Provides support for an injured part of the body

\section*{Bandage is too tight if:}
- The skin around the bandage becomes pale or bluish in color (cyanotic).
- There is a bluish tinge to the nearest fingernails or toenails.
- The victim complains of pain, usually only a few minutes after you apply the bandage.
- The skin beyond the bandage (distal) is cold.
- The skin beyond the bandage (distal) is tingling or numb.

\section*{Bandage is too tight if:}
- You cannot feel the pulse beyond the bandage (distal), or it is very weak.
- Capillary refill is absent or diminished in the fingernails or toenails beyond the bandage (when you press on the nail, the nailbed does not immediately turn pink again)
- The victim cannot move his or her fingers or toes.

\section*{Bandages}
- Triangular Bandages
- Support fractures and dislocations
- Apply splints
- Form slings
- Make improvised tourniquets
- Roller Bandages

\section*{Terminology}
- Occlusive- Waterproof and airtight
- Gauze pads- Commercially manufactured, individually wrapped sterile pads made of gauze
- Special pads- Large, thickly layered bulky pads used to control bleeding and stabilize impaled objects
- Bandage- Material used to hold a dressing in place
- Triangular bandage- Triangle-shaped piece of cloth used to apply $y_{45}$ splints and form slings

\section*{Slings}
1. Place one end of the base of an open triangular bandage over the shoulder of the uninjured side.
2. Allow the bandage to hang down in front of the chest so its apex will be behind the elbow of the injured arm.
3. Bend the arm at the elbow with the hand slightly elevated (four to five inches). When possible, the fingertips should be exposed so you can monitor for impaired circulation.

\section*{Slings}
4. Bring the forearm across the chest and over the bandage.
5. Carry the lower end of the bandage over the shoulder of the injured side, and tie a square knot at the uninjured side of the neck; make sure the knot is at the side of the neck.
6. Twist the apex of the bandage and tuck it in or pin it at the elbow.

\section*{Ideal Wound Closure}
- Allow for meticulous wound closure
- Easily and readily applied
- Painless
- low risk to provider
- Inexpensive
- Minimal scarring
- Low infection rate

\section*{Sutures}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_0cd2493a1c21edb05dd8g-046.jpg?height=1041&width=785&top_left_y=637&top_left_x=392)
- Non-absorbable sutures
- Tinsel strength 60 days
- Non-reactive
- Outermost closure

\section*{Sutures}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_0cd2493a1c21edb05dd8g-047.jpg?height=1037&width=783&top_left_y=636&top_left_x=393)
- Absorbable sutures
- Synthetic > natural
- Synthetic increases wound tinsel strength
- Deeper layers
- Avoid in highly contaminated wounds
- Avoid in adipose tissue
- Synthetic \& monofilament > natural \& braided

\section*{Sutures}
- Absorbable sutures are usually used for closure of deeper structures deeper than the epidermis
- In general, synthetic sutures are less reactive and have greater tensile strength than sutures from natural sources, such as catgut. They increase the time during which the healing wound retains 50\% of its tensile strength from less than 1 week to as long as two years.
- Chromic gut lasts for up to 2 weeks and is associated with tissue reactivity

\section*{Sutures}
- Deep sutures help relieve skin tension, decrease dead space and hematoma formation, and probably improve cosmetic outcome.
- Deep sutures should be avoided in highly contaminated wounds, where they increase the risk of infection.
- Sutures through adipose tissue do not hold tension, increase infection rates, and should be avoided

- Less reactive than staples
- Use of tissue adhesive adjunct (benzoin)
- Poor outcome in areas of tension
- Seldom used for primary closure
- Use after suture removal

\section*{Adhesive Tapes}
- Surgical adhesive tapes are less reactive than staples, but they require the use of adhesive adjuncts that increase local induration and wound infection
- Tape alone cannot maintain wound integrity in areas subject to tension.
- They are seldom recommended for primary wound closure, but are often used after suture removal to decrease tension on the wound until they fall off.

\section*{Hospital-Acquired Infections}
- An infection acquired in hospital by a patient who was admitted for a reason other than that infection.
- An infection occurring in a patient in a hospital or other health care facility in whom the infection was not present or incubating at the time of admission.
- This includes infections acquired in the hospital but appearing after discharge, and also occupational infections among staff of the facility

\section*{Types of Nosocomial Infections}

The most common types of nosocomial infections are:-
- urinary infections - most common. 80\% of these infections are associated with the use of an indwelling catheter.
- surgical site infection (0.5\% to 15\%) - is indicated by the presence of purulent discharge around the wound or the insertion site of a drain, or by the presence of cellulites which is emanating from the wound. The extent of contamination during the surgery is the main risk factor. Contamination varies with the length of the procedure and the patient's general condition.
- nosocomial pneumonia

\section*{Impact of nosocomial infections}
- They are a significant burden to patients and public health.
- They are a major cause of death and increased morbidity in hospitalized patients.
- They may cause increased functional disability and emotional stress and may lead to conditions that reduce quality of life.
- Not only do they affect the general health of patients, but they are also a huge burden financially due to the increased stays that patients with nosocomial infections require.
- The increased length of stay varies from 3 days for gynecological procedures to 19.8 days for orthopedic procedures.
- Other costs include additional drugs, the need for isolation, and the use of additional studies.
- There are also indirect costs due to loss of work.

\title{
SKIN INTEGRITY AND WOUND CARE
}

\section*{SKIN INTEGRITY}
- The skin is the largest organ in the body.
- Intact skin refers to the presence of normal skin and skin layers uninterrupted by wounds.
- The appearance of the skin and skin integrity is influenced by internal factors e.g genetics, age, individual health and external factors e.g activity.

\section*{PRESSURE ULCERS}
- A pressure ulcer is any lesion caused by unrelieved pressure that results in damage to underlying tissue (U.S Public Health service's panel for the prediction and prevention of pressure ulcers in Adults \{PPPPA\}, 1992)
- Also known as decubitus ulcers, pressure sores or bed sores.

\section*{Etiology of pressure ulcers}
- Occur due to localized ischaemia.
- When blood cannot reach the tissues, the cells are deprived of oxygen and nutrients. The waste products of metabolism accumulate in the cells and the tissue consequently dies.
- Prolonged, unrelieved pressure also damages the small blood vessels.

\section*{Risk factors}
- Immobility - reduction in the amount and control of movement a person has e.g due to paralysis, weakness, pain
- Inadequate nutrition causes weight loss, muscle atrophy and loss of subcutaneous tissue
- Feacal and urinary incontinence - moisture promotes skin maceration
- Decreased mental status - e.g unconcious or heavily sedated

\section*{Risk factors}
- Diminished sensation - paralysis, stroke
- Excessive body heat - elevated body temperature increases the metabolic rate thus increasing the cells' need for oxygen
- Advanced age - brings several changes in the skin
- Chronic medical conditions e.g DM
- Other factors - poor lifting techniques, incorrect positioning, repeated injections on the same site, hard support surfaces, incorrect application of pressure - relieving devices

\section*{Nursing management}

Diagnosis
- Risk for impaired skin integrity
- Impaired skin integrity
- Impaired tissue integrity
- Risk for infection
- Pain related to nerve involvement within the tissue impairement or as a consequence of procedures used to treat the wound.

\section*{Nursing management}

\section*{Implementing}
- Support wound healing
- Nutrition and fluids
- Preventing infection
- Positioning
- Preventing pressure ulcers
- Providing nutrition
- Maintaining skin hygiene
- Avoiding skin trauma
- Providing supportive devices
- Treating pressure ulcers
- The red, yellow, black (RYB) colour code

\section*{HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS}

\section*{DEFINITION}
- A health care system is the totality of services offered by all health disciplines.
- A health care system is the organization of people, institutions, and resources to deliver health care services to meet the health needs of target populations.
- Types of health care services are described as:-
- Health promotion and illness prevention (primary prevention)
- Diagnosis and treatment (secondary prevention)
- Rehabilitation and health restoration (tertiary prevention)

\section*{OVERVIEW OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN KENYA}
- The health sector comprises the public system, with major players including the MOH and parastatal organizations, and the private sector, which includes private for-profit, NGO, and FBO facilities.
- The public health system consists of the following levels of health facilities: national referral hospitals, provincial general hospitals, district hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries.

\section*{Structure of service delivery}
- The Provincial Health Management Team (PHMT) provides supervision and management support to the districts and subdistricts within the province.
- Public health services are managed by the District Health Management Team (DHMT) and Public Health Unit of the district hospitals.
- The DHMT and District Health Management Board (DHMB) provide management and supervision support to rural health facilities (sub-district hospitals, health centres, and dispensaries).

Levels of health care delivery in the Kenya Essential Package for Health (KEPH)
- 6: Tertiary hospitals
- 5: Secondary hospitals
- 4: Primary hospitals
- 3: Health centres, maternities, nursing homes
- 2: Dispensaries/clinics
- 1: Community:

Villages/Households/Families/Individuals

\section*{COHORTS}

KEPH distinguishes six distinct life cycle stages
- Pregnancy, delivery and the newborn child (up to 2 weeks of age)
- Early childhood (3 weeks to 5 years)
- Late childhood (6 to 12 years)
- Adolescence (13 to 24 years)
- Adulthood (25 to 59 years)
- Elderly (60 years and over)

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING HEALTH CARE DELIVERY}
- Increasing number of the elderly - long term illnesses are prevalent in this group and frequently require special housing, treatment, financial support and social networks.
- Advances in technology - improved diagnostic procedures and sophisticated equipment permit early recognition of diseases that might otherwise have remained undetected.
- Economics - the health care delivery system is very much affecte by a country's total economic status.
- Women's health - the women's movement has been instrumental in changing health care practices e.g more relaxed birthing centres.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING HEALTH CARE DELIVERY}
- Uneven distribution of services - in some areas, there are insufficient health care professionals and services available to meet the health care needs of individuals.
- Access to health care - lack of access due to low income, unemployment or poverty.
- The homeless and the poor - lead to limited access to health care services.
- Demographic changes - single-parent families, cultural and ethnic diversity.

\section*{NURSING CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS}
- A nursing care delivery system defines how work is organized, how nursing staff are deployed, and who does what in providing nursing care.
- Delivery systems identify who has the accountability for nursing care and clinical outcomes.
- Delivery systems provide the organization, rules and structure that define responsibility and accountability (who does what).

\section*{Organization of care delivery}
is determined by a variety of factors such as:-
- economic issues
- leadership beliefs
- the ability to recruit and retain staff.

Ideally, evidence of the effect of care models on quality and patient safety would also be a major factor in decision-making.

\section*{Organization of care delivery}
- One important function of the professional nurse at the first-line management position of nursing service department is organizing the activities of the staff into a workable pattern to meet patient needs.

\section*{Principles of personnel assignment}

Made by the head nurse or nurse in charge for each individual nurse.

\section*{Based on:}
- a- Nursing needs of each patient and approximate time required to care for him.
- b- The capabilities, skill level, previous experience and the interest of the staff members.
- c- Job description.

\section*{Principles of personnel assignment}
- Planned weekly, and revised daily if necessary to assure continuity of care.
- Take into account all the direct, indirect and unit activities
- Consider the geographical location of the unit and the assigned duties to save nurse's time and effort.
- Must be balanced among nursing staff.
- Never to assign the same task to more than one nurse.

\section*{Process of organizing patient care}
1. Planning:

Is a process of developing a course of action for meeting the needs of patient. In planning, the head nurse decides what should be done, when, how, where, by whom and to whom.
2. Assigning:

Assignment of patient and nursing activities are written in the assignment sheet by the head nurse/nurse in charge, based on the principles of assignment.
3. Leading:

Includes issuing instructions, motivation, and coordination of activities, by making rounds, checking performance and conducting conferences.
4. Evaluating:

By reviewing nursing performance and patient progress to be compared by the assignment and nursing care plan.

\section*{Process of organizing patient care}

Examples of organizational structure:
- Technology level
- Nurse-to-patient ratio
- Use of temporary staff members
- Workload
- Nursing education/experience
- Support for professional development
- Continuing education

\section*{Process of organizing patient care}

Direct Patient Care Functions:
- Assessment
- Monitoring
- Prioritizing goals
- Care coordination
- Therapeutic interventions
- Evaluation
- Communication
- Patient education

\section*{Process of organizing patient care}

Indirect Patient Care Functions:
- Clinical practice
- Education/research
- Leadership
- Operations
- Personnel management
- Quality improvement
- System coordination

\section*{Methods of patient care delivery}

I- The traditional methods
- 1. Case method.
- 2. Functional method.
- 3. Team method.
- 4. Modular nursing.
- 5. Primary nursing method.

II - The advanced method
- Case management

\section*{CASE METHOD}

It is the oldest patient care delivery method. In this method one professional nurse assumes total responsibility of providing complete care for one or more patients (1-6) while she is on duty. This method is used frequently in intensive care units and in teaching nursing students.

\section*{Advantages of case method}
- High degree of autonomy (independence)
- Lines of responsibility and accountability are clear
- Patient receives holistic, unfragmented care

\section*{Disadvantages of case method}
- Each RN may have a different approach to care
- Not cost-effective
- Lack of RN availability

\section*{FUNCTIONAL METHOD}
- Emerged during 1950s, due to shortage of nurses. This method focuses on getting the greatest amount of tasks in the least time. In this method, the nursing care is divided into tasks and each staff member is assigned to perform one or two tasks for all patients in the unit according to the level of skill required for performance

\section*{Advantages of functional methods}
- Care is provided economically and efficiently
- Minimum number of RNs required, so it is efficient when there is a shortage in the staff or there is limited number of professional nurses
- Tasks are completed quickly
- Useful in emergency situations.

\section*{Disadvantages of functional methods}
- Care may be fragmented
- Patient may be confused with many care providers
- Caregivers feel unchallenged
- Lack of communication among the different persons who care for the patient.
- Neglecting the humanity of the patient and the individual needs of the patient will be lost in an effort to get the work done.

\section*{TEAM METHOD}
- The concept of team nursing was introduced in the early 1950s. It is a method of nursing assignment that binds professional, technical and nurse aides into small teams. This method allows for efficient utilization of technical and/or nurses aide through the direct supervision, guidance, and teaching of professional nurses.
