\section*{Lines of Resistance}
- The last boundary that protects the basic structure
- Protect the basic structure and become activated when environmental stressors invade the normal line of defense. An example: when a certain bacteria enters our system, there is an increase in leukocyte count to combat infection.
- If the lines of resistance are effective, the system can reconstitute and if the lines of resistance are not effective, the resulting energy loss can result in death.

\section*{Stressors}
- Are capable of producing either a positive or negative effect on the client system.
- Is any environmental force which can potentially affect the stability of the system:
- Intrapersonal - occur within person, example is infection, thoughts and feelings
- Interpersonal - occur between individuals, e.g. role expectations
- Extrapersonal - occur outside the individual, e.g. job or finance concerns

\section*{Stressors}
- A person's reaction to stressors depends on the strength of the lines of defense.
- When the lines of defense fails, the resulting reaction depends on the strength of the lines of resistance.
- As part of the reaction, a person's system can adapt to a stressor, an effect known as reconstitution

\section*{KEY CONCEPTS}
- Viewed the client as an open system consisting of a basic structure or central core of energy resources which represent concentric circles
- Each concentric circle or layer is made up of the five variable areas which are considered and occur simultaneously in each client concentric circles.

\section*{KEY CONCEPTS}

These are:
- Physiological - refers of bodily structure and function.
- Psychological - refers to mental processes, functioning and emotions.
- Sociocultural - refers to relationships; and social/cultural functions and activities.
- Spiritual - refers to the influence of spiritual beliefs.
- Developmental - refers to life's developmental processes.

\section*{Basic Structure Energy Resources}

This is otherwise known as the central core, which is made up of the basic survival factors common to all organisms. These include the following:
- Normal temperature range - body temperature regulation ability
- Genetic structure - Hair color and bodily features
- Response pattern - functioning of body systems homeostatically
- Organ strength or weakness
- Ego structure
- Knowns or commonalities - value system

\section*{BETTY NEUMAN}
- PERSON: A client system that is composed of physiologic, psychological, sociocultural and environmental variables.
- ENVIRONMENT: internal and external forces surrounding humans at any time.
- HEALTH: focus is on the reparative process of getting well.
- NURSING: goal is to place the individual in the best condition for good health care.

\section*{Assumptions}
- Each client system is unique, a composite of factors and characteristics within a given range of responses contained within a basic structure.
- Many known, unknown, and universal stressors exist. Each differ in it's potential for disturbing a client's usual stability level or normal LOD (Line of Defence).

\section*{Assumptions}
- The particular inter-relationships of client variables at any point in time can affect the degree to which a client is protected by the flexible LOD against possible reaction to stressors.
- Each client/ client system has evolved a normal range of responses to the environment that is referred to as a normal LOD. The normal LOD can be used as a standard from which to measure health deviation.

\section*{Assumptions}
- When the flexible LOD is no longer capable of protecting the client/ client system against an environmental stressor, the stressor breaks through the normal LOD
- The client whether in a state of wellness or illness, is a dynamic composite of the inter-relationships of the variables. Wellness is on a continuum of available energy to support the system in an optimal state of system stability.
- Implicit within each client system are internal resistance factors known as LOR, which function to stabilize and realign the client to the usual wellness state.

\section*{Assumptions}
- Primary prevention relates to principles applied in client assessment and intervention, in identification and reduction of possible or actual risk factors.
- Secondary prevention relates to symptomatology following a reaction to stressor, appropriate ranking of intervention priorities and treatment to reduce their noxious effects.

\section*{Assumptions}
- Tertiary prevention relates to adjustive processes taking place as reconstitution begins and maintenance factors move the back in circular manner toward primary prevention.
- The client as a system is in dynamic, constant energy exchange with the environment.

\section*{HILDEGARD PEPLAU}
- Interpersonal relations model
- Use of a therapeutic relationship between the nurse and the client
- Nurses enter into a personal relationship with an individual when a need is present.
- Nurse - client relationship evolves in four phases

\section*{Major Concepts}
- The theory explains the purpose of nursing is to help others identify their felt difficulties.
- Nurses should apply principles of human relations to the problems that arise at all levels of experience.
- Peplau's theory explains the phases of interpersonal process, roles in nursing situations and methods for studying nursing as an interpersonal process.

\section*{Major Concepts}
- Nursing is therapeutic in that it is a healing art, assisting an individual who is sick or in need of health care.
- Nursing is an interpersonal process because it involves interaction between two or more individuals with a common goal.

\section*{Major Concepts}
- The attainment of goal is achieved through the use of a series of steps following a series of pattern.
- The nurse and patient work together so both become mature and knowledgeable in the process.

\section*{HILDEGARD PEPLAU}

PHASES
1. ORIENTATION: the client seeks help and the nurse assists the client to understand the problem and extent of the need for help.
2. IDENTIFICATION: the client assumes a posture of dependence, interdependence and independence in relation to the nurse.
3. EXPLOITATION: The client derives full value from what the nurse offers through the relationship. Power shifts from nurse to client.
4. RESOLUTION: old needs and goals are put aside and new ones adopted.

\section*{Factors influencing orientation phase}

\section*{HILDEGARD PEPLAU}
- To clients fufill their needs, nurses assume many roles, teacher, leader, counsellor
- Peplau's model continues to be used by clinicians when working with individuals who have psychologic problems.

\section*{HILDEGARD PEPLAU}
- Person: A developing organism that tries to reduce anxiety caused by needs.
- Environment: Existing forces outside the organism and in the context of culture
- Health: A word symbol that implies forward movement of personality and other ongoing human processes in the direction of creative, constructive, productive, personal and community living.
- Nursing: A significant therapeutic interpersonal process. It functions cooperatively with other human process that make health possible for individuals in communities.

\section*{Roles of nurse}
- Stranger: receives the client in the same way one meets a stranger in other life situations provides an accepting climate that builds trust.
- Teacher: who imparts knowledge in reference to a need or interest
- Resource Person : one who provides a specific needed information that aids in the understanding of a problem or new situation
- Counselors : helps to understand and integrate the meaning of current life circumstances ,provides guidance and encouragement to make changes

\section*{Roles of nurse}
- Surrogate: helps to clarify domains of dependence interdependence and independence and acts on clients behalf as an advocate.
- Leader : helps client assume maximum responsibility for meeting treatment goals in a mutually satisfying way

\section*{Assumptions}
- Both nurse and patient want an interpersonal relationship
- The patient is able to participate in an interpersonal relationship
- The interpersonal relationship will enhance self maturity and/or self fulfillment
- The patient has a felt need

\section*{Unitary Human Being (person)}
- A unitary human being is an "irreducible, indivisible, pan dimensional (four-dimensional) energy field identified by pattern and manifesting characteristics that are specific to the whole and which cannot be predicted from knowledge of the parts" and "a unified whole having its own distinctive characteristics which cannot be perceived by looking at, describing, or summarizing the parts"

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}
- Nursing :science of unitary, irreducible, human beings update (Rogers 1990)
- Vision of space based nursing (Rogers 1990)

Overview of Rogerian model
- Rogers conceptual system provides a body of knowledge in nursing.
- Rogers model provides the way of viewing the unitary human being.
- Humans are viewed as integral with the universe.
- The unitary human being and the environment are one, not dichotomous
- Nursing focus on people and the manifestations that emerge from the mutual human /environmental field process

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}
- Change of pattern and organization of the human field and the environmental field is propagated by waves
- The manifestations of the field patterning that emerge are observable events
- The identification of the pattern provide knowledge and understanding of human experience
- Basic characteristics which describes the life process of human: energy field, openness, pattern, and pan dimensionality
- Basic concepts include unitary human being, environment, and homeodynamic principles

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

\section*{Concepts of Rogers model Energy field}
- The energy field is the fundamental unit of both the living and nonliving
- This energy field "provide a way to perceive people and environment as irreducible wholes"
- The energy fields continuously varies in intensity, density, and extent.

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

\section*{Openness}
- The human field and the environmental field are constantly exchanging their energy
- There are no boundaries or barrier that inhibit energy flow between fields

\section*{Pattern}
- Pattern is defined as the distinguishing characteristic of an energy field perceived as a single waves
- "pattern is an abstraction and it gives identity to the field"

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

Pan dimensionality
- Pan dimensionality is defined as "non linear domain without spatial or temporal attributes"
- The parameters that human use in language to describe events are arbitrary.
- The present is relative, there is no temporal ordering of lives.

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

\section*{Homeodynamic principles}
- The principles of homeodynamic postulates the way of perceiving unitary human beings
- The fundamental unit of the living system is an energy field
- Three principles of homeodynamics
- Resonancy
- Helicy
- integrality

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

Resonance
- Resonance is an ordered arrangement of rhythm characterizing both human field and environmental field that undergoes continuous dynamic metamorphosis in the human environmental process

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

\section*{Helicy}
- Helicy describes the unpredictable, but continuous, nonlinear evolution of energy fields as evidenced by non repeating rhythmicities
- The principle of Helicy postulates an ordering of the humans evolutionary emergence
Integrality The mutual, continuous relationship of the human energy field and the environmental field .

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}
- Changes occur by the continuous repatterning of the human and environmental fields by resonance waves
- The fields are one and integrated but unique to each other
- Nursing Paradigms

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

\section*{Environment}
- The environment is an "irreducible, pan dimensional energy field identified by pattern and integral with the human field"
- The field coexist and are integral.
- Manifestation emerge from this field and are perceived.

\section*{Environment}

\section*{Health}
- "an expression of the life process; they are the "characteristics and behavior emerging out of the mutual, simultaneous interaction of the human and environmental fields"
- Health and illness are the part of the same continuum.

\section*{Environment}
- The multiple events taking place along life's axis denote the extent to which man is achieving his maximum health potential and very in their expressions from greatest health to those conditions which are incompatible with the maintaining life process

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

\section*{Nursing}
- Two dimensions Independent science of nursing
- An organized body of knowledge which is specific to nursing is arrived at by scientific research and logical analysis
- Art of nursing practice:
- The creative use of science for the betterment of the human
- The creative use of its knowledge is the art of its practice
- Nursing exists to serve people.

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}
- It is the direct and overriding responsibility to the society
- The safe practice of nursing depends on the nature and amount of scientific nursing knowledge the individual brings to practice.......the imaginative, intellectual judgment with which such knowledge is made in service to the man kind.

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}

\section*{APPLICATION}
- Changes occur by the continuous repatterning of the human and environmental fields by resonance waves
- The fields are one and integrated but unique to each other
- Nursing Paradigms/ shift

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}
- The Science of Unitary Human Beings provides a radical vision of nursing reality.
- It provides a framework for nursing practice, education and research that promises a move away from the previously predominant medical model approach to the delivery of nursing care.

\section*{MARTHA ROGERS}
- The framework provides an alternative to the traditional view of nursing which could be described as reductionistic, mechanistic and analytic.
- It has been said that it has "guided nursing out of a concrete, static, closed system world view" (Smith, 1989) and as a result has started to challenged many preconceived ideas about nursing.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

\section*{Introduction}
- Imogene King - born in 1923.
- Bachelor in science of nursing from St. Louis University in 1948
- Master of science in nursing from St. Louis University in 1957
- Doctorate from Teacher's college, Columbia University.
- Theory of goal attainment was first introduced by Imogene King in the early 1960's.
- Theory describes a dynamic, interpersonal relationship in which a person grows and develops to attain certain life goals.
- Factors which affects the attainment of goal are: roles, stress, space \& time

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

\section*{Basic assumptions}
- Nursing focus is the care of human being
- Nursing goal is the health care of individuals \& groups
- Human beings: are open systems interacting constantly with their environment.
- Basic assumption of goal attainment theory is that nurse and client communicate information, set goal mutually and then act to attain those goals, is also the basic assumption of nursing process

\section*{IMOGENE KING}
- "Each human being perceives the world as a total person in making transactions with individuals and things in environment"
- "Transaction represents a life situation in which perceiver \& thing perceived are encountered and in which person enters the situation as an active participant and each is changed in the process of these

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

\section*{Major Concepts}
- Interacting systems:
- personal system
- Interpersonal system
- Social system

Concepts are given for each system

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Concepts for Personal System
- Perception
- Self
- Growth \& development
- Body image
- Space
- Time

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Concepts for Interpersonal System
- Interaction
- Communication
- Transaction
- Role
- Stress

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Concepts for Social System
- Organization
- Authority
- Power
- Status
- Decision making

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Propositions of King's Theory
- If perceptual interaction accuracy is present in nurse-client interactions, transaction will occur
- If nurse and client make transaction, goal will be attained
- If goal are attained, satisfaction will occur
- If transactions are made in nurse-client interactions, growth \& development will be enhanced

\section*{IMOGENE KING}
- If role expectations and role performance as perceived by nurse \& client are congruent, transaction will occur
- If role conflict is experienced by nurse or client or both, stress in nurse-client interaction will occur
- If nurse with special knowledge skill communicate appropriate information to client, mutual goal setting and goal attainment will occur.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Human being/person
- Human being or person refers to social being who are rational and sentient.
- Person has ability to :
- perceive
- think
- feel
- choose
- set goals
- select means to achieve goals and
- to make decision

\section*{IMOGENE KING}
- Human being has three fundamental needs:
- The need for the health information that is unable at the time when it is needed and can be used
- The need for care that seek to prevent illness, and
- The need for care when human beings are unable to help themselves.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}
2. Health
- Health involves dynamic life experiences of a human being, which implies continuous adjustment to stressors in the internal and external environment through optimum use of one's resources to achieve maximum potential for daily living.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

\section*{3. Environment}
- Environment is the background for human interactions.
- It involves:
- Internal environment: transforms energy to enable person to adjust to continuous external environmental changes.
- External environment: involves formal and informal organizations. Nurse is a part of the patient's environment.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}
4. Nursing
- Definition: "A process of action, reaction and interaction by which nurse and client share information about their perception in nursing situation." and " a process of human interactions between nurse and client whereby each perceives the other and the situation, and through communication, they set goals, explore means, and agree on means to achieve goals."
- Action: is defined as a sequence of behaviors involving mental and physical action.
- Reaction: which is considered as included in the sequence of behaviors described in action.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}
- Goal of nurse: "To help individuals to maintain their health so they can function in their roles."
- Domain of nurse: "includes promoting, maintaining, and restoring health, and caring for the sick, injured and dying.
- Function of professional nurse: "To interpret information in nursing process to plan, implement and evaluate nursing care..

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

\section*{Theory of Goal Attainment and Nursing Process}

\section*{Assessment}
- King indicates that assessment occur during interaction.
- The nurse brings special knowledge and skills whereas client brings knowledge of self and perception of problems of concern, to this interaction.
- During assessment nurse collects data regarding client
- Perception is the base for collection and interpretation of data.
- Communication is required to verify accuracy of perception, for interaction and transaction.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Nursing diagnosis
- The data collected by assessment are used to make nursing diagnosis in nursing process.
- According to king in process of attaining goal the nurse identifies the problems, concerns and disturbances about which person seek help.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Planning
- After diagnosis, planning for interventions to solve those problems is done.
- In goal attainment planning is represented by setting goals and making decisions about and being agreed on the means to achieve goals.
- This part of transaction and client's participation is encouraged in making decision on the means to achieve the goals.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

Implementations
- In nursing process implementation involves the actual activities to achieve the goals.
- In goal attainment it is the continuation of transaction.

\section*{IMOGENE KING}

\section*{Evaluation}
- It involves to finding out weather goals are achieved or not.
- In king's description, evaluation speaks about attainment of goal and effectiveness of nursing care.

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Ida Jean Orlando - born in 1926.
- wrote about the nursing process.
- Nursing diploma - New York Medical College
- BS in public health nursing - St. John's University, NY,
- MA in mental health nursing - Columbia University, New York.
- Associate Professor at Yale School of Nursing and Director of the Graduate Program in Mental Health Psychiatric Nursing.
- Project investigator of a National Institute of Mental Health grant entitled: Integration of Mental Health Concepts in a Basic Nursing Curriculum.
- published in her 1961 book, The Dynamic Nurse-Patient Relationship and revised 1972 book: The Discipline and Teaching of Nursing Processes
- A board member of Harvard Community Health Plan.

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Major Dimensions
- The role of the nurse is to find out and meet the patient's immediate need for help.
- The patient's presenting behavior may be a plea for help, however, the help needed may not be what it appears to be.
- Therefore, nurses need to use their perception, thoughts about the perception, or the feeling engendered from their thoughts to explore with patients the meaning of their behavior.
- This process helps nurse find out the nature of the distress and what help the patient needs.

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}

\section*{CONCEPTS}
- Function of professional nursing organizing principle
- Presenting behavior - problematic situation
- Immediate reaction - internal response
- Nursing process discipline investigation
- Improvement - resolution

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Function of professional nursing - organizing principle
- Finding out and meeting the patients immediate needs for help
- "Nursing....is responsive to individuals who suffer or anticipate a sense of helplessness, it is focused on the process of care in an immediate experience, it is concerned with providing direct assistance to individuals in whatever setting they are found for the purpose of avoiding, relieving, diminishing or curing the individuals sense of helplessness." Orlando

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Presenting behavior - problematic situation
- To find out the immediate need for help the nurse must first recognize the situation as problematic
- The presenting behavior of the patient, regardless of the form in which it appears, may represent a plea for help
- The presenting behavior of the patient, the stimulus, causes an automatic internal response in the nurse, and the nurses behavior causes a response in the patient

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Immediate reaction - internal response
- Person perceives with any one of his five sense organs an object or objects
- The perceptions stimulate automatic thought
- Each thought stimulates an automatic feeling
- Then the person acts

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Nursing process discipline - investigation
- Any observation shared and explored with the patient is immediately useful in ascertaining and meeting his need or finding out that he is not in need at that time
- The nurse does not assume that any aspect of her reaction to the patient is correct, helpful or appropriate until she checks the validity of it in exploration with the patient
- The nurse initiates a process of exploration to ascertain how the patient is affected by what she says or does .
- When the nurse does not explore with the patient her reaction it seems reasonably certain that clear communication between them stops

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Improvement - resolution
- It is not the nurses activity that is evaluated but rather its result : whether the activity serves to help the patient communicate her or his need for help and how it is met.
- In each contact the nurse repeats a process of learning how to help the individual patient.

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}

\section*{ASSUMPTIONS}
- When patients cannot cope with their needs without help, they become distressed with feelings of helplessness
- Patients are unique and individual in their responses
- Nursing offers mothering and nursing analogous to an adult mothering and nurturing of a child
- Nursing deals with people, environment and health
- Patient need help in communicating needs, they are uncomfortable and ambivalent about dependency needs

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- Human beings are able to be secretive or explicit about their needs, perceptions, thoughts and feelings
- The nurse - patient situation is dynamic, actions and reactions are influenced by both nurse and patient
- Human beings attach meanings to situations and actions that are not apparent to others
- Nurses are concerned with needs that patients cannot meet on their own
- When patients cannot cope with their needs without help, they become distressed with feelings of helplessness.

Nursing, in its professional character, does add to the distress of the patient.
Patients are unique and individual in their responses.
Nursing offers mothering and nursing analogous to an adult mothering and nurturing of a child.
Nursing deals with people, environment and health.
Patient need help in communicating needs, they are uncomfortable and ambivalent about dependency needs.
Human beings are able to be secretive or explicit about their needs, perceptions, thoughts and feelings.
The nurse - patient situation is dynamic, actions and reactions are influenced by both nurse and patient.
Human beings attach meanings to situations and actions that are not apparent to others.
Patient's entry into nursing care is through medicine.
The patient cannot state the nature and meaning of his distress for his need without the nurses help or without her first having established a helpful relationship with him.

Any observation shared and observed with the patient is immediately useful in ascertaining and meeting his need or finding out that he is not in need at that time.

Nurses are concerned with needs that patients cannot meet on their own.

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- CHARACTERISTICS OF THE THEORY
- Orlando's theory interrelate concepts
- Orlando's theory has a logical nature
- Orlando's theory is simple and applicable in the daily practice.
- Orlando's theory contribute to the professional knowledge.
- Orlando's theory is applicable in clinical practice

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}
- STRENGTHS
- Use of her theory assures that patient will be treated as individuals and that they will have active and constant input into their own care
- Prevents inaccurate diagnosis or ineffective plans because the nurse has to constantly explore her reactions with the patient
- Assertion of nursing's independence as a profession and her belief that this independence must be based on a sound theoretical frame work
- Guides the nurse to evaluate her care in terms of objectively observable patient outcome
- Strengths:

Use of her theory assures that the patient will be treated as individuals and they will have an active and constant input into their own care.

Assertion of nursing's independence as a profession and her belief that this independence must be based on a sound theoretical frame work.

Guides the nurse to evaluate her care in terms of objectively observable patient outcomes.

\section*{Weaknesses:}

Lack the operational definitions of society or environment which limits the development of research hypothesis.

The theory focuses on short term care, particularly aware and conscious individuals and on the virtual absence of reference group or family members.

\section*{IDA JEAN ORLANDO}

\section*{CONCLUSION TO THEORY}
- Orlando's Deliberative Nursing Process Theory focuses on the interaction between the nurse and patient, perception validation, and the use of the nursing process to produce positive outcomes or patient improvement. Orlando's key focus was to define the function of nursing. (Faust C., 2002)
- Orlando's theory remains one the of the most effective practice theories available.
- The use of her theory keeps the nurse's focus on the patient.
- The strength of the theory is that it is clear, concise, and easy to use.
- While providing the overall framework for nursing, the use of her theory does not exclude nurses from using other theories while caring for the patient.

\section*{Summary}
- Florence Nightingale's Legacy of caring Focuses on nursing and the patient environment relationship.
- Virginia Henderson's Definition of Nursing
- Patients require help towards achieving independence.
- Derived a definition of nursing
- Identified 14 basic human needs on which nursing care is based.

\section*{Summary}
- Faye G.Abedellah's Typology of twenty one Nursing problems - Patient's problems determine nursing care
- Lydia E. Hall :Care, Cure, Core model - Nursing care is person directed towards self love.
- Jean Watson's Philosophy and Science of caring- Caring is a universal, social phenomenon that is only effective when practiced interpersonally considering humanistic aspects and caring. Caring is central to the essence of nursing.

- Three Theories:
- Theory of Self-Care
- Theory of Self-Care Deficit
- Theory of Nursing Systems
- Nursing Care:
- Wholly compensatory (doing for the patient)
- Partly compensatory (helping the patient do for himself or herself)
- Supportive- educative (Helping patient to learn self care and emphasizing on the importance of nurses' role

\section*{Summary}

Martha E.Roger's: Science of unitary human beings
- Person and environment are energy fields that evolve negentropically
- Nursing is a basic scientific discipline
- Nursing is using knowledge for human betterment.
- The unique focus of nursing is on the unitary or irreducible human being and the environment (both are energy fields) rather than health and illness

\section*{Summary}

Dorothy E.Johnson's Behavioural system model
- Individuals maintain stability and balance through adjustments and adaptation to the forces that impinges them.
- Individual as a behavioural system is composed of seven subsystems: the subsystems of attachment, or the affiliative, dependency, achievement, aggressive, ingestive-eliminative and sexual.
- Disturbances in these causes nursing problems.

\section*{Summary}

Sister Callista: Roy's Adaptation model
- Stimuli disrupt an adaptive system
- The individual is a biopsychosocial adaptive system within an environment.
- The individual and the environment provide three classes of stimuli-the focal, residual and contextual.
- Through two adaptive mechanisms, regulator and cognator, an individual demonstrates adaptive responses or ineffective responses requiring nursing interventions

\section*{Summary}

Betty Neuman's : Health care systems model
- Neuman's model includes intrapersonal, interpersonal and extrapersonal stressors.
- Nursing is concerned with the whole person.
- Nursing actions (Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary levels of prevention) focuses on the variables affecting the

\section*{Summary}

Imogene King's Goal attainment theory
- Transactions provide a frame of reference toward goal setting.
- Major concepts (interaction, perception, communication, transaction, role, stress, growth and development)
- Perceptions, Judgments and actions of the patient and the nurse lead to reaction, interaction, and transaction (process of nursing).

\section*{Summary}

Nancy Roper, WW.Logan and A.J.Tierney A model for nursing based on a model of living
- Individuality in living.
- A conceptual model of nursing from which theory of goal attainment is derived.
- Living is an amalgam of activities of living (ALs).
- Most individuals experience significant life events which can affect ALs causing actual and potential problems.
- This affects dependence - independence continuum which is bi-directional.
- Nursing helps to maintain the individuality of person by preventing potential problems, solving actual problems and helping to cope.

\section*{Summary}

Hildegard E. Peplau: Psychodynamic Nursing Theory
- Interpersonal process is maturing force for personality.
- Stressed the importance of nurses' ability to understand own behaviour to help others identify perceived difficulties.
- The four phases of nurse-patient relationships are:
- 1. Orientation
-2. Identification
-3. Exploitations
-4. Resolution
- The six nursing roles are:
-1. Stranger
- 2. Resource person
- 3. Teacher
- 4. Leader
- 5. Surrogate
-6. Counselor
- Interpersonal process alleviates distress.

\section*{Summary}

Ida Jean Orlando's Nursing Process Theory
- Nurses must stay connected to patients and assure that patients get what they need, focused on patient's verbal and non verbal expressions of need and nurse's reactions to patient's behaviour to alleviate distress.
- Elements of nursing situation:
- Patient
- Nurse reactions
- Nursing actions

\section*{Summary}

Nola J.Pender's :The Health promotion; model
- Promoting optimum health supersedes disease prevention.
