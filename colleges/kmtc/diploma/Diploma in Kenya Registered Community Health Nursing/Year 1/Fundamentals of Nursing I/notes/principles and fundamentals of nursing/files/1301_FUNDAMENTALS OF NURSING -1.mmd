\section*{Palpation of the Breast}

Normal Findings:
- No lumps or masses are palpable.
- No tenderness upon palpation.
- No discharges from the nipples.
- NOTE: The male breasts are observed by adapting the techniques used for female clients. However, the various sitting position used for woman is unnecessary.

\section*{BREAST EXAM - Part 1}
- With the patient in the sitting position, ask patient to lower the gown so that both breasts are visible. Inspect the appearance of the skin, size and dimpling of the breasts, and contour of the breasts.
- Instruct patient to raise arms outstretched above the head and examine each breast for dimpling, contour changes, and skin discoloration.
- Instruct patient to hold hands against hips, press inward, and instruct patient to lean forward. Inspect again for dimpling.
- Palpate the axillary nodes in the following four areas:
- 1) anterior axillary fold;
- 2) posterior axillary fold;
- 3) along the proximal humerus; and
- 4) deep in the axillary vault. (This should be done with patient's arm relaxed.)
- *Note: This examination should be performed on bare skin, not over the gown.

\section*{BREAST EXAM - Part 2}
- Instruct patient to lie down supine. Instruct patient to raise the ipsilateral arm above the head.
- Use the middle three digits of your dominant hand to palpate the breast starting at the top of the breast on the side of the sternum. Repeat on the opposite breast.

\section*{BREAST EXAM - Part 2}
- *Note: You must use 3 types of pressure while palpating, starting with a light pressure, then a medium pressure, then a firm pressure on each area covered. Fingers must never lose contact with the skin of the breast.
- *Recommended Technique: The "strip" technique - with your fingers never losing contact with the breast, descend from top to bottom and bottom to top in vertical lines until all regions (including the nipple as part of the breast tissue) have been palpated.

GORDON'S TYPOLOGY OF 11 FUNCTIONAL HEALTH PATTERNS
}

\section*{GORDON'S TYPOLOGY OF 11 FUNCTIONAL HEALTH PATTERNS}
- Marjorie Gordon (1987) proposed functional health patterns as a guide for establishing a comprehensive nursing data base.
- These 11 categories make possible a systematic and standardized approach to data collection, and enable the nurse to determine the aspects of health and human function:
- They provide a framework for assessment, nursing diagnoses, and a plan of care.

\section*{FUNCTIONAL HEALTH PATTERNS}
1. HEALTH PERCEPTION/ HEALTH MANAGEMENT PATTERN - describes the client's perceived pattern of health and well being and how health is managed.
2. NUTRITIONAL/ METABOLIC PATTERN describes the client's pattern of food and fluid consumption relative to metabolic need and pattern indicators of local nutrient supply.

\section*{FUNCTIONAL HEALTH PATTERNS}
3. ELIMINATION PATTERN - describes the patterns of excretory function (bowel, bladder and skin)
4. ACTIVITY/ EXERCISE PATTERN - describes the pattern of exercise, activity, leisure and recreation.

CRITICAL THINKING

\section*{OBJECTIVES}
- By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:-
i. Define critical thinking.
ii. State the importance of critical thinking in nursing.
iii. Describe the skills applied in critical thinking.
iv. Outline the factors affecting critical thinking.
v. Explain the attitudes that foster critical thinking.
vi. Describe the application of critical thinking in nursing practice.
- What makes the thinking of a nurse different from a dentist or an engineer?
- It is how we view the patient and the types of problems we deal with in practice.

\title{
If we can't think critically, we become part of problem!
}

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing and / or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication as a guide to belief and action (Paul, 2001).
- Purposeful thinking that aims to make judgments based on evidence (AlfaroLeFevre, 2000)

\section*{Definitions Of Critical Thinking}

It is thinking that defines its purposes and goals well; thinking that frames a question or problem precisely; thinking that carefully checks information for its completeness and relevance; thinking that is sensitive to ideas and concepts; thinking that can trace implications and consequences; thinking that can appreciate multiple perspectives and ways of looking at things. It is, in short, thinking done in such a way as to be disciplined and self-correcting. (Paul, 1995)

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Critical thinking underlies independent and interdependent decision-making. It includes questioning, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, inference, inductive and deductive reasoning, intuition, application and creativity (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 1998).

\section*{Why Focus on Critical Thinking?}
- The nurses are expected to accept more responsibilities, collaborate with diverse individuals, and make more independent decisions.
- Nurses are often involved in complex situations that require in-depth thinking.
- We must view ourselves as knowledge workers, who are thought-oriented rather than task orientated.
- Critical Thinking is the key to prevent and resolve problems.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL THINKING}
- Critical thinking in nursing is an essential tool to effectively treat patients. Nurses are expected to use critical thinking to solve client problem and make better decisions.
- Critical thinking, problem solving and decision making are interrelated processes.
- Critical thinking is essential to safe, competent, skillful nursing practice.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL THINKING}
- Nurses use knowledge from other subjects and fields e.g nutrition, physiology
- Nurses deal with change in stressful environments. Treatments, medications and technology change constantly, therefore routine actions may not be adequate.
- Critical thinking enables the nurse to recognize important cues and adapt interventions to meet specific client needs.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF CRITICAL THINKING}
- Nurses make important decisions e.g they must use good judgment to decide which observations must be reported to the physician immediately and which ones can be addressed later.

\section*{Novice Thinking Compared with Expert Thinking}

\section*{Novice Nurse}
- Knowledge is stored separate facts. structured.
- Focus much on actions. things before acting.
- Need clear-cut rules. the rules.

\section*{Expert Nurse}

Collect more depth
}

\section*{CREATIVITY}
- Creativity is a major component of critical thinking. It is thinking that results in the development of new ideas and products.
- Creative thinkers must have knowledge of the problem e.g knowledge of normal growth and development will help build on the knowledge and come up with a creative solution.

\section*{CREATIVITY}

Using creativity, nurse:-
- Generate many ideas rapidly
- Are generally flexible (able to change viewpoints)
- Create original solutions to problems
- Tend to be independent and selfconfident even when under pressure
- Demonstrate individuality

\section*{The Nature of Critical Thinking Characteristics}
- Critical Thinking is Rational.
- Critical Thinking is Reflective.
- Critical Thinking is inquisitive.
- Critical Thinking is Autonomous.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING CRITICAL THINKING}
- Many factors influence thinking e.g cognitive function, physical state, amount of sleep or rest, nutrition and fluid and electrolyte balances.
- The person's age, gender, developmental level, learning style, anxiety, attitude and preparation level also affect thinking.

\section*{SKILLS IN CRITICAL THINKING}
1. CRITICAL ANALYSIS
- It is the application of a set of questions to a particular situation or idea to determine essential information and ideas and discard superfluous information and ideas.

\section*{SKILLS IN CRITICAL THINKING}

\section*{Socratic questions:}
- Socratic questioning is a technique one can use to look beneath the surface, recognize and examine assumptions, search for inconsistencies, examine multiple points of view and differentiate what one knows from what merely believes.

\section*{SKILLS IN CRITICAL THINKING}

\section*{2. INDUCTIVE REASONING}
- Generalizations are made from a set of facts or observations. When viewed together, certain bits of information suggest a particular interpretation. e.g the nurse who observes that a client has dry skin, poor turgor, sunken eyes and dark amber urine may make a generalization that the client appears

\section*{SKILLS IN CRITICAL THINKING}

\section*{3. DEDUCTIVE REASONING}
- Is reasoning from the general to the specific. The nurse starts with a conceptual framework and makes descriptive interpretations of the client's needs basing on that frame work e.g basing Maslow's hierarchy of needs the nurse can categorize the client's problems in terms of elimination, nutrition and protection

\section*{Critical Thinking Attitude}
- Fair-mindedness
- Intellectual humility
- Intellectual integrity
- Intellectual perseverance
- Intellectual empathy
- Intellectual courage
- Intellectual curiosity

\section*{ATTITUDES THAT FOSTER CRITICAL THINKING}
- Independence of thought - critical thinking requires that individuals think for themselves.
- Fair-mindedness - critical thinkers assess all view-points with the same standards and not basing their judgments on personal or group bias or prejudice.
- Insight onto egocentricity and sociocentricity - critical thinkers are open into the possibility that their personal biases or social pressures and customs could duly affect their thinking.

\section*{ATTITUDES THAT FOSTER CRITICAL THINKING}
- Intellectual humility and suspension of judgment - means having an awareness of the limits of one's own knowledge
- Intellectual courage - with an attitude of courage, one is willing to consider and examine fairly one's own ideas and views.
- Integrity - requires that individuals apply the same rigorous standards of proof to their own knowledge and beliefs as they apply to the knowledge and beliefs of others.
- Perseverance - this determination enables them clarify concepts and sort out related issues in spite of difficulties and frustrations.

\section*{ATTITUDES THAT FOSTER CRITICAL THINKING}
- Confidence in reasoning - well reasoned thinking will lead to trustworthy conclusions.
- Interest in exploring both thoughts and feelings - a critical thinker knows that emotions can influence thinking and that often feelings underlie thoughts.
- Curiosity - the internal conversation going on within the mind of a critical thinker is filled with questions.

\section*{APPLYING CRITICAL THINKING TO NURSING PRACTICE}
- Nurses function effectively some part of everyday without thinking critically e.g selecting which uniform to wear or deciding what to eat. However, the high order skills of critical thinking are put in play as soon as a new idea is encountered or a less-than-routine decision must be made.
- The Nursing Process is a systematic, rational method of planning and providing individualized care. Paul and Elder (1995) identified elements of thought and applied to the nursing process.

\section*{APPLYING CRITICAL THINKING TO NURSING PRACTICE}

PROBLEM SOLVING
- The nurse obtains information that clarifies the nature of the problem and suggests possible solutions.
- Problem solving for one situation contributes to the nurse's body of knowledge for problem solving in a similar situation.
WAYS
1. Trial and error - trying a number of approaches
2. Intuition - experience

\section*{APPLYING CRITICAL THINKING TO NURSING PRACTICE}

DECISION - MAKING
- Nurses make decision in the course of problem solving or other situations e.g confidentiality, prioritizing, time management.
- Is a critical thinking process for choosing the best actions to meet the desired goal.

\end{tabular}

\section*{QUESTION GUIDE TO LOGICAL THINKING}

Described by lyer et all., (1995). These questions are in sequence:
* What is the issue?
* What information do I need and how do I get it?
* Are my data valid?
*What do the data mean, based on the facts?
*What should I do?
*Are there other questions I should ask?
*Is this the best way to deal with the issue?
- The nursing process is generally viewed as a tool for planning and providing patient care.

\section*{PARTS OF THINKING (Paul, 2001)}

All reasoning
1. Has a purpose
2. Is an attempt to figure something out
3. Is based on assumptions
4. Is done from some point of view
5. Is based on data, information and evidence
6. Is expressed through, and shapred by concepts and ideas
7. Leads somewhere and has implications and consequences.

\section*{Pitfalls of critical thinking}

\section*{Illogical Process}
1. Critical thinking fails as a process when logic is not used. A common fallacy arises from using a circular argument. For example, a nurse might write the nursing diagnosis "Ineffective coping, as evidenced by inability to cope." This does not define the problem, it simply makes a circle.
2. Another illogical process is called appeal to tradition. This is the argument that we have "always done it this way." New strategies and creative approaches are ignored.
3. Errors in logic also occur when the thinker makes hasty generalizations without considering the evidence. The critical thinker does not jump to conclusion.

\section*{Pitfalls of critical thinking}

\section*{Bias}
1. Everyone has biases. Critical thinkers examine their biases and do not allow them to compromise the integrity of their thinking processes.
2. Biases can interfere with patient care. For example, if we believe patients with alcoholism are manipulative, when the patient complains of anxiety, we ignore their complaint and miss the signs of delirium tremens.

\section*{Pitfalls of critical thinking}

Closed-Mindedness
1. The close-minded individual ignores alternative points of view.
2. Input from experts, patients, and significant others is ignored.
3. This results in limited options and the decreased use of innovative ideas.

\section*{Clinical reasoning}
- Clinical reasoning - a specific term - usually refers to ways of thinking about patient care issues (determining, preventing, and managing patient problems).
- For reasoning about other clinical issues (e.g., teamwork, collaboration, and streamlining work flow), nurses usually use the term critical thinking .

\section*{Clinical judgment}
- Clinical judgment refers to the result (outcome) of critical thinking or clinical reasoning the conclusion, decision, or opinion you make.
