                        <p>Pain is a highly unpleasant and very personal sensation that cannot be shared with others.</p>
                        <p>It can occupy all of a person's thinking, direct all activities and change a person's life.</p>
                        <p>It is more than a symptom of a problem.</p>
                        <p>Presents both physiologic and psychologic dangers to health and recovery</p>
                        <p>Pain is usually transitory, lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed, but some painful conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, may persist for years.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TYPES OF PAIN</h3>
                        <p>Pain may be acute or chronic. Acute pain is severe and lasts a relatively short time. It is usually a signal that body tissue is being injured in some way, and the pain generally disappears when the injury heals. Chronic pain may range from mild to severe, and is present to some degree for long periods of time.</p>

                        <p>Non-pharmacological pain management is the management of pain without medications. This method utilizes ways to alter thinking and focus to decrease pain.</p>

                        <ul>

                                <p><strong>Psychological:</strong> The unexpected is always worse because of what one imagines. Ways to accomplish this include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Explain each step of a procedure in detail, utilizing simple pictures or diagrams when available.</li>
                                    <li>Meet with the person who will perform the procedure and ask questions ahead of time.</li>
                                    <li>Tour the room where the procedure will take place.</li>
                                    <li>may observe a videotape, which describes the procedure</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Hypnosis:</strong> With hypnosis, a professional (such as a psychologist or physician) guides the child into an altered state of consciousness that helps him/her to focus or narrow their attention, in order to reduce discomfort.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Imagery:</strong> Guiding a child through an imaginary mental image of sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and feelings can often help shift attention away from the pain.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Distraction:</strong> Distraction can be helpful particularly for babies, by using colorful, moving objects. Singing songs, telling stories, or looking at books or videos can distract preschoolers. Older children find watching TV or listening to music helpful. Distraction should not be a substitute for explaining what to expect.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Relaxation:</strong> Children can be guided through relaxation exercises such as deep breathing and stretching, to reduce discomfort.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Exercise:</strong> physical exertion with the aim of training or improvement. Includes the McKenzie method, water therapy, flexion exercises, aerobic routines. Exercise is necessary for proper cardiovascular health, disc nutrition, and musculoskeletal health.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Manual techniques:</strong> manipulation of affected areas by means of chiropractic adjustments, osteopathy, massage therapy and other techniques.</p>

                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Behavioral modification:</strong> use of behavioral methods to optimize patient responses to back pain and painful stimuli. Cognitive therapy involves teaching the patient to alleviate back pain by means of relaxation techniques, coping techniques, and other methods.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Cutaneous stimulation:</strong> superficial heating or cooling of skin. These pain management methods include cold packs and hot packs, and should be used in conjunction with exercise.</p>

                                <p><strong>Electrotherapy:</strong> the most commonly known form of electrotherapy is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). TENS therapy attempts to reduce back pain by means of a low-voltage electric stimulation that interacts with the sensory nervous system.</p>
