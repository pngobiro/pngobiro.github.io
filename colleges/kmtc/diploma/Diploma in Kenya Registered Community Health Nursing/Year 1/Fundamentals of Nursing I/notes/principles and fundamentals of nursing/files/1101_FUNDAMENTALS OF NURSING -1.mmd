\section*{DYING AND DEATH}
- Death is defined as the cessation of all vital functions of the body including the heartbeat, brain activity (including the brain stem), and breathing. It can arrive unannounced at any time and is not the special province of the very aged.
- Dying is the final portion of the life cycle for all of us. Providing excellent, humane care to patients near the end of life, when curative means are either no longer possible or, no longer desired by the patient, is an essential part of nursing and medicine.

\section*{Concept of death and dying}
- The concept of death is developed over time as the person grows, experiences various losses and thinks about concrete and abstract concepts.

\section*{Concept of death and dying}
- Death is universal. all living things die.
- Death is inevitable, there is no way of escaping death. Nor is there any way of predicting the exact timing of death - it can occur at anytime.
- Death is irreversible. If a life form is truly dead it cannot be resuscitated or made alive again. Death is final.
- Death involves the cessation of all physiological functions. All signs of life cease.
- Death occurs because of biological reasons and biological death marks the end of our existence.

\section*{Signs of death}
- Cessation of breathing
- Cardiac arrest (No pulse)
- Pallor mortis, paleness which happens in the 15120 minutes after death
- Livor mortis, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body
- Algor mortis, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline
- Rigor mortis, the limbs of the corpse become stiff and difficult to move or manipulate
- Decomposition, the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

\section*{Signs of death}

The official signs of death include the following:
- no pupil reaction to light
- no response of the eyes to caloric (warm or cold) stimulation
- no jaw reflex (the jaw will react like the knee if hit with a reflex hammer)
- no gag reflex (touching the back of the throat induces vomiting)
- no response to pain
- no breathing

\section*{Development of the concept of}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Nooth} \\
\hline Age & Beliefs/ attitudes \\
\hline Infancy -5 years & Does not understand, believes death is reversible, a temporary departure or sleep \\
\hline 5-9 years & Understands death is final, believes own death can be avoided, associates death with aggression or violence \\
\hline 9-12 years & Understands death is inevitable end of life. begins to understand own mortality \\
\hline 12-18 years & Fears a lingering death, seldom thinks about death but views it in religious and philosophic terms \\

\hline 45-65 years & Accepts own mortality, encounters death of parents and some peers. Experiences peaks of death anxiety \\
\hline 65+ vears & Fears prolonaed illness, encounters death of \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Legalities related to death}
- Advance health care directives - legal documents that allow persons to specify aspects of care they wish to receive should they become unable to make or communicate their preferences.
- Autopsy/ postmortem - performed only in certain certain cases.
- Certification of death - formal determination/ pronouncement of death must be performed by a physician.

\section*{Legalities related to death}
- Do-Not-Resuscitate orders - physicians may order for clients who are in stage of terminal, irreversible illness or expected death.
- Euthanasia (Mercy killing) - the act of painlessly putting to death persons suffering from incurable or distressing disease.
- inquest - legal inquiry into the cause of death.
- Organ donation - people 18+ years may make a gift of all or any part of their bodies for medical/dental education, research, therapy or transplantation

\section*{Nursing management}

The nurse will be most successful communicating with families of dying patients if she or he:
- Reinforces interdisciplinary communication
- Ensures that physicians are aware of communication gaps
- Listens as much as speaks
- Acknowledges emotions
- Makes assurances about patient comfort

\section*{Planning care of the dying person}
- Schedule time to be available to client.
- Offer to contact clergy.
- Balance the client's need for independence and need for assistance.
- Respect the client's confidentiality.
- Answer all questions and provide factual information to client and family.

\section*{Spiritual needs of the dying:}
- Communicating empathy
- Playing music
- Using touch
- Praying with the client
- Contacting the clergy if requested by the client
- Reading religious literature aloud at the client's request

\section*{Meeting the Psychosocial Needs of the Terminally III Client}

\section*{Anxiety}
- A combination of factors contribute - Spend as much time as possible with the dying client.
- To anxiety of the dying client and family: Encourage verbalization of feelings.
- Client's fear of death (and the loss of the known world) Listen in nonjudgmental manner.
- Caregiver's fear of loss of the loved one - Answer all questions in an honest, factual manner.
- Client's sense of abandonment by the family, friends, and health care providers - Provide explanation of all procedures.
- Loss of independence and social isolation - Encourage family and friends to spend time with client.

\section*{Informing relatives}
- It is the responsibility of the senior nurse to contact relatives and ask them if they wish to attend. He/ she should feel confident, knowledgeable and competent to do so and should:
- give name, title and where he/she is calling from
- determine the identity of the person to whom you are speaking to
- explain that the client's condition has worsened

\section*{Informing relatives}
- stay calm and speak in a controlled manner
- use short sentences offering small pieces of information
- pause to allow the receiver of the call time to comprehend
- urge the individual to come to the hospital and reassure that care is being given. Ask if they require you to contact any other persons on their behalf such as a priest or other religious leaders
- document time and nature of information given and the name of the recipient(s).

\section*{Helping arriving relatives}

Grief reactions may differ:
- be prepared and avoid being judgmental
- words of comfort are often difficult to find; sincerity is generally the best course of action
- active listening is often the best approach as this allows for reminiscing and/or expression of emotions.

\section*{Helping arriving relatives}
- Those receiving notification of a sudden unexpected death may show severe emotional reactions.
- Encouraging survivors to view the deceased can seem quite brutal; however, this can help to reinforce the reality of the event and assist subsequent grieving.
- Consider the likely effect of showing personal emotion. It may or may not be appropriate depending upon the circumstances surrounding the actual/impending death.

\section*{Post-mortems}
- Post-mortems may only be carried out with written consent of relatives unless the death occurs in suspicious circumstances or occurred without prior medical intervention.

\section*{Organ Donation}
- The donation of organs for transplantation is a matter that requires compassion and sensitivity from the caregivers.
- Health care institutions are required to have policies related to the referral of potential donors to organ procurement agencies.
- It is important that families of the deceased know the importance of and process for organ donation.
- The following organs and tissues are used for transplantation:
- Kidneys
- Heart
- Lungs
- Liver
- Pancreas
- - Skin
- Corneas
- Bones (long bones and middle ear bones)

\section*{Accounting for valuables}
- Be aware of local policy.
- All valuables should be identified, accounted for and sent for safe-keeping as soon as is reasonably practical, in keeping with local policy.
- Any jewellery left on the deceased should be taped, and details noted on the appropriate documentation.
- A second responsible person should always be called on as witness when accounting for client property whether the client is deceased or otherwise.

\section*{Accounting for valuables}
- No valuables or other client property should be given to relatives prior to full documentation and a signature of receipt should be obtained.
- It is usual to ask relatives to collect the deceased's belongings when they
come to collect the Medical Certificate of Death. This allows time to parcel the property more appropriately and thus reduce the potential for further distress.

\section*{Last Offices}
- Last Offices means 'caring for the body after death'. It is the final expression of caring a nurse can undertake for their client.
- It is also essential to maintaining a safe environment and ensuring safe passage of the body.

\section*{Last Offices}
- Specific needs in relation to Last Offices can vary according to the client's cultural and religious practices. It is therefore important to elicit the wishes of the client and of the relatives prior to death if at all possible, and to make sure that these wishes are clearly documented in the client's records and adhered to.
- Two staff working quietly together should normally undertake this procedure, paying due regard to legal requirements including health and safety issues as appropriate
- it is advisable to perform Last Offices prior to Rigor mortis occurring, as movement and positioning will otherwise be impossible.

\section*{Equipment}
- Wash bowl
- Soap and towel(s)
- Disposable wipes
- Shaving materials as required (electric shaving is preferable to avoid damage
- to the skin)
- Toothbrush/toothpaste/oral hygiene pack
- Brush/comb
- Spigots and/or clamps (if necessary)
- Adhesive tape
- Occlusive tape and wound dressings if required
- Disposable gloves and aprons
- Clinical waste bag
- Clean linen and laundry skip
- Shroud or clean attire in keeping with deceased's/relatives' cultural/religious
- preferences
- Property book and envelope for valuables
- Legal documents; care records, medical notes, identification bands, death
- labels, notification-of-death forms
- Body bag if required (see special precautions)

\section*{Hospice Care}
- Hospice, a type of care for the terminally ill, is founded on the concept of allowing individuals to die with dignity and be surrounded by those who love them.

\section*{HEALTH ASSESSME \\ NT}

Accurate diagnosis rests firmly upon the foundation of a thoughtful and inclusive history and a competently performed physical examination.

\section*{Health Assessment}
1. Part of Nursing Process
2. Nurses use physical assessment skills to:
a) Develop (obtain baseline data) and expand the data base from which subsequent phases of the nursing process can evolve
b) To identify and manage a variety of patient problems (actual and potential)
c) Evaluate the effectiveness of nursing care
d) Enhance the nurse-patient relationship
e) Make clinical judgments

HISTORY
TAKING

\section*{Definition of Health History Systematic collection of subjective data which stated with client, and objective data which} observed by the nurse.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_f6ab4601d7fc6db9deeag-034.jpg?height=776&width=766&top_left_y=1082&top_left_x=1712)

\section*{History taking}
- Good history taking is an important first step in treating the patient. Each person will develop their own style and technique, but a good interview will likely include the basic elements discussed below.
- Remember you are treating a patient, not their condition. The better you understand your patient, the better your treatment plan will be and the more likely you will be to get good patient compliance.

\section*{History taking}
- History taking is a key component of patient assessment, enabling the delivery of high-quality care.
- Understanding the complexity and processes involved in history taking allows nurses to gain a better understanding of patients' problems.
- Care priorities can be identified and the most appropriate interventions commenced to optimize patient outcomes.

\section*{Specific goals}
- Gather, synthesize, organize and communicate "data" effectively
- Build differential diagnoses
- Actively participate in patient care

\section*{Phases of taking health history}

Two phases:-
*The interview phase
*The recording phase

\section*{Guidelines for Taking Nursing History}
- Private, comfortable, and quiet environment.
$\Rightarrow$ Allow the client to state problems and expectations for the interview.
$\Rightarrow$ orient the client the structure, purposes, and expectations of the history.

\section*{Guidelines for Taking Nursing History cont.}
- Communicate and negotiate priorities with the client
$\Rightarrow$ Listen more than talk.
- Observe non verbal communications e.g. "body language, voice tone, and appearance".

Guidelines for Taking Nursing History cont..
*Review information about past health history before starting interview.
*Balance between allowing a client to talk in an unstructured manner and the need to structure requested information.
* Clarify the client's definitions (terms \& descriptors)

\section*{Guidelines for Taking Nursing History cont..}
*Avoid yes or no question (when detailed information is desired).
*Write adequate notes and record soon after interview.

\section*{Types of Nursing Health History}
* Complete health history: taken on initial visits to health care facilities.
*Interval health history: collect information in visits following the initial data base is collected.
*Problem- focused health history: collect data about a specific problem

\section*{The Setting:}
- The setting is important because it creates the environment in which you and the patient must interact.
- The environment will greatly influence how comfortable the patient feels during the process and how complete and informative the patient's answers will be. It is normal to expect patients to experience some degree of anxiety during an initial interview.

\section*{The Setting:}
- Check your seating position - make sure your seating is no higher than eye level. Patients are very uncomfortable having to look up while talking and are actually most comfortable while looking slightly down.
- Be aware of your body language - avoid body positions that are defensive or withdrawn.
- Be aware of eye contact, too much and too little are both bad. Watch your vocabulary - don't overwhelm the patient with highly technical terminology they don't understand; at the same time, don't talk down to the patient.
- Lastly, a warm hand shake is a very comforting gesture towards a new patient and it's also a nice way to conclude the visit.

\section*{The Setting:}
- Respect for the patient as an individual is an important feature of assessment, and this includes consideration of beliefs and values and the ability to remain non-judgmental and professional.
- Respect also involves maintenance of privacy and dignity; the environment should be private, quiet and ideally, there should be no interruptions. When this is not possible the nurse should do everything possible to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATI ON

A nurse must have a respect for his/ her own calling, because God's precious gift of life is often literally placed in his/ her hands; He/ she must be a sound, and close, and quick observer.
-Florence Nightingale

\section*{Purposes of physical assessment}

Physical assessment of a patient serves many purposes:
1. Screening of general well-being. The findings will serve as baseline information for future assessments.
2. Validation of the complaints that brought the patient to seek health care.
3. Monitoring of current health problems.
4. Formulation of diagnoses and treatments.

\section*{Indications}
- Routine assessment
- On admission
- Pre-requisite to planning care

\section*{Role of the Nurse}
- The professional nurse plays a vital role in the assessment of patient problems.
- For example, a nurse in primary care may perform a comprehensive physical assessment of patients, while a critical care nurse may conduct selected patient assessments to monitor and evaluate current health problems.
- Nurses are expected to be familiar with and comfortable using physical assessment skills.
- Nurses require information in order to make clinical decisions.

\section*{Measurements}
- Body measurements include length or height, weight, and head circumference for children from birth to 36 months of age. Thereafter, body measurements include height and weight.
- The assessment of hearing, speech and vision are also measurements of an individual's function in these areas.
- A patient's measurements can be compared with a standard, expected, or predictable measurement for age and gender. Deviation from standards helps identify significant conditions requiring close monitoring or referral to a physician or pediatric nurse practitioner.
