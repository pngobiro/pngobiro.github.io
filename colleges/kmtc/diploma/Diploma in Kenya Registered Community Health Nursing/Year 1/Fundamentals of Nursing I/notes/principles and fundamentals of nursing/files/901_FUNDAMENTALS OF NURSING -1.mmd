ASSISTING PATIENTS WITH ELIMINATION

\section*{Elimination}
- Elimination patterns are essential to maintain health.
- The urinary and gastrointestinal systems together provide for the elimination of body wastes. The urinary system filters and excretes urine from the body, thereby maintaining fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.
- Normal bowel function provides for the regular elimination of solid wastes.

\section*{Elimination}
- During periods of stress and illness, clients experience alterations in elimination patterns.
- Nurses assess for changes, identify problems, and intervene to assist clients with maintaining proper elimination patterns.
- The nurse's role encompasses teaching clients self-care activities to promote independence and health.

\section*{Elimination}
- Elimination is normally a private function done without assistance.
- However, during periods of immobility and illness, assistance is needed.
- The main focus of the nurse is to provide maximum comfort and privacy to lessen the client's embarrassment.

\section*{Factors affecting elimination}
- Age - A client's age or developmental level will affect control over urinary and bowel patterns. Infants initially lack a pattern to their elimination. Control over bladder and bowel movements can begin as early as 18 months of age but is typically not mastered until age 4.
- Diet - Adequate fluid and fiber intake are critical factors to a client's urinary and bowel health. Inadequate fluid intake is a primary cause of constipation. Diarrhea and flatulence (discharge of gas from the rectum) are a direct result of foods ingested, and clients need to be educated as to which foods and fluids promote healthy elimination and which foods may inhibit it.

\title{
Factors affecting elimination
}
- Exercise - enhances muscle tone, which leads to better bladder and sphincter control. Peristalsis is also aided by activity, thus promoting healthy bowel elimination patterns.
- Medications - can have an impact on a client's elimination health and patterns and should be assessed during the health history interview. Cardiac clients, for instance, are commonly prescribed diuretics, which increase urine production.
Antidepressants and antihypertensives may lead to urinary retention. Some over-the-counter (OTC) cold remedies, especially antihistamines, may also result in urinary retention.

\section*{Assessment of elimination patterns}
- Many people, consider incontinence to be a hygienic rather than a health concern.
- Parents may view incontinence in children to be a form of misbehavior.
- Some adults consider incontinence to be a form of childlike or infantile behavior, or they may believe that urinary or fecal leakage is an inevitable consequence of aging.

\section*{Assessment of elimination patterns}
-When screening questions concerning altered patterns of elimination reveal significant findings, the interview should be expanded to include specific questions about the nature of the elimination disorder.
- The physical examination for elimination patterns focuses on functional issues associated with urinary or fecal incontinence and assesses the perineal and perianal areas.

\section*{Urinary eliminatio}
n

\section*{Urinary elimination}
- Continence in the adult requires anatomic integrity of the urinary system, nervous control of the detrusor muscle, and a competent sphincter mechanism.
- Urinary incontinence occurs when abnormalities of one or more of these factors causes an uncontrolled loss of urine that produces social, physiological, or hygienic difficulties for the client.

\section*{Common urinary elimination alterations}
- Urinary retention
- Urinary incontinence (stress, total, acute)

\section*{Managing altered urinary elimination}
- Ensure adequate daily fluid intake ( $15 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{lb}$ body weight).
- Reduce or avoid bladder irritants.
- Reduce alcohol consumption.
- Stop smoking.
- Teach pelvic muscle exercises to women (Kegel exercises).

\section*{Urinary Retention}
- The state in which the individual experiences incomplete emptying of the bladder.
- Major characteristics for urinary retention include bladder distension and small, frequent voiding or absence of urine output.
- Minor characteristics include sensation of bladder fullness, dribbling, residual urine, dysuria, and overflow incontinence.
- High urethral pressure caused by weak detrusor, inhibition of reflex arc, strong sphincter, and blockage are related factors for urinary retetion.

\section*{Common Causes of Urinary Retention}
- Bladder outlet
- Prostatic enlargement obstruction
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia
- Prostate cancer
- Prostatitis
- Bladder neck dyssynergia
- Urethral stricture
- Urethral tumor (rare)

\section*{Total Urinary Incontinence}
- Total Urinary Incontinence is the state in which an individual experiences a continuous and unpredictable loss of urine.
- Major characteristics include constant flow of urine occurring at unpredictable times without distension, uninhibited bladder contractions or spasms, unsuccessful incontinence refractory treatments, and nocturia.

\section*{Total Urinary Incontinence}
- Related factors include neuropathy that prevents transmission of the reflex that indicates bladder fullness, neurologic dysfunction causing triggering of micturition at unpredictable times, independent contraction of the detrusor reflex owing to surgery, trauma, or disease that affects spinal cord nerves, or anatomy (fistula).

\section*{Urinary catheterization}
- Urinary catheterization is an aseptic procedure but is also the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections, which can occur during insertion or removal of the catheter.
- Repeated catheterization causes trauma and results in infection.
- Patients should be catheterized only if clinically indicated

\section*{Urinary catheterization}
- It is important to use the correct urinary catheter for the condition. Foley catheters require no more than $5-10 \mathrm{ml}$ water.
- The balloon can cause obstruction and stasis of the urine if it is too large, thus increasing the risk of infection.

\section*{Catheterization}
- Occasionally, an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter may be used to provide continuous drainage for reflex incontinence.
- An indwelling catheter may be inserted for an acute episode of urinary retention or when other strategies to manage retention are ineffective. A catheter is chosen that minimizes urethral irritation and maximizes drainage from the bladder.

\section*{Coudé Catheter}
- The use of a coudé catheter is indicated when intermittent catheterization is needed.
- The coudé catheter works much like the other catheters; however, a distinguishing feature is that the tip of the catheter is more pointed and curved.
- The coudé catheter does not have a balloon; therefore it cannot be used for a procedure requiring an indwelling catheter.

\section*{Urethral catheterization}
- Urethral catheterization is a procedure that involves introducing a flexible rubber (latex, silicone, or Teflon) tube through the urinary opening (urethra) into the bladder.

There are two types of urethral catheterization.
- In straight, or short-term, urethral catheterization, a catheter is inserted only long enough to drain the bladder of urine and is then removed.
- In indwelling catheterization, a specialized catheter is inserted into the bladder for an extended period (days to weeks) to allow continuous drainage of urine into a collection bag.

\section*{Urethral catheterization}
- Indications for urethral catheterization include:
- To drain the bladder prior to, during, or after surgery
- For investigations
- To relieve retention of urine
- To accurately measure the urine output
- To relieve urinary incontinence when no other means is practical

\section*{Urethral catheterization}

\section*{CONTRA-INDICATIONS}

Nurses should not perform catheterisation without first seeking medical advice on the following:-
- Patients who have a history of urethral stricture
- Patients who have undergone trans-urethral resection of the prostate gland in the previous 48 hours
- Patients with a phimosis (tight foreskin)
- Patients who have a past history of difficulty in catheterisation
- Undiagnosed haematuria
- Urinary tract infection with clinical symptoms

\section*{Urethral catheterization}
- Equipment
- Dressing trolley
- Catheterization pack and drapes
- Sterile gloves
- Appropriate size catheter (see catheter size guideline below)
- Xylocaine jelly syringe (plain sterile lubricant for infants)
- Sterile water for balloon
- 5 ml Syringe
- Specimen jar
- Antiseptic solution. Aqueous Chlorhexidine $0.1 \%$ with Cetrimide (yellow solution) or Aqueous Chlorhexidine $0.1 \%$ (blue solution).
- Tape to secure catheter to leg
- Drainage bag
- Urine bag holder

\section*{Catheterization Procedure}
- Environment
- Explain the procedure to the patient/ child and the parents and obtain consent
- The bed is screened to ensure privacy
- Keep the patient warm at all times
- Ensure adequate light source

\section*{Catheterization Procedure}
1. Prepare the client for catheterization by reviewing the procedure. Reassure the client that catheterization will not produce a sharp pain; instead, inform the client that catheterization will produce sensations of intense urgency to urinate and pressure centered on the urethral and suprapubic area.
2. Documentation of the amount of water used to inflate the retention balloon assists when removing the indwelling catheter.
3. A catheter should be constructed of silicone or a Lubricious coating to minimize urethral trauma and irritation.

\section*{Catheterization}
- NOTE: The procedure for a straight catheterization (not indwelling) is the same.
- However, the catheter is inserted only long enough to obtain a urine specimen or to completely drain the bladder.

\section*{Catheterization}

\section*{BALLOON SIZE}
- Use the smallest balloon size possible. This keeps residual urine minimal, reduces the likelihood of bladder spasm, and minimizes damage to the bladder neck from the weight of the balloon
- Balloon sizes: 5-30 mls. The most commonly indicated balloon size is 10 ml . Always inflate the balloon to the manufacturers recommended volume indicated on the inflation valve of the catheter as well as written on the packaging.
- The 30 ml balloon is designed specifically as a haemostat post urological procedure, and should not be used for routine catheterisation
- - Inflate with sterile water. Air is not suitable as it will cause the balloon to float. Tap water is not sterile, and saline may block the inflation channel with crystals, making subsequent deflation difficult

\section*{Performing catheterization: Female client}

\section*{Action}
2. Assist the client to a supine position with legs spread and feet together or to a side-lying position with upper leg flexed.
3. Drape client's abdomen and thighs.
4. Ensure adequate lighting of the perineum.
6. Separate the perineum and, using forceps, cleanse the periurethral mucosa with a povidone-iodine or other antimicrobial cleanser
7. Generously coat the distal portion of the catheter with water-soluble, sterile lubricant.
8. Gently insert the catheter into meatus until urine is noted.

\section*{Rationale}
2. Facilitates visualization of area and promotes client comfort.
3. Promotes client comfort and warmth.
4. Facilitates proper execution of technique.
6. Removes dirt and minimizes the risk of urinary tract infection by removing surface pathogens. 7. Avoids urethral trauma and discomfort during catheter insertion.

\section*{Action}
6. Stretch the shaft of the penis and unroll the condom to the base of the penis.
Follow product directions for the application of the sealant.
7. Attach the condom to the drainage apparatus, either a leg bag or bedside drainage bag.
8. Remove gloves and wash hands.
9. Remove and reapply the condom catheter every 24 to 48 hours, or when leakage occurs.

\section*{Rationale}
6. The condom is applied over the entire penile shaft to maximize a watertight seal; the adhesive may be built into the wall of the condom, or a dual-sided sealant strip may be used to prevent leakage.
7. Ensures adequate urine containment.
8. Reduces the risks of contamination.
9. Regular reapplication allows routine inspection of the penile skin and avoids bacterial overgrowth and altered skin integrity under the condom.

\title{
Emptying the Drainage Bag
}

INDICATIONS
1. To dispose of urine
2. To monitor urinary output
3. To prevent reflux to kidneys. (Leg bag should be emptied when two third full)

\section*{Emptying the Drainage Bag}

\section*{REQUIREMENTS}
- Disposable plastic apron
- Non-sterile disposable gloves as per Glove Guidelines
- Clean container for urine (KEPT FOR THIS PURPOSE ONLY) e.g. Measuring jug/urinal
- Tissue/Paper towel
- Disposal bag as per Clinical Waste Guidelines

\section*{Emptying the Drainage Bag}
- This should be done wearing non-sterile gloves and via the drainage tap at the bottom of the bag. When the bag is empty, the tap should be closed securely and wiped with a tissue.
- If the bag does not have a tap, then replace it when full. Do not disconnect the bag to empty and then reconnect it.
- Wash and dry hands thoroughly after touching the drainage bag.
- With proper handling, drainage bags with taps can be left in situ for long periods and are more cost-effective in the long run.
- A separate urine bag-collecting receptacle must be used for each patient and each bag should be emptied separately as required.

\section*{Emptying the Drainage Bag}
- Hand hygiene and cleaning of periurethral area before insertion of a sterile catheter.
- Maintenance of a closed drainage system.
- Hand hygiene before and after emptying bags.

\section*{Documentation}

The procedure is documented in the child's medical record. The documentation should be signed by the person inserting the catheter. Documentation should include:
- Indication for catheterization
- Time and date of procedure
- Type of catheter.
- Size of catheter
- Expiry date of catheter
- Amount of water in balloon
- Any problems with insertion

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}
- Procedure and time done.
- Size of catheter.
- Amount of urine output.
- Color and character of urine.
- Client's response and how tolerated.
- Description of urine, colour and volume
- Specimen collected
- Review date

\section*{Ongoing nursing management}
- Measure urine output hourly and document
- Normal urine output is $0.5-1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{hr}$. Report any variation from this
- If oliguric ensure catheter is not blocked
- No routine change of urinary catheter or drainage bag is necessary. Change for clinical indicators if infection, obstruction or if system disconnects or leaks. Replace system and/or catheter using aseptic technique and sterile equipment
- Maintain unobstructed urine flow. Gravity is important for drainage and prevention of urine backflow. Ensure the drainage bag is below the level of the bladder, is not kinked and is secured
- Urine for urinalysis or culture should be collected fresh from sampling port of catheter tubing (not drainage bag). Clean port with disinfectant first

\section*{Ongoing nursing management}
- Drainage system
- Adherence to a sterile continuously closed method of urinary drainage has been shown to markedly reduce the risk of acquiring a catheter associated infection
- Hygiene
- Daily warm soapy water is sufficient meatal care or PRN if build up of secretions is evident
- Uncircumcised boys should have the foreskin gently eased down over the catheter after cleaning

\section*{Ongoing nursing management}
- Infection surveillance
- Consider daily the need for the indwelling catheter to remain insitu. Remove as soon as no longer required to reduce risk of UTI
- Cloudy, offensive smelling or unexplained blood stained urine is not normal and needs further investigation
- Full Ward Test (dipstick) should be done each day. This test can detect urinary protein, blood, nitrates
- Specimen collection
- Large volumes e.g. 24 hr collection, can be collected from drainage bag
- Record fluid balance.

\section*{Complications}
- Inability to catheterize
- Urethral injury from trauma sustained during insertion or balloon inflation in incorrect position
- Haemorrhage
- False passage
- Urethral strictures following damage to urethra. This may be a long term problem
- Infection
- Psychological trauma
- Paraphimosis due to failure to return foreskin to normal position following catheter insertion

\section*{CATHETERISATION OF A PATIENT WITH A SUPRA-PUBIC CATHETER}

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Insertion of a catheter into the bladder through the anterior wall of the abdomen using an aseptic technique.

\section*{CAUTION}
- Previous difficulties that have required medical assistance
- Blood clotting disorder

\section*{CATHETERISATION OF A PATIENT WITH A SUPRA-PUBIC CATHETER}

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR SUPRA-PUBIC CATHETERISATION}
- When it is not possible for a urethral catheter to be inserted e.g. stricture
- Where limb contractures make urethral catheter insertion and management difficult
- Improved patient comfort for wheelchair dependent patients and easier management of catheter change
- Minimises urethral trauma and development of mega urethra
- May be more acceptable in patients who are sexually active
- Can improve lifestyle of patient
- Where it is patients preferred choice
- Post operatively for bladder drainage or to monitor residual urine volume

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR SUPRAPUBIC CATHETERISATION}
- To relieve acute urinary obstruction where a urethral catheter cannot be inserted into the bladder eg. urethral stricture
- To relieve chronic urinary retention eg enlarged prostate
- Relieve chronic retention of the neurogenic bladder
- For clients who require long-term catheterisation, who are sexually active, in a wheelchair, or have persistent problems with urethral catheters.
- During and following pelvic or urological surgery

\section*{Bladder washout, irrigation and instillation}
- "manual washout or bladder lavage" is defined as the washing out of the bladder with sterile fluid and "bladder irrigation" as the
- continuous washing out of the bladder with sterile fluid.
- One indication of Bladder instillations is to prevent or treat catheter blockages.
- Instillation treatments are not limited to saline or citric acid solutions; there are some others such as chemotherapy drugs (i.e. mitomycin-C or epirubicin) or antiinflammatory drugs (i.e. hyaluronic acid), to reduce toxicity of brachytherapy or vesicoureteral reflux.

\section*{Bowel Elimination}
- Continence primarily relies on the consistency of the stool (fecal material), intestinal motility, compliance and contractility of the rectum, and competence of the anal sphincters.

\section*{Feacal elimination}
- Elimination of the waste products from the body is essential to health.
- Defeacation (bowel movement) is the expulsion of feaces from the anus and rectum.
- Normal feaces are made up of about 75\% water and 25\% solid mass.
- Feaces are normally brown due to presence of stercobilin and urobilin. Also action of bacteria e.g E. coli or staphylococci which are normally present present in the large intestine.

- Activity - poor activity leads to constipation
- Psychologic factors - anxiety or anger increase peristaltic action. In depression, it is slow
- Defeacation habits - defeacating at a regular time
- Medications - can interfere with normal elimination
- Diagnostic procedures - colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy

\section*{Factors that affect defeaction}
- Anaesthesia and surgery - cause normal colonic movements to cease or slow by blocking parasympathetic stimulation to the muscles of the colon.
- Pathologic condition - spinal injuries can decrease the sensory stimulation for defeacation
- Pain - clients who experience discomfort when defeacating often suppress the urge to defeacate to avoid pain.

\section*{Feacal elimination problems}
- Constipation - fewer than three bowel movements per week
- Diarrhoea - passage of liquid feaces and an increased frequency of defeacation
- Bowel incontinence - loss of voluntary ability to control feacal and gaseous discharges through the anal sphincter
- Flatulence - presence of excessive flatus in the intestines that leads to stretching and inflation of the intestines

\section*{Diarrhea}
- Diarrhea is the state in which an individual experiences a change in normal bowel habits characterized by the frequent passage of loose, fluid, unformed stools.
- Defining characteristics include abdominal pain, cramping, increased frequency, increased frequency of bowel sounds, loose or liquid stools, and urgency.
- Other possible characteristics include change in color of stools. Gastrointestinal, metabolic, nutritional, or endocrine disorders; infectious processes; tube feedings; fecal impaction; change in dietary intake; adverse affects of medications; and high stress levels may all contribute to diarrhea.

\section*{Bowel Incontinence}
- A state in which an individual experiences a change in normal bowel habits characterized by involuntary passage of stool.
- Related factors may include gastrointestinal and neuromuscular disorders, colostomy, loss of rectal sphincter control, and impaired cognition.

\section*{Fecal incontinence}
- Fecal incontinence is the involuntary loss of stool of sufficient magnitude to create a social or hygienic problem.
- The primary mechanisms that predispose the adult to incontinence of stool are dysfunction of the anal sphincter, disorders of the delivery of stool to the rectum, disorders of rectal storage, and anatomic defects.

\section*{Fecal incontinence}
- A disorder of stool volume and consistency is typically not enough to produce fecal incontinence in the otherwise normal individual. Instead, the person is likely to perceive a precipitous urgency to defecate, an impulse that is heeded rapidly.
- However, if the volume of stool is sufficient and the storage capacity of the rectum is compromised, or sphincter function is suboptimal, fecal incontinence may result.

\section*{Assisting client elimination}
- Positioning of the client plays an important role in elimination.
- Sitting is the usual position for both men and women for bowel elimination. Sitting is also the usual position for women to urinate; standing is the position preferred by some men.
- Clients unable to use the toilet require assistance in accomplishing elimination.
- Devices such as the bedpan, commode, or urinal can be substituted

\section*{Assisting client elimination}
- Clients who use a bedpan need as comfortable a setting as possible, therefore, after placement of the bedpan the head of the bed should be elevated to a $45^{\circ}$ angle, unless contraindicated.
- The nurse may need to assist the client to cross the legs in order to create somewhat of a sitting position.
- Clients who are able to get out of bed but are unable to ambulate to the toilet can use a bedside commode, which resembles a toilet but is portable. Typically, the client is assisted to stand and pivot to the commode from the bed.

\section*{Positioning and Removing a Bedpan}

\section*{Action}
7. While holding the bedpan with one hand, help the client to roll onto her back.
8. Check placement of bedpan by looking between client's legs. 9. If indicated, elevate head of bed to $45^{\circ}$ angle. 10. Place call light within reach of patient; place side rails in upright position and allow for privacy.

\section*{Rationale}
7. Prevents dislocation or alignment of bedpan.
8. May prevent spillage due to misalignment of bedpan.
9. Check physician order; bed remains flat if patient has a spinal cord injury or spinal surgery. Elevating the head of bed creates a more normal elimination position.
10. Privacy allows for a more comfortable
oliminating environmont.

\section*{Removing a Bedpan}

\section*{Action}
11. Wash hands, don gloves.
12. Lower head of bed to supine position.
13. While holding bedpan with one hand, roll client to side.
14. Assist with cleaning or wiping; always wipe with a front to back motion.
15. Empty bedpan, clean it, and store it in proper place; if bedpan is to be emptied outside client's room, cover it during transport.
16. Remove gloves and wash hands.
17. Allow client to wash hands.
18. Place call light within reach; recheck that side rails are in the upright position.

\section*{Rationale}
11. Prevents transmission of microorganisms.
12. Increases patient's ability to move to side-lying position.
13. Prevents possible spillage of bedpan contents.
14. Client may not be able to clean herself; wiping from front to back decreases chances of crosscontamination from anus to urethra.
15. Promotes privacy and decreases the chance of spilling contents.
16. Prevents transmission of microorganisms.
17. Provides for physical hygiene and comfort.
18. Ensures client safety and

\section*{Administering Enemas}
- Enema administration is a procedure used to introduce fluid into the lower bowel.
- The purpose of an enema is to cleanse the lower bowel, to assist in the evacuation of stool or flatus, or to instill medication. Enemas can be large or small depending on their purpose.

\section*{Administer Enemas}
- Large-volume enemas, which typically contain 500 to 1000 ml fluid, are administered to cleanse the bowel.
- Small-volume enemas are used for the purpose of evacuating stool or instilling medications in the lower bowel. These are usually found as prepackaged solutions, which contain 150 to 240 ml fluid.

\section*{Bowel diversion ostomies}
- Ostomy is an opening for the GIT, urinary or respiratory tract onto the skin
- Bowel diversion ostomies are often classified according to:
a) Their status, permanent or temporary
b) Anatomic location
c) Construction of the stoma (opening)

\section*{Bowel diversion ostomies}
- Bowel diversion surgery allows stool to safely leave the body whenbecause of disease or injury-the large intestine is removed or needs time to heal.
- Cancer, trauma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), bowel obstruction, and diverticulitis are all possible reasons for bowel diversion surgery.

\section*{Types of bowel diversion surgery}
- Ileostomy diverts the ileum to a stoma. Semisolid waste flows out of the stoma and collects in an ostomy pouch, which must be emptied several times a day. An ileostomy bypasses the colon, rectum, and anus and has the fewest complications.
- Colostomy is similar to an ileostomy, but the colonnot the ileum-is diverted to a stoma. As with an ileostomy, stool collects in an ostomy pouch.
- lleoanal reservoir surgery is an option when the large intestine is removed but the anus remains intact and disease-free. The surgeon creates a colonlike pouch, called an ileoanal reservoir, from the last several inches of the ileum.
