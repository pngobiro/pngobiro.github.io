\section*{Precautions}
- Do not use force when inserting a NG tube. If resistance occurs, rotate and retract the tube slightly and try again. Forcing the tube can cause traumatic injury to the tissue of the nose, throat or esophagus.
- Always check the tube positioning before giving feedings. If the tube is out of place the patient may aspirate the feeding solution into the lungs.
- Keep the patient in an upright or semi-upright sitting position when delivering a tube feeding to enhance peristalsis and avoid regurgitation of the feeding.
- Cap or clamp off the NG tube when not in use to prevent backflow of stomach contents or accumulation of air in the stomach.

\section*{Naso-gastric feeding}

DOCUMENTATION: Record the following information on the Patient Care Record:
- name of the formula used.
- amount of formula infused.
- amount of flush.
- time of the feeding.
- patient response.
-implementation of aspiration precautions

\section*{Naso-gastric feeding}

The complications of nasogastric tube feedings:
- obstruction of the tube
- perforation of the tube
- tube migration out of correct position
- regurgitation and aspiration of the feeding
- diarrhea
- nausea and vomiting
- abdominal distention, cramping and discomfort from too much feeding or a rate of feeding that is too rapid

\section*{Naso-gastric feeding}

Removing nasogastric tube Purpose: to allow for resumption of normal GI functions
Indications: when recovery from the reason foor insertion is achieved.

\section*{Naso-gastric feeding}
- Check PO for discontinuation of nasogastric tube.
- Explain procedure to patient, perform hand hygiene and don gloves.
- Turn off suction device and remove tape from pt's nose or cheek.
- Stand on patient's right side if right handed, place disposable pad across patient's chest.
- Inject air before pulling out tube to prevent residual contents draining into oropharynx.
- Ask patient to hold breath to help preventing aspiration.
- Dominant hand to draw the tube out into the towel held by non-dominant hand, to minimize dripping and unpleasant sight.
- Record the drainage collected by suction machine or drainage bag as fluid output.
- Dispose and perform hand hygiene.

\section*{Nasojejunal}
- - Used for patients who do not tolerate gastric feeds or patients with known abnormality of gastric emptying.
- - Can attempt to place at bedside and check X-ray for migration past the pyloris.
- - If unsuccessful then position tube under fluoroscopic or endoscopic guidance.
- - Residuals not helpful if tube remains post-pyloric, watch for signs of abdominal pain or distension to determine tolerance. Avoid starting feeds until patient is hemodynamically stable and initial volume resuscitation is complete.
Caution: Patients with nasal obstruction or severe facial fractures should have these tubes placed orally.

\section*{Open Gastrostomy}
- - These are usually performed either in conjunction with a laparotomy for other reasons or for patients who cannot have percutaneous placement due to intra-abdominal adhesions
- - This procedure requires a general anesthetic
- - The stomach is tacked to the abdominal wall with sutures and an external suture is usually placed around the tube to prevent it from being dislodged.
- - The tube should be left to gravity drainage for 24 hours and then can start enteral feeds.
- - Can check residuals for tolerance
- - Surgical incision should remain dressed for 24 hours and then left open to air if there is no drainage.

\section*{Transgastric Jejunostomy}
- - These tubes can be placed surgically, or with endoscopic or radiographic guidance.
- - May contain a second port for gastric aspiration.
- - Can be converted to gastrostomy later.
- - Cannot monitor residuals to determine tolerance.
- - Post placement care is same as PEG.

\section*{Surgical Jejunostomy}
- - Usually placed in conjunction with a laparotomy or for patient who need long term enteral access and cannot tolerate gastric feeds.
- - These can be placed either via a laparoscopic or open approach and require a general anesthetic.
- - The jejunum is tacked to the abdominal wall with sutures and an external suture is usually placed around the tube to prevent it from being dislodged.
- - Enteral feeds can begin 12 hours after surgery.

\section*{Surgical Jejunostomy}
- NOTE: Needle catheter jejunostomy tubes are much smaller diameter than standard tubes and are thus much more likely to obstruct. They must be flushed frequently and high fiber formula and medications should not be administered through these tubes.
- NOTE: All tubes not being used for continuous enteral feeds should be flushed with 30cc (adults) or 5-10 cc (pediatric) water every 4 hrs to ensure patency.
- NOTE: All tubes should be marked at the skin entrance to allow monitoring for migration of the tube. Tube position should be monitored by the nursing staff every Shift.

\section*{Enteral feeding}
- Candidates for enteral tube feeding are clients who have a functional GI tract and will not, should not, or cannot eat.
- Therefore, tube feedings are used for clients who are (or may become) malnourished and in whom oral feedings are insufficient to maintain adequate nutritional status.

\section*{Enteral feeding}
- Enterostomy is the surgical creation of an artificial fistula (gastrostomy, jejunostomy) in the intestines by incision through the abdominal wall.
- Tube enterostomies can be placed at various points along the GI tract and are performed when long-term tube feeding is anticipated or when obstruction makes nasal intubation impossible.
- Nutrients administered through tubes are liquefied so they can be easily digested and absorbed.

\section*{Gastrotomy tube}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_8e8fcf0f2560a9cba602g-015.jpg?height=1200&width=1825&top_left_y=440&top_left_x=427)

\section*{Enteral feeding}

Indications for use if a patient needs nutritional support and the GI tract is accessible and functioning:
i) Severe malnutrition - weight loss $>10 \%$, albumin $<30 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$, muscle wasting and peripheral oedema; and/or
ii) Moderately malnourished but would be expected to develop significant malnutrition in the short term as a result of an underlying condition eg head and neck cancers or advanced MND; and/or
iii) Normally nourished but unable to commence normal feeding for a considerable length of time (>3-4 days) e.g. post stroke; and/or
iv) Unable to meet nutritional requirements via oral diet alone

\section*{Indications for Enteral Feeding}
- Clients unable to eat
- ie: comatose with functional GI system
- Ventilated patients
- Post-op oral, head or neck surgery
- Clients who will not eat
- Older adults
- Confused clients
- Unable to maintain adequate oral nutrition - Cancer, sepsis, infection, trauma, head injury

\section*{Enteral feeding}

Contraindications for enteral feeding:
i) Major intra-abdominal sepsis
ii) Total obstruction of GI tract or abdominal distension of unknown pathology

\section*{Enteral feeding}

\section*{Problems and Complications - Possible Causes}
- Diarrhea
- Too rapid administration of the feed therefore may need to decrease the volume given and the rate
- Causes not related to enteral nutrition such as antibiotic treatment
- Nausea, vomiting, large aspirates
- A condition causing delayed gastric emptying
- Overfeeding - need to withhold feed for three hours and recommence at a lower rate
- Abdominal Discomfort
- Solution too cold
- Gastric distension
- Too rapid administration

\section*{Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)}
- PEG feeding tubes are increasingly used for long term enteral nutrition. It is used where patients cannot maintain adequate nutrition with oral intake.
- Indications include difficulties with oral intake often where obstruction to the upper airway or gastrointestinal tract makes passing a nasogastric tube difficult.

\section*{Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)}

\section*{Indications}
- Head and neck cancers. It is useful particularly when surgery is extensive and when combined with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or both.
- Malignant bowel obstruction including oesophageal cancer
- Neurological conditions are the most common indications for PEG and include:
- Stroke
- Disorders of swallowing
- Neurosurgical disease
- Parkinson's disease
- Brain tumours
- HIV encephalopathy
- Neonatal encephalopathy
- Head injury patients
- AIDS and HIV encephalopathy (improves nutritional status but not survival)
- Crohn's disease
- Burns patients

\section*{Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)}

Contraindications for PEG
- Acutely ill patients
- Patients with short life expectancy
- Patients with severe coughing

\section*{Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)}

\section*{Benefits of PEG:}
- Well tolerated (better than nasogastric tubes)
- Improved nutritional status
- Ease of usage over other methods (nasogastric or oral feeding) reported by carers
- Satisfactory use by home carers
- Low incidence of complications
- Reduction in aspiration pneumonia associated with swallowing disorders
- Cost effective relative to alternative methods particularly when reasonably long survival expected ${ }^{[37]}$

\section*{Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)}

\section*{Care of PEG tube}
- Examine skin around site for infection/ irritation.
- Note measuring guide number at end of external fixation device.
- Clean stoma site with sterile saline.
- Dry area with gauze.
- Rotate gastrostomy tube to prevent adherence to sides of track.
- Re-attach external fixation device to abdomen.
- Attach gastrostomy tube gently to fixation device and position as before according to mark/number on tube.
- Avoid use of bulky dressings.

DOCUMENTAT ION IN NURSING

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Documentation is any written or electronically generated information about a client that describes the care or service provided to that client.
- Documentation is the written and legal recording of the interventions that concern the patient and it includes a sequence of processes.

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Documentation is established with the personal record of the patient, which constitutes a base of information on the situation of his health.
- Health records may be paper documents or electronic documents, such as electronic medical records, faxes, e-mails, audio or video tapes and images.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}
- Documentation is critical to determine if the standard of care was rendered to a patient to defend nursing actions.
- Failure to chart, omissions and poor communication are hard to defend.
- Effective written communication skills are essential in order to precisely document each of the components of nursing practice.
- When done well, nursing documentation is a valuable tool to support effective communication between providers and continuity of care within and across settings.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}

The health-care record is a clinical document. It should include:
- information to identify the client,
- the care provider,
- the date of the encounter,
- the problem(s) being addressed,
- care provided,
- the clinical reasoning for the choice of care,
- the client's response and/or outcome of the interventions and future plans.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}
- Documentation is a part of that responsibility.
- Through documentation, nurses communicate their observations, decisions, actions and outcomes of these actions for clients.
Documentation is an accurate account of what occurred and when it occurred.

\title{
PURPOSE OF DOCUMENTATION
}
- To communicate in formation on patient's management, response to treatment and identified needs to ensure continuity of care.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF DOCUMENTATION}

The health care record is a mechanism which allows the health care team to:
- Communicate effectively;
- deliver appropriate individualized care
- evaluate the progress and health outcomes of patients/clients;
- retain the integrity of health information over time.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{Legal Implications of Documentation}
- The client health-care record is an important legal document. It can be used to resolve questions or concerns about accountability and the provision of care.
Facilitating Evidence-Based Practice
- Evidence-based practice is supported and informed by research findings, as well as by the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience of registered nurses.
- The health-care record can be an important source of data for nursing and health research thus, accurate and thorough documentation is essential.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{Funding and Resource Management}
- Documentation is one source of data that can be used by administration in making funding and resource management decisions.
- Health records are considered to be proof of care provided, and third-party insurers sometimes use documented client outcomes for the approval of insurance claims.
- Workload measurements and/or client classification systems, derived as a consequence of client documentation, are used by some agencies to help determine the allocation of staff and/or funding.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF NURSING DOCUMENTATION}
- Reflects the client's perspective, identifies the caregiver and promotes continuity of care by allowing other partners in care to access the information
- Communicates to all health care providers the plan of care, the assessment, the interventions necessary based on the client's history and the effectiveness of those interventions
- Is an integral component of inter-professional documentation within the client record

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF NURSING DOCUMENTATION}
- Demonstrates the nurse's commitment to providing safe, effective and ethical care by showing accountability for professional practice and the care the client receives, and transferring knowledge about the client's health history
- Demonstrates that the nurse has applied within the therapeutic nurse-client relationship the nursing knowledge, skill and judgment required by professional standards regulations.

\section*{The Ethical Implications of Documentation in Nursing}

Nursing is governed by ethical guidelines and laws. In order to track compliance with the laws and guidelines, documentation is used.
- Proof of Care
- Documentation shows the extent of care provided to a patient and the due diligence of the staff. How a patient was admitted, tested and treated. Every medication administered, test ordered and conversation with staff is recorded. This acts as proof of the care a patient received. Important also is justification for a procedure which is noted in the chart.

\section*{The Ethical Implication of Documentation in Nursing}

\section*{- Professional Accountability}
- Things can go wrong in health care, and, as such, health-care workers are susceptible to lawsuits. In order to protect yourself, documentation is important. Documentation is proof that you have provided a good quality of care, followed protocol and have done your best to help the patient.
- Licensing
- In order to operate within a health-care setting, both individuals and the institutions must be licensed. Review boards periodically look through records to determine that the staff is doing the job well. Accrediting bodies for hospitals review documentation to determine if the hospital is eligible for government funding. This determination is based on ethical treatment, quality of care and outcome of care.

\section*{The Ethical Implications of Documentation in Nursing}
- Quality of Care
- The quality of care is an ethical concern in nursing. Nurses are charged with providing a level of care that is governed by the licensing board as well as the institution where they work. To prove that this quality of care is being provided, nurses document patient interactions, such as concerns raised by patients which are then relayed to doctors.

\section*{The Ethical Implications of Documentation in Nursing}
- Treatment
- Documentation is important in treating clients. Proper documentation gives the health-care provider all the information needed to make a safe and appropriate treatment decision; Incomplete or inaccurate records can lead to treatment errors.

\section*{REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALITY DOCUMENTATION}

The following principles are intended to provide nurses with clear direction for producing and maintaining high quality, defensible documentation:
1. Document fact

Fact is what the nurse or midwife saw, heard or did in relation to the patient's care and condition.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{2. Document all relevant information}

This will be dictated by consideration of the individual circumstances of each patient. Nurses' documentation should be made with respect to the total condition of the patient, not just a clinical specialty.

\section*{3. Document contemporaneously}
- Nurses and midwives should record entries in the patient's notes as soon as possible after the events to which reference is being made have occurred, with the date and time for each entry recorded. All entries should also include the author's signature, printed name and designation.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{4. Maintain the integrity of documentation}

This principle refers to the requirement to preserve all that is recorded in a patient's record, even if an error is made. Nurses and midwives should not attempt to change or delete errors made in the patient's notes. An attempt to change or delete an entry could be interpreted as an attempt to cover up events or mislead others.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{1. Objective/Factual Documentation}
- Registered nurses must document accurately, completely, and objectively including any errors that occurred. An objective description is the result of direct observation and measurement.

\section*{2. Timeliness}
- Documentation is enhanced when client information is entered frequently into the client health-care record (Keatings \& Smith, 2000).
- Contemporaneous documentation (completion of the health-care record notes as close to the time of care as possible) enhances the credibility and accuracy of healthcare records.
- Documentation of an intervention should never be completed before it takes place.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{3. Use of Space}
- Documentation must not have empty lines or spaces, and the time when assessments and interventions were completed must be noted. On forms or flow sheets every required space should be filled.
- 4. Use of Abbreviations
- Many organizations are currently developing policies that are aimed at reducing the number of common but preventable sources of errors. These policies are related to approved or prohibited abbreviations, or are policies requiring that no abbreviations be used in a practice setting.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{5. Follow-up}
- Document any follow-up of assessments, observations or interventions that have been done, including whether a physician or other care provider has been notified regarding the client. Failed attempts to reach a care provider, the follow-up action taken, and the client's response to interventions should be documented on the client's healthcare record.

\section*{6. Correcting Errors}
- To correct an error in a paper-based health-care records system, one method that can be used to appropriately make corrections is the SLIDE rule (Baker, 2000). The SLIDE rule is completed as follows: cross through the word(s) with a single line, and insert your initials, along with the date and time the correction is made; then enter the correct information/explanation

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{7. Recording Medication Administration}
- Document the administration of medications immediately after its administration. This prevents errors such as another RN administering medication when the first dose was not recorded.

\section*{8. Recording Assistance with Care}
- In most circumstances, when a RN assists another RN in providing care, the RN providing care documents the actions and the client's responses and notes that another care provider assisted.
- It is not required to name the person who assisted. In certain circumstances, as in a critical incident such as a fall, it is important to record the names of those individuals assisting.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}
9. Designated Recorder in Emergency Situations
- In some emergency situations (e.g., during a cardiac arrest), documentation may be done by a designated recorder. When acting as a designated recorder, the recorder identifies the persons involved and the care they provided.

\section*{10. Clarification of Orders}
- If an order is poorly written, never guess or rely on group consensus to interpret that order. Always call the writer for clarification. There is a high risk for error and potential for an unsafe event to occur.
- A written record of every telephone call should be maintained, whether it is with another care provider for clarification of orders, or with a client following discharge from your facility or unit.

\title{
GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION
}
11. Recording a Telephone Conversation with a Client
- When advice is given by telephone, the RN is relying on the client's own assessment of the situation.
- The health-care record should include the date (including year) and time of the call, the nature of the call, the response by the RN, and the follow-up recommendations (Baker, 2000).

\section*{Documenting Telephone Orders}
- Write down the time and date on the physician's order sheet.
- Write down the order given by the physician.
- Read the order back to the physician to ensure it is accurately recorded.
- $\square$ Record the physician's name on the physician's order sheet, state "telephone order," print your name, sign the entry and identify your status (e.g., RN).

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{12. Interactions with other Health-care Professionals}
- It is the RN's responsibility when developing care plans, documenting on flow sheets, completing narrative or computerized documentation, or participating in team or family conferences, to document in the health-care record the outcomes or agreed upon plans of action and the names of the people involved.
- All health-care professionals are responsible for documenting the care they provide or the actions taken.
- The system used should record all interactions with members of the health-care team, including clarification of orders, failed attempts to reach other team members, and the follow up action taken.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{13. Client Education}
- Registered nurses perform, on a daily basis, a broad scope and depth of client education. Inadequate or incomplete documentation of client education impedes communication among health-care providers about what has been taught and diminishes the aspect of this component of care provided by the registered nurse.
- When documenting and evaluating client education, it is important to define the extent of the client's understanding (London, as cited in Bastable, 2003).

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}
14. Documenting an Incident in the Health-care Record
- When an incident occurs, pertinent data should be documented on the health-care records of the client(s) involved in the incident.
- An incident report provides a description of an unexpected or unusual event, for example, a client fall, medication error or harm to clients, staff or visitors. Careful documentation of incidents is important for continuous quality improvement, learning from mistakes and managing risk, and in case of a complaint or legal action.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{Guidance on how to complete documentation regarding an incident:}
- Be concise, accurate and objective.
- Record what was seen, and describe the care provided, who else was involved and the client's (person's) condition.
- Do not try to guess or explain what happened (e.g., the RN should record that side rails were not in place, but should not write that this was the reason the client fell out of bed).
- Record the actions taken by other health-care providers at the time.
- Do not blame individuals in the documentation.
- Always record the full facts.

Discuss with the manager and other team members what would be classified as a critical incident and what should be documented in the health-care record and on an incident report. The RN must take time to plan what they will enter into the health-care record prior to the actual entry. This can help prevent the recording of opinion and the drawing of conclusions that should be avoided in the health-care record

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR DOCUMENTATION}

Documentation needs to be CC FLAT
- Concise
- Complete
- Factual
- Legible
- Accurate
- Timely (current)

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{Narrative}
- Narrative documentation is the traditional method for recording nursing care provided. It is a story-like format to document information specific to client conditions and nursing care. Data are recorded in the progress notes without an organizing framework. It often requires the reader to sort through information to locate the data required.

\section*{Problem-Orientated Medical Record (POMR)}
- The foundation of this method is a single list of client problems generated by members of the health-care team. The nursing process forms the basis for the POMR method of documenting client problems.

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

Potter et al. (2006) listed the advantages of POMR method of documenting as follows:
- gives emphasis to client's perceptions of their problems
- requires continuous evaluation and revision of the care plan
- provides greater continuity of care among health-care team members
- enhances effective communication among health-care team members
- increases efficiency in gathering data
- provides easy-to-read information in chronological order
- reinforces use of the nursing process

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{SOAP/IER}

One of the most prominent features of this problem-orientated method of documentation is the structured way in which narrative progress notes are written by all health-care team members, using the SOAP, SOAPIE or SOAPIER format.
Subjective: the client's observations
Objective: the care provider's observations and tests Assessment: the care provider's understanding of the problem
Plans: goals, action, advice
Intervention: when an intervention was identified and changed to meet client's needs
Evaluation: how outcomes of care are evaluated
Revision: when changes to the original problem come from revised interventions, outcomes of care or time lines this is used to denote changes (Meiner, S., 1999).

\title{
METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION
}

\section*{PIE}
- The PIE notes are numbered or labeled according to the client's problems. Resolved problems are dropped from daily documentation after the RN's review.
Continuing problems are documented daily (Potter et al., 2006).
- Problem
- Intervention
- Evaluation

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{Focus Charting (sometimes referred to as DAR)}
- This method of documentation consists of notes that include Data, both subjective and objective; Action or nursing interventions; and Response of the client.
- One distinction of focus documentation is its movement away from documenting only problems. Instead, the notes are structured according to client concerns:
- a sign or symptom
- a condition
- a nursing diagnosis
- a behavior
- a significant event
- a change in a client's condition
- Documentation is written in accordance with the nursing process.

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

Graphic Sheets and Flow Sheets
- Health-care record entries should reflect the most recent assessment, as they are done, to ensure treatment decisions are based on accurate information. If documenting on a flow sheet or checklist, checkmarks may be used as long as it is clear who performed the assessment or intervention.

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{Charting by Exception (CBE)}

This system of health-care recording assessments, interventions, and responses was developed to eliminate redundancy and to organize information in a manner that would reduce errors in documentation. When used following a thorough orientation to the guidelines and protocols established for nursing assessment and intervention, CBE can:
- save time
- reduce repetition of documentation
- provide immediate identification of significant changes in a client's condition
However, in the presence of unclear nursing guidelines or lacking other flow sheets that are needed for recording other care or treatments, CBE can be more prone to legal interpretation of a breach in standards in nursing care.

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

Key elements required for CBE are:
- practice setting documentation policies and protocols
- assessment norms, standards of care
- individualized care plans
- unique flow sheets
- bedside accessibility of documentation forms

It is not acceptable to use documentation by exception unless these exist.

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{E-health Records}
- Has many benefits.
- The same principles apply whether documentation is completed in the paper health-care record or electronically. "Online documentation is defined as a technology that automates the capture of clinical care data.
- In the nursing realm, this can include assessment data, clinical findings, and nursing plans of care, nursing interventions (along with results), patient's progress toward goals, critical pathways, medication administration, risk assessments, discharge planning, patient education and more" (Kirkley \& Rewick, 2003

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

\section*{E-health Record Security}
- Electronic documentation systems require security features that protect client confidentiality and that prevent others from modifying documentation entries.
- Once documentation is completed, the program should lock entries so that they become "read only" information.
- The practice setting policies should reference that staff should only have access to healthcare records of clients in their specific area of practice.
- Select staff may be given authority to access all healthcare records.
- To heighten security of passwords, they should be required to be changed at specific intervals of time.

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}

Guidelines for nurses using electronic health records:
- $\square$ never reveal or allow anyone else access to your personal identification number or password
- inform your immediate supervisor if there is suspicion that an assigned personal identification code is being used by someone else;
- $\square$ change passwords at frequent and irregular intervals (as per agency policy);

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}
- choose passwords that are not easily deciphered;
- log off when not using the system or when leaving the terminal;
- maintain confidentiality of all information, including all print copies of information;
- shred any discarded print information containing client identification;
- $\square$ locate printers in secured areas away from public access;
- $\square$ retrieve printed information immediately;
- protect client information displayed on monitors (e.g., use of screen saver, location of monitor, use of privacy screens);
- $\square$ use only systems with secured access to record client information; and
- $\square$ only access client information which is required to provide nursing care for that client; accessing client information for purposes other than providing nursing care is a breach of confidentiality.

\section*{METHODS OF DOCUMENTATION}
- In summary, regardless of the method used, registered nurses are responsible and accountable for documenting client care including assessments, interventions carried out, and results of the interventions on client outcomes.
- Clients who are very ill, considered high risk or have complex health-care needs require more comprehensive, in depth and frequent documentation by the registered nurse providing care.

\section*{NURSING DOCUMENTATION}
- Nursing Assessment - Documentation should reflect that nursing assessment occurs on a timely and regular basis.
- Diagnostic Reasoning Documentation should reflect that the individual's health status evaluation is based on the information received and analyzed as a result of nursing assessment.

\section*{NURSING DOCUMENTATION}
- Planning - Documentation should reflect that a plan of care is developed based on nursing assessment and diagnostic reasoning.
- Implementation - Documentation should reflect that the plan developed to meet health needs/problems is being implemented.
1. The nursing notes should reveal that treatment rendered is consistent with the nursing plan of care.
2. The nursing notes should include information about the status of the health situation or problem, the treatment rendered, and the person's response to treatment.

\section*{NURSING DOCUMENTATION}
- Evaluation - Documentation should reflect that outcomes of nursing interventions are carefully evaluated.
1. The nursing notes should reflect the need to continue and/or change the plan of care.
2. The nursing notes should reflect changes in the nursing plan of care.
3. The nursing notes should include information about contacts with primary care prescribers and other members of the interdisciplinary team regarding the person's health status.

PAIN
MANAGEME
NT

\section*{PAIN}
- Pain is a highly unpleasant and very personal sensation that cannot be shared with others.
- It can occupy all of a person's thinking, direct all activities and change a person's life.
- It is more than a symptom of a problem.
- Presents both physiologic and psychologic dangers to health and recovery
- Pain is usually transitory, lasting only until the noxious stimulus is removed or the underlying damage or pathology has healed, but some painful conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, may persist for years.

\section*{TYPES OF PAIN}
- Pain may be acute or chronic. Acute pain is severe and lasts a relatively short time. It is usually a signal that body tissue is being injured in some way, and the pain generally disappears when the injury heals. Chronic pain may range from mild to severe, and is present to some degree for long periods of time.
