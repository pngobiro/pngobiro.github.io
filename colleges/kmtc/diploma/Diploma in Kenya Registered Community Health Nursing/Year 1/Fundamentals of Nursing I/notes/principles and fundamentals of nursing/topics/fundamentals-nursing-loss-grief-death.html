                            <li><strong>Uncomplicated grief</strong> is a grief reaction that normally follows a significant loss. Uncomplicated grief runs a fairly predictable course that ends with the relinquishing of the lost object and resumption of the previous life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Complicated grief</strong> is associated with traumatic death such as death by homicide, suicide, or an accident. Although traumatic death does not necessarily predispose the survivor to complications in mourning, survivors suffer emotions of greater intensity than those associated with normal grief. When loved ones die violently, the grievers may suffer from traumatic imagery, that is, the reliving the terror of the incident or imagining the feelings of horror felt by the victim. Such thoughts, coupled with intense grief, can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
                                <p>Symptoms may include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sleep disturbances, such as recurrent, terror-filled nightmares</li>
                                    <li>Psychological distress</li>
                                    <li>Chronic anxiety</li>

                            <li><strong>Dysfunctional Grief:</strong> Persons experiencing dysfunctional grief do not progress through the stages of overwhelming emotions associated with grief, or they may fail to demonstrate any behaviors commonly associated with grief. The person experiencing pathologic grief continues to have strong emotional reactions, does not return to a normal sleep pattern or work routine, usually remains isolated, and has altered eating habits. The pathologically grieving person is unable to reestablish a routine.

                            <li><strong>Denial</strong> - "I feel fine."; "This can't be happening, not to me." Denial is usually only a temporary defense for the individual.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anger</strong> - "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; '"Who is to blame?" Once in the second stage, the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bargaining</strong> - "I'll do anything for a few more years."; "I will give my life savings if..." The third stage involves the hope that the individual can somehow postpone or delay death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Depression</strong> - "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I'm going to die soon so what's the point... What's the point?"; "I miss my loved one, why go on?" During the fourth stage, the dying person begins to understand the certainty of death. Because of this, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time crying and grieving. This process allows the dying person to disconnect from things of love and affection. It is not recommended to attempt to cheer up an individual who is in this stage. It is an important time for grieving that must be processed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acceptance</strong> - "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it, I may as well prepare for it." In this last stage, individuals begin to come to terms with their mortality, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event</li>
