                        <p>The purpose of NANDA is to define, refine and promote a taxonomy of nursing diagnostic terminology of general use to professional nurses.</p>
                        <p>A <dfn>taxonomy</dfn> is a classification system or set of categories arranged on the basis of a single principle or set of principles.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosing refers to the reasoning process.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis is a statement or conclusion regarding the nature of a phenomenon.</p>

                            <li><strong>Discharge planning</strong> - begins at first client contact and involves comprehensive and ongoing assessment to obtain information about the client's ongoing needs.</li>

                            <li>Use category headings - Nursing Dx. Goals, Nursing intervention</li>
                            <li>Use standardized medical/ English symbols e.g. bd, H<sub>2</sub>O</li>
                            <li>Be specific - to help in clarifying issues.</li>
                            <li>Refer to procedure books or other references other rather than writing all the steps in a written plan.</li>
                            <li>Tailor the plan to the unique characteristics of the client by ensuring that the client's choices e.g preferences about times of care and the methods used are included.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the plan incorporates preventive and health maintenance aspects as well as restorative.</li>
                            <li>Ensure that the plan contains interventions for ongoing assessment of the client.</li>
                            <li>Include collaborative and coordination activities in the plan.</li>
                            <li>Include plans for the client's discharge and home care needs.</li>
