                            <li>stock and specific personal prescription drugs - ensure adequate supplies, within expiry date</li>
                            <li>medicine pots - to dispense individual medication</li>
                            <li>disposable cups - to provide a drink to assist easy swallowing of medication, or to dissolve tablets if necessary</li>
                            <li>water jug, freshly filled, to ensure water is easily available</li>
                            <li>straws - some patients find it easier to take unpalatable medicine through a straw, and a straw may help a patient with swallowing difficulties to wash tablets down more easily</li>
                            <li>teaspoons or medicine spoons - to put tablets into a patient's mouth without contaminating the medication</li>
                            <li>pestle and mortar - to crush tablets if necessary (NB: check with pharmacist that a liquid form is not available, and that the tablet is suitable to be crushed)</li>
                            <li>tablet file or cutter or knife - to divide a tablet evenly (NB: check with pharmacist that smaller doses are not available and that the tablet is suitable for cutting)</li>
                            <li>note pad - to keep a record of actions that are to be taken as a result of medication, e.g. re-ordering medication or discharge drugs, or returning to check BP or peak expiratory flow</li>
                            <li>drug reference book, e.g. BNF - to check unfamiliar doses or drugs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Procedure</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash and dry hands.</li>
                            <li>Consult the patient's prescription sheet. For regular drug administration times, work systematically from the front page of the prescription sheet to identify the following issues:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Has the patient any known allergies?</li>
                                    <li>What medication is due, e.g. regular doses? When was it last given?</li>
                                    <li>Once-only prescriptions, such as pre-medications: when are they due, or have they been given?</li>
                                    <li>Variable doses - these may need to be updated as a result of blood tests; therefore, are they current? Check date.</li>
                                    <li>Is analgesia required? If so, when was the last dose and was it effective?</li>
                                    <li>Progress of any current intravenous therapy - if a patient has an intravenous infusion in place, then it is an ideal opportunity to check (a) that it is running to time and (b) sufficient is prescribed for the patient's needs over the next shift</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Check each medication prescribed for dose, time, date, route and doctor's signature.</li>
                            <li>Select the medicine bottle, checking the name of the drug with that on the prescription sheet. If the patient needs to have a pre- medication check of pulse, blood pressure or peak expiratory flow, now is the time to do that.</li>
                            <li>Calculate the dose.</li>
                            <li>Tip the required number of tablets into the lid of the container</li>
                            <li>If working with another nurse, show the name of the container and the number of tablets to the other person, stating the written dose aloud.</li>
                            <li>Tip the dose into the pot. If measuring liquid: ensure the lid is on firmly and then shake the bottle to ensure the contents are well mixed. Put the pot on a level surface, pour the liquid into it, turning the bottle label away so that it does not get dripped on and obscured by medicine. Pour to the required level.</li>
                            <li>Take the medication to the patient.</li>
                            <li>Greet the patient by name and check identity against the prescription sheet label.</li>
                            <li>Assist the patient into an upright position to aid swallowing.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the patient understands the sequential order to take the medication; for example, antacids are taken after other tablets.</li>
                            <li>Do not leave any medicines beside the bed to be taken later. They may get forgotten, knocked over, or consumed accidentally by someone else.</li>
                            <li>Document the drug dose and time. If the patient has refused the medication or is nil by mouth, record on the prescription sheet the reasons for withholding the dose according to the local policy code. Report to medical staff.</li>
                            <li>Dispose of waste and used containers.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the patient for effects such as degree of pain relief, or side effects such as nausea or rashes, and document as necessary.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Injections deliver medication directly into the body and are not retrievable.</p>
                        <p>It is essential, therefore, to be accurate in identifying safe entry points for injections, and to take the utmost care in administering medication by the parenteral route.</p>
                        <p>The intramuscular route delivers injections directly into muscles which have an efficient blood supply and can absorb from 1 ml to 5 ml of medication, depending on the site.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Considerations before administration by the IM route</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The patient's age:</strong> elderly patients may have muscle wasting which may limit the choice of site, and babies who are not yet walking may have underdeveloped muscles, particularly in the buttocks.</li>
                            <li><strong>General physical status:</strong> emaciated or cachectic patients may also have muscle wasting or poor perfusion and skin condition. Oedematous limbs will not absorb medication as effectively as those with good perfusion.</li>
                            <li><strong>The drug therapy:</strong> the amount to be given, and the frequency and consistency of medication will influence the choice of location.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessment of appropriate site</h3>
                        <p>There are five sites that may be used for IM injections: deltoid; dorsogluteal; ventro-gluteal; and the thigh muscles - vastus lateralis and rector femoris.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Locating deltoid site:</strong> The densest part of the muscle can be located on the mid-lateral aspect of the arm in line with the axilla, and about 2.5 cm below the acromial process. This avoids the radial nerve and brachial artery. The typical absorption volume is no greater than $1-2 \text{ ml}$.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dorso-gluteal site:</strong> The patient should lie either on their side with knees slightly bent, or prone with toes pointing inwards. An imaginary line is drawn across from the cleft of the buttock to the greater trochanter of the femur. Then a vertical line is drawn midway across the first line, and the outer quadrant is identified. This quadrant is then divided into four quadrants: the desired location is the upper outer quadrant. The aim is to access the gluteus maximus muscle, and to avoid the sciatic nerve and gluteal artery. The typical absorption volume is $2-4 \text{ ml}$.</li>
                            <li><strong>Vastus lateralis and rector femoris:</strong> These quadriceps muscles are particularly good for toddlers or patients who have wasted muscles as they can be 'bunched up' before injecting. They can be located by measuring a hand's breadth down from the greater trochanter, and a hand's breadth up from the knee, identifying the middle third of the muscle as the safe location. The vastus lateralis is located on the side of the leg, and the rector femoris is at the front of the thigh. The typical absorption volume is $1-4 \text{ ml}$.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>2 ml or 5 ml syringe (depending on amount for injection).</li>
                            <li>$2 \times 21$ (green) or 23 (blue) gauge needle.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note: a large needle should be used for adults to ensure that it reaches the muscle layer. Short needles may result in the injection going into the adipose tissue, resulting in reduced effectiveness</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alcohol wipe</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Preparing the injection</h4>
                        <p>This is an aseptic procedure and therefore all equipment should be sterile.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Check all equipment to ensure it is sealed and used within expiry date.</li>
                            <li>Wash hands and put on gloves.</li>
                            <li>Prepare drug vial. Carry out the same checks as described in the procedure for oral drug administration. If a glass ampoule is used, flick the top of the ampoule to encourage all fluid to drain into the reservoir. Use a tissue or piece of gauze to protect your fingers from glass cuts when breaking the top off the ampoule. If a vial with a rubber bung is being used, remove the cover using scissors or forceps to prevent injury to your fingers; clean the rubber bung with an alcohol wipe.</li>
                            <li>Assemble needle and syringe, taking care not to touch the needle, except for the barrel when connected to the syringe.</li>
                            <li>Uncap the needle. It is best practice never to resheath an uncapped needle, even if unused, to prevent needlestick injuries.</li>
                            <li>To dilute a drug - if the drug requires mixing with a diluent, or if you are drawing fluid from a closed vial draw up the equivalent amount of air into the syringe, steady the vial on a flat surface with one hand, and insert the syringe into the vial and inject the vial with the air. This will make it easier to withdraw. Ensure drug is dissolved before aspirating the medication into the syringe.</li>
                            <li>Withdraw required amount into the syringe. Remove the vial, and holding the syringe with the needle uppermost, tap the syringe firmly to encourage air bubbles to rise to the top to be expelled.</li>
                            <li>Larger syringes may have the connection on the side, rather than the middle of the syringe. To aid the air to rise to the top, tip the syringe to a slight angle so that the air collects under the connection, and keep it at that angle until all the air is expelled.</li>

                        <p>Preparing an insulin dose may require drawing up from more than one multi-dose vial. The following procedure explains how to do this, and allows you to draw up from an ampoule that has a vacuum in it. If the air were not injected first, it would be very difficult to withdraw insulin as the vacuum within the ampoule would draw in the contents of the syringe and cause mixing of the two different types.</p>
                        <p>To prepare an injection from two multi-dose vials:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clean the rubber bung on both vials with an alcohol wipe.</li>
                            <li>Draw air into the syringe to equal the volume of drug to be withdrawn from the first vial.</li>
                            <li>With the first vial on a flat surface, insert the needle into the first vial. Do not touch the liquid with the needle, but inject the air and remove the needle.</li>
                            <li>Draw air into the syringe to equal the volume of drug to be withdrawn from the second vial, insert into the second vial, and inject the air. Then invert the vial and withdraw the required dose, tap to remove air bubbles and expel, and remove needle from vial.</li>
                            <li>Return to first vial, clean rubber bung, insert needle, invert vial and withdraw required amount carefully. Remove needle and expel air, taking care not to lose any of the first drug.</li>
                            <li>If necessary change the needle before administration. Some disposable insulin syringes have an integral needle which cannot be changed.</li>

                        <p>Rectal medication bypasses the upper gastrointestinal tract, avoiding liver metabolism and therefore working quickly. It is suitable for patients who are unconscious, unable to swallow or are vomiting.</p>
                        <p>Drugs given by suppository or enema can produce a local effect - e.g. to relieve constipation or treat local inflammation - or can work systemically - e.g. to provide pain relief.</p>

                        <p>Before administering medications rectally you should check the anal area to ensure there are no signs of rectal bleeding, skin tags, recent anorectal surgery, undiagnosed abdominal pain or paralytic ileus.</p>
                        <p>An unhurried and gentle approach should be taken to administering medication rectally, because the procedure can induce vagal stimulation resulting in bradycardia and vasodilation, and on rare occasions may cause the patient to collapse.</p>

                        <p>These may be used for diagnostic purposes such as dilating the pupil prior to examination; anaesthetizing the eye prior to treatment, or for treatment of eye conditions such as glaucoma or infection.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Always use separately labelled drug containers for each eye to prevent cross-infection.</li>
                            <li>If eye drops and ointment are prescribed to be administered at the same time, give the drops first, then administer ointment several minutes later, as the ointment can prevent absorption of the drops.</li>
                            <li>Medication should not be directed onto the cornea of the eye as this may damage the cornea, but directed into the area in the lower eyelid.</li>
                            <li>When clearing discharge from the eye or wiping away excess medication, do not use dry cotton-wool balls as fibres may get into the eye and damage the cornea.</li>
                            <li>Always work from the inner canthus (nose side) outwards to edge of eye when applying ointment or swabbing eye to reduce infection risk.</li>
                            <li>Medication containers should not touch the eye during administration as they may become contaminated or damage the eye.</li>
                            <li>Once an eye medication has been opened, record the starting date on the container and discard after two weeks.</li>
                            <li>If both eyes are to be treated but only one is discharging, treat the cleaner eye first to prevent cross-infection. Wash hands between eyes.</li>

                        <p>Assuming the physician's order and patient information are correct, there are three general possibilities for mistakes when administering IV medications via a pump:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>dosage miscalculation;</li>
                            <li>transcription data entry error;</li>
                            <li>titration of the wrong medication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Miscalculation Error:</strong> A miscalculation error can occur for any number of reasons, including the use of inaccurate parameters such as dose, weight, height, drug units, or solution volume. A misplaced decimal or missing number in this complex calculation can result in a calculation error that may not be immediately apparent to the clinician.</p>
                        <p><strong>Data Entry Error:</strong> A transcription type data entry error occurs when a nurse inadvertently inputs the wrong data into the infusion pump. Another type of transcription error is the inputting of an incorrect decimal point. For example, the proper infusion rate is calculated, but the rate is incorrectly entered as $54.0 \text{ ml/hr}$ instead of $5.40 \text{ ml/hr}$.</p>
                        <p><strong>Titration Errors:</strong> According to their effect on the patient, many drug delivery rates are changed while the infusion pump is infusing. This type of rate change is called titration. Understanding the medication that is being ordered and the dosage that this drug is routinely given in is key to assuring that the patient is getting the proper dose of medication.</p>
                        <p><strong>Transcription Errors:</strong> Being able to read a physicians writing is sometimes a difficult task, get clarity if uncertain about what has actually been written. If taking a verbal or phone order, a "read-back" system can be instituted in which the nurse who is taking the order, writes down the verbal order and reads it back to the prescribing physician.</p>

                            <li>Two people should be involved in the administration procedure of all controlled drugs, and where these two are nurses, one must be a registered nurse.</li>
                            <li>The prescription is checked as for usual medication. In addition, consider the time of the previous dose of controlled drug - is it within the prescribed time period? Has the patient already received his allotted dose?</li>
                            <li>Take the appropriate drug from the locked cupboard and compare it with the prescription sheet. Verify the dose and name of the drug. Check the quantity in the box with the record book and remove the drug from the container. Check that the remaining ampoules or tablets tally with the record book, and return the remainder to the cupboard and lock it.</li>
                            <li>Check the dose required, route, time, and patient's identity on the prescription.</li>

                            <li>In the controlled drug record book, document (a) the patient details, (b) date and time, (c) dose given, (d) dose discarded, and (e) the amount of remaining stock.</li>
                            <li>Both persons should go to the bedside, where the patient's identity should be confirmed and the prescription dose, time and route should be checked again.</li>
                            <li>Administer the medication by the prescribed route, and document this on the prescription sheet and in the controlled drug record.</li>
