                            <li>Don't panic. You will be able to assess the situation more effectively. Remember, psychological support is also important.</li>
                            <li>Remember the ABCs of Life Support:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>A</strong>irways open - Open and maintain victim's airway.</li>
                                    <li><strong>B</strong>reathing restored - If victim is not breathing, begin rescue breathing techniques immediately.</li>
                                    <li><strong>C</strong>irculation maintained - If no pulse is present, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques.</li>
                                </ul>
                                REMEMBER, to be able to perform CPR effectively, it is essential to be properly trained.
                            </li>
                            <li>Check for bleeding. Apply direct pressure and elevate injured limb.</li>
                            <li>Look for signs of shock and broken bones (fractures).</li>
                            <li>Check for emergency medical identification on the victim.</li>
                            <li>Get professional medical help quickly. Know emergency numbers, such as 999. Telephone appropriate authorities (ambulance, police, poison or fire department) and describe the problem. Be sure to give your name, location and the number of persons involved.</li>
                            <li>Loosen any clothing that may restrict victim's breathing or interfere with circulation.</li>
                            <li>Never give an unconscious person anything by mouth.</li>
                            <li>DO NOT move injured persons unless situation is life-threatening. Keep victim still, quiet and warm. Victims with broken bones (fractures) should not be moved until a splint has been properly applied.</li>
