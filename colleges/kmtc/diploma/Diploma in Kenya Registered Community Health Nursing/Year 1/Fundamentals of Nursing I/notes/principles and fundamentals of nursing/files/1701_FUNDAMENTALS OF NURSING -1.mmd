FIRST AID

\section*{Definition}
- First Aid is exactly as the term implies, the first aid given for an injury. It is not intended as a long-term solution to a problem, nor does it replace treatment provided by trained medical personnel.
- It is an immediate and temporary care given to a victim of an accident or sudden illness before the services of a physician is obtained.

\section*{Legal Considerations}
- Implied Consent involves an unresponsive victim in a lifethreatening condition.
- It is assumed or "implied" that an unresponsive victim would consent to lifesaving help.
- Only perform First Aid assistance for which you have been trained.

\section*{PURPOSE OF FIRST AID}
1. To save life
2. To prevent further injury
3. To preserve vitality and resistance to infection
PHASES OF FIRST AID
- 1. Self-aid
- 2. Assistance from a companion
- 3. Emergency treatment
- 4. Initial surgery

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF FIRST AID}
a)To prevent further injury to the casualty and to avoid injury to yourself: (e.g., from flames, collapsing building or any other hazards.
b)To assess and treat the casualty in the correct order of priority.
c)To place casualties in a comfortable position.
d)To immobilize injured limbs.
e)To relieve pain and anxiety if possible.
f) To arrange evacuation if necessary in the correct priority.

\section*{FIRST AID RULES}
1. Do not get excited. First, check for danger and then check for responsiveness.
2. Do not move injured victim unless it is necessary.
3. Keep the victim lying down with his head level with his feet while being examined.
4. Keep the victim warm and comfortable. Remove enough clothing to get a clear idea to the extent of the injury.
5. Examined the victim gently. Treat the most urgent injuries first and then treat the other injuries to the best of your ability.

\section*{FIRST AID RULES}
6. Avoid allowing the victim to see his own injury. Assure him that his condition is understood and that he will receive good care.
7. Do not try to give any solid or liquid substance by mouth to an unconscious victim.
8. Do not touch open wounds or burns with fingers or other objects except when sterile compresses or bandages are not available and it is absolutely necessary to stop bleeding.
9. Do not try to arouse an unconscious person.
10. Seek medical attention immediately.

\section*{PRIORITY OF TREATMENT}
- Some injuries are more serious than others and in general they should always be treated in the following order:
1. AIRWAY - Casualties with airway problems.
2. BREATHING - Casualties with difficulty in breathing or whose breathing has stopped
3 CIRCULATION - Casualties with bleeding wounds or are in shock.
4. DISABLITY - Casualties with other injuries, e.g. breaks and burns.

\section*{Initial assessment}
- Safety (yours and the victims),
- Mechanism of the injury (how did it happen),
- Medical information devices ("Medic Alert" tags)
- Number of casualties
- Bystanders

Always avoid contact with blood or other body fluids. Use latex gloves whenever possible.

\section*{Things you should have:}
$\square$ Two pairs of Latex, or other sterile gloves.
$\square$ Sterile dressings to stop bleeding.
$\square$ Cleansing agent/soap and antibiotic towelettes to disinfect.
$\square$ Antibiotic ointment to prevent infection.
$\square$ Burn ointment to prevent infection.
$\square$ Adhesive bandages in a variety of sizes.
$\square$ Eye wash solution to flush the eyes or as general decontaminant.
$\square$ Thermometer
$\square$ Prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood pressure monitoring equipment and supplies.

\section*{Family Kit - general purpose family first aid kit.}
- $\square$ tweezers
- $\square$ scissors
- $\square$ syringe
- swab
- Dantiseptic towelletes
- $\square$ gauze dressing
- non-adherent dressing
- $\square$ trauma pad

- $\square$ pill vials
- $\square$ safety pins
- bandage
- $\square$ gauze

- $\square$ iodine wipes
- copy of this first aid guide
- $\square$ surgical gloves

\section*{Assessment of and Positioning the Casualty}
a. CHECK for responsiveness establish whether the casualty is conscious by gently shaking him and asking, "Are you OK?"
b. CALL for help.
c. POSITION the unconscious casualty so that he is lying on his back and on a firm surface

\section*{Airway}
- Failure to maintain the open airway will prevent the casualty from receiving an adequate supply of oxygen.
- Therefore, while maintaining an open airway the rescuer should check for breathing by observing the casualty's chest and performing the following actions within 3 to 5 seconds:
(a) LOOK for the chest to rise and fall.
(b) LISTEN for air escaping during exhalation by placing your ear near the casualty's mouth.
(c) FEEL for the flow of air on your cheek
(d) PERFORM rescue breathing if the casualty does not resume breathing spontaneously.

\section*{Procedure}
1. Restore Breathing: A person becomes brain dead in 6 minutes if breathing is not restored.
2. Stop Severe Bleeding: Without blood, oxygen can not get to the vital organs of a persons body.

\section*{Procedure}
3. Treat Shock: A victims mind and body must work together in order to be healthy. Never overlook shock situations, be they mental or physical.
4. Call advanced medical help immediately: Always realize that you are providing a stop-gap function to an injured person. Always obtain trained medical assistance as soon as possible. It also is good first aid practice to have even minor wounds checked when expert medical assistance is available.

\section*{ASSESSING THE SITUATION}

\section*{What to Treat First}
1. Don't panic. You will be able to assess the situation more effectively. Remember, psychological support is also important.
2. Remember the ABCs of Life Support:
- Airways open - Open and maintain victim's airway.
- Breathing restored - If victim is not breathing, begin rescue breathing techniques immediately.
- Circulation maintained - If no pulse is present, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques.
- REMEMBER, to be able to perform CPR effectively, it is essential to be properly trained.

\section*{ASSESSING THE SITUATION}
3. Check for bleeding. Apply direct pressure and elevate injured limb.
4. Look for signs of shock and broken bones (fractures).
5. Check for emergency medical identification on the victim.
6. Get professional medical help quickly. Know emergency numbers, such as 999. Telephone appropriate authorities (ambulance, police, poison or fire department) and describe the problem. Be sure to give your name, location and the number of persons involved.

\section*{ASSESSING THE SITUATION}
7. Loosen any clothing that may restrict victim's breathing or interfere with circulation.
8. Never give an unconscious person anything by mouth.
9. DO NOT move injured persons unless situation is life-threatening. Keep victim still, quiet and warm
Victims with broken bones (fractures) should not be moved until a splint has been properly applied.

\section*{BURNS \& SCALDS}

CAUTION
- DO NOT clean burns or break blisters. DO NOT remove any clothing that sticks to burn. DO NOT apply grease, ointment or medication to a severe burn. DO NOT use cotton or material with loose fibers to cover burns.

\section*{TREATMENT}

First degree burns - redness or discoloration of skin surface; mild swelling and pain.
1. Apply cool, wet cloths or immerse in water. DO NOT use ice.
2. Blot gently; apply a dry, sterile pad if necessary.
3. Usually medical treatment is not necessary; however, if severe exist, call for professional medical help. Be alert for signs of shock.

\section*{TREATMENT}

Second degree burns - deep burn with red or mottled appearance; blisters; considerable pain and swelling; skin surface appears wet.
- If arms and legs are affected, elevate above heart level. Burns may be deep and potentially serious, requiring medical treatment depending on extent and location.
- Be alert for signs of shock and

\section*{TREATMENT}
- Third degree burns - deep tissue destruction with a white or charred appearance; no pain. Call for professional medical help immediately. Be alert for signs of shock.

\section*{CUTS \& SCRAPES}

BEFORE INITIATING ANY FIRST AID TO CONTROL BLEEDING, BE SURE TO WEAR GLOVES TO AVOID CONTACT OF THE VICTIM'S BLOOD WITH YOUR SKIN.
1. CLEAN... wound and surrounding area gently with mild soap and rinse. Blot dry with sterile pad or clean dressing.
2. TREAT... to protect against contamination.
3. PROTECT... and cover to absorb fluids and prevent further contamination. (Handle only the edges of sterile pads or dressings.) Secure with first aid tape to help keep out dirt and germs.

\section*{BLEEDING}
- BEFORE INITIATING ANY FIRST AID TO CONTROL BLEEDING, BE SURE TO WEAR GLOVES TO AVOID CONTACT OF THE VICTIM'S BLOOD WITH YOUR SKIN.
TREATMENT
1. Act quickly. Have victim lie down. Elevate injured limb higher than heart unless you suspect a broken bone.
2. Control bleeding by applying direct pressure on the wound with a sterile pad or clean cloth.

\section*{BLEEDING}
3. If bleeding is controlled by direct pressure, bandage firmly to protect wound. Check pulse to be sure bandage is not too tight.
4. If bleeding is not controlled by use of direct pressure, apply a tourniquet only as a last resort.
5. Call for professional medical help immediately.
6. If you are bleeding and have no one to help you, call for professional medical help.
Lie down, so your body weight applies pressure to the bleeding site.

\section*{BREATHING PROBLEMS}
- ESTABLISH NON-RESPONSIVENESS AND ACTIVATE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) OR CALL FOR HELP.
- SYMPTOMS
- May include: Shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, rapid pulse, bluish-purple skin color, dilated
- pupils, unconsciousness.

\section*{TREATMENT}
- For victim who has stopped breathing:
- 1. Lay victim flat on back. Tilt the head back with one hand to open airway, while placing two fingers of the other hand under the chin.
- 2. Clear airway, using your fingers in a hooked fashion to remove any solid or liquid obstructions.
- 3. Look, listen, and feel for respiratory movement for 5 seconds. If breathing is absent, pinch victim's nostrils closed, take a deep breath, completely cover victim's mouth, and give two slow, full breaths.
- 4. Check for carotid pulse in neck and for signs of breathing.

\section*{TREATMENT}

\section*{5. If pulse is present:}

For adults - continue rescue breathing at a rate of one strong every five seconds.
Re-check for pulse and breathing every twelve breaths.
For infants and small children - breathe shallow breaths at a rate of one every three seconds or 20 per minute.
6. If pulse is not present, begin Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).
For adults... Exert enough pressure to depress the breastplate $11 / 2$ to 2 inches.
Continue compressions. Every fifteen compressions should be followed with a pause by two rescue breaths.

\section*{TREATMENT}
- For children... Encircle the chest and depress about a third. Continue compressions at a rate of 100 per minute "one, two, three..."

\section*{TREATMENT}
- For infants... Use only fingertips. Apply moderate pressure to depress breastplate $1 / 2$ to $3 / 4$ inches.
Continue compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute.
- Every five compressions (3 seconds) should be followed without a pause by one rescue breath.

\section*{FRACTURE}
- SYMPTOMS
- May include: The victim hearing or feeling the bone break; area tender to touch with pain in one spot; swelling noted around suspected fracture; limb in an unnatural position; painful movement; abnormal motion; loss of function; grating sensation; discoloration of affected area.

\section*{TREATMENT}
1. Keep victim warm and still, treat for shock if necessary. DO NOT move victim until a splint has been applied unless there is danger of a life-threatening emergency.
2. If bone is suspected to be broken but does not pierce the skin (closed fracture), splint the limb before the victim is moved, immobilizing the joint above and below the suspected fracture site.

\section*{TREATMENT}
3. If broken bone pieces the skin (open or compound fracture), apply pressure to appropriate pressure point to control bleeding.
- DO NOT try to straighten limb, return it to a natural position, or replace bone fragments.
- DO NOT touch or clean the wound. Secure a sterile pad or clean cloth firmly in place over the wound and tie with strong bandages or cloth strips.

\section*{TREATMENT}
4. If victim must be moved, apply a splint to prevent further damage. Use anything that will keep the broken bones from moving, including broomsticks, boards or rolled magazines. Pad splints with cotton, clothes or clean cloths tied firmly (but not tightly) in place. If victim complains of numbness, loosen splint.
5. Get professional medical help immediately.

\section*{CHEMICAL BURNS}

TREATMENT
1. Remove contaminated clothing.
2. Flush burned area with cool water for at least 5 minutes.
3. Treat as you would any major or minor burn.
4. If eye has been burned:
A. Immediately flood face, inside of eyelid and eye with cool running water for at least 15 minutes. Turn head so water does not drain into uninjured eye. Lift eyelid away from eye so the inside of lid can also be washed.
B. If eye has been burned by a dry chemical, lift any loose particles off the eye with the corner of a sterile pad or clean cloth.
C. Cover both eyes with dry sterile pads, clean cloths, or eye pads; bandage in place.
5. Consult professional medical help

\section*{CHOKING, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION}

\section*{Partial Obstruction with Good Air Exchange}

\section*{SYMPTOMS}
- May include: Forceful cough with wheezing sounds between coughs.

\section*{TREATMENT}
- Encourage victim to cough as long as good air exchange continues. DO NOT interfere with attempts to expel object.

\section*{CHOKING, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION}

Partial or Complete Airway Obstruction in Conscious Victim with Poor Air Exchange
SYMPTOMS
- May include: Weak cough; high-pitched crowing noises during inhalation; inability to breathe, cough or speak; gesture of clutching neck between thumb and index finger; exaggerated breathing efforts; dusky or bluish skin color.

\section*{CHOKING, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION}

\section*{TREATMENT}

\section*{For Adult Victim}
- If victim is standing or sitting:
- 1. Stand slightly behind victim.
- 2. Place your arms around victim's waist; place your fist, thumb side in, against victim's abdomen, slightly above the navel and below the rib margins.
- 3. Grasp fist with your other hand and exert a quick upward thrust. Repeat (five times in a rapid succession) if necessary (Heimlich Maneuver or manual thrust.)

\section*{Heimlich Maneuver}
- Determine if the person is a choking victim. A true choking victim will often have their hands around their throat and a desperate or panicked look on their face.
- Reassure the victim immediately that you're going to help him or her.
- Get the victim in a standing position
- Perform back blows to a true choking victim before proceeding to use the Heimlich maneuver. Use the heel of one hand to give back blows between the victim's shoulder blades. If nothing improves, quickly move the abdominal thrusts.
- Stand behind the victim.

\section*{Perform the Heimlich maneuver, abdominal thrusts:}
- Pull inward and upward, pressing into the victim's abdomen with quick upward thrusts, using good force.
- Make the thrusts quick and forceful, as if you're trying to lift the victim off his or her feet from this position.
- Perform 5 abdominal thrusts in quick succession. Repeat the series of thrusts until the object is dislodged and expelled. The victim will cough out the obstacle obstructing their airway if this maneuver is successful.
- Use less force where the victim is a child.
- If the victim falls unconscious, stop the thrusts immediately. Be aware that this can happen at any time if the object is not removed.

TADAM

\section*{Heimlich Maneuver}
- Check to see if normal breathing has returned.
- Call for help immediately if you fail to dislodge the obstruction.

\title{
CHOKING, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION \\ PENETRATING OBJECTS \\ - Such as Sticks or Pieces of Metal Protruding from Body \\ SYMPTOMS \\ - May include: Profuse bleeding; swelling and redness of injured tissue.
}

\section*{CHOKING, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION}

\section*{CAUTION}
- DO NOT remove penetrating object.

\section*{TREATMENT}
1. Get professional medical help immediately.
2. If victim is fixed to object (impale), cut it off at a safe distance from skin. Immobilize object with thick dressings made from sterile pads or clean cloths secured in place with first aid tape, a belt or a bandage.
- If object is protruding from victim, DO NOT move it. Immobilize object with thick dressings made from sterile pads or clean cloths secured in place with first aid tape, a belt or a bandage. Do not apply bandage so tightly that breathing is restricted.
3. If object penetrates chest and victim complains of discomfort or pressure, quickly loosen bandage on one side and reseal. Watch carefully for recurrence. Repeat procedure if necessary.
4. If breathing problems develop, begin rescue breathing techniques immediately.
5. Treat for shock.

\section*{POISONING}

\section*{Causes of poisoning}
- Carbon monoxide gas (from furnaces, gas engines, fires, space heaters)
- Certain foods
- Chemicals in the workplace
- Drugs, including over-the-counter and prescription medicines (such as an aspirin overdose) and illicit drugs such as cocaine
- Household detergents and cleaning products
- Household and outdoor plants (eating toxic plants)
- Insecticides
- Paints

\section*{POISONING}
- Do NOT give an unconscious person anything by mouth.
- Do NOT induce vomiting unless you are told to do so by the Poison Control Center or a doctor. A strong poison that burns on the way down the throat will also do damage on the way back up.
- Do NOT try to neutralize the poison with lemon juice or vinegar, or any other substance, unless you are told to do so by the Poison Control Center or a doctor.
- Do NOT use any "cure-all" type antidote.
- Do NOT wait for symptoms to develop if you suspect that someone has been poisoned.

\section*{POISONING}

TREATMENT
1. DO NOT give any other first aid if victim is unconscious or is having convulsions.
- Begin rescue breathing techniques or CPR if necessary. If victim is convulsing, protect from further injury; loosen tight clothing if possible.

\section*{POISONING}
2. If professional medical help cannot be reached immediately:
- A. DO NOT induce vomiting if poison is unknown, a corrosive substance (i.e., acid, cleaning fluid), or a petroleum product (i.e., gasoline, turpentine, paint thinner, lighter fluid). DO NOT use activated charcoal.

\section*{POISONING}
- B. Induce vomiting if poison is known and is not a corrosive substance or petroleum product. To induce vomiting: Give adult one ounce of syrup of ipecac ( $1 / 2$ ounce for child) followed by four or five glasses of water. If victim has vomited, follow with one ounce of powdered, activated charcoal in water, if available.
3. Take poison container (or vomitus if poison is unknown) with victim to the hospital.

\section*{UNCONSCIOUSNESS}
- Unconsciousness is when a person is unable to respond to people and activities.
- Brief unconsciousness (or fainting) is often caused by dehydration, low blood sugar, or temporary low blood pressure.

\section*{Levels of unconscious episodes}
- Brief - Examples are fainting or blacking out.
- Longer - The victim is incoherent when roused.
- Prolonged - A person in a coma, for example, can be motionless and not at all aware of his or her surroundings for a very long time.

\section*{Primary Survey}
- Danger - Looking for Dangers to yourself and Casualty
- Response - Use the Glasgow Coma Scale to ascertain level of consciousness
- Airway - Examining the Airway for obstruction and Cervical Spine Control in the event of any possible trauma
- Breathing - Look, Listen and Feel for adequate respiratory effort.
- Circulation - Checking the Circulation. If a carotid pulse is not palpable then resuscitation should be commenced

\section*{UNCONSCIOUSNESS}
- Do NOT give an unconscious person any food or drink.
- Do NOT leave the person alone.
- Do NOT place a pillow under the head of an unconscious person.
- Do NOT slap an unconscious person's face or splash water on the face to try to revive him.

\section*{UNCONSCIOUSNESS}
- Victim Is Not Mentally Aware; Does Not Respond to Sensory Stimuli, Such as Sound or Light
TREATMENT
1. Call for professional medical help.
2. DO NOT move victim or give anything by mouth.
3. Keep victim warm; loosen any tight clothing.
4. Maintain an open airway. If breathing difficulties develop, begin rescue breathing techniques immediately.
5. Check for emergency medical identification tag to help determine cause of unconsciousness.

\section*{UNCONSCIOUSNESS}
- Call or tell someone to call emergency lines.
- Check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse frequently. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.
- If the person is breathing and lying on the back, and you do not think there is a spinal injury, carefully roll the person toward you onto the side. If breathing or pulse stops at any time, roll the person on to his back and begin CPR.

\section*{UNCONSCIOUSNESS}
- If you think there is a spinal injury, leave the person where you found them (as long as breathing continues). If the person vomits, roll the entire body at one time to the side.
- Keep the person warm until medical help arrives.
- If fainting is likely due to low blood sugar, give the person something sweet to eat or drink when they become conscious.

First Aid: Convulsions

\section*{GENERAL INSECT STINGS}
- 1. If a stinger is present, remove it by scraping away or gently pulling it out with forceps.
- 2. Apply paste of baking soda and cold cream or use a commercially available sting aid for topical relief of mosquito and other insect bites. Calamine lotion will also relieve itching
- 3. If multiple stings, or unusual reaction (i.e. excessive reddish skin or breathing issues), or a history of severe reactions, take victim immediately to advanced medical support.

\section*{Bed Bug Bites}

Description: Bedbugs are flat-bodied, oval, reddish brown and about a $1 / 4$ in size. Although not painful at first, bed bug bites usually become red, swollen and itchy. Reactions to bites range from mild to severe.
Treatment: Apply paste of baking soda and cold cream or use a commercially available sting aid for topical relief of bed bug bites.

\section*{Bee \& Wasp Stings}
- Description: A very sore area that is red and swollen. Usually there is a stinger protruding from the skin.

\section*{Treatment:}
1. Scrape the stinger away with the edge of a credit card, knife blade, or thumbnail. Do not try and squeeze the stinger out, as this will cause more bee/wasp venom into the skin.
2. After removing the stinger, wash the area with soap and water.
3. Apply a cool washcloth or ice pack.

\section*{Bee \& Wasp Stings}
4. Some people have symptoms of severe allergic reactions are:
- shortness of breath
- thickening of the tongue
- sweating
- an anaphylactic shock
- Seek medical help immediately if you have an allergic reaction.

\section*{Scorpion Sting}

Description: Usually found in the south western portions of the US. Less dangerous than the black widow, with the exception of babies.
Treatment:
- 1. Cold packs
- 2. Get victim to advanced medical support as soon as possible.

\section*{Snake Bite}
- = Expose the wound
- (a) Remove clothing
- (b) Remove shoes
- (c) Remove casualty's jewelry (safeguard/protect jewelry. Place in casualty's pocket)
- = Determine the nature of bite
- (a) Non-poisonous
- - Four to six rows of teeth - No fang marks on victim
- (b) Poisonous
- - Two rows of teeth - Two fangs which create puncture wounds

\section*{Snake Bite}

Signs and Symptoms
(a) Less than one hour

- Circulatory failure

\section*{Snake Bite}

Treatment
»(a) Non-poisonous
- - Cleanse/disinfect wound
- Use soap and water or an antiseptic solution.
- Use iodine (if casualty is not allergic to it)

CAUTION: If the bite cannot be positively identified as poisonous or nonpoisonous, treat as a poisonous bite.

\section*{Snake Bite}

\section*{»(b) Poisonous}
- - Rest the casualty / have casualty lie down
- Keep casualty still to delay venom absorption
- Apply broad bandage
- Keep bitten part below heart level
- - Immobilize the limb
- Bring transport to casualty

\section*{Snake Bite}
- = DON'TS
- (a) Cut or incise wound
- (b) Apply tourniquet
- (c) Wash bitten area

\section*{Sprains}
- A sprain is defined as tears of ligaments supporting a joint.
- Symptoms include pain at the joint, swelling and possibly discoloration.

\section*{Sprains}

\section*{Treatment:}
- Elevate the sprained portion of the body if possible. For sprained wrist, put in a sling, place sprained ankles on a pillow elevated
- Apply cold compress (i.e. ice in a bag) or allow cold running water over the sprain for the first 6 or 8 hours. After 24 hours, apply hot compress

\section*{Splinting}
- When splinting a painful injury, it's best to "splint it where it lies."
- Place the splint so the extremity stays in the position you found it in.
- It's best not to try to straighten out a deformity, unless it's necessary to get the victim out of the wilderness.

\section*{General Principles of Splinting}
1) Splint fracture where it lies - DO NOT reposition.
2) Immobilize fracture site before moving casualty. Splint should immobilize joint above and below fracture site.
3) Pad splints before applying.
4) Dress all wounds and/or open fracture (exposed bones) prior to splinting.
5) Check for neurovascular function before, during and after application of splint.
