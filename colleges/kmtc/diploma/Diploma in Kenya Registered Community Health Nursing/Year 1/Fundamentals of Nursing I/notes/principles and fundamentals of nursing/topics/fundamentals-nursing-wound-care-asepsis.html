                        <p>The skin is the largest organ of the body, making up 16% of body weight. It has several vital functions, which include; immune function, temperature regulation, sensation and vitamin production.</p>
                        <p>Skin is a dynamic organ in a constant state of change; cells of the outer layers are continuously shed and replaced by inner cells moving to the surface.</p>

                        <p>Type of dressing used depends on:</p>

                            <li>the location, size, and type of the wound</li>
                            <li>the amount of exudate</li>
                            <li>whether the wound requires debridement, is infected, or has sinus tracts</li>
                            <li>frequency of dressing change, ease or difficulty of dressing application, and cost</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dressing Materials</h3>
                        <p>The best material to use for dressings is plain cotton gauze.</p>
                        <p>Usually, all that is needed is just enough gauze to cover the wound lightly; multiple layers are unnecessary and wasteful.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Dressing solutions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Betadine</li>
                            <li>Normal saline</li>
                            <li>Ointments - silver sulphadiazine, Bacitracin</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Wet-to-Dry Dressing</h3>
                        <p><strong>Indication:</strong> The objective of the wet-to-dry dressing technique is to clean a wound or to prevent build-up of exudate. It is called a "wet-to-dry" dressing because you place a moist dressing on the wound and allow it to dry. When the dressing is removed, it takes with it the exudate, debris, and nonviable tissue that have become stuck to the gauze. Wet-to-dry dressings are indicated for wounds that are dirty or infected.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Moisten a gauze dressing with solution, and squeeze out the excess fluid. The gauze should be damp, not soaking wet. Completely open the gauze (it usually comes folded), and place it on the wound. You do not need many layers. Then cover with a thin layer of dry gauze. Optimally, a wet-to-dry dressing should be changed 3-4 times/day, depending on how much debridement is needed. The dressing should be changed more frequently for a dirty wound than for a clean wound.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Wet-to-Wet Dressing</h3>
                        <p><strong>Indication:</strong> A wet-to-wet dressing does not debride the wound, which remains as it is. The dressing remains wet so that when the gauze is removed, the top layers of the healing wound are not removed with it. This dressing should be used on clean, granulating wounds with no overlying exudate in need of removal.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Moisten the gauze dressing with solution. It should not be soaking wet, but it should be a little wetter than damp. Unfold the gauze, place it over the wound, and then cover with dry gauze. The dressing should still be wet or damp when it is changed. If the bottom layer of gauze has dried out, saturate the gauze with saline or water before removal.</p>
                        <p><strong>How Often?</strong> The wet-to-wet dressing should be changed at least twice a day to prevent drying.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Antibiotic Ointment</h3>
                        <p><strong>Indication:</strong> Antiobiotic ointment may be used as an alternative to wet-to-wet dressings for a clean wound that is healing well and has no need for debridement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Technique:</strong> Coat the wound with a small amount of ointment. A thick layer of antibiotic ointment over the wound offers no advantage and wastes supplies. Cover with a dry gauze if the wound is large or if it is in an area that will be covered with bed clothing or rubbed by clothing. Otherwise the wound can be left open to air with the antibiotic ointment alone.</p>
                        <p><strong>How Often?</strong> Remove the old ointment with gentle soap and water or saline, and reapply the ointment once or twice a day.</p>

                        <p>Remember, the goal is to promote healing. We know that a moist environment facilitates healing.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For a clean wound, it is best to use a wet-to-wet or ointment based dressing</li>
                            <li>For a wound in need of debridement the wet-to-dry technique should be done until the wound is clean and then change to a different dressing regimen.</li>
                            <li>For a wound covered with necrotic tissue, dressings cannot take the place of mechanical debridement. When present, necrotic tissue must be sharply debrided and then the wound treated with appropriate dressings.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Sterile technique</strong> uses instruments and supplies that have been specifically treated so that no bacterial or viral particles are present on their surfaces. Examples of sterilized supplies include instruments that havebeen autoclaved (subjected to high temperatures to kill microorganisms) and gauze and gloves that have been especially prepared at the factory and are individually packaged. Procedures in an operating room are usually done with sterile technique.</p>
                        <p>Gauze usually comes folded into a square. For dressings, it is best to open the gauze so that a single layer is in contact with the open wound.</p>
                        <p><strong>Clean technique</strong> uses instruments and supplies that are not as thoroughly treated to rid surfaces of all microorganisms. Nonsterile gloves and gauze, which come many in a package, are examples of "clean" supplies. Clean supplies are less expensive than sterile supplies. Hence, appropriate use of clean techniques can save valuable resources.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>All wounds should be thoroughly cleansed to allow full examination and subsequent closure. This will remove all loose particulate matter and decrease bacterial content. Remember, this can be painful, so whenever possible start by injecting local anesthetic around the wound.</p>
                        <p>Wound cleansing requires the application of fluid to clean the wound and optimise the healing environment.</p>
                        <p>The goal of wound cleansing is to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Remove visible debris and devitalised tissue</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Principles:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wound cleansing should not be undertaken to remove 'normal' exudate</li>
                            <li>Cleansing should be performed in a way that minimises trauma to the wound</li>
                            <li>Wounds are best cleansed with sterile isotonic saline or water</li>
                            <li>The less we disturb a wound during dressing changes the lower the interference to healing</li>
                            <li>Fluids should be warmed to $37^{\circ}\text{C}$ to support cellular activity</li>
                            <li>Skin and wound cleansers should have a neutral pH and be non-toxic</li>
                            <li>Avoid alkaline soap on intact skin as the skin pH is altered, resistance to bacteria decreases</li>
                            <li>Avoid delipidising agents as alcohol or acetone as tissue is degraded</li>
                            <li>Antiseptics are not routinely recommended for cleansing and should only be used sparingly for infected wounds</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Method:</h3>
                        <p>Irrigation is the preferred method for cleansing open wounds. This may be carried out utilising a syringe in order to produce gentle pressure - in order to loosen debris. Gauze swabs and cotton wool should be used with caution as can cause mechanical damage to new tissue and the shedding of fibres from gauze swabs/cotton wool delays healing.</p>

                            <li><dfn>Asepsis</dfn> is the state of being free from diseasecausing contaminants (such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) or, preventing contact with microorganisms</li>
                            <li><dfn>Aseptic technique</dfn> is a general term involving practices that minimize the introduction of microorganisms to patients during patient care.</li>
                            <li>There are two categories of asepsis; general asepsis which applies to patient care procedures outside the operating theatre and surgical asepsis relating to procedures/processes designed to prevent surgical site infection.</li>
                            <li>'A <dfn>clean technique</dfn> is a modified aseptic technique and aims to avoid introducing micro-organisms to a susceptible site and also to prevent crossinfection to patients and staff' (Royal Marsden Manual).</li>
                            <li>It differs from an aseptic technique, as the use of sterile equipment and the environment are not as crucial as would be required for asepsis.</li>
                            <li><dfn>Infection</dfn> is the 'invasion and multiplication of micro-organisms within tissue, which then results in destruction of the tissue' (ICNA 2003). It is part of a chain of events that can occur within the healthcare setting.</li>
