\section*{NURSING JUDGEMENTS}
- Judgments lead to effective care planning, interventions and intervention revision based on the evaluation of care.
- Every client's care must be individualized.
- Thinking critically will help avoid applying inaccurate knowledge from one situation to another.

\section*{MODEL FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NURSING JUDGMENT}

The nurse can apply the skill of clinical reasoning to determine the problem. These decisions are based on sound reasoning.
- Explanation - The ability to clearly and concisely explain one's conclusions. The nurse should be able to provide sound rationale for his/her answers.
- Self-regulation - Involves monitoring one's own thinking. This means reflecting on the process leading to the conclusions. The individual should self-correct the thinking process as needed, being alert for biases and incorrect assumptions.

\section*{Critical Thinking And Nursing Process}
- Critical thinking is the thought process underlying judgments and decisions made throughout the nursing process.

- How open am I to new ideas and viewpoints that differ from my own?
- Am I aware of my usual thinking and learning habits?
- Do I persist to find answers and solutions?
- How well do I express myself in writing?

\section*{APPLYING CRITICAL THINKING TO NURSING PRACTICE}
- A nurse manager faced with the common scenario of creating a time schedule that covers the Christmas and New Year holidays reviews the past practice on the unit. The practice on the unit is that staff must work one or the other holiday and preferences are based on seniority. Junior members of the staff do not receive their preferred holidays off resulting in dissatisfaction. In reflecting on this situation, the manager recognizes that senior members of the staff always being granted their holiday preferences for days off disadvantages junior members of the staff resulting in dissatisfaction.

\section*{APPLYING CRITICAL THINKING TO NURSING PRACTICE}
- As an evening supervisor, I stopped to check on a new graduate who was in charge for the first time. She appeared to be " in over her head," nervous and running around. Calmly, I asked how things were going. She replied, " Fine, except for the man in Room 203. His temperature was $104^{\circ}$ an hour ago. We drew blood cultures, gave aspirin, and started him on antibiotics. "I asked, " What 's the temperature now?" She replied, " He 's not due until 8 pm " (3 hours later).

THE NURSING PROCESS

\section*{LESSON OBJECTIVES}

By the end of the lesson, the student will be able to:-
- Define the nursing process
- State the importance of the nursing process
- Describe the steps of the nursing process
- Draw a nursing care plan

\section*{Nursing Process}
- Specific to the nursing profession
- A framework for critical thinking It's purpose is to:
"Diagnose and treat human responses to actual or potential health problems"

\section*{DEFINITION}
- An evolving procedure consisting of five components by which a person's health status and needs are identified (assessment and diagnosis), plans are developed (planning), care is delivered (implementation), and outcomes are evaluated (evaluation) as the physical, social, and emotional problems of the person are resolved and/or new problems are identified.

\section*{Nursing Process}
- Organized framework to guide practice
- Problem solving method - client focused
- Systematic- sequential steps
- Goal oriented- outcome criteria
- Dynamic-always changing, flexible
- Utilizes critical thinking processes

\section*{Nursing Process}

It can be understood as:-
- A form of documentation
- As a means of organizing work, that is patient allocation or primary nursing
- As an educational tool to help achieve patient centred nursing
- As a philosophy to help nursing attain professional status by offering an alternative to the medical model.

\section*{Scientific Method of problem solving}
- Identify the problem
- Collect data
- Form hypothesis
- Plan of action
- Hypothesis testing
- Interpret results
- Evaluate findings
- Nursing process is very much like the scientific method of problem solving.
- Nursing process is UNIQUE to the nursing profession

\section*{Characteristics of the Process}
- It is a systematic, client - centred method for structuring the delivery of nursing care.
- It entails gathering and analyzing data in order to identify client strengths and potential or actual health problems and developing and continually reviewing a plan of nursing interventions to achieve mutually agreed outcomes.
- It is cyclical - components follow a logical sequence.

\section*{Characteristics of the Process}
- Is interpersonal and collaborative. It requires the nurse to communicate directly and consistently with clients and families to meet their needs.
- It is used as a framework for nursing care in all types of health care settings with clients of all age groups.
- Nurses must use a variety of critical thinking skills to carry out the nursing process.

\section*{Characteristics of the Process}
- This process is cyclical. While the phases are ongoing, the actual process can end any time if the patient's problems are solved.
- The method is designed to be applied to any individual, family, or community need.
- The nursing process is used for medical problems and also to help with emotional or social needs of patients as well.
- The nursing process is goal-oriented. It is used to make client-centered, measurable, realistic goals for individual or community wellness improvement.

\section*{Nursing Process Characteristics}
- Orderly, step-by-step process
- Client is evaluated
- Data are collected and analyzed
- Plan of care is determined and set into motion
- Client is monitored, evaluated
- Care plan is revised as needed
- Client centered
- Assists to plan according to client needs
- Client participates
- Promotes collaboration

\section*{Advantages of Nursing Process}
- Provides
individualized
care
- Client is an
active participant
- Promotes
continuity of care
- Provides more effective communication
- Develops a clear and efficient plan of care
- Provides personal satisfaction as you see client achieve goals
- Professional

\section*{Advantages of Nursing Process}
- Lets the nurse develop a plan of care for the client and gives the nurse direction
- Helps determine the client's problems and ways to help the client overcome these problems
- Based on 5 specific steps which need to be completed in order
- Based on goals to determine if client's needs have been met. Designed on monitoring the outcomes of the process
- Continually looked at, reviewed, and changed based on the client's condition
- Guides the nurse to assist the client with reaching their greatest level of health

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF THE NURSING PROCESS}
- The nursing process enables the nurse to organize and deliver nursing care.
- The nursing process involves scientific reasoning.
- The nursing process is used to identify, diagnose and treat human responses to health and illness

\section*{Benefits of the Nursing Process}
- Improved quality of care
- Continuity of care
- Promotes client participation in care
- Delivery of care is organized, continuous, and systematic
- Efficient use of time and resources

\section*{PURPOSE OF CARE PLANNING}
- It is a legal document
- Shows accountability "The care plan is a document that identifies the care to be given, and a record that shows who planned and gave that care
- It should guide the work of others and be a basis for continuity of care
- Should show a logical and systematic flow of ideas through from the initial assessment to the final evaluation

\section*{PHASES OF THE NURSING PROCESS}
- ASSESSING - collect data, organize, validate, document
- DIAGNOSING - analyze data, identify problems, risks and strengths,, formulate diagnostic statements.
- OUTCOME IDENTIFICATION
- PLANNING - prioritize problems/ diagnoses, formulate goals/ desired outcomes, select nursing interventions, write nursing orders.

\section*{PHASES OF THE NURSING PROCESS}
- IMPLEMENTING - reassess the client, determine the nurse's need for assistance, implement the nursing interventions, supervise delegated care, document nursing activities
- EVALUATING - collect data related to outcomes, compare data with outcomes, relate nursing actions to client goals/ outcomes, draw conclusions about problem status, continue, modify or terminate the client's care plan.

- Performed within a specified time period
- Establishes complete database
- Problem-Focused
- Ongoing process integrated with care
- Determines status of a specific problem
- Emergency
- Performed during physiologic or psychologic crises
- Identifies life-threatening problems
- Identifies new or overlooked problems
- Time-lapsed
- Occurs several months after initial
- Compares current status to baseline

\section*{ASSESSMENT}

What components are needed for a successful assessment
- Good communication
- A systematic approach to data collection
- Interpretation based on nursing knowledge

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}
- Second step of the Nursing Process
- Interpret \& analyze clustered data
- Identify client's problems and strengths
- Formulate Nursing Diagnosis (NANDA : North American Nursing Diagnosis Association)-Statement of how the client is RESPONDING to an actual or potential problem that requires nursing intervention

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- A nursing diagnosis is a statement that describes the client's actual or potential response to health problem is licensed and competent to treat.
- Nursing diagnoses provide the basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcome for which the nurse is accountable.

\section*{Characteristics of Nursing Diagnoses}
- Complement physician treatments
- Separate and distinct
- Structure of Nursing Diagnoses
- Nursing Dx is a problem statement of how the client is RESPONDING to a problem...it may be an actual or potential problem
- Interpreted data is clustered in according to body systems, risk factors, family factors, emotional factors etc.

\section*{Types of Nursing Diagnoses}

Actual nursing diagnosis
- existing response to condition
- problem exists
- supporting signs and/or symptoms

Risk Nursing Diagnoses
- Possible development of problem
- Has not occurred
- No signs or symptoms
- NANDA describes Risk Diagnosis as:
"a clinical judgment made when a client is more vulnerable to develop the problem than others in the same or similar situations."

\section*{Types of Nursing Diagnoses}

A wellness diagnosis
Describes human responses to levels of wellness in an individual, family or community that have a readiness for enhancement e.g readiness for enhanced family coping.
A possible nursing diagnosis
Evidence about a health problem is incomplete or unclear e.g possible social isolation related to unknown cause in an elderly lady admitted and has none visiting her.
A syndrome diagnosis
Associated with a cluster of other diagnoses e.g risk for disuse syndrome in bed-ridden patients.

\section*{QUALIFIERS FOR DIAGNOSIS}
- Acute= Severe but short duration
- Alter= a change from baseline
- Chronic= Lasting along time, recurring, constant
- Decrease= lessened
- Increase = greater in size
- Deficient=inadequate in amount, not sufficient
- Depleted= empty, exhausted of..
- Disturbed= agitated, interrupted
- Dysfunction=abnormal

\section*{QUALIFIERS FOR DIAGNOSIS}
- Excessive= Quantity is greater
- Impaired =made worse, damage
- Ineffective =Not producing the desired effect
- Potential for =powerful
- Risk =hazard, chance of loss
- Hypothermia= body temperature is reduced below normal
- Hyperthermia =body temperature is elevated above normal
- Enhanced = made greater, increase quality

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS IS NOT MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS}
- Nursing Dx
$\checkmark$ describes the response to health problem
$\checkmark$ Determined by the nurse
$\checkmark$ Clinical judgment about the client
$\checkmark$ Human responses to disease or treatment
- Medical Dx - Diagnoses disease
- Determined by physician

\section*{Formulating a Nursing Diagnosis}
- Composed of 3 parts:
- Problem statement- the client's response to a problem
- Etiology- what's causing/contributing to the client's problem
- Defining Characteristics-what's the evidence of the problem

\section*{Nursing Diagnosis}
- Problem( Diagnostic Label)based on your assessment of client...(gathered information), pick a problem from the NANDA list...
- Etiology- determine what the problem is caused by or related to.
- Defining characteristics- then state as evidenced by (AEB) the specific facts the problem is based

\section*{NANDA NURSING DIAGNOSES}
- The purpose of NANDA is to define, refine and promote a taxonomy of nursing diagnostic terminology of general use to professional nurses.
- A taxonomy is a classification system or set of categories arranged on the basis of a single principle or set of principles.
- Diagnosing refers to the reasoning process.
- Diagnosis is a statement or conclusion regarding the nature of a phenomenon.

\section*{NANDA NURSING DIAGNOSES}

COMPONENTS
- Problem (diagnostic label) and its definition.
- Etiology
- Defining characteristicts.

\title{
NANDA NURSING DIAGNOSES \\ PROBLEM (DIAGNOSTIC LABEL) AND DEFINITION
}
- Describes the client's health problem or response for which nursing therapy is given.
- Describes the client's health status clearly and concisely.
- Purpose is to direct formation of client goals and desired outcomes.

\section*{NANDA NURSING DIAGNOSES \\ ETIOLOGY (RELATED FACTORS AND RISK FACTORS)}
- Identifies one or more probable causes of the health problem, gives direction to the required nursing therapy and enables the nurse to individualize care.
- Differentiating among possible causes in the nursing diagnosis is essential because each may require different nursing interventions.

\section*{NANDA NURSING DIAGNOSES}

DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS
- Are the cluster of signs and symptoms that indicate the presence of a particular diagnostic label.
- For actual nursing diagnosis, the defining characteristics are the client's signs and symptoms.
- For risk nursing diagnoses, the factors that cause the client to be more than "normally" vulnerable to the problem form the etiology of a risk nursing diagnosis.

\section*{COMPONENTS OF NURSING DIAGNOSIS LABEL}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline DIAGNOSIS AND DEFINITION & ETIOLOGY/ RELATED FACTORS & DEFINING CHARACTERISTI CTS \\
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{ACTIVITY INTOLERANCE} \\
\hline -Insufficient physiological or psychological energy to endure or complete required or desired daily activities & \begin{tabular}{l}
-Bedrest or immobility \\
-Generalized weakness \\
-Imbalance between oxygen supply / demand -Sedentary life style
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
-Verbal report of fatigue or weakness -Abnormal heart rate or blood pressure response to activity \\
-ECG changes reflecting arrhythmias or
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS}
- Uses the critical thinking skills of analysis and synthesis
- Used continuously by nurses
- Has 3 steps
1. Analyzing data - compare data against standards; cluster cues; Identify gaps and inconsistencies
2. Identifying health problems, risks and strengths

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS}
3. Formulating diagnostic statements
- basic two-part statements (problem/etiology), the two parts are joined by the words related to rather than due to. Due to implies that one part causes the other part
- Basic three-part statements (problem/etiology/signs and symptoms)cannot be used for risk diagnosis
- One part statements e.g wellness and syndrome nursing diagnosis; consist one label only; more specific e.g rape-trauma syndrome, readiness for enhanced parenting

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS}

\section*{VARIATIONS OF BASIC FORMATS}
- Writing unknown etiology when the defining characteristics are present but the nurse does not know the cause or contributing factors
- Using the phrase complex factors when there are too many etiologic factors.
- Using the word possible to describe either the problem or the etiology
- Using secondary to divide the etiology into two parts, thereby making the statements more descriptive and useful
- Adding a second part to the general response to make it more specific e.g impaired skin integrity (left lateral ankle)

\section*{DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS}

\section*{AVOIDING ERRORS IN DIAGNOSTIC REASONING}
- Verify
- Build a good knowledge base and acquire clinical experience
- Have a working knowledge of what is normal vital signs, lab tests, breath sounds
- Consult resources - literature, colleagues
- Base diagnoses on patterns - on behaviour over time rather than on an isolated incident
- Improve critical thinking skills - help to avoid errors in thinking e.g overgeneralization, stereotyping

\section*{Planning}

Third step of the Nursing Process
- This is when the nurse organizes a nursing care plan based on the nursing diagnoses.
- Nurse and client formulate goals to help the client with their problems
- Expected outcomes are identified
- Interventions (nursing orders) are selected to aid the client reach these goals.

\section*{PLANNING}

Planning is a deliberative, systematic phase of the nursing process that involves decision making and problem solving.

\section*{TYPES OF PLANNING}
- Initial planning - on admission, the nurse who performs admission assessment develops a comprehensive care plan.
- Ongoing planning - done by all nurses who work with the client.
- Discharge planning - begins at first client contact and involves comprehensive and ongoing assessment to obtain information about the client's ongoing needs.

\section*{PLANNING}

Effective planning depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of the assessment
- Determine the problems
- Establish the risks and priorities - How ill are they?
- Can they breath adequately (safe airway?)
- Are they in pain? (physical/ psychological)
- Can they maintain a safe environment? If not why not? (Drugs, drink, mental or psychological problem?)
- Noncompliance with medical advice

\section*{PLANNING}

\section*{Goals}
- $\square$ Client centered
- $\square$ Focus on the behavior
- Describe intended or desired change

Expected Outcome
- $\square$ Leads to fulfillment of goal
- Resolution of the problem
- Nursing Interventions
- $\square$ Planned actions
- $\square$ Promotes goal attainment

\section*{PLANNING PROCESS}
- Setting priorities
- Establishing client goals/ desired outcomes
- Selecting nursing interventions
- Writing nursing orders

\section*{Planning - Begin by prioritizing client problems}
- Prioritize list of client's nursing diagnoses using Maslow
- Rank as high, intermediate or low
- Client specific
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_e8bb00c13e0ea97515f3g-066.jpg?height=1137&width=1054&top_left_y=538&top_left_x=1265)
- Priorities can change

\section*{Goals are patient-centered and SMART}

\section*{Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant Time Bound}

Pt will walk 50 ft.
Pt will eat $75 \%$ of meal
Pt will be OOB $2-4 \mathrm{hrs}$
Pt will maintain $\mathrm{HR}<100$
Pt will state pain level is acceptable 6 (0-10)

\section*{PURPOSE OF DESIRED OUTCOME/ GOAL}
1. Provide direction for planning nursing interventions.
2. Serve as criteria for evaluating client progress.
3. Enable the client and nurse to determine when the problem has been resolved.
4. Help motivate the client and nurse by providing a sense of achievement.

\section*{Planning Developing a goal and outcome statement}
- Goal and outcome statements are client focused.
- Worded positively
- Measurable, specific observable, time-limited, and realistic
- Goal = broad statement
- Expected outcome = objective criterion for measurement of goal

\section*{Planning \\ Developing a goal and outcome statement}

EXAMPLE
- Goal:

Client will achieve therapeutic management of disease process....
- Outcome Statement: B/P readings of
110-120 / 70-80 and client statement of understanding importance of dietary sodium restrictions by day of discharge.

\section*{PURPOSE OF DESIRED OUTCOME/ GOAL}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline NURSING DIAGNOSIS & GOALS & DESIRED OUTCOMES \\
\hline Impaired physical mobility: inability to bear weight on left leg related to inflammation of knee joint. & Improved mobility Ability to bear weight on left leg & Ambulate with crutches Stand without assistance by the end of the month. \\
\hline Ineffective airway clearance related to poor cough effort, seconary to incision pain and fear of damaging sutures & Effective airway clearance & Lungs clear to auscultation during the entire postoperative period No cyanosis by 12 hours post-operation Will demonstrate good cough effort within 24 hours after surgery. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Planning-select interventions}
- Interventions are selected and written.
- The nurse uses clinical judgment and professional knowledge to select appropriate interventions that will aid the client in reaching their goal.
- Interventions should be examined for feasibility and acceptability to the client
- Interventions should be written

\section*{Interventions - 3 types}
- Independent ( Nurse initiated )- any action the nurse can initiate without direct supervision
- Dependent (Physician initiated )-nursing actions requiring MD orders
- Collaborative- nursing actions performed jointly with other health

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT ETIOLOGIES}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline DIAGNOSTIC LABEL (PROBLEM) & ETIOLOGY & NURSING INTERVENTION \\
\hline CONSTIPATIO N & Long-term laxative use & Develop a plan for gradual withdrawal from the laxatives; teach components of high fiber diet \\
\hline & Inactivity and insufficient fluid intake & Develop an exercise regimen that the client can follow at home; help the client develop a plan for including sufficient amounts of fluids in his diet \\
\hline INEFFECTIVE BREASTFEEDI NG & Breast engorgement & Teach massage of breasts before feeding; use hot packs before nursing \\
\hline & Inexperience and lack of knowledge & Teach to feed baby on demand; demonstrate different holding positions for feeding \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Implemention}
- The fourth step in the Nursing Process
- This is the "Doing" step
- Carrying out nursing interventions (orders) selected during the planning step
- This includes monitoring, teaching, further assessing, reviewing NCP, incorporating physicians orders and monitoring cost effectiveness of interventions
- Utilize nursing intervention classification (NIC) as standard

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}
- Consists of doing and documenting the activities that are the specific nursing actions needed to carry out the interventions(or nursing orders).
- Provides the actual nursing activities and client responses that are examined during the final phase.

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}

Executing the care plan
- Interventions are performed
- Assessment before, during, and after
- Report and document Includes:
- Putting the care plan into action
- Carrying out planned interventions
- $\square$ Assessing, reporting, documenting

\section*{Five activities of the implementing phase}

Five Activities of the Implementing Phase
- Reassessing the client
- Determining the nurse's need for assistance
- Implementing nursing interventions
- Supervising delegated care
- Documenting nursing activities

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}

\section*{IMPLEMENTING SKILLS}
- Cognitive/ intellectual skills - include problem solving, decision-making, critical thinking and creativity.
- Interpersonal skills - are all of the activities, verbal and nonverbal, people use when interacting directly with each other.
- Technical skills - are ‘hands-on’ skills/ tasks/procedures/psychomotor skills.

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}

PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING INCLUDES:-
- Reassessing the client
- Determining the nurse's need for assistance
- Implementing the nurse's interventions
- Supervising the delegated care
- Documenting the nursing activities

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}

\section*{GUIDELINES}
- Base nursing interventions on scientific knowledge, nursing research and evidence-based practice.
- Clearly understand the orders to be implemented and question any that are not understood.
- Adapt activities to individual client.

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}
- Implement safe care e.g infection prevention
- Provide teaching, support and comfort.
- Be holistic
- Respect the dignity of the client and enhance the client's self-esteem; encourage clients to make own decisions
- Encourage clients to participate

\section*{RATIONALE}
- A rationale is the scientific principle given as the reason for selecting a particular nursing intervention.

\section*{Evaluation- To determine effectiveness of NCP}
- Final step of the Nursing Process but also done concurrently throughout client care
- A comparison of client behavior and/or response to the established outcome criteria
- Continuous review of the nursing care plan
- Examines if nursing interventions are working
- Determines changes needed to help

\section*{EVALUATION}

Evaluation is a planned, ongoing, purposeful activity in which clients and health professionals determine:-
a) The client's progress toward achievement of goals/outcomes
b) The effectiveness of the nursing care plan. Conclusions drawn from evaluation determine whether the nursing interventions should be terminated, continued or changed.

\section*{EVALUATION}
- MENTAL - On going throughout implementation
- WRITTEN (this should preferably be done with the patient present in order to get accurate feedback)
- Must be carried out at least twice in 24 hours
- And whenever any incident occurs. (date, time
- signature)
- Write a general statement about patient's condition
- (better, same, worse)
- Evaluate each care plan in turn and by number

\section*{EVALUATION}
- Client is evaluated
- Care plan is evaluated
- Goal attainment is determined
- Cognitive Skills

Nurses Use:
- Decision making
- Critical thinking
- Problem solving

\section*{Evaluation Purpose}
- To estimate effectiveness of care
- To estimate quality of care
- To estimate client responses
- To determine if the care plan is working
- To determine how well the care plan is working

\section*{EVALUATION}

\section*{COMPONENTS}
- Collecting data related to the desired outcomes
- Comparing the data with outcomes
- Relating nursing activities to outcomes
- Drawing conclusions about problem status
- Continuing, modifying or terminating the nursing care plan.

\section*{Characteristics of Evaluation}
- Ongoing
- Continues as long as care is provided
- Client responses are compared
- Focuses on relationship
- Success of plan is judged

\section*{Evaluation}

Factors that impede goal attainment:
- Incomplete database
- Unrealistic client outcomes
- Nonspecific nursing interventions
- Inadequate time for clients to achieve outcomes.

\section*{WRITING A CARE PLAN}

\section*{Think about}
- Who is it for ?(The patient and other members of nursing team)
-What are the short term and long term goals?
- How can you determine that you have reached the goals? (measurable)
- How will the patient know he/she has achieved the goals? (realistic)
- Who is involved in the delivery of the care? (The patient (and family), yourself, the nursing team, medical staff, multidisciplinary team, labs, investigations, procedures etc)
- How quickly is the problem likely to change - How soon will you need to reevaluate the plan?

\section*{WRITING A CARE PLAN}

\section*{GUIDELINES}
1. Date and sign the plan - this is essential for evaluation, review and future planning.
2. Use category headings - Nursing Dx. Goals, Nursing intervention
3. Use standardized medical/ English symbols e. bd, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
4. Be specific - to help in clarifying issues.
5. Refer to procedure books or other references other rather than writing all the steps in a written plan.

\section*{WRITING A CARE PLAN}
6. Tailor the plan to the unique characteristics of the client by ensuring that the client's choices e.g preferences about times of care and the methods used are included.
7. Ensure that the plan incorporates preventive and health maintenance aspects as well as restorative.
8. Ensure that the plan contains interventions for ongoing assessment of the client.
9. Include collaborative and coordination activities in the plan.
10. Include plans for the client's discharge and home care needs.

\section*{NURSING ORDERS}

Nursing orders are instructions for the specific individualized activities the nurse performs to help the client meet established health care goals. How detailed the order is depends on the health personnel who will carry out the order.

\section*{COMPONENTS}
- Date
- Action verb e.g monitor
- Content area - what and where of the order
- Time element - when, how long, how often
- Signature - accountability and legal significance
