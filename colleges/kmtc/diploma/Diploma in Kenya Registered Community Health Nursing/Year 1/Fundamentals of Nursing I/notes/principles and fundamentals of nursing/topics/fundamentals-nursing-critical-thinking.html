                        <p>It is thinking that defines its purposes and goals well; thinking that frames a question or problem precisely; thinking that carefully checks information for its completeness and relevance; thinking that is sensitive to ideas and concepts; thinking that can trace implications and consequences; thinking that can appreciate multiple perspectives and ways of looking at things. It is, in short, thinking done in such a way as to be disciplined and self-correcting. (Paul, 1995)</p>
                        <p>Critical thinking underlies independent and interdependent decision-making. It includes questioning, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, inference, inductive and deductive reasoning, intuition, application and creativity (American Association of Colleges of Nursing, 1998).</p>

                                <p><strong>CRITICAL ANALYSIS</strong></p>
                                <p>It is the application of a set of questions to a particular situation or idea to determine essential information and ideas and discard superfluous information and ideas.</p>
                                <p><strong>Socratic questions:</strong></p>
                                <p>Socratic questioning is a technique one can use to look beneath the surface, recognize and examine assumptions, search for inconsistencies, examine multiple points of view and differentiate what one knows from what merely believes.</p>

                                <p><strong>INDUCTIVE REASONING</strong></p>
                                <p>Generalizations are made from a set of facts or observations. When viewed together, certain bits of information suggest a particular interpretation. e.g the nurse who observes that a client has dry skin, poor turgor, sunken eyes and dark amber urine may make a generalization that the client appears dehydrated.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>DEDUCTIVE REASONING</strong></p>
                                <p>Is reasoning from the general to the specific. The nurse starts with a conceptual framework and makes descriptive interpretations of the client's needs basing on that frame work e.g basing Maslow's hierarchy of needs the nurse can categorize the client's problems in terms of elimination, nutrition and protection.</p>

                        <p>Nurses function effectively some part of everyday without thinking critically e.g selecting which uniform to wear or deciding what to eat. However, the high order skills of critical thinking are put in play as soon as a new idea is encountered or a less-than-routine decision must be made.</p>
                        <p>The Nursing Process is a systematic, rational method of planning and providing individualized care. Paul and Elder (1995) identified elements of thought and applied to the nursing process.</p>

                            <li>Critical thinking fails as a process when logic is not used. A common fallacy arises from using a circular argument. For example, a nurse might write the nursing diagnosis "Ineffective coping, as evidenced by inability to cope." This does not define the problem, it simply makes a circle.</li>
                            <li>Another illogical process is called appeal to tradition. This is the argument that we have "always done it this way." New strategies and creative approaches are ignored.</li>
                            <li>Errors in logic also occur when the thinker makes hasty generalizations without considering the evidence. The critical thinker does not jump to conclusion.</li>

                            <li>Everyone has biases. Critical thinkers examine their biases and do not allow them to compromise the integrity of their thinking processes.</li>
                            <li>Biases can interfere with patient care. For example, if we believe patients with alcoholism are manipulative, when the patient complains of anxiety, we ignore their complaint and miss the signs of delirium tremens.</li>

The practice on the unit is that staff must work one or the other holiday and preferences are based on seniority.

In reflecting on this situation, the manager recognizes that senior members of the staff always being granted their holiday preferences for days off disadvantages junior members of the staff resulting in dissatisfaction.</p>

Calmly, I asked how things were going. She replied, " Fine, except for the man in Room 203. His temperature was $104^{\circ}$ an hour ago. We drew blood cultures, gave aspirin, and started him on antibiotics. "I asked, " What 's the temperature now?" She replied, " He 's not due until 8 pm " (3 hours later).</p>
