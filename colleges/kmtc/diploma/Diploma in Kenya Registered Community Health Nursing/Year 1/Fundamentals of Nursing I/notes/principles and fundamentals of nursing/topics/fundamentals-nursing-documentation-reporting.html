                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><dfn>Documentation</dfn> is any written or electronically generated information about a client that describes the care or service provided to that client.</p>
                        <p>Documentation is the written and legal recording of the interventions that concern the patient and it includes a sequence of processes.</p>
                        <p>Documentation is established with the personal record of the patient, which constitutes a base of information on the situation of his health.</p>
                        <p>Health records may be paper documents or electronic documents, such as electronic medical records, faxes, e-mails, audio or video tapes and images.</p>
                        <p>Documentation is critical to determine if the standard of care was rendered to a patient to defend nursing actions.</p>
                        <p>Failure to chart, omissions and poor communication are hard to defend.</p>
                        <p>Effective written communication skills are essential in order to precisely document each of the components of nursing practice.</p>
                        <p>When done well, nursing documentation is a valuable tool to support effective communication between providers and continuity of care within and across settings.</p>
                        <p>The health-care record is a clinical document. It should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>information to identify the client,</li>
                            <li>the care provider,</li>
                            <li>the date of the encounter,</li>
                            <li>the problem(s) being addressed,</li>
                            <li>care provided,</li>
                            <li>the clinical reasoning for the choice of care,</li>
                            <li>the client's response and/or outcome of the interventions and future plans.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Documentation is a part of that responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Through documentation, nurses communicate their observations, decisions, actions and outcomes of these actions for clients.</p>
                        <p>Documentation is an accurate account of what occurred and when it occurred.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Nursing is governed by ethical guidelines and laws. In order to track compliance with the laws and guidelines, documentation is used.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Proof of Care:</strong> Documentation shows the extent of care provided to a patient and the due diligence of the staff. How a patient was admitted, tested and treated. Every medication administered, test ordered and conversation with staff is recorded. This acts as proof of the care a patient received. Important also is justification for a procedure which is noted in the chart.</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional Accountability:</strong> Things can go wrong in health care, and, as such, health-care workers are susceptible to lawsuits. In order to protect yourself, documentation is important. Documentation is proof that you have provided a good quality of care, followed protocol and have done your best to help the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Licensing:</strong> In order to operate within a health-care setting, both individuals and the institutions must be licensed. Review boards periodically look through records to determine that the staff is doing the job well. Accrediting bodies for hospitals review documentation to determine if the hospital is eligible for government funding. This determination is based on ethical treatment, quality of care and outcome of care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quality of Care:</strong> The quality of care is an ethical concern in nursing. Nurses are charged with providing a level of care that is governed by the licensing board as well as the institution where they work. To prove that this quality of care is being provided, nurses document patient interactions, such as concerns raised by patients which are then relayed to doctors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Documentation is important in treating clients. Proper documentation gives the health-care provider all the information needed to make a safe and appropriate treatment decision; Incomplete or inaccurate records can lead to treatment errors.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The following principles are intended to provide nurses with clear direction for producing and maintaining high quality, defensible documentation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Document fact:</strong> Fact is what the nurse or midwife saw, heard or did in relation to the patient's care and condition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Document all relevant information:</strong> This will be dictated by consideration of the individual circumstances of each patient. Nurses' documentation should be made with respect to the total condition of the patient, not just a clinical specialty.</li>
                            <li><strong>Document contemporaneously:</strong> Nurses and midwives should record entries in the patient's notes as soon as possible after the events to which reference is being made have occurred, with the date and time for each entry recorded. All entries should also include the author's signature, printed name and designation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Maintain the integrity of documentation:</strong> This principle refers to the requirement to preserve all that is recorded in a patient's record, even if an error is made. Nurses and midwives should not attempt to change or delete errors made in the patient's notes. An attempt to change or delete an entry could be interpreted as an attempt to cover up events or mislead others.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <span class="heading-text">Guidelines for Documentation</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Objective/Factual Documentation:</strong> Registered nurses must document accurately, completely, and objectively including any errors that occurred. An objective description is the result of direct observation and measurement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Timeliness:</strong> Documentation is enhanced when client information is entered frequently into the client health-care record (Keatings & Smith, 2000). Contemporaneous documentation (completion of the health-care record notes as close to the time of care as possible) enhances the credibility and accuracy of healthcare records. Documentation of an intervention should never be completed before it takes place.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use of Space:</strong> Documentation must not have empty lines or spaces, and the time when assessments and interventions were completed must be noted. On forms or flow sheets every required space should be filled.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use of Abbreviations:</strong> Many organizations are currently developing policies that are aimed at reducing the number of common but preventable sources of errors. These policies are related to approved or prohibited abbreviations, or are policies requiring that no abbreviations be used in a practice setting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Follow-up:</strong> Document any follow-up of assessments, observations or interventions that have been done, including whether a physician or other care provider has been notified regarding the client. Failed attempts to reach a care provider, the follow-up action taken, and the client's response to interventions should be documented on the client's healthcare record.</li>
                            <li><strong>Correcting Errors:</strong> To correct an error in a paper-based health-care records system, one method that can be used to appropriately make corrections is the SLIDE rule (Baker, 2000). The SLIDE rule is completed as follows: cross through the word(s) with a <strong>S</strong>ingle <strong>L</strong>ine, and <strong>I</strong>nsert your initials, along with the <strong>D</strong>ate and time the correction is made; then <strong>E</strong>nter the correct information/explanation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recording Medication Administration:</strong> Document the administration of medications immediately after its administration. This prevents errors such as another RN administering medication when the first dose was not recorded.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recording Assistance with Care:</strong> In most circumstances, when a RN assists another RN in providing care, the RN providing care documents the actions and the client's responses and notes that another care provider assisted. It is not required to name the person who assisted. In certain circumstances, as in a critical incident such as a fall, it is important to record the names of those individuals assisting.</li>
                            <li><strong>Designated Recorder in Emergency Situations:</strong> In some emergency situations (e.g., during a cardiac arrest), documentation may be done by a designated recorder. When acting as a designated recorder, the recorder identifies the persons involved and the care they provided.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarification of Orders:</strong> If an order is poorly written, never guess or rely on group consensus to interpret that order. Always call the writer for clarification. There is a high risk for error and potential for an unsafe event to occur. A written record of every telephone call should be maintained, whether it is with another care provider for clarification of orders, or with a client following discharge from your facility or unit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Recording a Telephone Conversation with a Client:</strong> When advice is given by telephone, the RN is relying on the client's own assessment of the situation. The health-care record should include the date (including year) and time of the call, the nature of the call, the response by the RN, and the follow-up recommendations (Baker, 2000).</li>
                            <li><strong>Documenting Telephone Orders:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Write down the time and date on the physician's order sheet.</li>
                                    <li>Write down the order given by the physician.</li>
                                    <li>Read the order back to the physician to ensure it is accurately recorded.</li>
                                    <li>Record the physician's name on the physician's order sheet, state "telephone order," print your name, sign the entry and identify your status (e.g., RN).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Interactions with other Health-care Professionals:</strong> It is the RN's responsibility when developing care plans, documenting on flow sheets, completing narrative or computerized documentation, or participating in team or family conferences, to document in the health-care record the outcomes or agreed upon plans of action and the names of the people involved. All health-care professionals are responsible for documenting the care they provide or the actions taken. The system used should record all interactions with members of the health-care team, including clarification of orders, failed attempts to reach other team members, and the follow up action taken.</li>
                            <li><strong>Client Education:</strong> Registered nurses perform, on a daily basis, a broad scope and depth of client education. Inadequate or incomplete documentation of client education impedes communication among health-care providers about what has been taught and diminishes the aspect of this component of care provided by the registered nurse. When documenting and evaluating client education, it is important to define the extent of the client's understanding (London, as cited in Bastable, 2003).</li>
                            <li><strong>Documenting an Incident in the Health-care Record:</strong> When an incident occurs, pertinent data should be documented on the health-care records of the client(s) involved in the incident. An incident report provides a description of an unexpected or unusual event, for example, a client fall, medication error or harm to clients, staff or visitors. Careful documentation of incidents is important for continuous quality improvement, learning from mistakes and managing risk, and in case of a complaint or legal action.
                                <p>Guidance on how to complete documentation regarding an incident:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Be concise, accurate and objective.</li>
                                    <li>Record what was seen, and describe the care provided, who else was involved and the client's (person's) condition.</li>
                                    <li>Do not try to guess or explain what happened (e.g., the RN should record that side rails were not in place, but should not write that this was the reason the client fell out of bed).</li>
                                    <li>Record the actions taken by other health-care providers at the time.</li>
                                    <li>Do not blame individuals in the documentation.</li>
                                    <li>Always record the full facts.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Discuss with the manager and other team members what would be classified as a critical incident and what should be documented in the health-care record and on an incident report. The RN must take time to plan what they will enter into the health-care record prior to the actual entry. This can help prevent the recording of opinion and the drawing of conclusions that should be avoided in the health-care record.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Narrative</h3>
                        <p>Narrative documentation is the traditional method for recording nursing care provided. It is a story-like format to document information specific to client conditions and nursing care. Data are recorded in the progress notes without an organizing framework. It often requires the reader to sort through information to locate the data required.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Problem-Orientated Medical Record (POMR)</h3>
                        <p>The foundation of this method is a single list of client problems generated by members of the health-care team. The nursing process forms the basis for the POMR method of documenting client problems.</p>
                        <p>Potter et al. (2006) listed the advantages of POMR method of documenting as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>gives emphasis to client's perceptions of their problems</li>
                            <li>requires continuous evaluation and revision of the care plan</li>
                            <li>provides greater continuity of care among health-care team members</li>
                            <li>enhances effective communication among health-care team members</li>
                            <li>increases efficiency in gathering data</li>
                            <li>provides easy-to-read information in chronological order</li>
                            <li>reinforces use of the nursing process</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SOAP/IER</h3>
                        <p>One of the most prominent features of this problem-orientated method of documentation is the structured way in which narrative progress notes are written by all health-care team members, using the SOAP, SOAPIE or SOAPIER format.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>S</strong>ubjective: the client's observations</li>
                            <li><strong>O</strong>bjective: the care provider's observations and tests</li>
                            <li><strong>A</strong>ssessment: the care provider's understanding of the problem</li>
                            <li><strong>P</strong>lans: goals, action, advice</li>
                            <li><strong>I</strong>ntervention: when an intervention was identified and changed to meet client's needs</li>
                            <li><strong>E</strong>valuation: how outcomes of care are evaluated</li>
                            <li><strong>R</strong>evision: when changes to the original problem come from revised interventions, outcomes of care or time lines this is used to denote changes (Meiner, S., 1999).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">PIE</h3>
                        <p>The PIE notes are numbered or labeled according to the client's problems. Resolved problems are dropped from daily documentation after the RN's review. Continuing problems are documented daily (Potter et al., 2006).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>P</strong>roblem</li>
                            <li><strong>I</strong>ntervention</li>
                            <li><strong>E</strong>valuation</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Focus Charting (sometimes referred to as DAR)</h3>
                        <p>This method of documentation consists of notes that include Data, both subjective and objective; Action or nursing interventions; and Response of the client.</p>
                        <p>One distinction of focus documentation is its movement away from documenting only problems. Instead, the notes are structured according to client concerns:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a sign or symptom</li>
                            <li>a condition</li>
                            <li>a nursing diagnosis</li>
                            <li>a behavior</li>
                            <li>a significant event</li>
                            <li>a change in a client's condition</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Documentation is written in accordance with the nursing process.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Graphic Sheets and Flow Sheets</h3>
                        <p>Health-care record entries should reflect the most recent assessment, as they are done, to ensure treatment decisions are based on accurate information. If documenting on a flow sheet or checklist, checkmarks may be used as long as it is clear who performed the assessment or intervention.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Charting by Exception (CBE)</h3>
                        <p>This system of health-care recording assessments, interventions, and responses was developed to eliminate redundancy and to organize information in a manner that would reduce errors in documentation. When used following a thorough orientation to the guidelines and protocols established for nursing assessment and intervention, CBE can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>save time</li>
                            <li>reduce repetition of documentation</li>
                            <li>provide immediate identification of significant changes in a client's condition</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>However, in the presence of unclear nursing guidelines or lacking other flow sheets that are needed for recording other care or treatments, CBE can be more prone to legal interpretation of a breach in standards in nursing care.</p>
                        <p>Key elements required for CBE are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>practice setting documentation policies and protocols</li>
                            <li>assessment norms, standards of care</li>
                            <li>individualized care plans</li>
                            <li>unique flow sheets</li>
                            <li>bedside accessibility of documentation forms</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is not acceptable to use documentation by exception unless these exist.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">E-health Records</h3>
                        <p>Has many benefits.</p>
                        <p>The same principles apply whether documentation is completed in the paper health-care record or electronically. "Online documentation is defined as a technology that automates the capture of clinical care data.</p>
                        <p>In the nursing realm, this can include assessment data, clinical findings, and nursing plans of care, nursing interventions (along with results), patient's progress toward goals, critical pathways, medication administration, risk assessments, discharge planning, patient education and more" (Kirkley & Rewick, 2003)</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">E-health Record Security</h4>
                        <p>Electronic documentation systems require security features that protect client confidentiality and that prevent others from modifying documentation entries.</p>
                        <p>Once documentation is completed, the program should lock entries so that they become "read only" information.</p>
                        <p>The practice setting policies should reference that staff should only have access to healthcare records of clients in their specific area of practice.</p>
                        <p>Select staff may be given authority to access all healthcare records.</p>
                        <p>To heighten security of passwords, they should be required to be changed at specific intervals of time.</p>
                        <p>Guidelines for nurses using electronic health records:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>never reveal or allow anyone else access to your personal identification number or password</li>
                            <li>inform your immediate supervisor if there is suspicion that an assigned personal identification code is being used by someone else;</li>
                            <li>change passwords at frequent and irregular intervals (as per agency policy);</li>
                            <li>choose passwords that are not easily deciphered;</li>
                            <li>log off when not using the system or when leaving the terminal;</li>
                            <li>maintain confidentiality of all information, including all print copies of information;</li>
                            <li>shred any discarded print information containing client identification;</li>
                            <li>locate printers in secured areas away from public access;</li>
                            <li>retrieve printed information immediately;</li>
                            <li>protect client information displayed on monitors (e.g., use of screen saver, location of monitor, use of privacy screens);</li>
                            <li>use only systems with secured access to record client information; and</li>
                            <li>only access client information which is required to provide nursing care for that client; accessing client information for purposes other than providing nursing care is a breach of confidentiality.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In summary, regardless of the method used, registered nurses are responsible and accountable for documenting client care including assessments, interventions carried out, and results of the interventions on client outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Clients who are very ill, considered high risk or have complex health-care needs require more comprehensive, in depth and frequent documentation by the registered nurse providing care.</p>
