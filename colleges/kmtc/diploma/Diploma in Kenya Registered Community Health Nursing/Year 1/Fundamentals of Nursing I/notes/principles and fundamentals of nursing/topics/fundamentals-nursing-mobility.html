                            <li>It is easier to pull, push, or roll an object than to lift it. The movement should be smooth and continuous, rather than jerky.</li>
                            <li>Often less energy or force is required to keep an object moving than it is to start and stop it.</li>
                            <li>It takes less effort to lift an object if the nurse works as close to it as possible. Use the strong leg and arm muscles as much as possible. Use back muscles, which are not as strong, as little as possible. Avoid reaching.</li>
                            <li>The nurse rocks backward or forward on the feet and with his or her body as a force for pulling or pushing.</li>
                            <li>Plan the move or transfer carefully. Free the surrounding area of obstacles and move the required equipment near the head or foot of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Obtain assistance of other people or use mechanical devices</li>
                            <li>Adjust the working area to waist level and keep the body close to the area, elevate adjustable beds.</li>
                            <li>Always face the direction of the movement</li>
                            <li>Start any body movement with proper alignment</li>
                            <li>Before moving an object, increase stability by widening your stance and flexing your knees, hips and ankles.</li>
                            <li>Avoid working against gravity. Push, pull, roll or turn objects instead of lifting them.</li>
                            <li>Use your gluteal and leg muscles rather than sacrospinal muscles of the back to exert an upward thrust when lifting</li>
                            <li>When pushing an object, enlarge the foot of support by moving the front foot forward.</li>
                            <li>When moving objects, hold them as close as possible to your centre of gravity. The person's center of gravity located in the pelvic area.</li>

                            <li>The patient should wear footwear with nonskid soles to avoid slipping.</li>

                            <li>If you are moving a patient to a vinyl-covered chair, cover the seat and back with a bath blanket. This will make the patient more comfortable by absorbing perspiration. Placing a pillow on the seat will serve the same purpose.</li>
                            <li>Determine if the patient has a weaker side. If so, allow the patient to lead with the strong side. Make sure the patient can see the chair or bed that you are transferring to.</li>
                            <li><strong>DO NOT ALLOW THE PERSON TO PUT HIS ARMS AROUND YOUR NECK</strong></li>

                            <li>A schedule can be set up for turning the adult patient throughout their "awake" hours.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be rotated through four positions (unless a particular position is contraindicated).</li>
                            <li>Record the position change each time to ensure that all positions are used.</li>

                            <li>Turning may be harmful to patients with spinal injuries.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><dfn>Logrolling</dfn> is a technique used to turn a patient whose body must at all times be kept in a straight alignment (like a log).</li>
                            <li>This technique is used for the patient who has a spinal injury.</li>
                            <li>Logrolling is used for the patient who must be turned in one movement, without twisting.</li>
                            <li>Logrolling requires two people, or if the patient is large, three people.</li>
