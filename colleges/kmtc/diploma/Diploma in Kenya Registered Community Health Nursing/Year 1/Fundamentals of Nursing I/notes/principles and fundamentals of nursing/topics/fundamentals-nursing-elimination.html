                        <ul>
                            <li>Elimination patterns are essential to maintain health.</li>
                            <li>The urinary and gastrointestinal systems together provide for the elimination of body wastes. The urinary system filters and excretes urine from the body, thereby maintaining fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.</li>
                            <li>Normal bowel function provides for the regular elimination of solid wastes.</li>
                            <li>During periods of stress and illness, clients experience alterations in elimination patterns.</li>
                            <li>Nurses assess for changes, identify problems, and intervene to assist clients with maintaining proper elimination patterns.</li>
                            <li>The nurse's role encompasses teaching clients self-care activities to promote independence and health.</li>
                            <li>Elimination is normally a private function done without assistance.</li>
                            <li>However, during periods of immobility and illness, assistance is needed.</li>
                            <li>The main focus of the nurse is to provide maximum comfort and privacy to lessen the client's embarrassment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors affecting elimination</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Age</strong> - A client's age or developmental level will affect control over urinary and bowel patterns. Infants initially lack a pattern to their elimination. Control over bladder and bowel movements can begin as early as 18 months of age but is typically not mastered until age 4.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diet</strong> - Adequate fluid and fiber intake are critical factors to a client's urinary and bowel health. Inadequate fluid intake is a primary cause of constipation. Diarrhea and flatulence (discharge of gas from the rectum) are a direct result of foods ingested, and clients need to be educated as to which foods and fluids promote healthy elimination and which foods may inhibit it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exercise</strong> - enhances muscle tone, which leads to better bladder and sphincter control. Peristalsis is also aided by activity, thus promoting healthy bowel elimination patterns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medications</strong> - can have an impact on a client's elimination health and patterns and should be assessed during the health history interview. Cardiac clients, for instance, are commonly prescribed diuretics, which increase urine production. Antidepressants and antihypertensives may lead to urinary retention. Some over-the-counter (OTC) cold remedies, especially antihistamines, may also result in urinary retention.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessment of elimination patterns</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many people, consider incontinence to be a hygienic rather than a health concern.</li>
                            <li>Parents may view incontinence in children to be a form of misbehavior.</li>
                            <li>Some adults consider incontinence to be a form of childlike or infantile behavior, or they may believe that urinary or fecal leakage is an inevitable consequence of aging.</li>
                            <li>When screening questions concerning altered patterns of elimination reveal significant findings, the interview should be expanded to include specific questions about the nature of the elimination disorder.</li>
                            <li>The physical examination for elimination patterns focuses on functional issues associated with urinary or fecal incontinence and assesses the perineal and perianal areas.</li>

                        <p>Urinary catheterization is an aseptic procedure but is also the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections, which can occur during insertion or removal of the catheter.</p>

                        <p>The balloon can cause obstruction and stasis of the urine if it is too large, thus increasing the risk of infection.</p>

                        <p>Urethral catheterization is a procedure that involves introducing a flexible rubber (latex, silicone, or Teflon) tube through the urinary opening (urethra) into the bladder.</p>
                        <p>There are two types of urethral catheterization.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In straight, or short-term, urethral catheterization, a catheter is inserted only long enough to drain the bladder of urine and is then removed.</li>
                            <li>In indwelling catheterization, a specialized catheter is inserted into the bladder for an extended period (days to weeks) to allow continuous drainage of urine into a collection bag.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Indications for urethral catheterization include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To drain the bladder prior to, during, or after surgery</li>
                            <li>For investigations</li>
                            <li>To relieve retention of urine</li>
                            <li>To accurately measure the urine output</li>
                            <li>To relieve urinary incontinence when no other means is practical</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CONTRA-INDICATIONS</h3>
                        <p>Nurses should not perform catheterisation without first seeking medical advice on the following:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patients who have a history of urethral stricture</li>
                            <li>Patients who have undergone trans-urethral resection of the prostate gland in the previous 48 hours</li>
                            <li>Patients with a phimosis (tight foreskin)</li>
                            <li>Patients who have a past history of difficulty in catheterisation</li>
                            <li>Undiagnosed haematuria</li>

                            <li>Prepare the client for catheterization by reviewing the procedure. Reassure the client that catheterization will not produce a sharp pain; instead, inform the client that catheterization will produce sensations of intense urgency to urinate and pressure centered on the urethral and suprapubic area.</li>
                            <li>Documentation of the amount of water used to inflate the retention balloon assists when removing the indwelling catheter.</li>
                            <li>A catheter should be constructed of silicone or a Lubricious coating to minimize urethral trauma and irritation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>NOTE: The procedure for a straight catheterization (not indwelling) is the same.</p>
                        <p>However, the catheter is inserted only long enough to obtain a urine specimen or to completely drain the bladder.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">BALLOON SIZE</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use the smallest balloon size possible. This keeps residual urine minimal, reduces the likelihood of bladder spasm, and minimizes damage to the bladder neck from the weight of the balloon</li>
                            <li>Balloon sizes: 5-30 mls. The most commonly indicated balloon size is 10 ml . Always inflate the balloon to the manufacturers recommended volume indicated on the inflation valve of the catheter as well as written on the packaging.</li>
                            <li>The 30 ml balloon is designed specifically as a haemostat post urological procedure, and should not be used for routine catheterisation</li>
                            <li>Inflate with sterile water. Air is not suitable as it will cause the balloon to float. Tap water is not sterile, and saline may block the inflation channel with crystals, making subsequent deflation difficult</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ol>
                            <li>To dispose of urine</li>

                            <li>To prevent reflux to kidneys. (Leg bag should be emptied when two third full)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Disposable plastic apron</li>
                            <li>Non-sterile disposable gloves as per Glove Guidelines</li>
                            <li>Clean container for urine (KEPT FOR THIS PURPOSE ONLY) e.g. Measuring jug/urinal</li>
                            <li>Tissue/Paper towel</li>
                            <li>Disposal bag as per Clinical Waste Guidelines</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This should be done wearing non-sterile gloves and via the drainage tap at the bottom of the bag. When the bag is empty, the tap should be closed securely and wiped with a tissue.</p>
                        <p>If the bag does not have a tap, then replace it when full. Do not disconnect the bag to empty and then reconnect it.</p>
                        <p>Wash and dry hands thoroughly after touching the drainage bag.</p>
                        <p>With proper handling, drainage bags with taps can be left in situ for long periods and are more cost-effective in the long run.</p>
                        <p>A separate urine bag-collecting receptacle must be used for each patient and each bag should be emptied separately as required.</p>
                        <p>Key principles:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hand hygiene and cleaning of periurethral area before insertion of a sterile catheter.</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of a closed drainage system.</li>

                            <li>No routine change of urinary catheter or drainage bag is necessary. Change for clinical indicators if infection, obstruction or if system disconnects or leaks. Replace system and/or catheter using aseptic technique and sterile equipment</li>
                            <li>Maintain unobstructed urine flow. Gravity is important for drainage and prevention of urine backflow. Ensure the drainage bag is below the level of the bladder, is not kinked and is secured</li>
                            <li>Urine for urinalysis or culture should be collected fresh from sampling port of catheter tubing (not drainage bag). Clean port with disinfectant first</li>
                            <li><strong>Drainage system:</strong> Adherence to a sterile continuously closed method of urinary drainage has been shown to markedly reduce the risk of acquiring a catheter associated infection</li>
                            <li><strong>Hygiene:</strong> Daily warm soapy water is sufficient meatal care or PRN if build up of secretions is evident. Uncircumcised boys should have the foreskin gently eased down over the catheter after cleaning</li>
                            <li><strong>Infection surveillance:</strong> Consider daily the need for the indwelling catheter to remain insitu. Remove as soon as no longer required to reduce risk of UTI. Cloudy, offensive smelling or unexplained blood stained urine is not normal and needs further investigation. Full Ward Test (dipstick) should be done each day. This test can detect urinary protein, blood, nitrates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Specimen collection:</strong> Large volumes e.g. 24 hr collection, can be collected from drainage bag.</li>
