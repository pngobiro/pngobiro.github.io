                        <p>Theories are not discovered in nature but are human inventions.</p>
                        <p>Theory is a creative and rigorous structuring of ideas that projects a tentative, purposeful, and systematic view of phenomena (Chinn & Kramer, 2004, p. 268).</p>
                        <p><strong>THEORY:</strong> is a supposition or system of ideas that is proposed to explain a given phenomenon.</p>
                        <p><strong>NURSING THEORY:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is the body of knowledge that is used to support nursing practice.</li>
                            <li>It is a framework designed to organize knowledge and explain phenomena in nursing at a more concrete and specific level.</li>
                            <li>It is a set of concepts, definitions, relationships, and assumptions or propositions derived from nursing models or from other disciplines and project a purposive, systematic view of phenomena by designing specific inter-relationships among concepts for the purposes of describing, explaining, predicting, and /or prescribing.</li>
                            <li>Nursing theory is a conceptualization of some aspect of reality (invented or discovered) that pertains to nursing. The conceptualization is articulated for the purpose of describing, explaining, predicting, or prescribing nursing care (Meleis, 1997).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>CONCEPT:</strong> (Building blocks of theories). A mental idea of a phenomenon</p>
                        <p><strong>CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK:</strong> is a group of related ideas, statements or concepts. e.g Freud's idea of the mind (Id, Ego, Superego).</p>
                        <p>Concepts are basically vehicles of thought that involve images.</p>
                        <p>Concepts are words that describe objects, properties, or events and are basic components of theory.</p>
                        <p>Types of Concepts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Empirical concepts</strong> - Easily understood and measured.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inferential concepts</strong> - Indirectly observable. Cannot be physically measured as easily. Ex: Smiling=happiness</li>
                            <li><strong>Abstract concepts</strong> - We do not have literal evidence. Nonobservable, not always easily understood, hard to accurately measure. Ex: God, pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>MODELS:</strong> Representations of the interaction between concepts showing patterns.</p>
                        <p><strong>CONCEPTUAL MODEL:</strong> used interchangeably with conceptual framework. They represent ways of thinking about a problem or ways of representing how complex things work the way that they do.</p>
                        <p><strong>NURSING MODELS:</strong> are conceptual models, constructed of theories and concepts.</p>
                        <p>A conceptual model shows how various concepts are interrelated and applies theories to predict or evaluate consequences of alternative actions.</p>
                        <p>A conceptual model "gives direction to the search for relevant questions about the phenomena of central interest to a discipline and suggests solutions to practical problems"</p>
                        <p><strong>PROPOSITIONS:</strong> Links concepts. Defines relationships between concepts. "BP is high because of increased stress."</p>
                        <p><strong>ASSUMPTIONS:</strong> Statements of facts or beliefs. Something one must believe to be true.</p>
                        <p>Four concepts are generally considered central to the discipline of nursing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The person who receives nursing care (the patient or client);</li>
                            <li>The environment (society);</li>
                            <li>Nursing (goals, roles, functions);</li>
                            <li>Health.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>NURSING:</strong> the attributes, characteristics and actions of the nurse providing care on behalf of, or in conjunction with the client.</p>
                        <p><strong>HEALTH:</strong> the degree of wellness or wellbeing that the client experiences.</p>
                        <p>Health is a wholeness and successful adaptation</p>
                        <p>Disease: It is unregulated and undisciplined change and must be stopped or death will ensue</p>
                        <p><strong>ENVIRONMENT:</strong> the internal and external surroundings that affect the client. Includes families, friends etc.</p>
                        <p><strong>I. Internal Environment</strong></p>
                        <p>Homeostasis: A state of energy sparing that also provide the necessary baselines for a multitude of synchronized physiological and psychological factors</p>
                        <p><strong>II. External Environment</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pre-conceptual: Aspect of the world that individuals are able to intercept(interrupt).</li>
                            <li>Operational: Elements that may physically affect individuals but not perceived by them: radiation, micro-organism and pollution</li>
                            <li>Conceptual: Part of person's environment including cultural patterns characterized by spiritual existence, ideas, values, beliefs and tradition</li>

                        <p>Middle Range Theories are known to have a narrower and detailed focus compared to grand theories. They have lower level of abstraction than grand theories and they offer a more direct application to research and practice. These theories are specific to nursing practice and specify the area of practice, age range of the patient, nursing action or intervention, and proposed outcome</p>
                        <p>Examples</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Micro range theories are more tentative than grand and middle range theories and they serve as a means to test working hypotheses so they can be developed in a more organized theoretical system.</p>

                        <p>Nursing is different from medicine and the goal of nursing is to place the patient in the best possible condition for nature to act.</p>
                        <p>Nursing is the "activities that promote health (as outlined in canons) which occur in any caregiving situation. They can be done by anyone."</p>
                        <p><strong>Person</strong></p>
                        <p>People are multidimensional, composed of biological, psychological, social and spiritual components.</p>
                        <p><strong>Health</strong></p>
                        <p>Health is "not only to be well, but to be able to use well every power we have".</p>
                        <p>Disease is considered as dys-ease or the absence of comfort.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assumptions</h3>
                        <p>The major assumptions of the theory are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Nurses care for patients until patient can care for themselves once again.</li>
                            <li>Nurses are willing to serve and that "nurses will devote themselves to the patient day and night"</li>
                            <li>Nurses should be educated at the university level in both arts and sciences.</li>
                            <li>Independence is valued by the nurse and the patient, more than dependence.</li>
                            <li>Health has a meaning shared by the society at large.</li>
                            <li>Individuals desire health or a peaceful death and will act in such a way to achieve this.</li>
                            <li>Individuals will perform activities leading to health if they have the knowledge, capacity or will.</li>
                            <li>The individual's goal and the nurse's goal are congruent.</li>
                            <li>The 14 basic needs represent nursing's basic function.</li>
                            <li>The major explicit assumption is Henderson's contention that the nurse is an independent practitioner.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>Henderson provides the essence of what she believes is a definition of nursing.</p>
                        <p>Her emphasis on basic human needs as the central focus of nursing practice has led to further theory development regarding the needs of the person and how nursing can assist in meeting those needs.</p>
                        <p>Her definition of nursing and the 14 components of basic nursing care are uncomplicated and self-explanatory.</p>

                        <p>Includes 3 related concepts</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">SELF - CARE THEORY</h3>
                        <p>Based on four concepts</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li><strong>Self care</strong> - those activities an individual performs independently throughout life to promote and maintain personal well being.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self care agency</strong> - the individual's ability to perform self care activities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self care requisites/ needs</strong> - measures or actions taken to provide self care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Therapeutic self care demands</strong> - all self care activities required to meet existing self-care requisites/ actions to maintain health and wellbeing.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Self - care deficit results when self-care agency is not adequate to meet the known self-care demand.</p>
                        <p>Self-care deficit theory shows five methods of helping</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acting or doing for</li>
                            <li>Guiding</li>

                            <li>Supporting</li>
                            <li>Providing an environment that promotes the individual's abilities to meet current and future demands.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Identifies three types of nursing systems</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Wholly compensatory</strong> - required for individuals who are unable to control and monitor their environment and monitor their environment and process information.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partly compensatory</strong> - designed for individuals who are unable to perform some, but not all self care activities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Supportive-educative</strong> - designed for persons who need to learn to perform self-care measures and need assistance to do so.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>PERSON:</strong> Biopsychosocial being capable of self-care.</p>
                        <p><strong>ENVIRONMENT:</strong> internal and external stimuli.</p>
                        <p><strong>HEALTH:</strong> state of wholeness or integrity of human beings and the environment.</p>
                        <p><strong>NURSING:</strong> a creative effort of one human being to help another human being. Consists 3 systems- wholly compensatory, partially compensatory and supportive/ educative.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Key Concepts of Orem's Theory</h3>
                        <p><strong>Person:</strong> Man is an integrated WHOLE - a unity functioning biologically, symbolically and socially.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Man is self-reliant and responsible for self-care and wellbeing of his or her dependents and self-care is a requisite for all.</li>
                            <li>Man is a logical organism with rational powers.</li>
                            <li>Man's capacity to reflect on his/her own experience and the environment and his/her use of symbols/ideas/words that distinguished him/her from other species.</li>
                            <li>A patient is an individual who is in need of assistance in meeting specific health-care demands because of lack of knowledge, skills, motivation, or orientation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Health:</strong> State of wholeness or integrity of the individual human beings, his parts, and his modes of functioning.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This concept is inherent in her nursing systems since the goal in each system is optimal wellness relative to that system.</li>
                            <li>Responsibility of a total society and all its members.</li>
                            <li>A healthy person is likely to have sufficient self-care abilities to meet his/her universal self-care needs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Environment:</strong> Encompasses the elements external to man but she considered man and environment as an integrated system related to self-care.</p>
                        <p>Environmental conditions conducive to development include opportunities to be helped: being with other persons or groups where care is offered; opportunities for solitude and companionship; provision of help for personal and group concerns without limiting individual decisions and personal pursuits: shared respect , belief, and trust; recognition and fostering of developmental potential.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing:</strong> To Orem, nursing arises through a mandate from society which defines scopes, limits, and credentials of nursing practice (agency).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Through the nursing process, the nurse can select the nursing model appropriate for the patient.</li>
                            <li>It is a community service, an art, and a technology.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assumptions</h3>

                            <li>Self-care is learned through human interaction and communication.</li>
                            <li>Self-care includes deliberate and systematic actions performed to meet needs for care.</li>
                            <li>People should be self- reliant and responsible for their own care needs as well as others in the family who are not able to care for themselves.</li>
                            <li>Nursing is a deliberate, purposeful helping service performed by nurses for the sake of others over a period of time.</li>
                            <li>Persons are capable and willing to perform self care for self or for dependent members of the family.</li>

                        <p>Is the outer boundary to the normal line of defense, the line of resistance, and the core structure.</p>
                        <p>Keeps the system free from stressors and is dependent on the amount of sleep, nutritional status, as well as the quality and quantity of stress an individual experiences.</p>
                        <p>If the flexible line of defense fails to provide adequate protection to the normal line of defense, the lines of resistance become activated.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Normal Line of Defense</h3>
                        <p>Represents client's usual wellness level.</p>
                        <p>Can change over time in response to coping or responding to the environment, which includes intelligence, attitudes, problem solving and coping abilities. Example is skin which is constantly smooth and fair will eventually form callous over times.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Lines of Resistance</h3>
                        <p>The last boundary that protects the basic structure</p>
                        <p>Protect the basic structure and become activated when environmental stressors invade the normal line of defense. An example: when a certain bacteria enters our system, there is an increase in leukocyte count to combat infection.</p>
                        <p>If the lines of resistance are effective, the system can reconstitute and if the lines of resistance are not effective, the resulting energy loss can result in death.</p>

                        <p>Are capable of producing either a positive or negative effect on the client system.</p>
                        <p>Is any environmental force which can potentially affect the stability of the system:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intrapersonal - occur within person, example is infection, thoughts and feelings</li>
                            <li>Interpersonal - occur between individuals, e.g. role expectations</li>
                            <li>Extrapersonal - occur outside the individual, e.g. job or finance concerns</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A person's reaction to stressors depends on the strength of the lines of defense.</p>
                        <p>When the lines of defense fails, the resulting reaction depends on the strength of the lines of resistance.</p>
                        <p>As part of the reaction, a person's system can adapt to a stressor, an effect known as reconstitution</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Each client system is unique, a composite of factors and characteristics within a given range of responses contained within a basic structure.</li>
                            <li>Many known, unknown, and universal stressors exist. Each differ in it's potential for disturbing a client's usual stability level or normal LOD (Line of Defence).</li>
                            <li>The particular inter-relationships of client variables at any point in time can affect the degree to which a client is protected by the flexible LOD against possible reaction to stressors.</li>
                            <li>Each client/ client system has evolved a normal range of responses to the environment that is referred to as a normal LOD. The normal LOD can be used as a standard from which to measure health deviation.</li>
                            <li>When the flexible LOD is no longer capable of protecting the client/ client system against an environmental stressor, the stressor breaks through the normal LOD</li>
                            <li>The client whether in a state of wellness or illness, is a dynamic composite of the inter-relationships of the variables. Wellness is on a continuum of available energy to support the system in an optimal state of system stability.</li>
                            <li>Implicit within each client system are internal resistance factors known as LOR, which function to stabilize and realign the client to the usual wellness state.</li>
                            <li>Primary prevention relates to principles applied in client assessment and intervention, in identification and reduction of possible or actual risk factors.</li>
                            <li>Secondary prevention relates to symptomatology following a reaction to stressor, appropriate ranking of intervention priorities and treatment to reduce their noxious effects.</li>
                            <li>Tertiary prevention relates to adjustive processes taking place as reconstitution begins and maintenance factors move the back in circular manner toward primary prevention.</li>
                            <li>The client as a system is in dynamic, constant energy exchange with the environment.</li>

                        <p>Resonance is an ordered arrangement of rhythm characterizing both human field and environmental field that undergoes continuous dynamic metamorphosis in the human environmental process</p>
                        <p><strong>Helicy</strong></p>
                        <p>Helicy describes the unpredictable, but continuous, nonlinear evolution of energy fields as evidenced by non repeating rhythmicities</p>
                        <p>The principle of Helicy postulates an ordering of the humans evolutionary emergence</p>

                        <p>"an expression of the life process; they are the "characteristics and behavior emerging out of the mutual, simultaneous interaction of the human and environmental fields"</p>
                        <p>Health and illness are the part of the same continuum.</p>
                        <p>The multiple events taking place along life's axis denote the extent to which man is achieving his maximum health potential and very in their expressions from greatest health to those conditions which are incompatible with the maintaining life process</p>

                        <p>It is the direct and overriding responsibility to the society</p>
                        <p>The safe practice of nursing depends on the nature and amount of scientific nursing knowledge the individual brings to practice.......the imaginative, intellectual judgment with which such knowledge is made in service to the man kind.</p>

                        <p>The Science of Unitary Human Beings provides a radical vision of nursing reality.</p>
                        <p>It provides a framework for nursing practice, education and research that promises a move away from the previously predominant medical model approach to the delivery of nursing care.</p>
                        <p>The framework provides an alternative to the traditional view of nursing which could be described as reductionistic, mechanistic and analytic.</p>
                        <p>It has been said that it has "guided nursing out of a concrete, static, closed system world view" (Smith, 1989) and as a result has started to challenged many preconceived ideas about nursing.</p>
