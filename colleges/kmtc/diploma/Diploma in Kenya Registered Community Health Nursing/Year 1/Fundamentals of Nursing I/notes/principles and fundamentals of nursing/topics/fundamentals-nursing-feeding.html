                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="npo-diet">Nothing by Mouth/ Nil per Oral (NPO)</h3>
                        <p>Placing the client on NPO (nothing by mouth) status is a type of diet modification as well as a fluid restriction;</p>
                        <p>This intervention is prescribed prior to surgery and certain diagnostic procedures, to rest the GI tract (and prevent diarrhea or vomiting), or when the client's nutritional problem has not been identified.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="clear-liquid-diet">Clear-Liquid Diet</h3>
                        <p>Dairy products are not allowed on a clear-liquid diet. The client is allowed to ingest only liquids that keep the GI tract empty (no residue), such as water, apple juice, and gelatin. A clear-liquid diet is prescribed primarily for surgical clients.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="liquid-diet">Liquid Diet</h3>
                        <p>A liquid (or full liquid diet) consisting of various types of liquids is prescribed mainly for postoperative clients because of calorie and nutrient considerations. If the client tolerates a liquid diet without nausea or vomiting and has normal bowel sounds, the diet is progressed to as tolerated (client eats whatever foods that cause no problems).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="soft-diet">Soft Diet</h3>
                        <p>A soft diet promotes the mechanical digestion of foods. It is prescribed for clients experiencing difficulty in chewing and swallowing. A soft diet is also therapeutic for clients with impaired digestion and/or absorption, due to conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Foods to be avoided on this diet include nuts, seeds (tomatoes and berries with seeds), raw fruits and vegetables, fried foods, and whole grains.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="pureed-diet">Pureed Diet</h3>
                        <p>A pureed diet provides food that has been blenderized to a smooth consistency. It is prescribed for clients with dysphagia. Special consideration needs to be given to meal preparation; when food has the same consistency, it is difficult to distinguish the taste of different foods.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="mechanical-soft-diet">Mechanical Soft Diet</h3>
                        <p>A mechanical soft diet is similar to a soft diet; however, it allows clients variation, permitting foods with different tastes, such as chili beans. It is prescribed for clients experiencing difficulty chewing or who are unable to chew food thoroughly, as may occur with poorly fitted dentures.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="low-residue-diet">Low-Residue Diet</h3>
                        <p>A low-residue diet has reduced fiber and cellulose. It is prescribed to decrease GI mucosal irritation in clients with diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Foods to be avoided are raw fruits (except bananas), vegetables, seeds, plant fiber, and whole grains. Dairy products are limited to two servings a day.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="high-fiber-diet">High-Fiber Diet</h3>
                        <p>High-fiber-diet foods are the opposite of low-residue foods. A high-fiber diet is an integral part of the treatment regimen for diverticulosis because it increases the forward motion of the indigestible wastes through the colon.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="liberal-bland-diet">Liberal Bland Diet</h3>
                        <p>A liberal bland diet eliminates chemical and mechanical food irritants, such as fried foods, alcohol, and caffeine.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="fat-controlled-diet">Fat-Controlled Diet</h3>
                        <p>Fat-controlled diets reduce the total fat ingested by replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and restricting cholesterol. They are prescribed for clients with atherosclerosis, heart disease, and obesity. Saturated foods to be avoided include animal fats, gravies, sauces, chocolate, and whole-milk products.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="sodium-restricted-diet">Sodium-Restricted Diet</h3>
                        <p>Sodium intake may be restricted as follows: mild, 2 to 3 g ; moderate, 1000 mg ; strict, 500 mg ; severe, 250 mg . A sodium-restricted diet is prescribed for clients with excess fluid volume, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and renal failure.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="lactose-intolerance-diet">Lactose Intolerance Diet</h3>
                        <p>A lactose intolerance diet eliminates milk and all dairy products except yogurt. Lactose is a sugar found in milk and aids the body absorption of calcium. Lactose intolerance is caused by a lack or deficiency of lactase, an enzyme normally made in the small intestines that splits lactose into glucose and galactose. Incomplete digestion of lactose results in diarrhea, gas, and abdominal cramps between 30 minutes and 2 hours after consumption of diary foods.</p>
