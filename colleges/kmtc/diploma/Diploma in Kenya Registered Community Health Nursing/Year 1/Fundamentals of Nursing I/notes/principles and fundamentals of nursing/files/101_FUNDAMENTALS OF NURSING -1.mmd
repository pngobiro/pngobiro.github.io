\section*{LEGAL PROTECTIONS IN NURSING PRACTISE}
- Laws and strategies are in place to protect the nurse against litigation.
- Providing safe, competent practice by following the nurse practice and standards of practice is a major legal safe guard for nurses.
- Accurate and complete documentation is also a critical component of legal protection of the nurse.

\section*{GOOD SAMARITAN ACTS}
- Good Samaritan acts are laws designed to protect health care providers who provide assistance at the scene of an emergency against claims of malpractice unless it can be shown that there was a gross departure from the normal standard of care or willful wrongdoing on their part.

\section*{GOOD SAMARITAN ACTS (CONT'D)}

Guidelines for nurses who render emergency care

\section*{Bed making}
- Nursing is a profession that requires extensive training in patient care and procedures.
- One of these tasks is learning how to make a bed properly, especially since beds are such an integral part of the patient's world while staying in the hospital.

\section*{Definition}
- A hospital bed is the piece of equipment most frequently used by the hospitalized patient. Hospital beds are also found in long-term-care facilities, as well as patients' homes. The ideal hospital bed should be selected for its impact on patients' comfort, safety, medical condition, and ability to change positions.

\section*{Importance of bed making}
1. It helps maintain a clean, orderly and comfortable room which contributes to the patients sense of well-being.
2. Helps the patient secure proper rest and comfort which are essential for health and refresh him/her by providing cleanliness
3.It helps prevent or avoid microorganisms to come in contact with the patient which could cause tribulations.
4.It minimizes the sources of skin irritation by providing smooth, wrinkle-free bed foundation

\section*{Purpose}
- The purpose of a well-made hospital bed, as well as an appropriately chosen mattress, is to provide a safe, comfortable place for the patient, where repositioning is more easily achieved, and pressure ulcers are prevented.

\section*{Purpose}
- To keep the ward neat and tidy.
- For patients comfort.
- To prevent cross infection.
- For treatment of certain conditions.

\section*{Purpose}

An unoccupied bed
- to promote the client's comfort
- to provide a clean environment for the client
- to provide a smooth, wrinkle-free bed, thus minimizing sources of skin irritation.

\section*{Purpose}

\section*{An occupied bed}
- to conserve the client's energy and maintain current healthy status
- to promote the client's comfort
- to provide a clean environment for the client
- to provide a smooth, wrinkle-free bed, thus minimizing sources of skin irritation

\section*{Bed making supplies}
(a) Large sheets (2).
(b) Drawsheet (1) - sheet placed over the bottom sheet to help lift or move a patient and to protect the bottom sheet from soiling.
(c) Blanket.
(d) Pillow(s).
(e) Pillowcase(s)
(f) Flannel (Bed cover)

\section*{Bed making}

\section*{Mitered corner}
- a means of anchoring sheets on mattresses
- method of folding the bed clothes at the corners to secure them in place while the bed is occupied

- Bathe ears and front and back of neck Perspiration accumulates on the back of the neck when patients lie in bed for long periods.
- Bathe upper body and extremities, stroking arms from wrist to shoulder. Include axillary area - Stimulates circulation.
- Soak hands in basin if indicated - Dirt accumulates under fingernails, especially in incontinent patients.

\section*{Bed Bath}

CARE OF
PRESSURE
AREAS

\section*{Pressure area care}
- Pressure area care refers to moving the patient into another position to relieve pressure on a part of the body and prevent the development of a pressure ulcer or 'bed sore'.
- One of the best ways of preventing a pressure ulcer is to reduce or relieve pressure on areas that are vulnerable to pressure ulcers (e.g, bony parts of the body). This is done by moving around and changing position as much as possible.
