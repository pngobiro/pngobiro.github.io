                        <p>Remember you are treating a patient, not their condition. The better you understand your patient, the better your treatment plan will be and the more likely you will be to get good patient compliance.</p>
                        <p>History taking is a key component of patient assessment, enabling the delivery of high-quality care.</p>
                        <p>Understanding the complexity and processes involved in history taking allows nurses to gain a better understanding of patients' problems.</p>
                        <p>Care priorities can be identified and the most appropriate interventions commenced to optimize patient outcomes.</p>

                            <li>Observe non verbal communications e.g. "body language, voice tone, and appearance".</li>
                            <li>Review information about past health history before starting interview.</li>
                            <li>Balance between allowing a client to talk in an unstructured manner and the need to structure requested information.</li>
                            <li>Clarify the client's definitions (terms & descriptors)</li>
                            <li>Avoid yes or no question (when detailed information is desired).</li>
                            <li>Write adequate notes and record soon after interview.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The setting is important because it creates the environment in which you and the patient must interact.</p>
                        <p>The environment will greatly influence how comfortable the patient feels during the process and how complete and informative the patient's answers will be. It is normal to expect patients to experience some degree of anxiety during an initial interview.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check your seating position - make sure your seating is no higher than eye level. Patients are very uncomfortable having to look up while talking and are actually most comfortable while looking slightly down.</li>
                            <li>Be aware of your body language - avoid body positions that are defensive or withdrawn.</li>
                            <li>Be aware of eye contact, too much and too little are both bad. Watch your vocabulary - don't overwhelm the patient with highly technical terminology they don't understand; at the same time, don't talk down to the patient.</li>
                            <li>Lastly, a warm hand shake is a very comforting gesture towards a new patient and it's also a nice way to conclude the visit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Respect for the patient as an individual is an important feature of assessment, and this includes consideration of beliefs and values and the ability to remain non-judgmental and professional.</p>
                        <p>Respect also involves maintenance of privacy and dignity; the environment should be private, quiet and ideally, there should be no interruptions. When this is not possible the nurse should do everything possible to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.</p>
