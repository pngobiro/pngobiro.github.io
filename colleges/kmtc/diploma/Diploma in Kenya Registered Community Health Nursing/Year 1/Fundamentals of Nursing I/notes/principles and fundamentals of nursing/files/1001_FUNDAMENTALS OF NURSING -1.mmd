\section*{Changing an ostomy appliance}

Assessment.
Prior to and during the procedure, the nurse should assess:
- the color of the stoma.
- the stoma for swelling.
- the periostomal skin for irritation and redness.
- the feces for amount, color, consistency, presence of blood or pus.
- the patient's knowledge and understanding of ostomy care.

\section*{Changing an ostomy appliance}

Planning.
The nurse should assemble the following equipment:
- Non-sterile gloves, to protect hands.
- a water-proof bag for the soiled appliance to minimize odor.
- cleaning materials, including tissues, warm water, wash cloth, towel, and in some cases, mild soap.
- gauze pad to cover the stoma.
- a skin barrier, in the form of a spray, disc, or sheet to protect the skin.
- measuring guide (stoma guidestrip) to measure the stoma.
- clamp.
- scissors if the appliance does not have a precut opening.
- adhesive with brush to apply it to the bag if needed.
- a deodorant for a non-odor proof colostomy bag.

\section*{Changing an ostomy \\ - Intervention appliance}
- Explain the procedure to the patient and/or family member.
- Communicate acceptance and support of the patient.
- Provide privacy, preferably in the bathroom, where the patient can learn to care for his/her ostomy as he/she would at home.
- Assist the patient to a comfortable position, either sitting or lying, and expose only the stoma area.
- Unfasten the belt and check the method of adhesion.
- Empty the effluent in the pouch.

\section*{Changing an ostomy appliance}
- Remove the appliance, peeling the bag off slowly while holding the patient's skin taut.
- Cleanse the periostomal skin and stoma with warm water and soap.
- Dry the area thoroughly by patting with a towel. Rationale: Excessive rubbing may abrade the skin.
- Place a piece of tissue or gauze pad over the stoma. Rationale: Any seepage from the stoma will be absorbed in the tissue or gauze pad.

\section*{Changing an ostomy appliance}
- Check the fit of the appliance. Measure the size of the guidestrip. Rationale: Close fit of the barrier (faceplate) prevents contact of skin with effluent.
- Discard or cleanse the bag. Measure the effluent if ordered.
- Wash soiled belt with warm water and mild soap, rinse, and dry.
- Remove and discard gloves; wash hands.
- Document in patient's record.

\section*{Changing an ostomy appliance}

Evaluation: Expected outcomes of the procedure include:
- stoma of a healthy color
- normal periostomal skin without signs of redness or irritation
- the appliance fits snugly and allows no leakage
- patient participation is at the appropriate level

\section*{Nursing management}

A person who has a stoma may require nursing assistance in several major areas:
- psychosocial factors
- stoma and skin care
- nutrition and bowel regulation - The diet for the ostomy patient is individualized and depends on various factors, including his/her previous dietary habits and general health status
- the return to optimal health and well-being

\section*{Nursing management}
- Assessing - history, physical examination of abdomen, rectum, anus, inspecting feaces; review data from diagnotic tests
- Diagnosing - NANDA diagnosis include:
- Bowel incontinence
- Constipation
- Risk for constipation
- Perceived constipation
- Diarrhoea

\section*{Nursing management}
- Diagnosing - feacal elimination problems may affect other areas e.g
- Risk for deficient fluid volume deficit related to prolonged diarrhoea, abnormal fluid loss through ostomy
- Risk for impaired skin integrity related to prolonged diarrhoea, bowel incontinence, bowel diversion ostomy
- Low self esteem related to ostomy, feacal incontinence, need for assistance with toileting
- Deficient knowledge related to lack of previous knowledge
- Anxiety related to lack of control of elimination, response of others to ostomy

\section*{Nursing management}
- Planning - goals are:
- Maintain or restore normal bowel elimination pattern
- Maintain or regain normal stool consistency
- Prevent associated risks e.g fluid imbalance, skin breakdown

\section*{Nursing management}
- Implementing
- Promoting regular defeacation
- Privacy
- Timing
- Nutrition and fluids
- For constipation - increase fluid intake, fiber diet
- For diarrhoea - encourage oral fluids, eating small amounts, avoid highly spiced foods
- For flatulence - limited carbonated bevareges, avoid gas-forming foods e.g cabbage, beans, onions
- Exercise - regular exercise helps develop a regular defeacation pattern

\section*{Nursing management}
- Positioning
- Medications
- Administering enemas -
- cleansing enema - to remove feaces
- Carminative enemas - to expel flatus
- Retention enema - introduces oil or medication into the rectum.
- Return - flow enema - used occassionally to expel flatus

\section*{Nursing management}
- Evaluation - the goals established during the planning phase are evaluated.
Prior to discharge from the hospital, the patient and/or a family member should be able to:
- identify all necessary equipment and supplies and where these can be obtained.
- perform skin and stoma care.
- change the ostomy appliance.
- state signs of complications and when to seek medical attention.
- discuss the importance of nutrition.
- identify ostomy groups, enterostomal therapists, home health agencies, suppliers.

\section*{Haemovigilance}
should include:
- Promoting the appropriate use of blood and blood components/products.
- Provision and organisation of education and training relevant to staff involved in the transfusion process.
- Co-ordination, collection and reporting to the NHO of serious adverse reactions/events relating to blood transfusion.
- The tracing and recall of blood and blood components as requested by the BTS.
- Participation in an active hospital transfusion committee.
- Review and audit of all aspects of the transfusion process.

VENEPUNCT
URE

\section*{VENEPUNCTURE}

This is a procedure in which a cannula is inserted into the vein.
PURPOSE
- To withdraw or transfuse blood and its components
- To establish venous access in critical illness
- To manage fluid and electrolyte imbalance

\section*{INTRAVENOUS FLUID} ADMINISTRATI ON

\section*{INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS}
- Intravenous fluids are chemically prepared solutions that are administered to the patient.
- They are tailored to the body's needs and used to replace lost fluid and/or aid in the delivery of IV medications.
- For patients that do not require immediate fluid or drug therapy, the continuous delivery of a small amount of IV fluid can be used to keep a vein patent for future use.

\section*{INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS}
- The goal of intravenous fluid (IV) administration is to carefully achieve and maintain a euvolemic and isotonic environment within the body as well as to provide for a variety of nutritional and pharmacologic interventions.

\section*{The distribution of body water within a euvolemic 70 kg person.}

The 2/3 Rule
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_ec37d24be65382c21d7eg-026.jpg?height=1171&width=1723&top_left_y=575&top_left_x=360)

\section*{Potential Sources of Fluid Excess or Loss in Hospitalized Patients}

Intake
- Intravenous fluids
- Medications given via IV drip
- Water flushes given with crushed medications
- Water flushes to keep tubes patent
- Water contained in tube feedings or TPN

\section*{Potential Sources of Fluid Excess or Loss in Hospitalized Patients}

Output
- Stool/Urine
- Chest tubes
- Percutaneous drains
- Biliary /Pancreatic
- Wound drainage
- Ostomies
- Naso/oro gastric tube suction
- Excessive drooling/sialorrhea
- Fistulas
- Enterocutaneous
- Spit fistulas
- Insensible losses
- Accelerated insensible losses including:
- Burns
- Tracheostomies
- Fever

\section*{FORMS OF IV FLUIDS}

IV fluids come in four different forms:
- Colloids - contain solutes in the form of large proteins or other similarly sized molecules. are useful in maintaining blood volume, but their use in the field is limited. Colloids are expensive, have specific storage requirements, and have a short shelf life. Commonly used colloid solutions include plasma protein fraction, salt poor albumin, dextran, and hetastarch.

\section*{FORMS OF IV FLUIDS}
- Crystalloids are the primary fluid used for prehospital IV therapy. Crystalloids contain electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride) but lack the large proteins and molecules found in colloids. Crystalloids come in many preparations and are classified according to their "tonicity." Depending on their concentration, crystalloids can affect the distribution of water within the body.

\section*{FORMS OF IV FLUIDS}
- Isotonic crystalloids have a tonicity equal to the body plasma. When administered to a normally hydrated patient, isotonic crystalloids do not cause a significant shift of water between the blood vessels and the cells. Thus, there is no (or minimal) osmosis occurring.
The most common isotonic solutions used in prehospital care are
- Lactated Ringer's (LR) contains sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and sodium lactate in sterile water.
- Normal saline solution (NSS) contains 0.9\% sodium chloride (salt) in sterile water.
- 5\% Dextrose in water (D5W) is packaged as an isotonic carbohydrate that contains glucose as

\section*{FORMS OF IV FLUIDS}

Hypertonic crystalloids have a tonicity higher than the body plasma. The administration of a hypertonic crystalloid causes water to shift from the extravascular spaces into the bloodstream, increasing the intravascular volume.
Examples include 3\% sodium chloride ( $3 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ ), with $513 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ of NaCl , and $5 \% \mathrm{NaCl}(5 \%$ NaCl ), with $855 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ of sodium and chloride, $50 \%$ dextrose in water ( $\mathrm{D}_{50} \mathrm{~W}$ ), a highly concentrated sugar solution.

\section*{FORMS OF IV FLUIDS}
- Hypotonic crystalloids have a tonicity lower than the body plasma. The administration of a hypotonic crystalloid causes water to shift from the intravascular space to the extravascular space, and eventually into the tissue cells.
- Types of hypotonic fluids include 0.45\% sodium chloride ( $0.45 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ ), 0.33\% sodium chloride, 0.2\% sodium chloride, and $2.5 \%$ dextrose in water.

\section*{FORMS OF IV FLUIDS}
- Blood and blood products are the most desirable fluids for replacement. Unlike colloids and crystalloids, the hemoglobin carries oxygen to the cells.
- Not only is the intravascular volume increased, but the fluid administered can also transport oxygen to the cells.
- Blood, however, is a precious commodity and must be conserved to benefit the people most in need.

\section*{FORMS OF IV FLUIDS}
- Oxygen-carrying solutions are synthetic fluids that carry and deliver oxygen to the cells.
- These fluids, which remain experimental, show promise for the prehospital care of patients who have experienced severe blood loss or are otherwise suffering from hypovolemia.
- It is hoped that oxygen-carrying solutions will be similar to crystalloid solutions in cost, storage capability, and ease of administration, and be capable of carrying oxygen, which presently can only be accomplished by blood or blood products.

\section*{CALCULATION OF RATE}

Total Volume To Be Infused X Drop Factor (15)

Total hours $\times 60$ minutes
$1 \mathrm{ml}=15$ drops
Example
If 1000 ml of $5 \% \mathrm{D} / \mathrm{w}$ is to run for 24 hrs , how many drops per minutes should it run?
$1000 \mathrm{ml} . \times 15 \mathrm{gtt} / \mathrm{ml} .=10 \mathrm{gtt} / \mathrm{min}$ $24 \times 60 \mathrm{~min}$.

\section*{ADVERSE EFFECTS}
- Infection - Any break in the skin carries a risk of infection.
- Phlebitis - inflammation of a vein that may be caused by infection, the mere presence of a foreign body (the IV catheter) or the fluids or medication being given.
- Infiltration / Extravasation Infiltration occurs when an IV fluid or medication accidentally enters the surrounding tissue rather than the vein.
- Fluid overloadThis occurs when fluids are given at a higher rate or in a larger volume than the system can absorb or excrete.

\section*{ADVERSE EFFECTS}
- Hypothermia The human body is at risk of accidentally induced hypothermia when large amounts of cold fluids are infused. Rapid temperature changes in the heart may precipitate ventricular fibrillation.
- Electrolyte imbalance - Administering a too-dilute or tooconcentrated solution can disrupt the patient's balance of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other electrolytes.
- Embolism - A blood clot or other solid mass, as well as an air bubble, can be delivered into the circulation through an IV and end up blocking a vessel. Peripheral IVs have a low risk of embolism, since large solid masses cannot travel through a narrow catheter, and it is nearly impossible to inject air through a peripheral IV at a dangerous rate. The risk is greater with a central IV. Air bubbles of less than 30 microliters are thought to dissolve into the circulation harmlessly.

\section*{Role of the nurse in IV fluid administration}
- Be familiar with the type of fluid being administered, the rate and duration of the infusion, the fluid's effects on the body, and potential adverse reactions.
- Monitor the patient's response to treatment, watching closely for any signs and symptoms of hypervolemia or hypovolemia.
- Monitor lab values to assess kidney function and fluid status.
- Regularly check the venous access site for signs of infiltration, inflammation, infection, or thrombosis.
- Educate the patient and the family about the prescribed therapy, including potential complications and symptoms that require immediate attention.

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS RELATING TO FLUID AND ACID - BASE BALANCE}

NANDA Diagnosis
- Deficient fluid volume
- Excess fluid volume
- Risk for imbalanced fluid volume
- Risk for deficient fluid volume
- Impaired gas exchange

May be aetiology of other nursing diagnosis
- Impaired oral mucous membrane related to fluid volume deficit
- Impaired skin integrity related to dehydration
- Ineffective tissue perfusion related to decreased cardiac output secondary to fluid volume deficit or oedema

\section*{NURSING CARE PLAN}

\section*{ASSESSMENT}

Meryln, a 27 year old business woman reports weakness, malaise, and flu-like symptoms for 3 days. She is thirsty, unable to tolerate fluids because of nausea and vomitting and she is passing watery stools 4-6 times a day.
On physical examination, she is 160 cm tall, weighs 66.2 Kg , Temp - 38.3 , PR - $106 / \mathrm{min}$, RR- $24 / \mathrm{min}$, BP $-95 / 55 \mathrm{mmHg}$, urine output $20 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$, dry oral mucosa, furrowed toungue, cracked lips.
Diagnostic data - urine specific gravity 1.035, serum sodium $155 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, Serum pottasium $2.2 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$, Chest X-ray - Negative.

\section*{NURSING CARE PLAN}

DIAGNOSIS
- Deficient fluid volume related to nausea and vomitting and diarrhoea as evidenced by decreased urine output, increased urine concentration, fever, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, increased pulse rate and decreased blood pressure.

\section*{NURSING CARE PLAN}

\section*{DESIRED OUTCOMES/ INDICATORS}
- Electrolyte and acid/base balance as evidenced by not compromised serum electrolytes within normal limits.
- Fluid balance as evidenced by maintaining urine output $>1300 \mathrm{mls}$ per day, maintaining $\mathrm{BP}, \mathrm{PR}, \mathrm{RR}$, Temp; Explains measures that can be taken to treat or prevent fluid volume

\section*{NURSING CARE PLAN}

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTION}

Electrolyte management (Hypokalaemia)
- Obtain specimens for analysis of altered potassium levels - urine and serum analysis provides information about extracellular levels of potassium.
Electrolyte management (Hypernatemia)
- Provide frequent oral hygiene - oral mucous membranes become dry and sticky due to loss of fluid in the interstitial spaces.
Fluid management
- Weigh daily and monitor trends - weight helps to assess fluid balance.

\section*{NURSING CARE PLAN}

\section*{EVALUATION}

Meryln remained hospitalised for 48 hours. She required fluid replacement of a total of 5L. Her BP increased to $120 / 70 \mathrm{mmHg}$, PR - 74/min, RR 14/min at rest. Her urine output increased and she was able to take oral fluids. She was able to discuss symptoms of deficient fluid volume that would necessitate her calling a health proffessional.

\section*{CRITICAL THINKING}
- MeryIn is responding appropriately to questions. What would you do?
- Offer suggestions for ways to help MeryIn increase her oral intake.
- Meryln asks why you weigh her every morning. How do you respond?

BLOOD
TRANSFUS
ION

\section*{Blood transfusion}
- The transfusion process is complex, involving many interlinking chains of events, and a multidisciplinary group of health professionals with different levels of awareness and understanding of transfusion practice.
- The role of the Transfusion Nurse is evolving as an integral part of efforts to optimise appropriate use of blood components, reduce procedural risks and improve transfusion practice generally.

The Principle Aims of Blood Transfusion are to:-
(1) Improve oxygen carrying capacity of blood.
(2) Symptomatic improvement.
(3) Reduce hypovolaemia.
- 1 UNIT of Blood should increase the Hb by approx.1g/dL.
- If no improvement or reduction in Hb - think about ongoing blood loss or destruction.
- You need treat the underlying cause.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_ec37d24be65382c21d7eg-049.jpg?height=1711&width=1235&top_left_y=82&top_left_x=1028)

\section*{Blood transfusion}
- Blood should only be stored in the blood fridge, never in a domestic or drug fridge.
- Remember that you must fill in the laboratory register when removing red cells from a blood bank fridge. Put the date and time of removal and your initials along side the unit number you are collecting.
- Patients should be transfused in an area they can readily be observed,

\section*{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}

\section*{Purpose}
- To counteract severe hemorrhage and replace the blood loss.
- To prevent circulatory failure in operation where blood loss is considerable, such as in rectal resection hysterectomy and arterial surgery.
- In severe burns to make up for blood lost by burning but only after plasma and electrolytes have been replaced.
- For treatment of severe anemia due to cancer, marrow aplasia and similar conditions.
- To provide clotting factors normally present in blood, which may be absent as a result of disease.

\section*{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}

\section*{BLOOD PRODUCTS AVAILABLE}
- Whole blood - 450 mls , in cases of acute haemorrhage
- Packed cells - 200 mls , used to increase oxygen-carrying capacity in anaemias, surgery
- FFP - 150 mls, expands blood volume and provides clotting factors
- Platelets - 50 mls , replaces platelets
- Clotting factors and Cryoprecipitate - 50 mls, for clotting factors deficiencies

\section*{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}

ADMINISTRATION
- Packed cells - should not hang more than 4 hours
- Platelet concentration - administer as quickly as possible but within not more than 30 minutes. Collect one at a time. 150-280 micron filter $Y$ type must be used.
- FFP - administer as quickly as possible but within less than 4 hours
- Cryoprecipitate - administer as quickly as possible but within not more than four hours.
Directly transfuse all blood products and heparin lock must be removed.

\section*{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}

RECOMMENDED GAUGE
- Adults - 18-20
- Paediatric - 22-24
- Neonate - 24-26

\section*{Indications for Blood Transfusion}

Acute Anaemia
(1)Symptomatic hypovolaemia and blood loss.
(2) Peri-operative - 'replacing losses'
(3) Haemolysis (treat the underlying cause)
(4) Severe, critical illness

\section*{Indications for blood transfusion}
- Whole blood: blood loss > 1500 ml ,
- PRBC: blood loss < 1000 ml .
- FFP: deficiency of coagulation factor and protein, massive transfusion.
- PLT: thrombocytopenia, massive transfusion.

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}

\section*{Pre-transfusion checks}
- Is the transfusion prescribed appropriately?
-Why does the patient need a transfusion?
- Have any accompanying medications e.g. Frusemide, been prescribed?
- Are there any special requirements e.g. Gamma Irradiation?
- Check the patient has venous access. Is it patent and intact?
- Will a second checker be available?
- Ensure the patient is positioned so they can be closely observed when the transfusion is taking place.
- Does the patient understand the procedure?
- Have they given their consent?

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}

\section*{Equipment}
- A blood giving set should be used to administer blood
- Blood giving sets differ form regular giving sets in that they have a double chamber and an integral mesh filter. This is to prevent micro thrombi from being infused into the patient.
- As with any sterile devise you must check the expiry date and that the packaging is intact
- Non-sterile Gloves and an apron

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}

Bed side checking
- Checking must take place at the patients bedside
- Bedside checking is the last chance to prevent an error
- Most local policies state that blood should be independently checked by two trained members of staff
- Only check blood or blood products for one patient at a time
- If you are interrupted in the checking procedure you must start again

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}
- Check the full name, date of birth and hospital number on the patient ID band against the compatibility label
- Check the blood unit number on the compatibility label against the blood unit number on the blood bag label
- Now check the blood group and Rh status of the donor and the blood group and Rh status of the recipient on the blood label match those recorded on the compatibility label. Are the blood groups compatible?

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}
- Check the expiry date on the blood bag label
- Observations of vital signs should be carried out immediately before the transfusion is started and should include BP, Temperature, Respirations, Pulse, Oxygen saturations and urine output.
- Ensure clinical staff are available to closely observe the patient

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}
- Asepsis and standard precautions must be used throughout
- Wash hands
- Put on non sterile gloves and an apron
- Close the clamp on the giving set to occlude the line

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}

Putting up the blood
- Pull the tabs to expose the outlet port
- insert the spike into the blood component pack outlet
- Squeeze the blood up through the first chamber

Priming the line
- Run the blood through the giving set so that all air is expelled
- Aseptically attach blood giving set to cannula
- Secure the giving set and cannula with bandaging

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}

Ask the patient to observe for and report the following symptoms
- Chest or loin pain
- Feeling unwell
- Shortness of breath
- Rashes
- A restless or anxious feeling
- Abdominal discomfort
- Blood in the urine
- Ensure the patient has access to a call bell

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}
- Ensure the blood is being delivered at the correct rate.
- If the blood is transfused too quickly the patient is at risk of becoming overloaded. If the transfusion is delayed there is a risk of haemolysis occurring as the blood warms to room temperature

\section*{Administering blood transfusion}
- The patient should be closely observed during the first fifteen minutes of receiving a blood transfusion by a qualified member of staff. This is because a blood reaction is likely to occur with the first few drops.

\section*{Documentation}
- First name, surname, DOB, hospital number
- Date, time transfusion started and finished
- Reason for transfusion and consent
- Type of units transfused
- Number of units transfused
- Unit numbers in full
- Outcome of transfusion
- Any adverse reactions

\section*{Role of the nurse}
1. Confirm that there is a physician's order and a signed consent from the client.
2. Have two nurses confirm that the client name and ID number, blood type, RH type, and product unit numbers are correct. Check also the expiration date.
3. Make sure the transfusion is started within 30 minutes of arrival at bedside.
4. Maintain asepsis. If possible wear gloves before performing venipuncture, transfusing blood, and when terminating blood and disposing of equipment.

\section*{Some points to remember}
- Blood should be transfused within four hours of its removal from storage (there is a risk of bacterial proliferation and red call metabolism if the blood reaches an ambient temperature for a sustained period of time)
- Never add anything to a blood transfusion
- Blood products are not compatible with dextrose (dextrose 5\%) can lyse red blood cells
- Change the giving set at least every twelve hours for a continuing transfusion and on completion of the transfusion
- Used bags stay on the ward for 48 hrs (in case of delayed reaction) and then disposed of in a yellow clinical waste bin (in the case of a delayed reaction the lab can use the stalk of donor blood to initiate serological investigation

\section*{Transfusion reactions}

\section*{Adverse reactions}
- Acute reactions
- Allergic reaction (mild to anaphylaxis)
- Haemolytic reaction
- Infective shock
- Circulatory overload

\section*{Delayed complications of transfusion}
- Delayed haemolysis of transfused red cells
- Transfusion associated graft versus host disease
- Post transfusion purpura
- Iron overload
- Infection e.g. HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Syphilis

\section*{Adverse reactions:}

If any of the following occur,
- Increase in temperature by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Significant rise or fall in Blood Pressure
- Significant rise in pulse
- Any sign of a reaction

Stop the transfusion!

\section*{Adverse reactions:}

\section*{How to act when patient reacts}
- Stop the transfusion
- Maintain venous access (keep the line open with normal saline)
- Check ABC and examine the patient
- Check the ID of the patient (verbally and/or wristband) against ID details on the unit, compatibility form, compatibility label and prescription chart
- Call for senior and specialist help (if it appears life threatening call the resuscitation team)
- Emergency drugs and crash trolley (hydrocortisone, Antihistamine, adrenaline)
- Retain any unfinished infusion and giving set (this will need to go back to the laboratory)
- Close monitoring of vital signs

\section*{Complications of blood transfusion}
- Acute/chronic hemolytic reaction.
- Infections.
- Volume overload.
- Transfusion-related acute lung injury.
- Non-hemolytic febrile reaction.
- Urticaria.

\section*{Complications of blood transfusion}
- Hypothermia: Will induce arrhythmia. Warming all blood product is absolutely indicated.
- Hypocalcemia (Citrate intoxication): Cardiac depression, aggravated by hepatic disease.
- Hyperkalemia
- Coagulopathy: Dilutional thrombocytopenia and decreased coagulation factor.

\section*{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}

Note:
1. Always member to have anti- histamine injection ready in case a patient has reaction from the blood.
2. Be familiar with the most usual symptoms of blood reactions which are:-
Immediate Reaction:
a) Headache
b) Backache
c) Chills
d) Pyrexia
e) Rash of the skin (urticaria)
Late Reaction
a) Dyspnea
b) Renal shut down in severe cases
c) Heamaturia
d) Chest pain
e) Rigor (rigidity)

\section*{Nursing Interventions in Transfusion Reaction}

Reactions following blood transfusion may occur for various reasons. Patient must be informed that the supply of blood is not completely risk-free but that it has been tested carefully.
Nursing management is directed toward preventing complications and promptly initiating measures to control any complications that occur.

\section*{Nursing Interventions in Transfusion Reaction}

The following steps are taken so that a diagnosis may be made regarding the type and severity of the reaction:
$\square$ The transfusion set is disconnected, but the intravenous line is kept patent with a normal saline solution (0.9\%) in case intravenous medication should be needed rapidly.
$\square$ The blood container and tubing are saved, not discarded. They are sent to blood bank for repeat typing and culture. The identifying tags and numbers are verified.
$\square$ The symptoms are treated as prescribed and vital signs are monitored.

\section*{Nursing Interventions in Transfusion Reaction}
$\square$ The patient blood is drawn from plasma hemoglobin, culture, and retyping.
$\square$ A urine sample is collected as soon as possible and sent to laboratory for a hemoglobin determination. Subsequent voiding of urine should be observed.
$\square$ The blood bank is notified that a suspected transfusion reaction has occurred.
$\square$ The reaction is documented according to the institution's policy.

OXYGEN
THERAPY
- Oxygen therapy is administration of supplemental oxygen to a patient to prevent or treat hypoxia.
- Hypoxia is a condition in which there is insufficient oxygen to meet the metabolic demands of tissues and cells.

\section*{Signs and symptoms of hypoxia}
- Apprehension, anxiety, behavioural changes
- Decreased level of consciousness
- Increased pulse rate
- Increased rate and depth of respiration or irregular respiratory patterns
- Decreased lung sounds
- Use of accessory muscles of respiration
- Pallor, cyanosis
- Increased fatigue
- Dizziness
- Clubbing of nails due to prolonged, chronic hypoxia

\section*{Oxygen safety guidelines}
- Oxygen is a medication and should be administered under order.
- An 'oxygen in use' sign must be placed on the client's door and the client's room/ bedside.
- Oxygen delivery systems must be kept away from open flames.
- No smoking in the premises.
- Keep oxygen cylinders secured to avoid falling.
- Check the oxygen level of portable tanks before transporting a client's bedside.

\section*{Oxygen delivery systems}
- Nasal cannula: is a simple comfortable device for delivering oxygen to a client.
- The two tips of cannula ( 1.5 cm long) protrude from the centre of the disposable tube and are inserted into the nostrils.
- Oxygen is delivered via the cannula at a flow rate from 1-6 L/min.
- The percentage will vary from

LOSS,
GRIEVING AND DEATH

\section*{Terminologies}
- Anticipatory grief - Loss
- Autopsy
- Maturational loss
- Bereavement
- Mourning
- Complicated grief - Palliative care
- Dysfunctional grief- Rigor mortis
- Grief
- Hospice
- Liver mortis
- Situational loss
- Uncomplicated grief

\section*{LOSS AND GRIEF}
- Loss is an actual or potential situation in which something that is valued is changed, no longer available or gone.
- Grief is the total response to the emotional experience related to loss.
- Berievement is the subjective response experienced by the surviving loved ones after the death of a person with whom they have shared a significant relationship.
- Mourning is the behavioural process through which grief is eventually resolved or altered. It is often influenced by culture, spiritual beliefs and custom.

\section*{Types of losses}

Loss occurs when a valued object is changed or is no longer available.
There are many types of loss, including:
- Actual loss: Death of a loved one, theft of one's property
- Perceived loss: Occurs when a sense of loss is felt by an individual but is not tangible to others
- Physical loss: Loss of an extremity in an accident, scarring from burns, permanent injury
- Psychological loss: Such as a woman feeling inadequate after menopause and resultant infertility

\section*{Types of losses}

There are four major categories of loss:
- loss of external objects,
- loss of familiar environment,
- loss of aspects of self,
- loss of significant other.

\section*{Grief}
- Grief is a universal, normal response to loss.
- Grief drains people, both emotionally and physically.
- Because grief consumes so much emotional energy, relationships may be impaired and health status may become altered.
- There are different types of grief including uncomplicated ("normal"), dysfunctional, and anticipatory

\section*{Reactions Commonly Experienced During Grief}

Physical Psychosocial Cognitive Behavioral
- Loss of appetite - Profound sadness - Inability to Impulsivity
- Weight loss - Helplessness concentrate - Indecisiveness
- Insomnia - Hopelessness - Forgetfulness - Social withdrawal
- Fatigue - Denial - Impaired judgment - Distancing
- Decreased libido - Anger
- Decreased immune - Hostility - Guilt
- Nightmares
- Multiple somatic - Preoccupation with lost object
- Restlessness - Loneliness

\section*{Types of grief}
- Uncomplicated grief is a grief reaction that normally follows a significant loss. Uncomplicated grief runs a fairly predictable course that ends with the relinquishing of the lost object and resumption of the previous life.
- Complicated grief is associated with traumatic death such as death by homicide, suicide, or an accident.

\section*{Types of grief}
- Although traumatic death does not necessarily predispose the survivor to complications in mourning, survivors suffer emotions of greater intensity than those associated with normal grief.
- When loved ones die violently, the grievers may suffer from traumatic imagery, that is, the reliving the terror of the incident or imagining the feelings of horror felt by the victim.
- Such thoughts, coupled with intense grief, can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

\section*{Symptoms may include:}
- Sleep disturbances, such as recurrent, terror-filled nightmares
- Psychological distress
- Chronic anxiety
- Unless this problem is recognized and the survivors are encouraged to express the intense feelings, they will not be able to progress through the normal, adaptive grieving process.

\section*{Types of grief}

\section*{Dysfunctional Grief}
- Persons experiencing dysfunctional grief do not progress through the stages of overwhelming emotions associated with grief, or they may fail to demonstrate any behaviors commonly associated with grief.
- The person experiencing pathologic grief continues to have strong emotional reactions, does not return to a normal sleep pattern or work routine, usually remains isolated, and has altered eating habits.
- The pathologically grieving person is unable to reestablish a routine.

\section*{Dysfunctional grief}

\section*{Observations}
- The client fails to grief
- Avoids visiting the grave and refuses to participate in memorial services
- Becomes recurrently symptomatic during anniversary
- Develops persistent guilt and lowered self esteem
- Continues to search for lost person
- Unable to discuss the deceased with composure
- Relationships with friends and relatives worsen

\section*{Types of grief responses}

A normal grief response may be:-
- Abbreviated - brief but genuinely felt
- Anticipatory - experienced in advance of the event.
- Disenfranchised - occurs when a person is not able to acknowledge the loss to other persons e.g suicide, abortion
- Unhealthy/ pathologic/ dysfunctional - may be unresolved or inhibited. It is extended in length and severity

\section*{Factors contributing to unresolved grief}
- Ambivalence towards the person
- Perceived need to be brave and in control; fear of losing control in front of others
- Endurance of multiple losses
- Extremely high emotional value invested in the dead person: failure to grief helps the berieved avoid the reality of the loss
- Uncertainty about the loss
- Lack of support systems

\section*{Stages of grieving (Kubler-Ross, 1969)}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Stage & Behavioural response & Nursing implication \\
\hline Denial & refuses to believe that loss is happening & Verbally support but do not reinforce denial \\
\hline Anger & May direct anger at nurse about matters that normally would not bother them & Help understand that anger is a normal response \\
\hline Bargainin g & Seeks to bargain to avoid loss & Listen attentively and allow client to talk. Spiritual support \\
\hline Depressi on & Grieves over what has happened and what cannot be. May talk freely or withdraw & Allow client to express sadness. Communicate nonverbally by sitting quietly without expecting conversation. Touch. \\
\hline Acceptan ce & Comes in terms with loss. Decreased interest in sorrounding and sunnort & Help family understand client's decreased need to socialize. Fncourage client \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{The stages, popularly known by the acronym DABDA, Invented by C.M. \& R.P.}

Denial - "I feel fine."; "This can't be happening, not to me." Denial is usually only a temporary defense for the individual.
Anger - "Why me? It's not fair!"; "How can this happen to me?"; '"Who is to blame?" Once in the second stage, the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue.
Bargaining - "I'll do anything for a few more years."; "I will give my life savings if..." The third stage involves the hope that the individual can somehow postpone or delay death.

\section*{The stages, popularly known by the acronym DABDA, Invented by C.M. \& R.P.}

Depression - "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?"; "I'm going to die soon so what's the point... What's the point?"; "I miss my loved one, why go on?" During the fourth stage, the dying person begins to understand the certainty of death. Because of this, the individual may become silent, refuse visitors and spend much of the time crying and grieving. This process allows the dying person to disconnect from things of love and affection. It is not recommended to attempt to cheer up an individual who is in this stage. It is an important time for grieving that must be processed.
Acceptance - "It's going to be okay."; "I can't fight it, I may as well prepare for it."
In this last stage, individuals begin to come to terms with their mortality, or that of a loved one, or other tragic event

\section*{Stages of grieving (Engel, 1964)}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Stage & Behavioural response \\
\hline Shock and disbelief & Refuses to accept loss, denies emotionally \\
\hline Developing awareness & Reality of loss begins to penetrate consciousness \\
\hline Restitution & Conducts rituals of mourning \\
\hline Resolving the loss & Attempts to deal with the painful loss. \\
\hline Idealization & Reminders of lost object evoke fewer feelings of sadness. Reinvests feelings in others \\
\hline Outcome & Behaviour influenced by several factorse.g importance of lost object \\
