                        <p>They are tailored to the body's needs and used to replace lost fluid and/or aid in the delivery of IV medications.</p>

                        <p>IV fluids come in four different forms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Colloids</strong> - contain solutes in the form of large proteins or other similarly sized molecules. are useful in maintaining blood volume, but their use in the field is limited. Colloids are expensive, have specific storage requirements, and have a short shelf life. Commonly used colloid solutions include plasma protein fraction, salt poor albumin, dextran, and hetastarch.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Crystalloids</strong> are the primary fluid used for prehospital IV therapy. Crystalloids contain electrolytes (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride) but lack the large proteins and molecules found in colloids. Crystalloids come in many preparations and are classified according to their "tonicity." Depending on their concentration, crystalloids can affect the distribution of water within the body.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Isotonic crystalloids</strong> have a tonicity equal to the body plasma. When administered to a normally hydrated patient, isotonic crystalloids do not cause a significant shift of water between the blood vessels and the cells. Thus, there is no (or minimal) osmosis occurring. The most common isotonic solutions used in prehospital care are
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Lactated Ringer's (LR) contains sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and sodium lactate in sterile water.</li>
                                            <li>Normal saline solution (NSS) contains 0.9% sodium chloride (salt) in sterile water.</li>
                                            <li>5% Dextrose in water (D5W) is packaged as an isotonic carbohydrate that contains glucose as</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Hypertonic crystalloids</strong> have a tonicity higher than the body plasma. The administration of a hypertonic crystalloid causes water to shift from the extravascular spaces into the bloodstream, increasing the intravascular volume. Examples include 3% sodium chloride (3% NaCl), with $513 \text{ mEq/L}$ of NaCl , and 5% NaCl (5% NaCl ), with $855 \text{ mEq/L}$ of sodium and chloride, 50% dextrose in water (D<sub>50</sub>W), a highly concentrated sugar solution.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hypotonic crystalloids</strong> have a tonicity lower than the body plasma. The administration of a hypotonic crystalloid causes water to shift from the intravascular space to the extravascular space, and eventually into the tissue cells. Types of hypotonic fluids include 0.45% sodium chloride (0.45% NaCl), 0.33% sodium chloride, 0.2% sodium chloride, and 2.5% dextrose in water.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <p><strong>Blood and blood products</strong> are the most desirable fluids for replacement. Unlike colloids and crystalloids, the hemoglobin carries oxygen to the cells. Not only is the intravascular volume increased, but the fluid administered can also transport oxygen to the cells. Blood, however, is a precious commodity and must be conserved to benefit the people most in need.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Oxygen-carrying solutions</strong> are synthetic fluids that carry and deliver oxygen to the cells. These fluids, which remain experimental, show promise for the prehospital care of patients who have experienced severe blood loss or are otherwise suffering from hypovolemia. It is hoped that oxygen-carrying solutions will be similar to crystalloid solutions in cost, storage capability, and ease of administration, and be capable of carrying oxygen, which presently can only be accomplished by blood or blood products.</p>

                        <p>The general formula for calculating IV drip rates is:</p>

                        <p>Total time in minutes = $24 \text{ hrs} \times 60 \text{ min/hr} = 1440 \text{ min}$.</p>

                            <li><strong>Phlebitis</strong> - inflammation of a vein that may be caused by infection, the mere presence of a foreign body (the IV catheter) or the fluids or medication being given.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infiltration / Extravasation</strong> Infiltration occurs when an IV fluid or medication accidentally enters the surrounding tissue rather than the vein.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fluid overload</strong> This occurs when fluids are given at a higher rate or in a larger volume than the system can absorb or excrete.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypothermia</strong> The human body is at risk of accidentally induced hypothermia when large amounts of cold fluids are infused. Rapid temperature changes in the heart may precipitate ventricular fibrillation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electrolyte imbalance</strong> - Administering a too-dilute or tooconcentrated solution can disrupt the patient's balance of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other electrolytes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Embolism</strong> - A blood clot or other solid mass, as well as an air bubble, can be delivered into the circulation through an IV and end up blocking a vessel. Peripheral IVs have a low risk of embolism, since large solid masses cannot travel through a narrow catheter, and it is nearly impossible to inject air through a peripheral IV at a dangerous rate. The risk is greater with a central IV. Air bubbles of less than 30 microliters are thought to dissolve into the circulation harmlessly.</li>

                        <p>Meryln remained hospitalised for 48 hours. She required fluid replacement of a total of 5L. Her BP increased to $120 / 70 \text{mmHg}$, PR - $74 /\text{min}$, RR $14 /\text{min}$ at rest. Her urine output increased and she was able to take oral fluids. She was able to discuss symptoms of deficient fluid volume that would necessitate her calling a health proffessional.</p>

                            <li>Blood products are not compatible with dextrose (dextrose 5%) can lyse red blood cells</li>
                            <li>Change the giving set at least every twelve hours for a continuing transfusion and on completion of the transfusion</li>
                            <li>Used bags stay on the ward for 48 hrs (in case of delayed reaction) and then disposed of in a yellow clinical waste bin (in the case of a delayed reaction the lab can use the stalk of donor blood to initiate serological investigation</li>

                        <p>Reactions following blood transfusion may occur for various reasons. Patient must be informed that the supply of blood is not completely risk-free but that it has been tested carefully.</p>
                        <p>Nursing management is directed toward preventing complications and promptly initiating measures to control any complications that occur.</p>
                        <p>The following steps are taken so that a diagnosis may be made regarding the type and severity of the reaction:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The transfusion set is disconnected, but the intravenous line is kept patent with a normal saline solution (0.9%) in case intravenous medication should be needed rapidly.</li>
                            <li>The blood container and tubing are saved, not discarded. They are sent to blood bank for repeat typing and culture. The identifying tags and numbers are verified.</li>
                            <li>The symptoms are treated as prescribed and vital signs are monitored.</li>
                            <li>The patient blood is drawn from plasma hemoglobin, culture, and retyping.</li>
                            <li>A urine sample is collected as soon as possible and sent to laboratory for a hemoglobin determination. Subsequent voiding of urine should be observed.</li>
                            <li>The blood bank is notified that a suspected transfusion reaction has occurred.</li>
                            <li>The reaction is documented according to the institution's policy.</li>
