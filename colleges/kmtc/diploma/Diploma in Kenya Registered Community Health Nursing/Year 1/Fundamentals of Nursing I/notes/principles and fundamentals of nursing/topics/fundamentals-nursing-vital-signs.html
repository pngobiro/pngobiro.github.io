                        <p>Vital or cardinal signs are temperature, pulse, respiration and blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>Monitoring a client's vital signs should not be an automatic or a routine procedure; it should be a thoughtful, scientific assessment.</p>
                        <p>When and how often to assess a specific client's vital signs are chiefly nursing judgments, depending on the client's health status.</p>
                        <p>Vital signs are objective measurements of the patient's most basic body function.</p>
                        <p>A change in vital signs can be a strong indicator of a decline in the patient's health status.</p>
                        <p>When a nurse observes a patient's abnormal vital signs, the nurse must precisely document the specific variation, such as fever, blood pressure spike, or depressed respiration, and also the specific action taken to address the condition.</p>
                        <p>Observation is "looking and listening to the subjective and objective information that the patient provides".</p>
                        <p>The vital role of nurses is not just data collectors, but interpreters of multiple and complex patient data gathered in context of the whole picture presented by the patient.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>consists of glass tube</li>
                            <li>should be immersed in antiseptic solution to prevent infection</li>
                            <li>Shake it before using it to bring the mercury down.</li>
                            <li>Never hold the thermometer at the bulb, because the hand may cause inaccurate reading.</li>
                            <li>Cleaning the thermometer with hot water should be avoided since, it will cause mercury to expand more and may break the thermometer.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Age</strong> - As people age they become more sensitive to extremely hot or cold environments, which can affect body temperature</li>
                            <li><strong>Diurnal variations (circadian rhythms)</strong> - in health, a person's temperature fluctuates throughout the day</li>
                            <li><strong>Exercise</strong> - increases heat production, which results in an increased body temperature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hormones</strong> - During ovulation, for example, women's temperatures can be raised</li>
                            <li><strong>Stress</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Environment</strong> - Environmental climates where individuals are exposed to extreme temperature conditions may result in them developing heat stroke or hypothermia.</li>
                            <li>Hot and cold food and drink may affect temperature</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Methods of Taking Temperature</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Axillary</strong>, under the armpit. This method provides the least accurate results.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orally</strong>, under the tongue. This method is never used with infants or very young children because they may accidentally bite or break the thermometer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rectally</strong>, inserted into the rectum. This method provides the most accurate recording of the temperature. It is most often used for infants.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tympanic</strong>, in the tympanic membrane. Used mostly for infants</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Do not use an oral thermometer for an individual, who has a history of seizures, breathes through his or her mouth, has just had oral surgery, or is unconscious.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wait at least 15 minutes after eating, drinking, or smoking</li>
                            <li>Place under tongue in either pocket just off-center in lower jaw</li>

                            <li><strong>Carbon Dioxide</strong> - Too much $\text{CO}_2$ increases respiration rate, because each breath pulls in oxygen and exhales carbon dioxide.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oxygen</strong> - oxygen concentration of the blood is monitored by small sensory organs called aortic bodies, and low oxygen concentration causes respiration rate to increase.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acid</strong> - Parts of the brain are very pH sensitive. Chemicals that make the blood basic are interpreted to mean that respirations should stop temporarily.</li>
                            <li><strong>Epinephrine</strong> - Anything that induces an adrenaline response causes breathing to become rapid.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acetylcholine</strong> - The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine acts to constrict airways and slow respiration. Because bringing air into the lungs is drying and because oxygen is capable of damaging cells in excess, it's best for general health if an animal doesn't breathe any more than necessary.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>CHECK THE EQUIPMENT. Do not use if any problems are found.
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Look to see that the gauge - mercury meniscus or aneroid needle is at zero</li>
                                    <li>Check the cuff for any breaks in stitching or tears in the fabric.</li>
                                    <li>Check the rubber tubing for cracks or leaks, especially at connections.</li>
                                    <li>Be sure three sizes of cuffs are accessible (small, regular, and adult large).</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>PLACE THE MANOMETER so it can be viewed straight on and within 15 inches of the viewer.</li>
                            <li>RIGHT ARM will be used when possible. Upper arm should be bare and unconstricted by clothing</li>
                            <li>SELECT THE APPROPRIATE SIZE CUFF. The bladder width should equal at least 40% of the circumference of the upper arm, and the length of the bladder should be 80% of the circumference of the arm, but no more than 100%.</li>
                            <li>PALPATE the location of the brachial artery (on the upper arm's inner aspect).</li>
                            <li>POSITION the center of the cuff's bladder over the brachial artery.</li>
                            <li>APPLY THE CUFF evenly and snugly one-inch (2.5 cm) above the antecubital fossa (bend of arm).</li>
                            <li>POSITION THE ARM so the cuff is at heart level. The arm should rest firmly supported on a table, slightly abducted and bent, with palm up.</li>
                            <li>For the first reading only,
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Palpate the radial artery pulse.</li>
                                    <li>Inflate the cuff to the point where the pulse can no longer be felt.</li>
                                    <li>Slowly deflate the cuff, noting on the gauge the point where the pulse reappears/can again be felt. This is the estimated systolic pressure. Rapidly deflate the cuff. Wait at least 15-30 seconds before re-inflating the cuff to begin the first auscultatory measurement. (This allows good circulation to be reestablished.)</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>CHECK THE CLIENT'S POSITION. Legs should be uncrossed, feet resting firmly on the floor and the back supported while blood pressure is being measured.</li>
                            <li>INSERT the stethoscope earpieces, angled forward to fit snugly.</li>
                            <li>PLACE THE BELL OR THE DIAPHRAGM HEAD of the stethoscope lightly over brachial artery at the bend of the elbow, but with good skin contact. Avoid too much pressure, which can close off the vessel and distort the sounds, therefore altering the reading. (The bell head is preferred because it permits more accurate auscultation of the Korotkoff sounds than the diaphragm, especially in the interpretation of diastolic readings.)</li>
                            <li>INFLATE the cuff as rapidly as possible to maximum inflation level (MIL).</li>
                            <li>DEFLATE THE CUFF SLOWLY and CONSISTENTLY at the rate of 2 mm per pulse beat. The rate of deflation should be slow enough to accurately evaluate the exact millimeter marking of the Korotkoff sounds. Once deflation has begun, never reinflate.</li>
                            <li>NOTE where the first sharp rhythmic sound appears in relation to the number or markings on the gauge. This is the systolic pressure.</li>
                            <li>CONTINUE DEFLATION at the established rate. NOTE on the gauge where the last sound is heard. This is the diastolic pressure in adults.</li>
                            <li>CONTINUE DEFLATION for 10 mm Hg past the last sound. (This assures that the absence of sound is not a "skipped" beat but is the true end of the sound.) Then deflate the cuff rapidly and completely.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Korotkoff's Sounds</h3>
                        <p>Measurement of blood pressure by auscultation is based on the sounds produced as a result of changes in blood flow, termed Korotkoff's sounds, and are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Phase I</strong> The pressure level at which the first faint, clear tapping sounds are heard, which increase as the cuff is deflated (reference point for systolic BP).</li>
                            <li><strong>Phase II</strong> During cuff deflation when a murmur or swishing sounds are heard.</li>
                            <li><strong>Phase III</strong> The period during which sounds are crisper and increase in intensity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Phase IV</strong> When a distinct, abrupt, muffling of sound is heard</li>
                            <li><strong>Phase V</strong> The pressure level when the last sound is heard (reference point for diastolic BP).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors affecting blood pressure</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Peripheral resistance</li>
                            <li>blood vessel diameter - Smaller diameter, same volume, more pressure.</li>
                            <li>blood viscosity - The more viscous the blood, the greater resistance it encounters and the higher the blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Vessel elasticity - The elastic recoil of the vessel then maintains the continued flow of blood during diastole.</li>
                            <li>Blood volume - When there is a greater volume of fluid, more fluid presses against the walls of the arteries resulting in a greater pressure.</li>
                            <li>Cardiac output - An increase in cardiac output results in increased blood pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors that can affect blood pressure reading</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Blood Pressure Cuff is too Small</strong> - Studies have shown that using too small of a blood pressure cuff can cause a patient's systolic blood pressure measurement to increase 10 to 40 mmHg .</li>
                            <li><strong>Blood Pressure Cuff Used Over Clothing</strong>- Studies have shown that clothing can impact a systolic blood pressure from 10 to 50 mmHg .</li>
                            <li><strong>Not Resting 3-5 minutes</strong> - Any activities such as exercise or eating can affect systolic blood pressure measurement 10 to 20 mmHg .</li>
                            <li><strong>Arm/Back/Feet Unsupported</strong> - When having your blood pressure measured, you should always be seated in a comfortable chair, legs uncrossed, with your back and arm supported. These differences can increase/decrease systolic blood pressure 2 mmHg for every inch above/below your heart level.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional State</strong> - Stress or anxiety can cause large increases in blood pressure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Talking</strong> - studies have shown that systolic blood pressure measurement may increase 10 to 15 mmHg .</li>
                            <li><strong>Smoking</strong>- Tobacco products all contain nicotine which will temporarily increase blood pressure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alcohol/Caffeine</strong>- Alcohol and caffeine consumption causes blood pressure levels to spike.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temperature</strong>- Blood pressure tends to increase when you are cold.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Injury or blocked artery is present</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Systematic error is most often due to a lack of concentration or poor hearing. It may result in confusion of auditory and visual cues or misreading of the Korotkoff sounds.</li>
                            <li>Terminal digit preference refers to the tendency for an observer to record the pressure reading to A convenient digit, such as zero diagnosis and treatment.</li>
                            <li>Observer prejudice or bias implies that an observer adjusts the observed pressure to meet his/her preconceived notion of what the pressure "should be."</li>
                            <li>Equipment Errors</li>
                            <li>Patient Preparation Errors</li>
