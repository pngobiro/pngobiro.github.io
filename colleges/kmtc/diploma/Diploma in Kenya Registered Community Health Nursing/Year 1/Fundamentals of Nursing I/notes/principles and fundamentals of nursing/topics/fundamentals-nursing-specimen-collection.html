                            <li><strong>First Morning Specimen:</strong> This is the specimen of choice for urinalysis and microscopic analysis, since the urine is generally more concentrated (due to the length of time the urine is allowed to remain in the bladder) and, therefore, contains relatively higher levels of cellular elements and analytes such as protein, if present.</li>
                            <li><strong>Midstream Clean Catch Specimen:</strong> This is the preferred type of specimen for culture and sensitivity testing because of the reduced incidence of cellular and microbial contamination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Timed Collection Specimen:</strong> A timed specimen is collected to measure the concentration of these substances in urine over a specified length of time, usually 8 or 24 hours. In this collection method, the bladder is emptied prior to beginning the timed collection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Catheter Collection Specimen:</strong> This assisted procedure is conducted when a patient is bedridden or cannot urinate independently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Suprapubic Aspiration Specimen:</strong> This method is used when a bedridden patient cannot be catheterized or a sterile specimen is required. The urine specimen is collected by needle aspiration through the abdominal wall into the bladder.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pediatric Specimen:</strong> For infants and small children, a special urine collection bag is adhered to the skin surrounding the urethral area.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note any abnormal characteristics such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unusual color (e.g., specimen is blue),</li>
                            <li>Presence of foreign objects or material,</li>
                            <li>Unusual odor (e.g., bleach), or</li>
                            <li>Signs of adulteration (e.g., excessive foaming when shaken).</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>All urine collection and/or transport containers should be clean and free of particles or interfering substances.</li>
                            <li>The collection and/or transport container should have a secure lid and be leakresistant.</li>
                            <li>Use containers that are made of breakresistant plastic, which is safer than glass.</li>
                            <li>The container material should not leach interfering substances into the specimen.</li>
                            <li>Specimen containers should not be reused.</li>
                            <li>A primary collection container should hold at least $50 \text{ mL}$, has a wide base and an opening of at least $4 \text{ cm}$. The 24-hour containers should hold up to $3\text{L}$.</li>
                            <li>sterile collection containers for microbiology specimens.</li>
                            <li>Transport tubes should be compatible with automated systems and instruments used by the lab.</li>
                            <li>Proper labeling should be applied to the collection container or tubes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Urine Specimen Handling Guidelines</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Labels:</strong> Include the patient name and identification on labels. Make sure that the information on the container label and the requisition match.</li>
                            <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Ensure that there is sufficient volume to fill the tubes and/or perform the tests.</li>
                            <li><strong>Collection Date and Time:</strong> Include collection time and date on the specimen label. This will confirm that the collection was done correctly. For timed specimens, verify start and stop times of collection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Collection Method:</strong> The method of collection should be checked when the specimen is received in the laboratory to ensure the type of specimen submitted meets the needs of the test ordered.</li>
                            <li><strong>Proper Preservation:</strong> Check if there is a chemical preservative present or if the specimen has not been refrigerated for greater than two hours post collection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Light Protection:</strong> Verify that specimens submitted for testing of light-sensitive analytes are collected in containers that protect the specimen from light.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Definition</h3>
                        <p>Stool specimen collection is the process of obtaining a sample of a patient's feces for diagnosic purposes.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Purpose</h3>
                        <p>This procedure is used to test for infectious organisms, mucus, fat, parasites, or blood in the stool.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Precautions</h3>
                        <p>Depending on the proposed analysis of the feaces, watery feaces will not be suitable for conducting a test for any fat that may be present, but can be used for other analyses, such as testing for bacteria.</p>
                        <p>Stool specimen can be tested for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ova and cysts</li>
                            <li>Occult blood e.g in peptic ulcer, iron deficiency anaemia</li>
                            <li>Leucocytes - Chronic ulcerative colitis and chronic bacillary dysentery can cause passage of pus with the stool.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Procedure</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adult and older children patient can collect the specimen by passing feces into plastic wrap stretched loosely over the toilet bowl.</li>
                            <li>With young children and infants wearing diapers, the diaper should be lined with plastic wrap. A urine bag can be attached to the child to ensure that the stool specimen is not contaminated with urine.</li>
                            <li>For a bedridden patient, the specimen should be collected in a bedpan lined with plastic wrap, and the nurse can transfer a portion of the feces into the appropriate container.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preparation</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If occult blood is suspected, the patient should be given a mild laxative and should avoid eating foods rich in meat extracts or leafy vegetables three days prior to the test.</li>
                            <li>If the patient's gums bleed when brushing their teeth, the mouth should be cleansed with mouthwash and wiped with a cloth to avoid blood entering the digestive system and contaminating the stool specimen.</li>
                            <li>Certain drugs may interfere with the analysis of the specimen, and the patient should avoid ingesting products such as antacids, oily foods and drugs, and antibiotics.</li>
                            <li>Barium sulphate should be excluded two weeks prior to the test, and medical procedure dyes three weeks prior to the test.</li>
                            <li>If fat in the stool is suspected, the patient will also be asked to collect the samples in preweighed airtight containers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Guidelines</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The faeces specimen should not be contaminated with urine.</li>
                            <li>Do not collect the specimen from bed pan.</li>
                            <li>Collect the specimen during the early phase of the disease and as far as possible before the administration of antimicrobial agents.</li>
                            <li>1 to 2 gm quantity is sufficient.</li>
                            <li>If possible, submit more than one specimen on different days.</li>
                            <li>The fresh stool specimen must be received within 1-2 hours of passage.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aftercare</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient should be made clean and comfortable.</li>
                            <li>All contents of kits, towels, plastic wrap, gloves, and bedpans should be disposed of in appropriate containers. The nurse should wash and dry his or her hands thoroughly.</li>
                            <li>Speed in testing the sample is essential, in order that an accurate result is obtained. Therefore the specimen should be sent for testing as quickly as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If there is a delay in sending the specimen for testing, organisms present in the feces may die, while others may multiply, giving a false reading.</li>
                            <li>Patients should inform medical staff of any medications currently being taken as elements of the drugs may be present in the feces.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Results</h3>
                        <p>The specimens are compared with normal values. Abnormal results indicate that infection, disease, or parasite infestation are present.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Health care team roles</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nurse should be aware of the qualities of normal feces, and note if the patient has any difficulties in passing feces.</li>
                            <li>As many patients may feel uncomfortable performing this collection properly, the nurse should also educate the patient concerning the reasons for having it done.</li>
                        </ul>
