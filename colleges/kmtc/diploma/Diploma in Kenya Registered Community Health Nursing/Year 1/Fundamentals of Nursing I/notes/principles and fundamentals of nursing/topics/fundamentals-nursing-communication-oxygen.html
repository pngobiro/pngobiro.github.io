                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The concept of team nursing was introduced in the early 1950s. It is a method of nursing assignment that binds professional, technical and nurse aides into small teams. This method allows for efficient utilization of technical and/or nurses aide through the direct supervision, guidance, and teaching of professional nurses.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Advantages:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High-quality, comprehensive care with a high proportion of ancillary staff</li>
                            <li>Team members participate in decision making and contribute their own expertise</li>
                            <li>Feeling of participation and belonging are facilitated with team members.</li>
                            <li>Work load can be balanced and shared.</li>
                            <li>Division of labour allows members the opportunity to develop leadership skills.</li>
                            <li>Every team member has the opportunity to learn from and teach colleagues</li>
                            <li>There is a variety in the daily assignment.</li>
                            <li>Interest in client's wellbeing and care is shared by several people, reliability of decisions is increased.</li>
                            <li>Nursing care hours are usually cost effective.</li>
                            <li>The client is able to identify personnel who are responsible for his care.</li>
                            <li>Continuity of care is facilitated, especially if teams are constant.</li>
                            <li>Barriers between professional and non-professional workers can be minimized, the group efforts prevail.</li>
                            <li>Everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the care plan.</li>

                            <li>Team leader must have good leadership skills to effectively direct the team and create a "team spirit".</li>
                            <li>Insufficient time for planning and communication</li>
                            <li>Establishing a team concept takes time, effort and constancy of personnel. Merely assigning people to a group does not make them a 'group' or 'team'.</li>
                            <li>Unstable staffing pattern make team nursing difficult.</li>
                            <li>All personnel must be client centred.</li>
                            <li>There is less individual responsibility and independence regarding nursing functions</li>
                            <li>Insufficient time for care planning and communication may lead to unclear goals. Therefore responsibilities and care may become fragmented</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For team nursing to succeed, the team leader must have strong clinical skills, good communication skills, delegation ability, decisionmaking ability, and the ability to create a cooperative working environment.</p>

                        <p>Although two or three persons are assigned to each module, the greatest responsibility for the care of assigned patients falls on the professional nurse. The professional nurse is also responsible for guiding and teaching non-professional nurse.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Modular nursing is similar to team nursing because professional and non-professional employees cooperate in caring for patients under the leadership of a professional nurse.</p>
                        <p>Module nursing is similar to primary nursing because each pair or trio of nursing personnel are responsible for the care of the patients in their caseload from admission to discharge, following discharge and during subsequent admissions to the agency.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Case management is a process of monitoring an individual patient's health care by the case manager, for the purpose of maximizing positive outcomes and containing costs.</p>
                        <p>The case manger has graduate-level preparation or is at an advanced level of nursing practice. The case manager role requires not only advanced nursing skills but also advanced managerial and communication skills.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Case managers employed by the hospitals follow a patient from the time admission is planned through the time of discharge. This case manager might plan the admitting process to ensure that all preadmission work-ups are completed and that the patient is being admitted at the appropriate time to facilitate follow-up through on problems.</li>
                            <li>Case managers in private practice may focus on a particular group of client. For example, the geriatric case manager focuses on managing care for the older client. The private case manager is paid by the client or family usually based on the hours of service provided. The case manager may help the family to identify all the options for care and treatment, ask questions to obtain greater understanding of the overall problem, and work with the family in the decision-making process.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Case management tools:</h3>
                        <p>The case manager uses two tools, Case Manager Plan (CMP), and Critical Path Diagnosis (CPD) to design, map, track, monitor, and adjust the patient's course through the care-treatment process.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Case Manager Plan (CMP):</strong> Is a multicolumn plan with accompanying time line that includes medical and nursing diagnosis, desired care outcomes, intermediate daily goals to support each outcome, and the daily activities required of nurse, physicians, and other care givers to achieve intermediate goal.</li>
                            <li><strong>Critical Path Diagnosis (CPD):</strong> Is an abbreviated, one - page version of the required physician and nurse action listed in the CMP, together with the exact data on which all key events must occur to achieve the desired outcome by the target date.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The case manager evaluates the patient's progress toward care and treatment goal daily by comparing signs, symptoms, and assessment data against information in the CMP and CDP then tracking variances from the expected course of progress.</p>

                        <p>Community - based health care is a PHC system that provides health related services within the context of the people's daily lives in places where they spend most of their times e.g homes, work, schools.</p>
                        <p>It is the design, delivery and evaluation of health care services developed in partnerships with communities.</p>
                        <p>A community - based health care system needs to:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>provide easy access to the system</li>
                            <li>be flexible in responding to the care needs that individuals and family identify</li>
                            <li>promote care between and among health care agencies through improved communication mechanisms</li>
                            <li>provide appropriate support for family care givers</li>
                            <li>be affordable</li>

                        <p>The ideal CBHC system according to deTornyay (1992) would accomplish these goals:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>be more oriented to health and emphasize health promotion and disease prevention</li>
                            <li>focus on individual responsibility for health practices and behavior</li>
                            <li>be population based and focus more attention on risk factors in the physical and social environment</li>
                            <li>use electronic information systems</li>
                            <li>have a stronger focus on consumers who would have increased information and be informed participants in decision about their health care.</li>
                            <li>Base decisions on outcomes</li>
                            <li>Provide care more efficiently by means of integrated or coordinated teams of providers.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Is a complex process that includes discrete, transitory actions such as touching or broad, longer lasting interventions such as listening.</li>
                            <li>Comforting has been a unique characteristic to nursing since the days of Florence Nightingale, "Making the patient as comfortable as possible".</li>

                        <p>Kolcaba (1991, 1995) identifies comfort needs within four contexts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical comfort needs</strong> - relate to bodily sensations and physiologic problems associated with medical diagnosis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychospiritual comfort needs</strong> - relate to internal awareness of self including esteem, concept, sexuality and meaning of one's life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Social comfort</strong> - relate to interpersonal, family and social relationships.</li>
                            <li><strong>Environmental comfort needs</strong> - relate to the external background of human experience and can include light, noise, temperature and natural versus synthetic elements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Empathy</strong> - an expression of understanding of "how is it for the client" who is distressed, suffering or sad e.g "I understand how hard it is for you"</li>
                            <li><strong>Positive talk</strong> - by keeping the client informed, encouraged or coached e.g "you are doing good, this is a very difficult procedure"</li>
                            <li><strong>Therapeutic touch</strong> - nurse maintains physical contact with the client and reassures and comforts the client e.g "how about if I hold your hand during this prcedure".</li>
                            <li><strong>Competent physical and technical skills</strong> - the nurse's level of proffessionalism and efficiency decreases the anxiety and promotes comfort e.g "we do this procedure frequently".</li>
                            <li><strong>Vigilance</strong> - the client trusts that the nurse is involved in his/ her care e.g "am back to check on how you are doing".</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">COMMUNICATION PROCESS MODEL</h3>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Components of communication process</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Input:</strong> The sender has an intention to communicate with another person. This intention makes up the content of the message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sender:</strong> The sender encodes the message. Thus he gives expression to the content.</li>
                            <li><strong>Channel:</strong> The message is sent via a channel, which can be made of a variety of materials.</li>
                            <li><strong>Noise:</strong> The channel is subjected to various sources of noise. e.g telephone communication, where numerous secondary sounds are audible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> The receiver decodes the incoming message, or expression. He "translates" it and thus receives the message.</li>
                            <li><strong>Output:</strong> This is the content decoded by the receiver.</li>
                            <li><strong>Code:</strong> In the process, the relevance of a code becomes obvious: The codes of the sender and receiver must have at least a certain set in common in order to make communication work.</li>

                            <li><strong>Introductory phase</strong> - also referred to as the orientation/ prehelping phase. It sets the tone for the rest of the relationship. Three stages of this phase are:-
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Opening the relationship</li>

                            <li><strong>Working phase</strong> - the nurse and client begin to view each other as unique individuals. Has two stages:-
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Exploring and understanding thoughts and feelings. The skills required in this phase are:-

                                            <li>Empathetic listening and responding</li>

                            <li><strong>Termination phase</strong> - if the previous phases have evolved effectively, the client generally has a positive outlook and feels able to handle problems independently. Summarizing or reviewing the process can produce a sense of accomplishment. Both nurse and client should express their feelings of termination openly.</li>

                        <p>Communication is an integral part of the nursing process.</p>
                        <p>Communication is important in caring for clients who have communication problems.</p>
                        <p>Communication skills are even more important when the client has sensory, language or cognitive deficits.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Assessing</h3>
                        <p>To assess the client's communication, the nurse determines communication impairments or barriers and communication style.</p>
                        <p>Culture may influence when and how a client speaks</p>
                        <p>Language varies according to age and development</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosing</h3>
                        <p>Impaired verbal communication may be used as a nursing diagnosis when " an individual experiences a decreased, delayed, or absent ability to receive, process, transmit and use a system of symbols" (Wilkinson, 2000)</p>
                        <p>Impaired verbal communication may not be useful when an individual's communication problems are caused by psychiatric illness or coping problem.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Planning</h3>
                        <p>When a nursing diagnosis related to impaired verbal communication has been made, the nurse and client determine outcomes and begin planning ways to promote effective communication.</p>
                        <p>The overall client outcome is to reduce or resolve the factors impairing the communication.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Implementing</h3>
                        <p>Nursing interventions to facilitate communication with clients who have problems with speech or language include manipulating the environment, providing support, employing measures to enhance communication and educating the client and support person.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Is useful for both client and nurse communication</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Client:</strong> to establish whether outcomes have been met in relation to communication, the nurse must listen actively, observe nonverbal cues and use therapeutic communication skills to determine that communication was effective.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nurse:</strong> process recording - verbatim (word-forword) is used. Includes all verbal and nonverbal interactions of both the nurse and client.</li>

                        <p>You are assigned to take care of Mr. Mana, a 45year old man, who will be returning from recovery room after undergoing the removal of a mass from his abdomen. While you are prepering his room for his return, the nurse and the physician arrive to talk with Mrs Mana about her husband's surgery. The doctor explains that the mass was malignant and invasive. Mr. mana is a candidate of chemotherapy but his prognosis is guarded because of the extent of the tumour growth. Mrs. Mana looks away, closes her eyes and only nods her head.</p>
                        <p>As the physician leaves, the nurse approaches Mrs. Mana, sits next to her and puts her hand around Mrs. Mana who begins to cry. The nurse uses a soothing voice to tell her that it is okay to cry and assures her she will remain with her. The two of them sit together in silence until Mrs. Mana is able to express her feelings. The nurse listens attentively. Later the nurse offers to get a cup of coffee for Mrs. Mana and asks if there is anything she could do to assist Mrs. Mana at this difficcult time.</p>
