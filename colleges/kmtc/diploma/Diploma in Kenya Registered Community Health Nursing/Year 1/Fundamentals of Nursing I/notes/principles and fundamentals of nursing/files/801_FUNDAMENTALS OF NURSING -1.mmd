\section*{TEAM METHOD}

\section*{Advantages:}
- High-quality, comprehensive care with a high proportion of ancillary staff
- Team members participate in decision making and contribute their own expertise
- Feeling of participation and belonging are facilitated with team members.
- Work load can be balanced and shared.
- Division of labour allows members the opportunity to develop leadership skills.
- Every team member has the opportunity to learn from and teach colleagues
- There is a variety in the daily assignment.

\section*{TEAM METHOD}

\section*{Advantages}
- Interest in client's wellbeing and care is shared by several people, reliability of decisions is increased.
- Nursing care hours are usually cost effective.
- The client is able to identify personnel who are responsible for his care.
- Continuity of care is facilitated, especially if teams are constant.
- Barriers between professional and non-professional workers can be minimized, the group efforts prevail.
- Everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the care plan.

\section*{TEAM METHOD}

\section*{Disadvantages:}
- Continuity suffers if daily team assignments vary
- Team leader must have good leadership skills to effectively direct the team and create a "team spirit".
- Insufficient time for planning and communication
- Establishing a team concept takes time, effort and constancy of personnel. Merely assigning people to a group does not make them a 'group' or 'team'.
- Unstable staffing pattern make team nursing difficult.
- All personnel must be client centred.
- There is less individual responsibility and independence regarding nursing functions
- Insufficient time for care planning and communication may lead to unclear goals. Therefore responsibilities and care may become fragmented

\section*{TEAM METHOD}
- For team nursing to succeed, the team leader must have strong clinical skills, good communication skills, delegation ability, decisionmaking ability, and the ability to create a cooperative working environment.

\section*{TEAM METHOD}

\section*{Channels of communication in team nursing}
- Reports
- Work or assignment conference
- Patient care conference
- Written nursing care plan

\section*{MODULAR NURSING:}
- Modular nursing assignment is used when the nursing staff includes technical and nurse aides, as well as professional nurses.
- Although two or three persons are assigned to each module, the greatest responsibility for the care of assigned patients falls on the professional nurse. The professional nurse is also responsible for guiding and teaching non-professional nurse.

\section*{MODULAR NURSING:}

Advantages
- Continuity of care is improved
- RN more involved in planning and coordinating care
- Geographic closeness and efficient communication.
Disadvantages
- Increased costs to stock each module
- Long corridors not conducive to modular nursing.

\section*{MODULAR NURSING:}
- Modular nursing is similar to team nursing because professional and non-professional employees cooperate in caring for patients under the leadership of a professional nurse.
- Module nursing is similar to primary nursing because each pair or trio of nursing personnel are responsible for the care of the patients in their caseload from admission to discharge, following discharge and during subsequent admissions to the agency.

\section*{PRIMARY NURSING METHOD}

This method is the best in an agency with an allprofessional nurse staff.
- It is: A comprehensive, continuous and coordinated nursing process for meeting the total needs of each patient.
Basic concepts in primary nursing:
- Patient assessment by a primary nurse, who plans the care to be given by secondary or associate nurse when the primary nurse is off duty. The 24 hours responsibility for care is put into practice through the primary nurse's written directive on a preplanned communication assignment.

\section*{PRIMARY NURSING METHOD}

Functions of primary nurse include:
1- Conducting an admission (initial) assessment.
2- Developing, planning, implementing, and revising the nursing care plan.
3- Directing care in her absence.
4- Collaborating with physicians and families.
5- Making referrals.
6- Teaching health concepts.
7- Making discharge plans.

\section*{PRIMARY NURSING METHOD}

Advantages
- High-quality, holistic patient care
- Establish rapport with patient
- RN feels challenged and rewarded.

Disadvantages
- Primary nurse must be able to practice with a high degree of responsibility and autonomy
- RN must accept 24-hour responsibility
- More RNs needed; not cost-effective

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}
- Case management is a process of monitoring an individual patient's health care by the case manager, for the purpose of maximizing positive outcomes and containing costs.
- The case manger has graduate-level preparation or is at an advanced level of nursing practice. The case manager role requires not only advanced nursing skills but also advanced managerial and communication skills.

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}

Case manager's approaches:-
1- Case managers employed by the hospitals follow a patient from the time admission is planned through the time of discharge. This case manager might plan the admitting process to ensure that all preadmission work-ups are completed and that the patient is being admitted at the appropriate time to facilitate follow-up through on problems.

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}

2- Case managers in private practice may focus on a particular group of client. For example, the geriatric case manager focuses on managing care for the older client. The private case manager is paid by the client or family usually based on the hours of service provided. The case manager may help the family to identify all the options for care and treatment, ask questions to obtain greater understanding of the overall problem, and work with the family in the decision-making process.

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}

Case management tools:
- The case manager uses two tools, Case Manager Plan ( CMP), and Critical Path Diagnosis ( CPD) to , design , map , track , monitor, and adjust the patient's course through the care-treatment process.
1-Case Manager Plan (C M P):
- Is a multicolumn plan with accompanying time line that includes medical and nursing diagnosis , desired care outcomes, intermediate daily goals to support each outcome, and the daily activities required of nurse, physicians, and other care givers to achieve intermediate goal.

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}
- 2- Critical Path Diagnosis (CPD) :
- Is an abbreviated, one - page version of the required physician and nurse action listed in the CMP, together with the exact data on which all key events must occur to achieve the desired outcome by the target date.
- The case manager evaluates the patient's progress toward care and treatment goal daily by comparing signs, symptoms, and assessment data against information in the CMP and CDP then tracking variances from the expected course of progress.

Therapists, Dietary,

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}

Advantages:
a) For the patient:
- Establishing and achieving a set of "expected" or standardized patient care outcomes for each patient.
- Facilitating early patient discharge or discharge within an appropriate length of stay.
- Using the fewest possible appropriate health care resources to meet expected patient care outcomes.
- Facilitating the continuity of patient care through collaborative practice of diverse health professionals.
b) For the nurse:
- Enhancing nurse's professional development and job satisfaction.
- Facilitating the transfer of knowledge of expert clinical staff of novice staff.

\section*{CASE MANAGEMENT}

Disadvantages
- The risk with case management models is that integration into unit care delivery may not occur.
- Care goals for the patient, as determined by the case manager, may not be communicated to the bedside nurse.
- The case manager becomes the care coordinator and decision maker for care planning, and the unit nursing staff may become more focused on technical tasks.

\section*{Choosing a Nursing Care Delivery Model:}

In order to determine the most proper model - for a current situation, the following questions are to be answered:
- What staff mix is required?
- Who should make work assignments?
- Work assigned by task? By patient?
- How will communication be handled?
- Who will make decisions?
- Who will be responsible and accountable?
- Fit with unit/facility/organization management?

\section*{COMMUNITY - BASED HEALTH CARE}
- Community - based health care is a PHC system that provides health related services within the context of the people's daily lives in places where they spend most of their times e.g homes, work, schools.
- It is the design, delivery and evaluation of health care services developed in partnerships with communities.

\section*{COMMUNITY - BASED HEALTH CARE}
- A community - based health care system needs to:-
- provide easy access to the system
- be flexible in responding to the care needs that individuals and family identify
- promote care between and among health care agencies through improved communication mechanisms
- provide appropriate support for family care givers
- be affordable

\section*{COMMUNITY - BASED HEALTH CARE}

The ideal CBHC system according to deTornyay (1992) would accomplish these goals:-
- be more oriented to health and emphasize health promotion and disease prevention
- focus on individual responsibility for health practices and behavior
- be population based and focus more attention on risk factors in the physical and social environment
- use electronic information systems

\section*{COMMUNITY - BASED HEALTH CARE}
- have a stronger focus on consumers who would have increased information and be informed participants in decision about their health care.
- Base decisions on outcomes
- Provide care more efficiently by means of integrated or coordinated teams of providers.
- Balance technology with non-technical interventions and weigh the benefits against its effects on human values and interpersonal processes

\section*{COMMUNITY BASED FRAMEWORK}

INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
Is one that makes all levels of care available in an integrated form - primary, secondary and tertiary care.

\section*{GOALS}
- To facilitate care across settings
- Recovery
- Positive health outcomes
- Long-term benefits of modifying harmful lifestyles through health promotion and disease prevention.

\section*{COMMUNITY BASED NURSING}
- Is nursing care directed toward a specific group or population within the community and may be provided for individuals and groups. The level of care can be primary, secondary or tertiary.

\section*{COMMUNITY BASED NURSING}
- Nurses who work in community based settings e.g public health nurses need to be prepared to make home visits.
- Home visits can provide information that is not obtainable in other ways.

\section*{CONTINUITY OF CARE}
- Is the coordination of health care services by health care providers for clients moving from one health care setting to another and between and among health care professionals.
- Continuity ensures uninterrupted and consistent services for the client from one level of care to another.
- It maintains client focused individualized care and helps optimize the client's health status.

\section*{DISCHARGE PLANNING}
- Is the process of preparing a client to leave one level of care for another within or outside the current health care agency.
- Discharge planning needs to begin when a client is admitted to the agency.
- Effective discharge planning involves:-
a) Ongoing assessment to obtain comprehensive information about the client's on-going needs.
b) Statements of nursing diagnosis
c) Plans to ensure the client's and caregivers' needs are met.

WARD
LAYOUT

\section*{Ward layout}
- A well organised ward has everything in the right place, which saves time.
Single sex ward areas
All wards have designated ward areas or bays and washing facilities for male and female patients.
Exceptions:
- Obstetrics and gynaecology, which are women only.
- In the specialist wards such as the Intensive Care Unit, male and female patients may be nursed in the same area.

\section*{Ward layout}
- Bathrooms and toilets

All wards have separate facilities with permanent signs on toilets and bathrooms for either male or female patients.

THE
COMMUNICATI
ON PROCESS

\section*{COMMUNICATION}
- Effective communication is an essential element of an optimal nurse-client relationship and of the leader manager role.
- Establishing a client rapport facilitates a vital role - the process of teaching, a structured form of communication designed to produce learning.

\section*{COMMUNICATION}
- Is a critical skill in nursing.
- It is the process by which humans meet their survival needs, build relationships and experience in joy.
- In nursing, it is a dynamic process used to gather assessment data, to teach and to persuade and to express caring and comfort.
- It is an integral part of the helping relationships.

\section*{CARING}
- Care is the essence of nursing and the dominant, distinctive and unifying feature of nursing (Madeleine Leininger, 1984).
- Caring is intentional action that conveys physical and emotional security and genuine connectedness with another person or group of people (Miller, 1995).
- Caring includes assistive, supportive and facilitative acts toward or for another individual or group with evident or anticipated needs.

\section*{CARING BEHAVIOURS}
- Comfort,
- Compassion,
- Concern,
- Coping Behaviour,
- Empathy,
- Enabling,
- Facilitating,
- Interest,
- Involvement,
- Health

Consultative Acts,
- Health Instruction Acts,
- Helping Behaviours,

\section*{CARING BEHAVIOURS}
- Health

Maintenance
Acts,
- Love,
- Nurturance,
- Presence,
- Protective Behaviours,
- Restorative

Behaviours,
- Sharing,
- Stimulating Behaviours,
- Stress Alleviation,
- Support,
- Tenderness,
- Touching
- Trust.

\section*{COMFORTING}
- Is a complex process that includes discrete, transitory actions such as touching or broad, longer lasting interventions such as listening.
- Comforting has been a unique characteristic to nursing since the days of Florence Nightingale, "Making the patient as comfortable as possible".

\section*{COMFORT NEEDS}

Kolcaba $(1991,1995)$ identifies comfort needs within four contexts:
- Physical comfort needs - relate to bodily sensations and physiologic problems associated with medical diagnosis.
- Psychospiritual comfort needs - relate to internal awareness of self including esteem, concept, sexuality and meaning of one's life.
- Social comfort - relate to interpersonal, family and social relationships.
- Environmental comfort needs - relate to the external background of human experience and can include light, noise, temperature and natural versus synthetic elements.

\section*{COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES}
- Empathy - an expression of understanding of "how is it for the client" who is distressed, suffering or sad e.g "I understand how hard it is for you"
- Positive talk - by keeping the client informed, encouraged or coached e.g "you are doing good, this is a very difficult procedure"
- Therapeutic touch - nurse maintains physical contact with the client and reassures and comforts the client e.g "how about if I hold your hand during this prcedure".

\section*{COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES}
- Competent physical and technical skills - the nurse's level of proffessionalism and efficiency decreases the anxiety and promotes comfort e.g "we do this procedure frequently".
- Vigilance - the client trusts that the nurse is involved in his/ her care e.g "am back to check on how you are doing".

\section*{COMMUNICATION PROCESS}

\section*{SENDER - MESSAGE - RECEIVER RESPONSE/ FEEDBACK}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_c7320e7ff02d12b140e0g-052.jpg?height=976&width=2086&top_left_y=794&top_left_x=245)

\section*{Components of communication process}
- Input: The sender has an intention to communicate with another person. This intention makes up the content of the message.
- Sender: The sender encodes the message. Thus he gives expression to the content.
- Channel: The message is sent via a channel, which can be made of a variety of materials.
- Noise. The channel is subjected to various sources of noise. e.g telephone communication, where numerous secondary sounds are audible.

\section*{Components of communication process}
- Receiver. The receiver decodes the incoming message, or expression. He "translates" it and thus receives the message.
- Output. This is the content decoded by the receiver.
- Code. In the process, the relevance of a code becomes obvious: The codes of the sender and receiver must have at least a certain set in common in order to make communication work.

\title{
MODES OF COMMUNICATION
}
- VERBAL COMMUNICATION
- NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION personal appearance, posture and gait, facial expression, gestures

\section*{THERAPEUTIC COMMUNICATION}
- Promotes understanding and can help establish a constructive relationship between the nurse and the client.
- The relationship is client and goal directed.
- It is important to understand how the client views and feels about the situation before responding to it.

\section*{THERAPEUTIC COMMUNICATION}

\section*{ATTENTIVE LISTENING}
- Is listening actively using all the senses as opposed to listening passively with the ear.
- Involves paying attention to verbal and nonverbal communication.
PHYSICAL ATTENDING
- Face the other person squarely
- Adopt an open posture
- Lean toward the person
- Maintain good eye contact
- Try to be relatively relaxed

\section*{THERAPEUTIC COMMUNICATION}

\section*{TECHNIQUES}
- Using silence
- Providing general leads e.g "can you tell me how it is to you"
- Being specific and tentative e.g "are you in pain"
- Using open ended questions e.g "what is your opinion"
- Using touch
- Restating or paraphrasing
- Seeking clarification

\section*{THERAPEUTIC COMMUNICATION}
- Offering self
- Giving information
- Acknowledging
- Reflecting - directing ideas, feelings, questions back to the client to enable them to explore their own ideas and feelings about a situation.
- Summarizing and planning - stating the main points of a discussion to clarify the points discussed.

\section*{NURSE - CLIENT RELATIONSHIP}
- Referred to as interpersonal/ therapeutic/ helping relationships.
- Helping is a growth facilitating process that strives to achieve two basic goals:-
1. Helps clients manage their problems in living more effectively and develop u used or underused opportunities more fully.
2. Helps clients become better at helping themselves in their everyday lives.

\section*{HELPING RELATIONSHIP}

May be influenced by:-
- Personal and professional characteristics of the nurse and client
- Age
- Sex
- Appearance
- Diagnosis
- Education
- Values
- Ethnic and cultural background
- Personality
- Expectations
- Setting

\section*{HELPING RELATIONSHIP}

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS}
- Is an intellectual and emotional bond between the nurse and client and is focused on the client
- Respects the client as an individual including:-
- maximizing the client's abilities to participate in decision making
- Considering ethnic and cultural aspects
- Considering family relationships and values
- Respects client confidentiality
- Focuses on the client's well-being
- Is based on mutual trust, respect and acceptance

\section*{HELPING RELATIONSHIP}

\section*{PHASES OF THE HELPING RELATIONSHIP}
- Pre-interaction phase - similar to the planning stage before an interview. The nurse has information about the client before the first face-to-face meeting.
- Introductory phase - also referred to as the orientation/ prehelping phase. It sets the tone for the rest of the relationship. Three stages of this phase are:-
- Opening the relationship
- Clarifying the problem
- Structuring and formulating the contract

\section*{HELPING RELATIONSHIP}
- Working phase - the nurse and client begin to view each other as unique individuals.
Has two stages:-
1. Exploring and understanding thoughts and feelings.

The skills required in this phase are:-
*Empathetic listening and responding
*Respect
* Genuineness
* Concreteness - be specific
* Confrontation - nurse points out discrepancies between thoughts, feelings and actions that inhibit the client's self understanding or exploration of specific areas.
2. Facilitating and taking action

\section*{HELPING RELATIONSHIP}
- Termination phase - if the previous phases have evolved effectively, the client generally has a positive outlook and feels able to handle problems independently.
- Summarizing or reviewing the process can produce a sense of accomplishment
- Both nurse and client should express their feelings of termination openly.

\section*{DEVELOPING A HELPING RELATIONSHIP}
- Listen actively
- Help to identify what the person is feeling
- Empathize
- Be honest
- Be genuine and credible
- Use your ingenuity (creativity)
- Be aware of cultural differences that may affect meaning and understanding
- Maintain client confidentiality
- Know your role and limitations

\section*{COMMUNICATION PROCESS \\ FACTORS INFLUENCING COMMUNICATION PROCESS}
- Development
- Gender
- Values and perceptions
- Personal space (distance people prefer in interaction with others)
- Roles and relationships
- Environment
- Interpersonal attitudes

\section*{BARRIERS TO COMMUNICATION}
- Stereo-typing e.g "women are complainers"
- Agreeing and disagreeing
- Being defensive e.g "you are not the only client"
- Challenging e.g "you think I gave you the wrong pill"
- Probing
- Rejecting e.g "I cant talk now, am going for tea"
- Changing topics and subjects
- Passing judgments - approving or disapproving responses e.g "that's not good enough"

\section*{COMMUNICATION AND THE NURSING PROCESS}
- Communication is an integral part of the nursing process.
- Communication is important in caring for clients who have communication problems.
- Communication skills are even more important when the client has sensory, language or cognitive deficits.

\section*{COMMUNICATION AND THE NURSING PROCESS}

\section*{ASSESSING}
- To assess the client's communication, the nurse determines communication impairments or barriers and communication style.
- Culture may influence when and how a client speaks
- Language varies according to age and development

\section*{COMMUNICATION AND THE NURSING PROCESS}

\section*{DIAGNOSING}
- Impaired verbal communication may be used as a nursing diagnosis when " an individual experiences a decreased, delayed, or absent ability to receive, process, transmit and use a system of symbols" (Wilkinson, 2000)
- Impaired verbal communication may not be useful when an individual's communication problems are caused by psychiatric illness or coping problem.

\section*{COMMUNICATION AND THE NURSING PROCESS}

\section*{PLANNING}
- When a nursing diagnosis related to impaired verbal communication has been made, the nurse and client determine outcomes and begin planning ways to promote effective communication.
- The overall client outcome is to reduce or resolve the factors impairing the communication.

\section*{COMMUNICATION AND THE NURSING PROCESS}

\section*{IMPLEMENTING}
- Nursing interventions to facilitate communication with clients who have problems with speech or language include manipulating the environment, providing support, employing measures to enhance communication and educating the client and support person.

\section*{COMMUNICATION AND THE NURSING PROCESS}

\section*{EVALUATION}

Is useful for both client and nurse communication
- Client: to establish whether outcomes have been met in relation to communication, the nurse must listen actively, observe nonverbal cues and use therapeutic communication skills to determine that communication was effective.
- Nurse: process recording - verbatim (word-forword) is used. Includes all verbal and nonverbal interactions of both the nurse and client.

\section*{FOCUS}

You are assigned to take care of Mr. Mana, a 45year old man, who will be returning from recovery room after undergoing the removal of a mass from his abdomen. While you are prepering his room for his return, the nurse and the physician arrive to talk with Mrs Mana about her husband's surgery. The doctor explains that the mass was malignant and invasive. Mr. mana is a candidate of chemotherapy but his prognosis is guarded because of the extent of the tumour growth. Mrs. Mana looks away, closes her eyes and only nods her head.

\section*{FOCUS}

As the physician leaves, the nurse approaches Mrs. Mana, sits next to her and puts her hand around Mrs. Mana who begins to cry. The nurse uses a soothing voice to tell her that it is okay to cry and assures her she will remain with her. The two of them sit together in silence until Mrs. Mana is able to express her feelings. The nurse listens attentively. Later the nurse offers to get a cup of coffee for Mrs. Mana and asks if there is anything she could do to assist Mrs. Mana at this difficcult time.

\section*{FOCUS}
1. Interpret Mrs. Mana's nonverbal behaviour in response to the news about her husband's surgery.
2. Evaluate the nurse's response towards Mrs. Mana based on the concepts of caring and comforting.
3. Why is it important for the nurse to effectively communicate with Mrs. Mana at this time?
4. The nurse was described as listening attentively to Mrs.Mana. Cite actions that portray attentive listening.

\section*{FOCUS}
1. Mrs. Mana's nonverbal behaviour - changes in posture, facial expression, lack of verbal expression,
Express fear, disappointment, loss, anxiety, devastation,
2. Caring actions: sitiing with Mrs. Mana, listening to her, giving undivided attention, soothing voice, touching, presence, a cup of coffee
3. Provide information, trusting relationship, Stress reduction, helping families understand treatment options, decision making
4. Paying attention to both verbal and nonverbal communication, remaining silent, focusing solely on Mrs. Mana, encouraging her to talk, not interrupting

\section*{OXYGEN ADMINISTRA TION}
- Oxygenation is the process of oxygen diffusing passively from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells or dissolves into the plasma.
- Insufficient oxygenation is termed hypoxemia.
- Oxygen delivery
is the rate of oxygen transport from the lungs to the peripheral tissues
- Oxygen consumption
- is the rate at which oxygen is removed from the blood for use by the tissues.
- Hypoxia literally means "deficient in oxygen", that is an abnormally low oxygen availability to the body or an individual tissue or organ.
- Hypoxemia is the reduction of oxygen specifically in the blood; that is decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood.
- Anoxia is when there is no oxygen available at all.
- oxygen is a drug and therefore requires prescribing in all but emergency situations.
- Failure to administer oxygen appropriately can result in serious harm to the patient.
- The safe implementation of oxygen therapy with appropriate monitoring is an integral component of the health professional's role.

Factors affecting delivery of oxygen to tissues
- Inspired oxygen concentration FIO2
- Alveolar ventilation
- Ventilation-perfusion distribution within lungs
- Haemoglobin Hb and concentrations of agents which may bind to Hb as carbon monoxide
- Influences on the oxygen Hb dissociation curve
- Cardiac output
- Distribution of capillary blood flow within tissues

\section*{Measures of Oxygenation}
- Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2)
- Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)
- A-a oxygen gradient
- PaO2/FiO2 ratio
- A-a oxygen ratio
- Oxygenation index

\section*{Signs and Symptoms of Hypoxemia and Hypoxia}
- Dyspnea, tachypnea. Hyperventilation
- Cyanosis +/-
- Impaired mental performance, coma
- Seizures, brain injury
- Tachycardia/ Hypertension -
- Hypotension/ Bradycardia
- Lactic acidosis

\section*{Consequences of Hypoxemia}
- Systemic hypotension
- Pulmonary hypertension which can lead to heart failure
- Polycythemia
- Tachycardia
- Cerebral involvement (from confusion to coma)
- Objectives of Oxygen therapy
- To overcome the reduced partial pressure and oxygen quantity in blood
- To increase the quantity of oxygen carried in solution in the plasma, even when the Hemoglobin is fully saturated.

\section*{Indications of Oxygen therapy:}

\section*{Respiratory compromise}
- Cyanosis
- Tachypnoea
- Hypoxemia
- Partially obstructed airway

Cardiac compromise
- Chest pain
- Shock
- Tachycardia
- Arrhythmias

Neurological deficits
- Cerebrovascular accident
- Spinal injuries
- Coma
- Types of oxygen delivery
- Nasal cannulae
- Medium concentration mask
- Fixed concentration mask
- Non-rebreather bag
- Humidified circuits
- High flow systems
- Oxygen Administration Safety
- . Oxygen is extremely hazardous in contact with an open flame
-. Do not allow smoking in an area where oxygen is being administered
- . Educate all patients on $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

\section*{Methods of Oxygen Administration}

Nasal cannulas
- Two prongs inserted just inside anterior nares and supported on a light frame
- Oxygen is supplied at rates of 1-4 liters/min resulting in inspired concentrations of approx. 25-30\%
- Masks
- Simple plastic masks fit over nose and mouth allow inspired oxygen concentrations of upto 60\% when supplied with flow rates of 6 liters/min
- Some accumulation of CO2 occurs within the mask (2\%), so cautious use in patients liable to develop CO2 retention
- Venturi Masks
- Useful mask for delivering controlled oxygen concentrations (e.g. CO2 retainer patients) based on Venturi principle
- Venturi principle:
- As the oxygen enters the mask through a narrow jet, it entrains a constant flow of air, which enters via surrounding holes.
- Non Rebreather bags
- Reservoir bags'
- Deliver $\mathrm{FiO}_{2}$ 0.6-0.8
- Flow rate must be set to $151 / \mathrm{min}$
- Fill reservoir 2 thirds before applying
- Useful in acute situation
- Should not be worn >24hrs
- Transtracheal oxygen
- Delivered via a microcatheter inserted through the anterior tracheal wall with the tip lying just above the carina
- Tents
- Used only for children who do not tolerate masks well.
- Ventilators
- Complete control over the composition of the inspired gas is available.
- Patient is mechanically ventilated via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube
- Hyperbaric Oxygen
- $100 \%$ oxygen is given at an increased pressure of 3 atm .
- Since normal air is 20\% oxygen, pure oxygen would be 5 times more oxygen, and at 3times normal air pressure, a patient gets 15 times more oxygen than normal.

\section*{Indications:}
- Decompression illness (the "bends")
- Carbon monoxide poisoning
- Radiation necrosis
- Reconstructive surgery
- Some infections, wounds
- Nasal Cannula
