- It will provide cognitive flexibility that will be required for the formation and navigation of tomorrow's health care environment" (Borsy, 2009).

\section*{HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT IN NURSING}
- Nursing began as women provided for their families' health needs.
- Documentation of the profession is available only for the last 150 years.
- The profession began as certain individuals emerged with the desire and ability to nurture others and provide for them.

\section*{History of Nursing}
- The nursing profession has developed throughout history, seeing a transformation in practice, types of caregivers, roles, and policy changes, but nursing remains a profession of caring and service to those in need.
- The earliest nurses never attended nursing school; they were often nuns or other women who provided care for the sick, poor, or homeless without family support.

\section*{History of Nursing}
- Women were frequently called in to work as midwives to help deliver babies, or as wet nurses to breastfeed.
- During the Middle Ages, early hospitals were operated by nurses who were often affiliated with religious organizations.
- Many of these institutions were places for patients to die, with nurses providing comfort during the final hours.

\section*{History of Nursing}
- In the 18th and 19th centuries, the nursing profession expanded to include care of soldiers during many prominent wars.
- In 1853, Florence Nightingale served as a nurse during the Crimean War, during which she not only cared for the injured, but set standards of cleanliness in the areas where she worked; her sanitary reforms reduced the overall incidence of infection where they were implemented.

\section*{History of Nursing}
- At the end of the 19th century, more nurses began to work toward changing policy in leadership and education in nursing schools, recognizing their role as more than that of a bedside caregiver.
- By implementing change, many nurses went beyond the scope of care to educate those in leadership about the need for prevention and to reach some groups of people that may have fallen through the cracks.

\section*{History of Nursing}
- In 1893, Lillian Wald began promoting the role of the public health nurse to help those living outside of the hospital setting; and in 1925, Mary Breckinridge started the Frontier Nursing Service to help some of the poor and destitute living in rural parts of America.
