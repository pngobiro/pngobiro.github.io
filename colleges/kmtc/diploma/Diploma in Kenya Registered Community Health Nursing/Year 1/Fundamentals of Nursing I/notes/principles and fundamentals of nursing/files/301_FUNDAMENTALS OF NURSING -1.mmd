\section*{TEMPERATURE}

The system that regulates body temperature has three main parts:
- Sensors in the skin
- An integrator in the hypothalamus
- An effector system that adjusts the production and loss of heat.

\section*{Types of thermometers}

Several types of thermometers
1. Electronic/Digital
2. Mercury, Glass

\section*{Glass mercury/ digital thermometers}

\section*{Care of clinical thermometer}
- consists of glass tube
- should be immersed in antiseptic solution to prevent infection
- Shake it before using it to bring the mercury down.
- Never hold the thermometer at the bulb, because the hand may cause inaccurate reading.
- Cleaning the thermometer with hot water should be avoided since, it will cause mercury to expand more and may break the thermometer.

\section*{Factors affecting body temperature}
- Age - As people age they become more sensitive to extremely hot or cold environments, which can affect body temperature
- Diurnal variations (circadian rhythms) - in health, a person's temperature fluctuates throughout the day
- Exercise - increases heat production, which results in an increased body temperature.
- Hormones - During ovulation, for example, women's temperatures can be raised
- Stress
- Environment - Environmental climates where individuals are exposed to extreme temperature conditions may result in them developing heat stroke or hypothermia.
- Hot and cold food and drink may affect temperature

\section*{Methods}
- Axillary, under the armpit. This method provides the least accurate results.
- Orally, under the tongue. This method is never used with infants or very young children because they may accidentally bite or break the thermometer.
- Rectally, inserted into the rectum. This method provides the most accurate recording of the temperature. It is most often used for infants.
- Tympanic, in the tympanic membrane. Used mostly for infants

\section*{Taking temperature}

\section*{Tympanic}
- Tympanic thermometers are inserted in the ear canal
- A disposable ear tip should be used Oral
Do not use an oral thermometer for an individual, who has a history of seizures, breathes through his or her mouth, has just had oral surgery, or is unconscious.

\section*{Taking temperature}
- Oral temperatures
- Wait at least 15 minutes after eating, drinking, or smoking
- Place under tongue in either pocket just offcenter in lower jaw
- Tympanic temperatures
- Proper technique essential
- Adult - pull ear up and back
- Child - pull ear down and back
- Fast, easy to use, and preferred in pediatric offices

\section*{Taking temperature}
- Rectal remperatures
- Standard precaution - gloves
- Patient is positioned on side (left side preferred) or stomach
- Lubricate tip of thermometer
- Slowly and gently insert tip into anus
- $1 / 2$ inch for infants
- 1 inch for adults
- Hold thermometer in place while temperature is taken

\section*{Taking temperature}
- Axillary temperatures
- Place patient in seated or lying position
- Place tip of thermometer in middle of axilla with shaft facing forward
- Probe must touch skin on all sides
- Temporal temperatures
- Temporal scanner
- Noninvasive, quick
- Stroke scanner across forehead, crossing over the temporal artery

\section*{Temporal scanner}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_c52f15d643e65a242601g-013.jpg?height=1043&width=904&top_left_y=467&top_left_x=173)

\section*{Reading temperatures}
1. By degree
2. Place thermometer at eye level and look for silver line of mercury
3. Never place fingers on bulb of thermometer as this might change the value

\section*{Reading temperature}
- A normal body temperature taken orally is $98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, with a range of $97.8-99.1^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ( $36.5-37.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).
- A fever is a temperature of $101^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(38.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ or higher in an infant younger than three months or above $102^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(38.9^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ for older children and adults.
- Hypothermia is recognized as a temperature below $96^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(35.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.

\section*{Converting celcius to farenheight}
- ${ }^{\circ} \mathbf{F}$ to ${ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
- ${ }^{\circ} \mathbf{C}$ to ${ }^{\circ} \mathbf{F}$ Multiply by 9 , then divide by 5 , then add 32
- Fahrenheit to Celsius ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}-32$ ) / $1.8={ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Celsius to Fahrenheit ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \times 1.8+32=$ ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

\section*{Alterations in body temperature}
- PYREXIA
- Intermittent - the body alternates at regular intervals between periods of fever, normal and subnormal temperatures.
- Remittent - wide range of temperature fluctuation within 24 hr period, all of which are above normal.
- Relapsing - short febrile periods of a few days are interspersed with periods of 1 or 2 days of normal temperature.
- Constant - the body temperature fluctuates minimally but always remains above normal.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS FOR CLIENTS WITH FEVER}
- Monitor vital signs
- Assess skin colour and temperature
- Monitor WBC, hematocrit value and other pertinent laboratory reports for indications of dehydration or infections
- Remove excess blankets when the client feels warm
- Provide adequate nutrition and fluids to meet increased metabolic demands to prevent dehydration

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS FOR CLIENTS WITH FEVER}
- Measure intake and output
- Reduce physical activity to limit heat production
- Administer antipyretics as ordered
- Provide oral hygiene to keep the mucous membranes moist
- Provide tepid sponge bath to increase heat loss through conduction
- Provide dry clothing and bed linen

\section*{Hypothermia}
- Is a core body temperature below the lower limit of normal.
- The three physiologic mechanisms of hypothermia are:-
- Excessive heat loss
- Inadequate heat production
- Impaired hypothalamic thermoregulation
- Hypothermia may be induced or accidental.

\section*{NURSING INTERVENTIONS FOR CLIENTS WITH HYPOTHERMIA}
- Provide a warm environment
- Provide dry clothing
- Apply warm blankets
- Keep limbs close to the body
- Cover the client's scalp with a cap or a turban
- Supply warm oral or intravenous fluids
- Apply warming pads

PULSE

\section*{PULSE}
- Is a wave of blood created by contraction of the left ventricle of the heart.
- Pulse wave represents the stroke volume output and the amount of blood that enters the arteries with each ventricular contraction.
- In a healthy person, the pulse reflects the heart beat.

\section*{Taking pulse}
- The pulse can be recorded anywhere that a surface artery runs over a bone.
- To measure a pulse, one should place the index, middle, and ring fingers over the radial artery. It is located above the wrist, on the anterior or front surface of the thumb side of the arm.
- Gentle pressure should be applied, taking care to avoid obstructing blood flow.
- The rate, rhythm, strength, and tension of the pulse should be noted.

\section*{Pulse Sites}
- Temporal - when radial pulse is not accessible
- Carotid - in cases of cardiac arrest
- Apical - routinely for infants and children upto 3 years, determine discrepancies with radial pulse
- Brachial - to measure blood pressure
- Radial - readily accessible
- Femoral - in cases of cardiac arrest
- Popliteal - determine circulation of the lower leg
- Posterior tibial - - determine circulation of the foot
- Dorsalis pedis - - determine circulation of the foot

\section*{Pulse Sites}

\section*{Taking pulse}
- Gently place 2 fingers on the artery.
- Do not use your thumb, because it has its own pulse that can be felt.
- Count the beats for one minute

\section*{Assessment}

\section*{Strength of pulse}
- weak or 1+ beats of poor force
- strong or 2+ beats of moderate force[easily felt]
- bounding or 3+ beats of strong force
- thready-- beats are barely felt
- absent

Rhythm
- Tachycardia- faster than 100 beats/ min
- Bradycardia-slower than 60 beats/ min
- Dysrhythmia--irregular rhythm

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING THE PULSE}
- Age
- Gender
- Exercise
- Fever
- Medications e.g digitalis
- Hypovolaemia
- Stress
- Position changes
- Pathology

RESPIRATI ONS

\section*{RESPIRATIONS}
- Respiration is the act of breathing.
- Purpose: To Exchange O2-CO2 in lungs/ tissues
- Ventilation-movement of air in \& out of lungs
- However, we count respirations

\section*{Measure:}
- Rate, rhythm, depth, effort of breathing

\section*{Normal:}
- Rate - $16-20 / \mathrm{min}$; regular rhythm;
- Depth- subjectively measured as shallow, normal, or deep
- Effort - no effort; unlabored.

\section*{Respirations}
- An examiner's fingers should be placed on the person's wrist, while the number of breaths or respirations in one minute is recorded.
- Every effort should be made to prevent people from becoming aware that their breathing is being checked.

\section*{Respirations}
- Respirations are quiet, slow, and shallow when the adult is asleep, and rapid, deeper, and noisier during and after activity.
Average respiration rates at rest are:
- infants, 34-40 per minute
- children five years of age, 25 per minute
- older children and adults, 16-20 per minute
- Tachypnea is rapid respiration above 20 per minute.

\section*{Rhythms/ Breathing patterns}
- Eupnea- normal rate \& rhythm
- Tachypnea- rapid breathing, rate > 20/min
- Bradypnea- slow breathing, rate < 16/min
- Dyspnea- difficult or labored breathing
- Apnea- absence of breathing
- Orthopnea- inability to lie down to breathe

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING RESPIRATION}
- Carbon Dioxide - Too much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increases respiration rate, because each breath pulls in oxygen and exhales carbon dioxide.
- Oxygen - oxygen concentration of the blood is monitored by small sensory organs called aortic bodies, and low oxygen concentration causes respiration rate to increase.
- Acid - Parts of the brain are very pH sensitive. Chemicals that make the blood basic are interpreted to mean that respirations should stop temporarily.

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING RESPIRATION}
- Epinephrine - Anything that induces an adrenaline response causes breathing to become rapid.
- Acetylcholine - The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine acts to constrict airways and slow respiration. Because bringing air into the lungs is drying and because oxygen is capable of damaging cells in excess, it's best for general health if an animal doesn't breathe any more than necessary.

BLOOD
PRESSURE

\section*{BLOOD PRESSURE}
- Blood Pressure (BP) is the lateral force on the walls of artery by the pulsing blood under pressure from the heart. The heart' s contraction forces blood under high pressure into the aorta.
- The peak of maximum pressure when ejection occurs is the systolic blood pressure. When the ventricles relax, the blood remaining in the arteries exerts a minimum a diastolic pressure.

\section*{BLOOD PRESSURE}
- Arterial blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood on the wall of a blood vessel as the heart pumps (contracts) and relaxes.
- Systolic blood pressure is the degree of force when the heart is pumping (contracting).
- The diastolic blood pressure is the degree of force when the hearts relaxed.

\section*{Stethoscope}
- The stethoscope is an instrument for listening to sounds within the body.
- Body sounds can be heard at the skin's surface and transported via enclosed columns of air to the ear.
- In order to take the blood pressure, the stethoscope diaphragm is applied directly over the brachial pulse pressure point (inner arm).

\section*{Stethoscope}
- The diaphragm headpiece should be applied with light pressure (heavy pressure will distort the artery and produce sounds below the true diastolic) so that there is no air between the skin and the stethoscope.
- In using stethoscopes with bent ear tips, the ear tips should point forward toward the nose.

\section*{Procedure}
1. CHECK THE EQUIPMENT. Do not use if any problems are found.
a. Look to see that the gauge - mercury meniscus or aneroid needle is at zero
b. Check the cuff for any breaks in stitching or tears in the fabric.
c. Check the rubber tubing for cracks or leaks, especially at connections.
d. Be sure three sizes of cuffs are accessible (small, regular, and adult large).

\section*{Procedure}
2. PLACE THE MANOMETER so it can be viewed straight on and within 15 inches of the viewer.
3. RIGHT ARM will be used when possible. Upper arm should be bare and unconstricted by clothing
4. SELECT THE APPROPRIATE SIZE CUFF. The bladder width should equal at least $40 \%$ of the circumference of the upper arm, and the length of the bladder should be $80 \%$ of the circumference of the arm, but no more than $100 \%$.
5. PALPATE the location of the brachial artery (on the upper arm's inner aspect).
6. POSITION the center of the cuff's bladder over the brachial artery.
7. APPLY THE CUFF evenly and snugly one-inch ( 2.5 cm ) above the antecubital fossa (bend of arm).

\section*{Procedure}
8. POSITION THE ARM so the cuff is at heart level. The arm should rest firmly supported on a table, slightly abducted and bent, with palm up.
9. For the first reading only,
a. Palpate the radial artery pulse.
b. Inflate the cuff to the point where the pulse can no longer be felt.
c. Slowly deflate the cuff, noting on the gauge the point where the pulse reappears/can again be felt. This is the estimated systolic pressure. Rapidly deflate the cuff. Wait at least 15-30 seconds before re-inflating the cuff to begin the first auscultatory measurement. (This allows good circulation to be reestablished.)

\section*{Procedure}
10. CHECK THE CLIENT'S POSITION. Legs should be uncrossed, feet resting firmly on the floor and the back supported while blood pressure is being measured.
11. INSERT the stethoscope earpieces, angled forward to fit snugly.
12. PLACE THE BELL OR THE DIAPHRAGM HEAD of the stethoscope lightly over brachial artery at the bend of the elbow, but with good skin contact. Avoid too much pressure, which can close off the vessel and distort the sounds, therefore altering the reading. (The bell head is preferred because it permits more accurate auscultation of the Korotkoff sounds than the diaphragm, especially in the interpretation of diastolic readings.)

\section*{Procedure}
14. INFLATE the cuff as rapidly as possible to maximum inflation level (MIL),.
15. DEFLATE THE CUFF SLOWLY and CONSISTENTLY at the rate of 2 mm per pulse beat. The rate of deflation should be slow enough to accurately evaluate the exact millimeter marking of the Korotkoff sounds. Once deflation has begun, never reinflate.
16. NOTE where the first sharp rhythmic sound appears in relation to the number or markings on the gauge. This is the systolic pressure.
17. CONTINUE DEFLATION at the established rate. NOTE on the gauge where the last sound is heard. This is the diastolic pressure in adults.
18. CONTINUE DEFLATION for 10 mm Hg past the last sound. (This assures that the absence of sound is not a "skipped" beat but is the true end of the sound.) Then deflate the cuff rapidly and completely.

\section*{Korotkoff's Sounds}

Measurement of blood pressure by auscultation is based on the sounds produced as a result of changes in blood flow, termed Korotkoff's sounds, and are:
1. Phase I The pressure level at which the first faint, clear tapping sounds are heard, which increase as the cuff is deflated (reference point for systolic BP).
2. Phase II During cuff deflation when a murmur or swishing sounds are heard.
3. Phase III The period during which sounds are crisper and increase in intensity.
4. Phase IV When a distinct, abrupt, muffling of sound is heard
5. Phase V The pressure level when the last sound is heard (reference point for diastolic BP).

\section*{Factors affecting blood pressure}
- Peripheral resistance
- blood vessel diameter - Smaller diameter, same volume, more pressure.
- blood viscosity - The more viscous the blood, the greater resistance it encounters and the higher the blood pressure.
- Vessel elasticity - The elastic recoil of the vessel then maintains the continued flow of blood during diastole.
- Blood volume - When there is a greater volume of fluid, more fluid presses against the walls of the arteries resulting in a greater pressure.
- Cardiac output - An increase in cardiac output results in increased blood pressure.

\section*{Factors that can affect blood pressure reading}
- Blood Pressure Cuff is too Small - Studies have shown that using too small of a blood pressure cuff can cause a patient's systolic blood pressure measurement to increase 10 to 40 mmHg .
- Blood Pressure Cuff Used Over Clothing- Studies have shown that clothing can impact a systolic blood pressure from 10 to 50 mmHg .
- Not Resting 3-5 minutes - Any activities such as exercise or eating can affect systolic blood pressure measurement 10 to 20 mmHg .
- Arm/Back/Feet Unsupported - When having your blood pressure measured, you should always be seated in a comfortable chair, legs uncrossed, with your back and arm supported. These differences can increase/decrease systolic blood pressure 2 mmHg for every inch above/below your heart level.

\section*{Factors that can affect blood pressure reading}
- Emotional State - Stress or anxiety can cause large increases in blood pressure.
- Talking - studies have shown that systolic blood pressure measurement may increase 10 to 15 mmHg .
- Smoking- Tobacco products all contain nicotine which will temporarily increase blood pressure.
- Alcohol/Caffeine- Alcohol and caffeine consumption causes blood pressure levels to spike.
- Temperature- Blood pressure tends to increase when you are cold.

\section*{Taking blood pressure}

\section*{Avoid measurement in an arm}
- Injury or blocked artery is present
- History of mastectomy on that side
- Implanted device is under the skin

\section*{Common Causes of Blood Pressure Measurement Errors}
- Systematic error is most often due to a lack of concentration or poor hearing. It may result in confusion of auditory and visual cues or misreading of the Korotkoff sounds.
- Terminal digit preference refers to the tendency for an observer to record the pressure reading to A convenient digit, such as zero diagnosis and treatment.
- Observer prejudice or bias implies that an observer adjusts the observed pressure to meet his/her preconceived notion of what the pressure "should be."
- Equipment Errors
- Patient Preparation Errors

\section*{CORRECTING BLOOD PRESSURE ERRORS}
- Patient preparation
- Selecting proper cuff size
- Estimating systolic blood pressure
- Recording average blood pressure (instead of a single measurement)
- Eliminating terminal digit bias
- Maintaining and calibrating equipment

\section*{Taking Vital signs}

Equipments required:
1. Oral/ axilla / rectal thermometer (1)
2. Stethoscope (1)
3. Sphygmomanometer with appropriate cuff size (1)
4. Watch with a second hand (1)
5. Spirit swab or cotton (1)
6. Sponge towel (1)
7. Receiver (2): for clean (1) for discard (1)
8. Record form
9. Ball- point pen: blue / black (1) red (1)
10. Steel tray (1): to set all materials

\section*{Taking Vital signs}

Before beginning any procedure:
- Have equipment clean and ready
- Wash hands
- Identify the person
- Introduce yourself if necessary
- Go to a private or quiet area
- Explain the procedure
- Document your results

\section*{CRITICAL THINKING}
- IDENTIFY - Identifies abnormal vital signs as profoundly or moderately abnormal; accurately describes client condition, Identifies possible cause of abnormal vital
- GATHER - Assesses client appropriately to include peripheral pulses, HR, skin condition for pallor and moisture, altered LOC, temp and /or O2 sat; Identifies possible cause of abnormal vital signs;
- EXAMINE - Prioritizes pertinent assessment data for specific client; Reflects on possible causes of abnormal vital signs; validates by using manual equipment for abnormal BP

\section*{CRITICAL THINKING}
- FORMULATE - Develops a plan for correcting abnormal vital signs; Analyzes pros and cons of plan for potential outcomes
- APPLY - Notifies the team members for client abnormal vital signs with each occurrence; implements plan to improve abnormal vital signs with accuracy and without hesitation; documents actions, client responses and outcomes
- EVALUATE - Reflects on other avenues of planning after completion and discussions with peers in post conference; request feedback from staff and faculty to improve the process; accurately assesses and reassesses client as needed; Utilizes this learning experience in other client settings.

PATIENT
FEEDING

\section*{Patient feeding}
- Nutrition is the process by which the body metabolizes and utilizes nutrients.
- Digestion refers to the mechanical and chemical processes that convert nutrients into a physically absorbable state.
- Absorption is the process by which the end products of digestion-monosaccharides (simple sugars), amino acids, glycerol, fatty acid chains, vitamins, minerals, and water-pass through the epithelial membranes in the small and large intestines into the blood or lymph systems.

\section*{Patient feeding}
- Understanding the role of basic nutrients provides the foundation for selecting foods that promote health.
- Selecting the healthiest forms of each of these nutrients and eating them in proper balance enables the body to function at its optimal level of health.

\section*{Types of diet}

\section*{Nothing by Mouth/ Nil per Oral (NPO)}
- Placing the client on NPO (nothing by mouth) status is a type of diet modification as well as a fluid restriction;
- This intervention is prescribed prior to surgery and certain diagnostic procedures, to rest the GI tract (and prevent diarrhea or vomiting), or when the client's nutritional problem has not been identified.

\section*{Types of diet}

\section*{Clear-Liquid Diet}
- Dairy products are not allowed on a clear-liquid diet. The client is allowed to ingest only liquids that keep the GI tract empty (no residue), such as water, apple juice, and gelatin. A clear-liquid diet is prescribed primarily for surgical clients.
Liquid Diet
- A liquid (or full liquid diet) consisting of various types of liquids is prescribed mainly for postoperative clients because of calorie and nutrient considerations. If the client tolerates a liquid diet without nausea or vomiting and has normal bowel sounds, the diet is progressed to as tolerated (client eats whatever foods that cause no problems).

\section*{Types of diet}

\section*{Soft Diet}
- A soft diet promotes the mechanical digestion of foods. It is prescribed for clients experiencing difficulty in chewing and swallowing. A soft diet is also therapeutic for clients with impaired digestion and/or absorption, due to conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Foods to be avoided on this diet include nuts, seeds (tomatoes and berries with seeds), raw fruits and vegetables, fried foods, and whole grains.

\section*{Pureed Diet}
- A pureed diet provides food that has been blenderized to a smooth consistency. It is prescribed for clients with dysphagia. Special consideration needs to be given to meal preparation; when food has the same consistency, it is difficult to distinguish the taste of different foods.

\section*{Types of diet}

Mechanical Soft Diet
- A mechanical soft diet is similar to a soft diet; however, it allows clients variation, permitting foods with different tastes, such as chili beans. It is prescribed for clients experiencing difficulty chewing or who are unable to chew food thoroughly, as may occur with poorly fitted dentures.

\section*{Types of diet}

\section*{Low-Residue Diet}
- A low-residue diet has reduced fiber and cellulose. It is prescribed to decrease GI mucosal irritation in clients with diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Foods to be avoided are raw fruits (except bananas), vegetables, seeds, plant fiber, and whole grains. Dairy products are limited to two servings a day.

\section*{High-Fiber Diet}
- High-fiber-diet foods are the opposite of low-residue foods. A high-fiber diet is an integral part of the treatment regimen for diverticulosis because it increases the forward motion of the indigestible wastes through the colon

\section*{Liberal Bland Diet}
- A liberal bland diet eliminates chemical and mechanical food irritants, such as fried foods, alcohol, and caffeine

\section*{Types of diet}

\section*{Fat-Controlled Diet}
- Fat-controlled diets reduce the total fat ingested by replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and restricting cholesterol. They are prescribed for clients with atherosclerosis, heart disease, and obesity. Saturated foods to be avoided include animal fats, gravies, sauces, chocolate, and whole-milk products.

\section*{Sodium-Restricted Diet}
- Sodium intake may be restricted as follows: mild, 2 to 3 g ; moderate, 1000 mg ; strict, 500 mg ; severe, 250 mg . A sodium-restricted diet is prescribed for clients with excess fluid volume, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and renal failure.

\section*{Types of diet}

\section*{Lactose Intolerance Diet}
- A lactose intolerance diet eliminates milk and all dairy products except yogurt. Lactose is a sugar found in milk and aids the body absorption of calcium. Lactose intolerance is caused by a lack or deficiency of lactase, an enzyme normally made in the small intestines that splits lactose into glucose and galactose. Incomplete digestion of lactose results in diarrhea, gas, and abdominal cramps between 30 minutes and 2 hours after consumption of diary foods.

\section*{Nursing measures that promote patient feeding}
- Before bringing the meal tray into the room, ask whether the client needs to void or have a bowel movement.
- Provide hygiene measures before serving the meal tray.
- Position the client in a comfortable position, preferably in a chair, if not contraindicated.
- Ask about the client's eating habits, and as to the foods he or she prefers to eat first.
- Make sure the foods are being served at the correct temperature.

\section*{Nursing measures that promote patient feeding}
- Provide assistance if the client is unable to handle eating utensils or open containers and packages.
- Provide adequate time for the client who has difficulty in chewing or swallowing. Make sure that someone is in the room while the client is eating.
- Document the type and amount of food taken at each meal.
- Remove the tray after the meal and provide hygiene measures.

\section*{Tube feeding}

Types of feeding tubes
- Nasogastric
- Nasoduodenal
- Percutaneous Endoscopic

Gastrostomy (PEG)
- Open gastrostomy
- Transgastric jejunostomy
- Surgical jejunostomy

\section*{Intubation}
- Placement of a tube into the stomach or intestine through the mouth, nasopharynx, (Nasogastric/Levine), or through an artificial opening made in the abdominal wall of the stomach (gastrostomy) or small intestine (jejunostomy)
- Nasogastric = short term
- Gastrostomy= long term, surgically inserted directly into the stomach(gastrostomy) or small intestine (jejunostomy)

\section*{Tube Feedings}
- Additional water post:
- Feedings
- Medications
- Prescribed times
- Medications
- Liquid/ dissolved
- No enteric coated or time released capsules
- Do not mix meds with formula. Give medication prior to formula

\section*{Tube feeding schedule}
- Continuous
- Over 24 hrs
- Cyclic
- Prescribed period
- Bolus
- Prescribed volume over 30-60 min. 4-6 times/day.
- Physician orders frequency, amount, \& type of feeding

\section*{Problems with tube feeding}
- Dry mouth
- Sore mouth
- Thirst
- Feeling deprived

\section*{Do's and don'ts of tube feeding}
- Do not hurry/force feeding
- Abdominal distention \& discomfort
- Clean not sterile technique
- Formula at room temp.
- Warm = bacterial growth
- Cold= gastric cramping \& discomfort, liquid is not warmed by the mouth and esophagus
- Formula can hang for 8hrs.

\section*{Procedure for checking tube placement}
- X-ray is the best and most accurate
- Air insertion and listen with stethoscope
- Aspirate gastric contents
- Determines tube placement and checks for digestion of previous feeding ( should be less than 50 mls ) Note -any gastric contents should be returned to the stomach so the chemical balance is not disturbed.
- Check pH of aspirate with pH paper

\section*{Aspirate pH}
- Stomach is acidic 1-4
- Intestine is 7 or greater
- Pleural secretions 6
- Wait at least 1 hr after feedings to check
Feeding is not given if no bowel sounds are heard, abdomen is distended, too much residual, or tube dislodged

\section*{Position for tube feeding}
- Fowlers before and after
- Prevents aspiration
- Regulate the flow of the feeding
- Gravity/ feeding pump
- Flush tube well post feeding
- Clamp tube post flushing
- Intake/output

Avoid introducing air into tubing

\section*{Nasogastric intubation}
- Nasogastric intubation refers to the process of placing a soft plastic nasogastric (NG) tube through a patient's nostril, past the pharynx and down the esophagus into a patient's stomach.

\section*{Nasogastric tube feeding}
- Most common first line route.
- - Easy to place at bedside by nursing staff.
- - Use small flexible tubes to avoid nasal skin erosion.
- - Check position via auscultation/aspiration of gastric contents
- and gastric PH, as per nursing protocol. If in doubt regarding position by auscultation and aspiration then confirm with abdominal X-ray.
- - Check residuals to evaluate tolerance.

\section*{Nasogastric tube feeding}

\section*{Requirements}
- Personal protective equipment
- NG/OG tube
- Catheter tip irrigation 60 ml syringe
- Water-soluble lubricant, preferably 2\% Xylocaine jelly
- Adhesive tape
- Low powered suction device OR Drainage bag
- Stethoscope
- Cup of water (if necessary)
- Emesis basin
- pH indicator strips

\section*{Nasogastric tube feeding}

\section*{Procedure}
- To insert a nasogastric tube, have the patient tilt his head slightly back and gently ease the lubricated tubing into the nares.
- Have the patient tilt his head forward into a neutral upright position, hold his breath and swallow.
- Gravity and swallowing will help move the tube down the esophagus as you gently continue to advance the tube.
- The patient can assist by swallowing and can even take sips of water to help move the tubing down into the stomach.

\section*{Nasogastric tube feeding}
- Advance the tubing until you reach the marker tape that you applied when measuring the distance to the patient's stomach.
- Secure the tubing with tape and check the tubing for placement.
- If the patient gags during the procedure, stop advancing the tube and allow the patient to rest.
- If the tubing comes out of the mouth, retract the tubing and try again.
- If the patient is unconscious, advance the tube between respirations to avoid placing the tube into the trachea.
- If the patient becomes cyanotic, coughs or displays any signs of respiratory distress, remove the tubing, allow the patient to rest and begin again.
