\section*{Common causes of Medication Error's}

Assuming the physician's order and patient information are correct, there are three general possibilities for mistakes when administering IV medications via a pump:
- dosage miscalculation;
- transcription data entry error;
- titration of the wrong medication.

\section*{Common causes of Medication Error's}
- Miscalculation Error: A miscalculation error can occur for any number of reasons, including the use of inaccurate parameters such as dose, weight, height, drug units, or solution volume. A misplaced decimal or missing number in this complex calculation can result in a calculation error that may not be immediately apparent to the clinician.

Data Entry Error: A transcription type data entry error occurs when a nurse inadvertently inputs the wrong data into the infusion pump. Another type of transcription error is the inputting of an incorrect decimal point. For example, the proper infusion rate is calculated, but the rate is incorrectly entered as $54.0 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$ instead of $5.40 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{hr}$.

\section*{Common causes of Medication Error's}

Titration Errors: According to their effect on the patient, many drug delivery rates are changed while the infusion pump is infusing. This type of rate change is called titration. Understanding the medication that is being ordered and the dosage that this drug is routinely given in is key to assuring that the patient is getting the proper dose of medication.

Transcription Errors: Being able to read a physicians writing is sometimes a difficult task, get clarity if uncertain about what has actually been written. If taking a verbal or phone order, a "read-back" system can be instituted in which the nurse who is taking the order, writes down the verbal order and reads it back to the prescribing physician.

\section*{Factors associated with medication errors}

Include:
- Medications with similar names or similar packaging
- Medications that are not commonly used or prescribed
- Commonly used medications to which many patients are allergic (e.g., antibiotics, opiates, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)
- Medications that require testing to ensure proper (i.e., nontoxic) therapeutic levels are maintained (e.g., lithium, warfarin, theophylline, and digoxin)

\section*{Controlled drugs}

To check and administer a controlled drug
- Two people should be involved in the administration procedure of all controlled drugs, and where these two are nurses, one must be a registered nurse.
- The prescription is checked as for usual medication. In addition, consider the time of the previous dose of controlled drug - is it within the prescribed time period? Has the patient already received his allotted dose?
- Take the appropriate drug from the locked cupboard and compare it with the prescription sheet. Verify the dose and name of the drug. Check the quantity in the box with the record book and remove the drug from the container. Check that the remaining ampoules or tablets tally with the record book, and return the remainder to the cupboard and lock it.

\section*{Controlled drugs}
- Check the dose required, route, time, and patient's identity on the prescription.
- Prepare the appropriate amount of drug required, discarding any excess in the sink.
- In the controlled drug record book, document (a) the patient details, (b) date and time, (c) dose given, (d) dose discarded, and (e) the amount of remaining stock.
- Both persons should go to the bedside, where the patient's identity should be confirmed and the prescription dose, time and route should be checked again.
- Administer the medication by the prescribed route, and document this on the prescription sheet and in the controlled drug record.

PERIOPERA
TIVE
NURSING

\section*{PERIOPERATIVE NURSING}

Encompasses three phases:
- Preoperative - begins when decision to have surgery is made and ends when client is transferred to operating table.
- Intraoperative - begins when client is transferred to operating table and ends when is admitted to the recovery room.
- Postoperative - begins with admission to recovery room and ends when healing is complete.

\section*{PURPOSES OF SURGERY}
- Diagnostic
- Palliative
- Ablative - removes a diseased body part

SPECIMEN COLLECTIO

N

\section*{Specimen collection}
- Specimen collection refers to collecting various specimens (samples), such as, stool, urine, blood and other body fluids or tissues, from the patient for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.
- Various types of specimen collected from the patient in the clinical settings, either in out patient departments (OPD) or in-patient units, for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

\section*{General considerations}
- When collecting specimen, wear gloves to protect self from contact with body fluids.
1. Get request for specimen collection and identify the types of specimen being collected and the patient from which the specimen collected.
2. Give adequate explanation to the patient about the purpose, type of specimen being collected and the method used.

\section*{General considerations}
3. Assemble and organize all the necessary materials for the specimen collection.
4. Get the appropriate specimen container and it should be clearly labeled have tight cover to seal the content and placed in the plastic bag or racks, so that it protects the laboratory technician from contamination while handling it.
- Apply strict aseptic techniques throughout the procedure.
- Wash hands before and after the collection.
- Collect the specimen at the appropriate phase of disease.
- Make certain that the specimen is representative of the infectious process (e.g. sputum is the specimen for pneumonia and not saliva) and is adequate in quantity for the desired tests to be performed.
- Collect or place the specimen aseptically in a sterile and/or appropriate container.

\section*{SPECIMEN COLLECTION}
- Ensure that the outside of the specimen container is clean and uncontaminated.
- Close the container tightly so that its contents do not leak during transportation.
- Label and date the container appropriately and complete the requisition form.
- Arrange for immediate

\section*{Criteria for rejection of specimen}
- Missing or inadequate identification.
- Insufficient quantity.
- Specimen collected in an inappropriate container.
- Contamination suspected.
- Inappropriate transport or storage.
- Unknown time delay.
- Haemolysed blood sample.

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}

Patient Request Form
- The provider will complete the "Patient Request Form" with the following information at a minimum:
- Date collected
- Patient's first and last name
- Chart number
- Age
- Source of specimen
- Test(s) requested

\section*{DOCUMENTATION}
1. Time specimen collected.
2. Color and consistency
3. Test collected for.
4. Condition of skin.

\section*{BLOOD SAMPLE}
- Whole blood is required for bacteriological examination.
- Serum separated from blood is used for serological techniques.
- Skin antisepsis is extremely important at the time of collection of the sample.

\section*{BLOOD SAMPLE}

While collecting blood for culture, the following points must be remembered:
- Collect blood during the early stages of disease since the number of bacteria in blood is higher in the acute and early stages of disease.
- Collect blood during paroxysm of fever since the number of bacteria is higher at high temperatures in patients with fever.
- Small children usually have higher number of bacteria in their blood as compared to adults and hence less quantity of blood needs to be collected from them.

Purpose:
To observe, examine or test for diagnosis

\section*{Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)}
- Examination of CSF is an essential step in the diagnosis of any patient with evidence of meningeal irritation or affected cerebrum.
- Almost $3-10 \mathrm{ml}$ of CSF is collected and part of it is used for biochemical, immunological and microscopic

\section*{Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)}

\section*{Precautions to be taken for CSF collection and transportation:}
- Collect CSF before antimicrobial therapy is started.
- Collect CSF in a screw - capped sterile container and not in an injection vial with cotton plug.
- Do not delay transport and laboratory investigations.
- Transport in a transport medium if delay in processing is unavoidable.
- CSF is a precious specimen, handle it carefully and economically. It may not be possible to get a repeat specimen.
- Perform physical inspection immediately after collection and indicate findings on laboratory requisition form.
- Store at 370C, if delay in processing is inevitable.

\section*{Sputum specimen}

Patient preparation
- Before collecting sputum specimen, teach patient about the difference between sputum and saliva, how to cough deeply to raise sputum.
- Position the patient, usually sitting up position. Also postural drainage can be used.
- Give oral care, to avoid sputum contamination with microorganisms of the mouth.
Avoid using tooth paste because it alter the result.

\section*{Sputum specimen}

\section*{Obtain specimen}
- Put on gloves, to avoid contact with sputum particularly it hemoptysis (blood in sputum) present.
- Ask patient to cough deeply to raise up sputum
- Take usually about $15-30 \mathrm{ml}$ sputum
- Ask patient to spit out the sputum into the specimen container
- Make sure it doesn't contaminate the outer part of the container. If contaminated clean with disinfectant
- Cover the cap tightly on the container

\section*{Sputum specimen}

\section*{Re-comfort the patient}
- Give oral care following sputum collection (To remove any unpleasant taste)
Care of the specimen and the equipments used
- Label the specimen container
- Arrange or send the specimen promptly and immediately to laboratory.
- Give proper care of equipments used

Document the amount, color, consistency of sputum, (thick, watery, tenacious) and presence of blood in the sputum.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN}

\section*{URINE}
- The clinical information obtained from a urine specimen is influenced by the collection method, timing and handling.

\section*{Types of Collection}
- Random Specimen This is the specimen most commonly sent to the laboratory for analysis, primarily because it is the easiest to obtain and is readily available.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN}
- First Morning Specimen This is the specimen of choice for urinalysis and microscopic analysis, since the urine is generally more concentrated (due to the length of time the urine is allowed to remain in the bladder) and, therefore, contains relatively higher levels of cellular elements and analytes such as protein, if present.
- Midstream Clean Catch Specimen This is the preferred type of specimen for culture and sensitivity testing because of the reduced incidence of cellular and microbial contamination.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN}
- Timed Collection Specimen A timed specimen is collected to measure the concentration of these substances in urine over a specified length of time, usually 8 or 24 hours. In this collection method, the bladder is emptied prior to beginning the timed collection.
- Catheter Collection Specimen This assisted procedure is conducted when a patient is bedridden or cannot urinate independently.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN}
- Suprapubic Aspiration Specimen This method is used when a bedridden patient cannot be catheterized or a sterile specimen is required. The urine specimen is collected by needle aspiration through the abdominal wall into the bladder.
- Pediatric Specimen For infants and small children, a special urine collection bag is adhered to the skin surrounding the urethral area.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN}
- Note any abnormal characteristics such as:
- Unusual color (e.g., specimen is blue),
- Presence of foreign objects or material,
- Unusual odor (e.g., bleach), or
- Signs of adulteration (e.g., excessive foaming when shaken).

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN - collection}
- All urine collection and/or transport containers should be clean and free of particles or interfering substances.
- The collection and/or transport container should have a secure lid and be leakresistant.
- Use containers that are made of breakresistant plastic, which is safer than glass.
- The container material should not leach interfering substances into the specimen.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN collection}
- Specimen containers should not be reused.
- A primary collection container should hold at least 50 mL , has a wide base and an opening of at least 4 cm . The 24-hour containers should hold up to 3L.
- sterile collection containers for microbiology specimens.
- Transport tubes should be compatible with automated systems and instruments used by the lab.
- Proper labeling should be applied to the collection container or tubes.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN HANDLING GUIDELINES}
- Labels Include the patient name and identification on labels. Make sure that the information on the container label and the requisition match.
- Volume Ensure that there is sufficient volume to fill the tubes and/or perform the tests.
- Collection Date and Time Include collection time and date on the specimen label. This will confirm that the collection was done correctly. For timed specimens, verify start and stop times of collection.

\section*{URINE SPECIMEN HANDLING GUIDELINES}
- Collection Method The method of collection should be checked when the specimen is received in the laboratory to ensure the type of specimen submitted meets the needs of the test ordered.
- Proper Preservation Check if there is a chemical preservative present or if the specimen has not been refrigerated for greater than two hours post collection.
- Light Protection Verify that specimens submitted for testing of light-sensitive analytes are collected in containers that protect the specimen from light.

\section*{STOOL SPECIMEN}

\section*{Definition}
- Stool specimen collection is the process of obtaining a sample of a patient's feces for diagnosic purposes.

\section*{Purpose}
- This procedure is used to test for infectious organisms, mucus, fat, parasites, or blood in the stool.

\section*{Precautions}
- Depending on the proposed analysis of the feaces, watery feaces will not be suitable for conducting a test for any fat that may be present, but can be used for other analyses, such as testing for bacteria.

\section*{STOOL SPECIMEN}

Stool specimen can be tested for:
- Ova and cysts
- Occult blood e.g in peptic ulcer, iron deficiency anaemia
- Leucocytes - Chronic ulcerative colitis and chronic bacillary dysentery can cause passage of pus with the stool.

\section*{Stool specimen}

\section*{Procedure}
- Adult and older children patient can collect the specimen by passing feces into plastic wrap stretched loosely over the toilet bowl.
- With young children and infants wearing diapers, the diaper should be lined with plastic wrap. A urine bag can be attached to the child to ensure that the stool specimen is not contaminated with urine.
- For a bedridden patient, the specimen should be collected in a bedpan lined with plastic wrap, and the nurse can transfer a portion of the feces into the appropriate container.

\section*{Stool specimen}

\section*{Preparation}
- If occult blood is suspected, the patient should be given a mild laxative and should avoid eating foods rich in meat extracts or leafy vegetables three days prior to the test.
- If the patient's gums bleed when brushing their teeth, the mouth should be cleansed with mouthwash and wiped with a cloth to avoid blood entering the digestive system and contaminating the stool specimen.

\section*{Stool specimen}

\section*{Preparation}
- Certain drugs may interfere with the analysis of the specimen, and the patient should avoid ingesting products such as antacids, oily foods and drugs, and antibiotics.
- Barium sulphate should be excluded two weeks prior to the test, and medical procedure dyes three weeks prior to the test.
- If fat in the stool is suspected, the patient will also be asked to collect the samples in preweighed airtight containers.

\section*{Stool specimen}

\section*{Guidelines}
- The faeces specimen should not be contaminated with urine.
- Do not collect the specimen from bed pan.
- Collect the specimen during the early phase of the disease and as far as possible before the administration of antimicrobial agents.
- 1 to 2 gm quantity is sufficient.
- If possible, submit more than one specimen on different days.
- The fresh stool specimen must be received within 1-2 hours of passage.

\section*{Stool specimen}

\section*{Aftercare}
- The patient should be made clean and comfortable.
- All contents of kits, towels, plastic wrap, gloves, and bedpans should be disposed of in appropriate containers. The nurse should wash and dry his or her hands thoroughly.
- Speed in testing the sample is essential, in order that an accurate result is obtained. Therefore the specimen should be sent for testing as quickly as possible.

\section*{Stool specimen}

\section*{Complications}
- If there is a delay in sending the specimen for testing, organisms present in the feces may die, while others may multiply, giving a false reading.
- Patients should inform medical staff of any medications currently being taken as elements of the drugs may be present in the feces.

\section*{Stool specimen}

\section*{Results}
- The specimens are compared with normal values. Abnormal results indicate that infection, disease, or parasite infestation are present.

\section*{Health care team roles}
- The nurse should be aware of the qualities of normal feces, and note if the patient has any difficulties in passing feces.
- As many patients may feel uncomfortable performing this collection properly, the nurse should also educate the patient concerning the reasons for having it done.

WOUND DRESSING

\section*{Introduction}
- The skin is the largest organ of the body, making up 16\% of body weight. It has several vital functions, which include; immune function, temperature regulation, sensation and vitamin production.
- Skin is a dynamic organ in a constant state of change; cells of the outer layers are continuously shed and replaced by inner cells moving to the surface.

\section*{TYPES OF WOUNDS}
- Body wounds are either intentional e.g during therapy like venupuncture or unintentional/ accidental e.g fracture
- Open wounds - skin or mucous membranes is broken; Closed wound- tissues are traumatized without a break in the skin.

\section*{Open wound}

\section*{TYPES OF WOUNDS}

Wounds may also be described according to how they are acquired.
- Clean wounds - minimal inflammation- closed
- Clean-contaminated wounds - surgical wounds
- Contaminated wounds - open, fresh, accidental wounds and surgical wounds involving a major break in sterile technique; show evidence of inflammation.
- Dirty/ infected wounds - contain dead tissue with evidence of a clinical infection e.g purulent drainage.

\section*{Classification of wounds by cause}
- intentional
- involves a wound that is the result of planned therapy
- unintentional
- involves a wound that is the result of unexpected trauma
- by status of skin integrity
- open
- involves a break in skin integrity or mucous membrane
- closed
- involves no break in skin integrity or mucous membrane
- by severity of injury
- superficial
- involves only the epidermal layer of skin
- penetrating
- involves penetration of the epidermal and dermal layers of skin and deeper tissues or organs

\section*{Classification of wounds by cause}
- by degree of contamination
- clean
- uninfected wounds in which no inflammation is encountered and the respiratory, gastrointestinal, genital, and/or urinary tracts are not entered
- clean/contaminated
- uninfected wounds in which no inflammation is encountered but the respiratory, gastrointestinal, genital, and/or urinary tract have been entered
- contaminated
- open, traumatic wounds or surgical wounds involving a major break in sterile technique that show evidence of inflammation
- infected
- old, traumatic wounds containing dead tissue and wounds with evidence of a clinical infection (e.g., purulent drainage)

\section*{Classification of wounds by cause}
- by depth
- partial-thickness
- involves only the epidermal and dermal layers of skin
- full-thickness
- involves the epidermal and dermal layers of skin, subcutaneous tissue and, possibly, muscle and bone
- by descriptive qualities
- laceration
- involves tearing apart of tissues resulting in irregular wound edges
- abrasion
- involves scraping or rubbing the surface of the skin by friction
- contusion
- involves a blow from a blunt object resulting in swelling, discoloration, bruising, and/or eccymosis
- incision
- involves cutting the skin with a sharp instrument
- puncture
- involves penetration of the skin and, often, the underlying tissues by a sharp instrument

\section*{Types of wound drainage}
- serous exudate
- consists chiefly of serum derived from blood and serous membranes of the body
- sanguineous
- consists of serum and red blood cells
- purulent
- consists of serum and pus (leukocytes, liquefied living and dead bacteria, dead tissue debris)

\section*{Wound healing}
- Types of wound healing
- primay intention healing
- Secondary intention
- Phases of wound healing
- Inflammatory
- Proliferative
- Maturation
- Complications of wound healing
- Haemorrhage
- Infection
- Dehiscence with possible evisceration

\section*{Factors affecting wound healing}
- Developmental considerations
- Nutrition
- Lifestyle
- Medications e.g anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin

\section*{Dressing wounds}

Purposes
- Protect the wound from mechanical injury
- Protect wound from microbial contamination
- Provide/ maintain high humidity of the wound
- Provide thermal insulation
- Absorb drainage or debride a wound or both
- Prevent haemorrhage
- Splint or immobilize the wound site thereby facilitate healing and prevent injury.

\section*{Types of dressings}
- type of dressing used depends on:
- the location, size, and type of the wound
- the amount of exudate
- whether the wound requires debridement, is infected, or has sinus tracts
- frequency of dressing change, ease or difficulty of dressing application, and cost

\section*{Dressing Materials}
- The best material to use for dressings is plain cotton gauze.
- Usually, all that is needed is just enough gauze to cover the wound lightly; multiple layers are unnecessary and wasteful.

\section*{Dressing solutions}
- Betadine
- Normal saline
- Ointments - silver sulphadiazine, Bacitracin

\section*{Types of dressings}

\section*{Wet-to-Dry}
- Indication
- The objective of the wet-to-dry dressing technique is to clean a wound or to prevent build-up of exudate. It is called a "wet-to-dry" dressing because you place a moist dressing on the wound and allow it to dry.
- When the dressing is removed, it takes with it the exudate, debris, and nonviable tissue that have become stuck to the gauze.
- Wet-to-dry dressings are indicated for wounds that are dirty or infected.

\section*{Types of dressings}

\section*{Technique}
- Moisten a gauze dressing with solution, and squeeze out the excess fluid. The gauze should be damp, not soaking wet.
- Completely open the gauze (it usually comes folded), and place it on the wound. You do not need many layers. Then cover with a thin layer of dry gauze.

\section*{Types of dressings}
- Optimally, a wet-to-dry dressing should be changed 3-4 times/day, depending on how much debridement is needed.
- The dressing should be changed more frequently for a dirty wound than for a clean wound.

\section*{Types of dressings}

Wet-to-Wet
Indication
- A wet-to-wet dressing does not debride the wound, which remains as it is. The dressing remains wet so that when the gauze is removed, the top layers of the healing wound are not removed with it.
- This dressing should be used on clean, granulating wounds with no overlying exudate in need of removal.

\section*{Types of dressings}

Technique
- Moisten the gauze dressing with solution. It should not be soaking wet, but it should be a little wetter than damp. Unfold the gauze, place it over the wound, and then cover with dry gauze.
- The dressing should still be wet or damp when it is changed. If the bottom layer of gauze has dried out, saturate the gauze with saline or water before removal.
How Often?
- The wet-to-wet dressing should be changed at least twice a day to prevent drying.

\section*{Types of dressings}

\section*{Antibiotic Ointment}

Indication
- Antiobiotic ointment may be used as an alternative to wet-to-wet dressings for a clean wound that is healing well and has no need for debridement.
Technique
- Coat the wound with a small amount of ointment. A thick layer of antibiotic ointment over the wound offers no advantage and wastes supplies.
- Cover with a dry gauze if the wound is large or if it is in an area that will be covered with bed clothing or rubbed by clothing. Otherwise the wound can be left open to air with the antibiotic ointment alone.
How Often?
- Remove the old ointment with gentle soap and water or saline, and reapply the ointment once or twice a day.

\section*{When to do which dressing}

Remember, the goal is to promote healing. We know that a moist environment facilitates healing.
- For a clean wound, it is best to use a wet-to-wet or ointment based dressing
- For a wound in need of debridement the wet-to-dry technique should be done until the wound is clean and then change to a different dressing regimen.
- For a wound covered with necrotic tissue, dressings cannot take the place of mechanical debridement. When present, necrotic tissue must be sharply debrided and then the wound treated with appropriate dressings.

\section*{Sterile Technique vs. Clean Technique}
- Sterile technique uses instruments and supplies that have been specifically treated so that no bacterial or viral particles are present on their surfaces. Examples of sterilized supplies include instruments that havebeen autoclaved (subjected to high temperatures to kill microorganisms) and gauze and gloves that have been especially prepared at the factory and are individually packaged. Procedures in an operating room are usually done with sterile technique.
- Gauze usually comes folded into a square. For dressings, it is best to open the gauze so that a single layer is in contact with the open wound.

\section*{Sterile Technique vs. Clean Technique}
- Clean technique uses instruments and supplies that are not as thoroughly treated to rid surfaces of all microorganisms. Nonsterile gloves and gauze, which come many in a package, are examples of "clean" supplies. Clean supplies are less expensive than sterile supplies. Hence, appropriate use of clean techniques can save valuable resources.

\section*{Cleansing the wound}
- All wounds should be thoroughly cleansed to allow full examination and subsequent closure. This will remove all loose particulate matter and decrease bacterial content. Remember, this can be painful, so whenever possible start by injecting local anesthetic around the wound.

\section*{Wound cleansing}
- Requires the application of fluid to clean the wound and optimise the healing environment.
The goal of wound cleansing is to:
- Remove visible debris and devitalised tissue
- Remove dressing residue
- Remove excessive or dry crusting exudates

\section*{Wound cleansing}

Principles:
Wound cleansing should not be undertaken to remove 'normal' exudate
- Cleansing should be performed in a way that minimises trauma to the wound
- Wounds are best cleansed with sterile isotonic saline or water
- The less we disturb a wound during dressing changes the lower the interference to healing
- Fluids should be warmed to $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to support cellular activity

\section*{Wound cleansing}
- Skin and wound cleansers should have a neutral pH and be non-toxic
- Avoid alkaline soap on intact skin as the skin pH is altered, resistance to bacteria decreases
- Avoid delipidising agents as alcohol or acetone as tissue is degraded
- Antiseptics are not routinely recommended for cleansing and should only be used sparingly for infected wounds

\section*{Wound cleansing}

Method:
- Irrigation is the preferred method for cleansing open wounds. This may be carried out utilising a syringe in order to produce gentle pressure - in order to loosen debris. Gauze swabs and cotton wool should be used with caution as can cause mechanical damage to new tissue and the shedding of fibres from gauze swabs/cotton wool delays healing.

\section*{Choice of dressing}
- A wound will require different management and treatment at various stages of healing. No dressing is suitable for all wounds; therefore frequent assessment of the wound is required. Considerations when choosing dressing products -
- Maintain a moist environment at the wound/dressing interface
- Be able to control (remove) excess exudates. A moist wound environment is good, a wet environment is not beneficial
- Not stick to the wound, shed fibres or cause trauma to the wound or surrounding tissue on removal

\section*{Choice of dressing}
- Protect the wound from the outside environment bacterial barrier
- Good adhesion to skin
- Sterile
- Aid debridement if there is necrotic or sloughy tissue in the wound (caution with ischaemic lesions)
- Keep the wound close to normal body temperature
- Conformable to body parts and doesn't interfere with body function
- Be cost-effective
- Diabetes - choose dressings which allow frequent inspection
- Non-flammable and non-toxic

ASEPSIS

\section*{Definitions}
- Asepsis is the state of being free from diseasecausing contaminants (such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) or, preventing contact with microorganisms
- Aseptic technique is a general term involving practices that minimize the introduction of microorganisms to patients during patient care.
- There are two categories of asepsis; general asepsis which applies to patient care procedures outside the operating theatre and surgical asepsis relating to procedures/processes designed to prevent surgical site infection.

\section*{Definitions}
- 'A clean technique is a modified aseptic technique and aims to avoid introducing micro-organisms to a susceptible site and also to prevent crossinfection to patients and staff' (Royal Marsden Manual).
- It differs from an aseptic technique, as the use of sterile equipment and the environment are not as crucial as would be required for asepsis.
- Infection is the 'invasion and multiplication of micro-organisms within tissue, which then results in destruction of the tissue' (ICNA 2003). It is part of a chain of events that can occur within the healthcare setting.

\section*{Aims of an Aseptic Technique}
- Aseptic techniques are used to reduce the risk of post-procedure infections and to minimize the exposure of health care providers to potentially infectious microorganisms.
- To prevent the introduction of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms into susceptible sites such as wounds or the bladder.
- To prevent the transfer of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms from one patient to another.
- To prevent staff from acquiring an infection from the patient.
