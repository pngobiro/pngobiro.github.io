\section*{Indications}
- Paralysed patients
- Obese patients
- Emaciated patients
- Incontinent patients
- Unconscious patients
- Very ill patients who are unable to turn themselves

\section*{Method}
- Wash each area, massage well with the palm of your hand using soap.
- Rinse each area, dry it and apply powder, cream or vaseline depending on the patient's need.
- If needed, patient may be seated on an air ring or soft pillow to relieve pressure

\section*{PRESSURE ULCERS}
- A pressure ulcer is any lesion caused by unrelieved pressure that results in damage to underlying tissue (U.S Public Health service's panel for the prediction and prevention of pressure ulcers in Adults \{PPPPA\}, 1992)
- Also known as decubitus ulcers, pressure sores or bed sores.

\section*{Pressure ulcer (Decubitus ulcer)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_229c21f01fc3d025e5a2g-006.jpg?height=1369&width=1703&top_left_y=387&top_left_x=408)

\section*{Etiology of pressure ulcers}
- Occur due to localized ischaemia.
- When blood cannot reach the tissues, the cells are deprived of oxygen and nutrients. The waste products of metabolism accumulate in the cells and the tissue consequently dies.
- Prolonged, unrelieved pressure also damages the small blood vessels.

\section*{Risk factors}
- Immobility - reduction in the amount and control of movement a person has e.g due to paralysis, weakness, pain
- Inadequate nutrition causes weight loss, muscle atrophy and loss of subcutaneous tissue
- Feacal and urinary incontinence - moisture promotes skin maceration
- Decreased mental status - e.g unconscious or heavily sedated

\section*{Risk factors}
- Diminished sensation - paralysis, stroke
- Excessive body heat - elevated body temperature increases the metabolic rate thus increasing the cells' need for oxygen
- Advanced age - brings several changes in the skin
- Chronic medical conditions e.g DM
- Other factors - poor lifting techniques, incorrect positioning, repeated injections on the same site, hard support surfaces, incorrect application of pressure - relieving devices

- Two hourly turning of bed - ridden patients

MOUTH CARE

\section*{Causes of poor oral hygiene}
- Inability to carry out oral care, e.g due to stroke, arthritis, arm injury, head injury, surgery;
- Lack knowledge or motivation;
- Lack of access to dental services;
- Lack of money to afford equipment for oral care;
- Poor diet or reduced fluid intake;(not drinking enough)
- If the patient is nil by mouth due to surgery or has swallowing problems.
- Some medications such as anticholinergic drugs and oxygen therapy can cause a dry mouth or an unpleasant taste in the mouth (Major, 2005).

\section*{Mouth care}

Purpose
- To remove food particles from around and between the teeth
- To remove dental plaque to prevent dental caries
- To increase appetite
- To enhance the client's feelings of well-being
- To prevent sores and infections of the oral tissue
- To prevent bad odor or halitosis

\section*{Benefits of oral hygiene}
- Promote self-esteem and comfort;
- Improve appetite and enjoyment of food and drink, as poor oral hygiene can affect taste;
- Improve social acceptability and social interaction by preventing halitosis.

\section*{Mouth care}

\section*{Procedure for oral assessment}
- Gain consent.
- Wash hands.
- Wear gloves and apron.
- Maintain privacy as required. Assess the oral cavity using an appropriate assessment tool. You may need a tongue depressor and a torch to carry out the assessment efficiently.

\section*{Purpose}
- To provide a baseline, initial information about the condition of the patient's oral cavity.
- To monitor progress of oral care/treatments.
- To identify any new problems (Dougherty and Lister, 2008).

\section*{Mouth care}

Equipment Required:
- Torch
- Toothbrush and paste
- Tongue depressor
- Cotton tipped applicator, padded applicator
- Vaseline (if necessary)
- Kidney dish
- Suction equipment (if appropriate)
- Clean procedure gloves
- Tissues or wipes

\section*{Mouth care}

\section*{Procedure for mouth care}
- Gain consent
- Assemble equipment - soft toothbrush, toothpaste, clothing protection, receiver, glass of water for rinsing mouth, tissues;
- Ask the patient to get into an upright position if possible or assist them to do this. (If the patient needs to lie flat special care must be taken to avoid choking. The procedure should be undertaken with the patient's head turned to the side, and suction equipment should be to hand);

\section*{Mouth care}
- Wet the toothbrush head and apply a small amount of toothpaste only. Use a gentle, rotational movement to clean the inner, outer and biting surfaces of the teeth. You may also gently brush the surface of the tongue and the gums;
- If the patient cannot tolerate the use of a toothbrush (e.g due to mouth tenderness) foam sticks and mouthwash can be used instead (Dougherty and Lister, 2008);
- Allow the patient to take mouthfuls of water, rinse the mouth and spit into the receiver. Use tissues to dry around the mouth;
- Apply moisturizer to the patient's lips if required.

\section*{Mouth care for unconscious patient}

\section*{$\square$ Position}
- Side lying with the head of the bed lowered, the saliva automatically runs out by gravity rather than being aspirated by the lungs or if patient's head can not be lowered, turn it to one side: the fluid will readily run out of the mouth, where it can be suctioned
- Rinse the patient's mouth by drawing about 10 ml of water or mouth wash in to the syringe and injecting it gently in to each side of the mouth
- If injected with force, some of it may flow down the clients throat and be aspirated into the lung
- All the rinse solution should return; if not suction the fluid to prevent aspiration

\section*{Denture care}
- Gain consent
- Assemble equipment - gloves and apron, a denture brush or toothbrush, and denture cleaner or toothpaste denture products are preferable if available as they preserve the condition of the dentures compared with toothpaste (Major, 2005);
- Assess the oral cavity as above;
- Remove dentures and partial dentures from the oral cavity;
- Clean at a sink;
- Pat dry and rinse with cold water before repositioning in patient's mouth (Hickson 2008
- Dentures may be soaked occasionally - use specific soaking solution and follow manufacturer's instructions. Always use a dedicated denture container, carefully labelled with the patient's details.

\section*{BODY}

MECHANICS AND MOBILITY

\section*{BODY MECHANICS AND MOBILITY}

Body Mechanics: is the effort; coordinated, and safe use of the body to produce motion and maintain balance during activity.
Proper Body Mechanics
- Use of safest and most efficient methods of moving and lifting is called body mechanics. This means applying mechanical principles of movements to the human body.

\section*{Basic Principles of body mechanics}
1. It is easier to pull, push, or roll an object than to lift it. The movement should be smooth and continuous, rather than jerky.
2. Often less energy or force is required to keep an object moving than it is to start and stop it.
3. It takes less effort to lift an object if the nurse works as close to it as possible. Use the strong leg and arm muscles as much as possible. Use back muscles, which are not as strong, as little as possible. Avoid reaching.
4. The nurse rocks backward or forward on the feet and with his or her body as a force for pulling or pushing.

\section*{Basic Principles of body mechanics}
5. Plan the move or transfer carefully. Free the surrounding area of obstacles and move the required equipment near the head or foot of the bed.
6. Obtain assistance of other people or use mechanical devices
7. Adjust the working area to waist level and keep the body close to the area, elevate adjustable beds.
8. Always face the direction of the movement
9. Start any body movement with proper alignment

\section*{Basic Principles of body mechanics}
10. Before moving an object, increase stability by widening your stance and flexing your knees, hips and ankles.
11. Avoid working against gravity. Push, pull, roll or turn objects instead of lifting them.
12. Use your gluteal and leg muscles rather than sacrospinal muscles of the back to exert an upward thrust when lifting
13. When pushing an object, enlarge the foot of support by moving the front foot forward.
14. When moving objects, hold them as close as possible to your centre of gravity. The person's center of gravity located in the pelvic area.

\section*{Body Mechanics Safety Precautions}
- Using specific methods to lift large weights without injury
- Safety Precautions
- Use legs, not back to lift
- Largest bone/muscle group
- Keep weight close to body
- Shifts center of gravity to patient
- More leverage
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_229c21f01fc3d025e5a2g-062.jpg?height=712&width=887&top_left_y=888&top_left_x=1288)

LIFTING
PATIENTS

\section*{Lifting consideration}
- Consider the weight of object/ patient.
- Communicate with partner.
- Identify the need for help before lifting.
- Have a plan

\section*{Guidelines for Safe Lifting}
1. Consider the weight of the patient together with the weight of the stretcher or other equipment being carried and determine if additional help is needed.
2. Know your physical ability and limitations. Know your combined ability with your partner. If absolutely necessary, you can ask bystanders to help.
3. Lift without twisting. Avoid any kind of swinging motion when lifting as well.

\section*{Guidelines for Safe Lifting}
4. Position your feet shoulder width apart with one foot slightly in front of the other.
5. Communicate clearly and frequently with your partner. Decide ahead of time how you will move the patient and what verbal commands will be used. Also, tell the patient what you will be doing ahead of time. A startled patient may reach out or grab something and cause a loss of balance.

\section*{Guidelines for Carrying Patients}
- Whenever possible, move patients on devices that can be rolled.
- Minimize the distance needed to carry patients
- Work in a coordinated manner with your partner.
- Keep the weight as close to your body as possible.
- Keep your back in a locked-in position and refrain from twisting.
- Flex at the hips, NOT the waist, and bend at the knees.
- Do not hyperextend your back (do not lean back from the waist).
- Try to lift with a partner that has similar height and strength.

\section*{Steps of proper lifting}
- Let your legs do the work
- Pick the object up, from between your knees. Keep the load close to your body and then stand up, using your leg muscles. Keep your back as straight as possible and tighten your abdominal muscles as you rise from the floor
- Avoid twisting
- When you're standing and ready to move, hold the load close to your body to lessen the strain on your lower back. Avoid turning or twisting while holding the load. Turn by pivoting your feet, not your back. Avoid lifting heavy loads above your waist

\section*{Equipment for Moving Patients}

\section*{Wheeled Stretcher}
- Stretchers are usually adjustable to different heights and different angles. Some can be adjusted to elevate the legs (Trendelenberg position). Additional equipment may be attached to the stretchers including oxygen, IV lines, and cardiac monitors or defibrillators.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_229c21f01fc3d025e5a2g-070.jpg?height=1280&width=942&top_left_y=221&top_left_x=74)

Gridelines for transferring a patient by stretcher:
- Push the stretcher with the patient's feet forward.
- Pull ithead-first into levators.
- Pulliteet-first down ramps.
- Never leave a patient on astretcher unatented.

\section*{SAFETY MEASURES WITH WHEELCHAIRS}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_229c21f01fc3d025e5a2g-071.jpg?height=1490&width=2348&top_left_y=282&top_left_x=44)

\section*{Transferring a Patient Between Chair and Bed}

Your patients may need to be transferred between the bed and a chair or wheelchair. Remember the following points:
- The patient should wear footwear with nonskid soles to avoid slipping.
- Always get help if the patient is unable to assist or is very heavy. Encourage the patient to help, however, whenever possible.
- If you are moving a patient to a vinyl-covered chair, cover the seat and back with a bath blanket. This will make the patient more comfortable by absorbing perspiration. Placing a pillow on the seat will serve the same purpose.
- Determine if the patient has a weaker side. If so, allow the patient to lead with the strong side. Make sure the patient can see the chair or bed that you are transferring to.
- DO NOT ALLOW THE PERSON TO PUT HIS ARMS AROUND YOUR NECK
- MAKE SURE YOU LOCK THE WHEELS ON THE BED AND WHEELCHAIR

ASSISTING THE PATIENT TO TRANSFER

\section*{PROPER POSITIONING IN}

\section*{THE PATIENT INA CAIRFAY JSIT UP STRAIGHT}

THE BACKS OF HIS KNEES SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM THE SEAT OF THE CHAIR

HIS FEET SHOULD EITHER REST ON THE FLOOR OR ON A STOOL

HIS LOWER BACK SHOULD REST AGAINST THE BACK OF THE CHAIR

\section*{WHEELCHAIRS:}
- A. Make sure the chair is locked when removing or seating the person.
- B. Pull the wheelchair backwards up steps or curbs.
- C. Adjust the height of the foot pedals so the person is sitting at a 90 degree angle at the hip and knee.

\section*{Modes of Lifting patients}
- Through arm wrist crossed over grip
- Thumb through grip
- Shoulder blade grip

\section*{ASSISTING A PATIENT TO MOVE UP IN BED}

\section*{Patient mobility}

Assistive Devices
Clients who are unable to ambulate independently can use devices designed to help them walk safely.
Determination of which device to use is based on:
- Upper arm strength
- Endurance (stamina)
- Presence or absence of one-sided weakness
- Weight-bearing ability

TURNING
PATIENTS

\section*{Reasons for turning frequently}
- Provides exercise for muscles
- Stimulates circulation
- Helps prevent decubitis ulcers and contractures
- Provides comfort to the patient

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}

\section*{General Principles for Turning the Adult Patient.}
- Sometimes the physician will specify how often to turn a patient.
- A schedule can be set up for turning the adult patient throughout his "awake" hours.
- The patient should be rotated through four positions (unless a particular position is contraindicated)
- Record the position change each time to ensure that all positions are used.

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}

One example of a schedule for turning would be:
- 10 a.m Prone position
- 12 p.m. Left Sim's position
- 2 p.m Supine position
- 4 p.m. Right Sim's position
- 6 p.m. Prone position

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}

Certain conditions may make it impossible to turn the patient.
- Turning may be impossible if the patient has fractures that require traction appliances.
- Turning may be harmful to patients with spinal injuries.
In these cases, you need to rub the back by lifting the patient slightly off the bed and massaging with your hand held flat.

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}

\section*{Logrolling}
- Logrolling is a technique used to turn a patient whose body must at all times be kept in a straight alignment (like a log).
- This technique is used for the patient who has a spinal injury.
- Logrolling is used for the patient who must be turned in one movement, without twisting.
- Logrolling requires two people, or if the patient is large, three people.

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_229c21f01fc3d025e5a2g-087.jpg?height=1229&width=1691&top_left_y=425&top_left_x=261)

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}

\section*{Technique.}
- Wash your hands.
- Approach and identify the patient (by checking the identification band) and explain the procedure (using simple terms and pointing out the benefits).
- Provide privacy.
- Position the bed.
- The bed should be in the flat position at a comfortable working height.
- Lower the side rail on the side of the body at which you are working. Position yourself with your feet apart and your knees flexed close to the side of the bed.
- Fold the patient's arms across his chest.

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}
- Place your arms under the patient so that a major portion of the patient's weight is centered between your arms. The arm of one nurse should support the patient's head and neck.
- On the count of three, move the patient to the side of the bed, rocking backward on your heels and keeping the patient's body in correct alignment.
- Raise the side rail on that side of the bed.
- Move to the other side of the bed.
- Place a pillow under the patient's head and another between his legs.
- Position the patient's near arm toward you.

\section*{TURNING THE ADULT PATIENT}
- Grasp the far side of the patient's body with your hands evenly distributed from the shoulder to the thigh.
- On the count of three, roll the patient to a lateral position, rocking backward onto your heels.
- Place pillows in front of and behind the patient's trunk to support his alignment in the lateral position.
- Provide for the patient's comfort and safety.
- Position the call bell.
- Place personal items within reach.
- Be sure the side rails are up and secure.
- Report and record as appropriate.

\section*{TRANSFERS}
- Patients transferred to wheelchairs, chairs, and stretchers
- Correct procedures must be followed to prevent injury to both patient and worker

\section*{MECHANICAL LIFTS}
- Frequently used to transfer weak or paralyzed patients
- Check straps, clasps, and sling for any defects
- Use smooth even movements while operating lift
- Reassure frightened patients that lift is safe
- Move unnecessary furniture out of the way during transfers
- Particularly important in home care situations

VITAL
SIGNS

\section*{VITAL SIGNS}
- Vital or cardinal signs are temperature, pulse, respiration and blood pressure.
- Monitoring a client's vital signs should not be an automatic or a routine procedure; it should be a thoughtful, scientific assessment.
- When and how often to assess a specific client's vital signs are chiefly nursing judgments, depending on the client's health status.

\section*{VITAL SIGNS}
- Vital signs are objective measurements of the patient's most basic body function.
- A change in vital signs can be a strong indicator of a decline in the patient's health status.
- When a nurse observes a patient's abnormal vital signs, the nurse must precisely document the specific variation, such as fever, blood pressure spike, or depressed respiration, and also the specific action taken to address the condition.

\section*{VITAL SIGNS}
- Observation is "looking and listening to the subjective and objective information that the patient provides"
The vital role of nurses
- not just data collectors
- Interpreters of multiple and complex patient data gathered in context of the whole picture presented by the patient

\section*{TIME TO ASSESS VITAL SIGNS}
- On admission to provide a baseline which can be compared with subsequent measurements, thereby providing objective data and trends.
- When a client has a change in the health status or reports symptoms such as chest pain.
- Before and after surgery or an invasive procedure
- Before and/ or after administration of medication
- Before and after any nursing intervention that could affect the vital signs e.g ambulating a client who has been on bedrest.
