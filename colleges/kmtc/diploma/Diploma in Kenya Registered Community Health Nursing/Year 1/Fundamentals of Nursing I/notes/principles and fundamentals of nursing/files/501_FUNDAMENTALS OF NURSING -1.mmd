\section*{PAIN MANAGEMENT}

Examples of pharmacological pain relief include the following:
- analgesics (mild pain relievers)
- sedation (usually given by IV)
- anesthesia (usually given by IV)
- topical anesthetics (cream put on the skin to numb the area)
- pain relievers

\section*{INVASIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES}
- Injections-direct delivery of steroids or anesthetic to nerve, joint or epidural space.
- Prolotherapy-injection of solution to stimulate blood circulation and ligament repair at affected site.
- Surgically implanted electrotherapy devicesimplantable spinal cord stimulators (SCS) and implantable peripheral nerve stimulators.
- Implantable opioid infusion pumps-surgically implanted pumps that deliver opioid agents directly to affected nerve.
- Radiofrequency radioablation-deadening of painful nerve via heat produced by a specialized device. The efficacy of this treatment is mixed.

\section*{Non-pharmacological pain management}

Non-pharmacological pain management is the management of pain without medications. This method utilizes ways to alter thinking and focus to decrease pain.
Methods include the following:
- psychological -The unexpected is always worse because of what one imagines. Ways to accomplish this include:
- Explain each step of a procedure in detail, utilizing simple pictures or diagrams when available.
- Meet with the person who will perform the procedure and ask questions ahead of time.
- Tour the room where the procedure will take place.
- may observe a videotape, which describes the procedure

\section*{Non-pharmacological pain management}
- hypnosis

With hypnosis, a professional (such as a psychologist or physician) guides the child into an altered state of consciousness that helps him/her to focus or narrow their attention, in order to reduce discomfort.
- imagery

Guiding a child through an imaginary mental image of sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and feelings can often help shift attention away from the pain.

\section*{Non-pharmacological pain management}
- distraction

Distraction can be helpful particularly for babies, by using colorful, moving objects. Singing songs, telling stories, or looking at books or videos can distract preschoolers. Older children find watching TV or listening to music helpful. Distraction should not be a substitute for explaining what to expect.
- relaxation

Children can be guided through relaxation exercises such as deep breathing and stretching, to reduce discomfort.

\section*{Non-pharmacological pain management}
- Exercise-physical exertion with the aim of training or improvement. Includes the McKenzie method, water therapy, flexion exercises, aerobic routines. Exercise is necessary for proper cardiovascular health, disc nutrition, and musculoskeletal health.
- Manual techniques-manipulation of affected areas by means of chiropractic adjustments, osteopathy, massage therapy and other techniques.

\section*{Non-pharmacological pain management}
- Behavioral modification-use of behavioral methods to optimize patient responses to back pain and painful stimuli. Cognitive therapy involves teaching the patient to alleviate back pain by means of relaxation techniques, coping techniques, and other methods.
- Cutaneous stimulation -superficial heating or cooling of skin. These pain management methods include cold packs and hot packs, and should be used in conjunction with exercise.
- Electrotherapy -the most commonly known form of electrotherapy is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). TENS therapy attempts to reduce back pain by means of a low-voltage electric stimulation that interacts with the sensory nervous system.

\section*{Interventions/Rationales}
1. Assess the client's level of pain, determining the intensity at its best and worst Determines a baseline for future assessment.
2. Listen to the client while she discusses the pain; acknowledge the presence of pain Acknowledging the client's pain decreases anxiety by communicating acceptance and validating the client's perceptions.
3. Discuss reasons why pain may be increased or decreased - Helps the client determine a cause-and-effect relationship between pain and specific activities.

\section*{Interventions/Rationales}
4. Teach relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and imagery - Reduces skeletal muscle tension and anxiety, which potentiates the perception of pain.
5. Teach the client and family about treatment approaches (biofeedback, hypnosis, massage therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture, and exercise). - Makes the client and family aware of the availability of treatment options.

\section*{Interventions/Rationales}
6. Teach the client about the use of medication for pain relief. Provide accurate information to reduce fear of addiction. - Lack of knowledge and fear may prohibit client from taking analgesic medications as prescribed.
7. Encourage the client to rest at intervals during the day.- Fatigue increases the perception of pain.
8. Explain the relationship between chronic pain and depression. - Knowledge decreases anxiety.

\section*{DRUG ADMINISTRA TION}

\section*{DRUG ADMINISTRATION}
- The administration of medications is controlled by three Acts of Parliament - the Medicines Act (1968), the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) and the Poisons Act (1972) - and a Statutory Instrument - the Misuse of Drugs Regulations (1985). These provide the framework within which medicines are stored, transported, prescribed, recorded, dispensed and administered.
- The British National Formulary (BNF) provides a summary of the key legal issues for health care practitioners.

\section*{DRUG ADMINISTRATION}
- The nurse should always assess a client's health status and obtain a medication history prior to giving any medication.
- The extent of assessment depends on the client's illness or current condition, the intended drug and route of administration.
During drug administration, as a nurse you should:
- knowledge of the drug
- know its effects and potential side effects
- know the patient's condition
- assess the suitability for that medication at that given time.

\section*{DRUG ADMINISTRATION}

The A-F of safe practice
- To ensure safe administration, some principles of safe practice can be considered.
- Accurate prescription
- Best information
- Correct dispensing
- Deliberation before administration
- Effective systems
- Fail-safe policies.

\section*{Practice guidelines}
- Nurses who administer medications are responsible for their own actions.
- Be knowledgeable
- Keep narcotics and barbiturates in a locked place
- Use only medications that are in a clearly labeled container
- Calculate drug dosages accurately
- Administer only medications that are personally prepared
- Identify the client correctly before drug administration
- Do not leave medications on the bedside with certain exceptions e.g cough syrup
- Take special precautions when administering certain medications e.g insulin
- Incase of a medication error, report immediately.

\section*{Stages of the medication process}

There are five stages of the medication process:
(a)ordering/prescribing,
(b)transcribing and verifying,
(c)dispensing and delivering,
(d)administering, and
(e)monitoring and reporting.

\section*{Rights of Medication Administration}
1. Right patient
- Check the name on the order and the patient.
- Use 2 identifiers.
- Ask patient to identify himself/herself.
2. Right medication
- Check the medication label.
- Check the order.
3. Right dose
- Check the order.
- Confirm appropriateness of the dose using a current drug reference.
- If necessary, calculate the dose and have another nurse calculate the dose as well.

\section*{Rights of Medication Administration}

\section*{4. Right route}
- Again, check the order and appropriateness of the route ordered.
- Confirm that the patient can take or receive the medication by the ordered route.

\section*{5. Right time}
- Check the frequency of the ordered medication.
- Double-check that you are giving the ordered dose at the correct time.
- Confirm when the last dose was given.

\section*{6. Right documentation}
- Document administration AFTER giving the ordered medication.
- Chart the time, route, and any other specific information as necessary.

\section*{Rights of Medication Administration}

\section*{7. Right reason}
- Confirm the rationale for the ordered medication. What is the patient's history? Why is he/she taking this medication?
- Revisit the reasons for long-term medication use.
8. Right response
- Make sure that the drug led to the desired effect. If an antihypertensive was given, has his/her blood pressure improved?
- Be sure to document your monitoring of the patient and any other nursing interventions that are applicable.

Reference: Nursing2012 Drug Handbook. (2012). Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

\section*{Calculating drug doses}
- Example: a prescription requires 30 mg of a drug that is dispensed as
- 60 mg in 5 ml

What you want: $30 \mathrm{mg} \times$ total volume:
What you've got: 60 mg
$5 \mathrm{ml}=\frac{30}{60} \times 5=2.5 \mathrm{ml}$ required

\section*{Routes of drug administration}
- A route of drug administration is the path by which a drug or other substance is brought into contact with the body. Drugs are introduced into the body by several routes. When administering a drug, the nurse should ensure that the pharmaceutical preparation is appropriate for the route specified.

\section*{PARENTERAL}

The term parenteral administration implies the routes through which the drug directly reaches the body fluids, by passing the preliminary process of transport through the intestinal wall or pulmonary alveoli which is an essential process when drugs are taken orally, inhaled or administered reactally. Following are the Parenteral routes

\section*{Techniques for Administering Drugs}
- Parenteral drug packaging
- Ampule - glass or plastic container that is sealed and sterile (open with care)
- Vial - small bottle with rubber diaphragm that can be punctured by needle

\section*{Ampules and Vials}

a) Subcutaneous (S/C)
b) Intramuscular (I/M)
c) Intravenous (I/V)
d) Intraperitoneal (I/P)
e) Intradermal
f) Intra Medullary
g) Intrathecal
h) Intraarticular
i) Intra-cardiac
j) Intra arterial

The Parenteral administration has certain advantages over oral route.
i) Drug is neither invaded nor destroyed by digestive enzymes.
ii) A higher concentration of drug in blood may be achieved because the hepatic metabolism of drug due to First-Pass effect is avoided.
iii) Absorption is complete and predictable.
iv) In emergency this method is particularly useful. If the patient is unconscious, uncooperative or vomiting, the Parenteral therapy becomes necessary.
However, there are certain disadvantages of the parenteral therapy which are as under:
i) It is expensive because all the parenteral preparations should be
ii) Asepsis must be maintained to avoid infection.
iii) An intravascular injection may accidentally occur when it is not actually intended.
iv) Pain may accompany or follow the injection.
v) It requires the services of a professionally skilled personnel because it is difficult for the patient to perform the injection himself.

\section*{Types of Oral Medication}
1. Lozenges - sweet medicinal tablet containing sugar that dissolve in the mouth so that the medication is applied to the mouth and throat
2. Tablets - a small disc or flat round piece of dry drug containing one or more drugs made by compressing a powdered form of drug(s)
3. Capsules - small hollow digestible case usually made of gelatin, filled with a drug to be swallowed by the patient.
4. Syrups - sugar containing medicine dissolved in water
5. Tinctures - medicinal substances dissolved in water
6. Suspensions - liquid medication with undissolved solid particles in it.
7. Pills and gargle - a small ball of variable size, shape and color some times coated with sugar that contains one or more medicinal substances in solid form taken in mouth.
8. Effervescence - drugs given of small bubbles of gas.
9. Gargle - mildly antiseptic solution used to clean the mouth or throat.
10. Powder - a medicinal preparation consisting of a mixture of two or more drugs in the form of fine particles.

\section*{Medication administration}
- Do NOT use Kardex to medicate
- Report any unexpected reactions, medication error, error in preparation by pharmacist
- Observe the 8 rights
- Document and report adverse reactions

\section*{Administering oral medication}

\section*{Equipment}
- stock and specific personal prescription drugs - ensure adequate supplies, within expiry date
- medicine pots - to dispense individual medication
- disposable cups - to provide a drink to assist easy swallowing of medication, or to dissolve tablets if necessary
- water jug, freshly filled, to ensure water is easily available
- straws - some patients find it easier to take unpalatable medicine through a straw, and a straw may help a patient with swallowing difficulties to wash tablets down more easily
- teaspoons or medicine spoons - to put tablets into a patient's mouth without contaminating the medication

\section*{Administering oral medication}
- pestle and mortar - to crush tablets if necessary (NB: check with pharmacist that a liquid form is not available, and that the tablet is suitable to be crushed)
- tablet file or cutter or knife - to divide a tablet evenly (NB: check with pharmacist that smaller doses are not available and that the tablet is suitable for cutting)
- note pad - to keep a record of actions that are to be taken as a result of medication, e.g. re-ordering medication or discharge drugs, or returning to check BP or peak expiratory flow
- drug reference book, e.g. BNF - to check unfamiliar doses or drugs.

\section*{Administering oral medication}

\section*{Procedure}
- Wash and dry hands.
- Consult the patient's prescription sheet. For regular drug administration times, work systematically from the front page of the prescription sheet to identify the following issues:
- Has the patient any known allergies?
- What medication is due, e.g. regular doses? When was it last given?
- Once-only prescriptions, such as pre-medications: when are they due, or have they been given?
-Variable doses - these may need to be updated as a result of blood tests; therefore, are they current? Check date.
- Is analgesia required? If so, when was the last dose and was it effective?
- Progress of any current intravenous therapy - if a patient has an intravenous infusion in place, then it is an ideal opportunity to check (a) that it is running to time and (b) sufficient is prescribed for the patient's needs over the next shift

\section*{Administering oral medication}
- Check each medication prescribed for dose, time, date, route and doctor's signature.
- Select the medicine bottle, checking the name of the drug with that on the prescription sheet. If the patient needs to have a pre- medication check of pulse, blood pressure or peak expiratory flow, now is the time to do that.
- Calculate the dose.
- Tip the required number of tablets into the lid of the container
- If working with another nurse, show the name of the container and the number of tablets to the other person, stating the written dose aloud.

\section*{Administering oral medication}
- Tip the dose into the pot. If measuring liquid: ensure the lid is on firmly and then shake the bottle to ensure the contents are well mixed. Put the pot on a level surface, pour the liquid into it, turning the bottle label away so that it does not get dripped on and obscured by medicine. Pour to the required level

\section*{Administering oral medication}
- Take the medication to the patient.
- Greet the patient by name and check identity against the prescription sheet label.
- Assist the patient into an upright position to aid swallowing.
- Ensure the patient understands the sequential order to take the medication; for example, antacids are taken after other tablets.
- Do not leave any medicines beside the bed to be taken later. They may get forgotten, knocked over, or consumed accidentally by someone else.

\section*{Administering oral medication}
- Document the drug dose and time. If the patient has refused the medication or is nil by mouth, record on the prescription sheet the reasons for withholding the dose according to the local policy code. Report to medical staff.
- Dispose of waste and used containers.
- Monitor the patient for effects such as degree of pain relief, or side effects such as nausea or rashes, and document as necessary.

\section*{Information on Drug Labels}
- Name of medication
- Expiration date
- Total dose and concentration

\section*{Intramuscular (IM) injections}
- Injections deliver medication directly into the body and are not retrievable.
- It is essential, therefore, to be accurate in identifying safe entry points for injections, and to take the utmost care in administering medication by the parenteral route.
- The intramuscular route delivers injections directly into muscles which have an efficient blood supply and can absorb from 1 ml to 5 ml of medication, depending on the site.

\section*{Considerations before administration by the IM route}
- The patient's age: elderly patients may have muscle wasting which may limit the choice of site, and babies who are not yet walking may have underdeveloped muscles, particularly in the buttocks.
- General physical status: emaciated or cachectic patients may also have muscle wasting or poor perfusion and skin condition. Oedematous limbs will not absorb medication as effectively as those with good perfusion.
- The drug therapy: the amount to be given, and the frequency and consistency of medication will influence the choice of location.

\section*{Assessment of appropriate site}
- There are five sites that may be used for IM injections: deltoid; dorsogluteal; ventro-gluteal; and the thigh muscles - vastus lateralis and rector femoris.

\section*{Locating deltoid site}
- The densest part of the muscle can be located on the mid-lateral aspect of the arm in line with the axilla, and about 2.5 cm below the acromial process.
- This avoids the radial nerve and brachial artery.
- The typical absorption volume is no greater than $1-2 \mathrm{ml}$.

\section*{Dorso-gluteal site}
- The patient should lie either on their side with knees slightly bent, or prone with toes pointing inwards .
- An imaginary line is drawn across from the cleft of the buttock to the greater trochanter of the femur. Then a vertical line is drawn midway across the first line, and the outer quadrant is identified. This quadrant is then divided into four quadrants: the desired location is the upper outer quadrant
- The aim is to access the gluteus maximus muscle, and to avoid the sciatic nerve and gluteal artery.
- The typical absorption volume is $2-4 \mathrm{ml}$.

\section*{Vastus lateralis and rector femoris}
- These quadriceps muscles are particularly good for toddlers or patients who have wasted muscles as they can be 'bunched up' before injecting
- They can be located by measuring a hand's breadth down from the greater trochanter, and a hand's breadth up from the knee, identifying the middle third of the muscle as the safe location
- The vastus lateralis is located on the side of the leg, and the rector femoris is at the front of the thigh.
- The typical absorption volume is $1-4 \mathrm{ml}$.

\section*{Intramuscular injection procedure}

\section*{Equipment}
- 2 ml or 5 ml syringe (depending on amount for injection).
- $2 \times 21$ (green) or 23 (blue) gauge needle.

Note: a large needle should be used for adults to ensure that it reaches the muscle layer. Short needles may result in the injection going into the adipose tissue, resulting in reduced effectiveness
- Alcohol wipe
- Gauze swab.
- Receiver.
- Prescribed drug and prescription sheet.
- Gloves - to protect from drug spillage and body fluids.
- Apron -for protection as above.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_6874479116161931500dg-068.jpg?height=1410&width=2383&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=113)

Intramuscular injection in deltoid and gluteal muscles

\section*{Preparing the injection}

This is an aseptic procedure and therefore all equipment should be sterile.
- Check all equipment to ensure it is sealed and used within expiry date.
- Wash hands and put on gloves.
- Prepare drug vial. Carry out the same checks as described in the procedure for oral drug administration .
If a glass ampoule is used, flick the top of the ampoule to encourage all fluid to drain into the reservoir. Use a tissue or piece of gauze to protect your fingers from glass cuts when breaking the top off the ampoule. If a vial with a rubber bung is being used, remove the cover using scissors or forceps to prevent injury to your fingers; clean the rubber bung with an alcohol wipe.

\section*{Preparing the injection}
- Assemble needle and syringe, taking care not to touch the needle, except for the barrel when connected to the syringe.
- Uncap the needle. It is best practice never to resheath an uncapped needle, even if unused, to prevent needlestick injuries.
- To dilute a drug - if the drug requires mixing with a diluent, or if you are drawing fluid from a closed vial draw up the equivalent amount of air into the syringe, steady the vial on a flat surface with one hand, and insert the syringe into the vial and inject the vial with the air. This will make it easier to withdraw. Ensure drug is dissolved before aspirating the medication into the syringe.

\section*{Preparing the injection}
- Withdraw required amount into the syringe. Remove the vial, and holding the syringe with the needle uppermost, tap the syringe firmly to encourage air bubbles to rise to the top to be expelled.
- Larger syringes may have the connection on the side, rather than the middle of the syringe. To aid the air to rise to the top, tip the syringe to a slight angle so that the air collects under the connection, and keep it at that angle until all the air is expelled.

\section*{Subcutaneous (SC) injections}
- Small amounts of medication (0.2-2 ml) are given into the subcutaneous tissue to allow a slow, sustained absorption of medication.
- It is an ideal route for insulin, which requires frequent injections, but is also used regularly for heparin. Preferred sites for self-administered SC injections are the outer upper arms, the upper thighs, and the lower abdomen around the umbilicus.
- Nurses can also use the back of the upper arms, outer thighs and upper buttocks but these are not accessible for self-administration.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_6874479116161931500dg-073.jpg?height=1327&width=1509&top_left_y=427&top_left_x=540)

\section*{Subcutaneous (SC) injections}

Equipment
- Insulin syringe or 1 ml syringe. If injecting insulin use an insulin syringe with a 25 or 27 gauge needle.
- $2 \times 25$ or 27 gauge needles (orange).
- Gauze swab.
- Receiver.
- Prescribed drug and prescription sheet.

\section*{Subcutaneous (SC) injections}

Preparing an insulin drug dose
- Preparing an insulin dose may require drawing up from more than one multi-dose vial. The following procedure explains how to do this, and allows you to draw up from an ampoule that has a vacuum in it. If the air were not injected first, it would be very difficult to withdraw insulin as the vacuum within the ampoule would draw in the contents of the syringe and cause mixing of the two different types.
- To prepare an injection from two multi-dose vials

\section*{Subcutaneous (SC) injections}
- Clean the rubber bung on both vials with an alcohol wipe.
- Draw air into the syringe to equal the volume of drug to be with- drawn from the first vial.
- With the first vial on a flat surface, insert the needle into the first vial. Do not touch the liquid with the needle, but inject the air and remove the needle.
- Draw air into the syringe to equal the volume of drug to be with drawn from the second vial, insert into the second vial, and inject the air. Then invert the vial and withdraw the required dose, tap to remove air bubbles and expel, and remove needle from vial.
- Return to first vial, clean rubber bung, insert needle, invert vial and withdraw required amount carefully. Remove needle and expel air, taking care not to lose any of the first drug.
- If necessary change the needle before administration. Some disposable insulin syringes have an integral needle which cannot be changed.

\section*{Administering Intradermal Injections:-}
1. Check physician's order
2. Prepare equipment:

Draw up 0.1 ml of the medication in a 1cc syringe - ones called a TB/tuberculin syringe.
Collect medication, procedure gloves, alcohol wipe, and cotton ball
3. Cleanse the site with an alcohol pad going
in a circular motion
4. Hold the skin taut
5. Hold the needle at a 15 degree angle to the skin with the bevel facing up.
6. Insert the needle through the skin, just below the epidermis into the dermis.
7. Inject the fluid, making a bubble just below the skin
8. Remove the needle
9. Dispose of used syringe and needle in a Sharps container

\section*{Rectal medication}
- Rectal medication bypasses the upper gastrointestinal tract, avoiding liver metabolism and therefore working quickly. It is suitable for patients who are unconscious, unable to swallow or are vomiting.
- Drugs given by suppository or enema can produce a local effect - e.g. to relieve constipation or treat local inflammation - or can work systemically - e.g. to provide pain relief.

\section*{Rectal medication}
- Before administering medications rectally you should check the anal area to ensure there are no signs of rectal bleeding, skin tags, recent anorectal surgery, undiagnosed abdominal pain or paralytic ileus.
- An unhurried and gentle approach should be taken to administering medication rectally, because the procedure can induce vagal stimulation resulting in bradycardia and vasodilation, and on rare occasions may cause the patient to collapse

\section*{Administering suppositories}

Equipment
- Tray.
- Prescribed suppositories - as per prescription
- Disposable gloves and apron.
- Lubricant
- Tissues or gauze swabs.
- Protective bed cover such as incontinence pad.
- Waste disposal bag.
- Easy access to toilet, bedpan or commode.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_6874479116161931500dg-089.jpg?height=600&width=1809&top_left_y=54&top_left_x=607)
- Used for gaseous and volatile agents and aerosols.
- solids and liquids are excluded if larger than 20 micron. the particles impact in the mouth and throat. Smaller than 0.5 micron , they aren't retained.
Advantages
A- Large surface area
B- thin membranes separate alveoli from circulation
C- high blood flow
- As result of that a rapid onset of action due to rapid access to circulation.

\section*{Metered dose inhaler}

\section*{6- Inhalation route (Cont.)}

1- Most addictive route of administration because it hits the brain so quickly.

2- Difficulties in regulating the exact amount of dosage.

3- Sometimes patient having difficulties in giving themselves a drug by inhaler.

\section*{Ophthalmic medication}
- Ophthalmic medication is usually applied topically, the most common methods being eye drops or ointment.
- These may be used for diagnostic purposes such as dilating the pupil prior to examination; anaesthetizing the eye prior to treatment, or for treatment of eye conditions such as glaucoma or infection.

\section*{Eye/ ear/ nasal drops}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_6874479116161931500dg-093.jpg?height=1309&width=1159&top_left_y=449&top_left_x=575)

\section*{Ophthalmic medication}
- Always use separately labelled drug containers for each eye to prevent cross-infection.
- If eye drops and ointment are prescribed to be administered at the same time, give the drops first, then administer ointment several minutes later, as the ointment can prevent absorption of the drops.
- Medication should not be directed onto the cornea of the eye as this may damage the cornea, but directed into the area in the lower eyelid

\section*{Ophthalmic medication}
- When clearing discharge from the eye or wiping away excess medication, do not use dry cotton-wool balls as fibres may get into the eye and damage the cornea.
- Always work from the inner canthus (nose side) outwards to edge of eye when applying ointment or swabbing eye to reduce infection risk.
- Medication containers should not touch the eye during administration as they may become contaminated or damage the eye.
- Once an eye medication has been opened, record the starting date on the container and discard after two weeks.
- If both eyes are to be treated but only one is discharging, treat the cleaner eye first to prevent cross-infection. Wash hands between eyes.

\section*{Administering eye medication}

Equipment
- Prescribed medication and prescription.
- Tissues or gauze swabs.
- Sterile saline solution and sterile eye dressing pack containing gallipot and sterile gauze (if eye requires cleansing prior to drug administration).
