\section*{Case Study}
- Mrs. Jones is a 32-year-old house wife, mother of two-yearold twin boys, who was admitted to the hospital yesterday with bilateral pneumonia.
- Vital signs: T-100.2 P-102 R-28 BP-110/60.
- IV D5 $1 / 4 \mathrm{NS}$ infusing at $100 \mathrm{cc} / \mathrm{hr}$.
- Appetite is poor; drinking only moderate amount of fluids.
- Auscultation of chest reveals bilateral crackles and wheezes.
- Frequent productive cough of thick yellow mucous.
- States she is very weak and tired because the cough has been keeping her awake at night and prevents her from sleeping in the daytime.
- States she gets "short of breath" with any activity.
- Her husband is home with the twins, and she is worried about him having to take care of the boys.
- Categorizing the data: all of the assessment data are related to physiologic needs except for the last one, which is related to selfesteem (role change).
- Nursing diagnoses are actual or potential problems, which the patient is experiencing or may experience that may be prevented, resolved, or reduced by nursing intervention. Nursing diagnoses describe human responses and alterations in the client's ability to function as an independent human being.
- In setting priorities, the first consideration is: Are any of the identified nursing diagnoses lifethreatening?
- The next step is to classify the diagnoses according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
- The patient's input is essential in prioritizing diagnoses and determining which problems should be addressed first.

\section*{Physiologic needs:}
1. Ineffective breathing pattern related to weakness and fatigue.
2. Ineffective airway clearance related to thick secretions.
3. Disturbed sleep pattern related to frequent cough.
4. Alteration in nutrition-less than body requirements related to loss of appetite.
5. Deficient fluid volume related to loss of appetite and insufficient oral intake.
6. Activity intolerance related to weakness and fatigue.

\section*{Self-esteem need:}
7. Anxiety related to change in role functioning associated with husband having to assume care of children.

Nursing Diagnosis 1: Ineffective breathing pattern related to weakness and fatigue.
Expected Outcome: The patient will experience adequate respiratory function within 48 hours as evidenced by:
a. Respiratory rate $12-18 \mathrm{~min}$.
b. Decreased dyspnea
c. Lungs clear to auscultation
d. No cyanosis
e. Clear mental status
f. Blood gases within normal limits

\section*{Nursing Actions:}
1. Assess and document vital signs including respiratory rate every four hours and prn.

3. Assess and document signs of hypoxia every four hours and prn (color, dyspnea).
4. Monitor blood gases as ordered, report abnormal results to physician.
5. Elevate head of bed 45 degrees as tolerated.
6. Instruct and assist patient to turn, cough, and deep breathe every 1-2 hours.
7. Encourage use of incentive spirometer every 1-2 hours.

\section*{Nursing Actions:}
8. Perform actions to promote removal of pulmonary secretions:
- Fluid intake of 2500-3000cc per day
- Humidify inspired air as ordered
- Assist with or perform chest physiotherapy as ordered
- Administer expectorants as ordered and monitor effects
9. Administer oxygen prn as ordered.
10. Provide psychosocial support and restful environment.
11. Notify physician if impaired breathing pattern persists or worsens.

\section*{Implementation of care}
- Prior to implementing the planned nursing interventions, the nurse should reassess the patient to determine if
- there have been any changes since the plan was formulated. The nurse must understand the rationale, technique,
- and possible effects of each nursing action.
- During delivery of care, patient safety is of utmost importance.

\section*{Evaluation: At the end of two days:}
- Normal skin turgor
- Mucous membranes are moist
- BP 11/60-144/64, P 68-72 R 18-20. No postural hypotension

Nursing Diagnosis: Disturbed sleep pattern related to frequent cough.
Expected Outcome: The patient will sleep as much as possible within the parameters of the treatment plan
during hospitalization as evidenced by:
a. The patient will sleep 3-4 hours at a time
b. The patient states she feels "rested"
c. No signs of sleep deprivation (difficulty concentrating, thick speech, irritability, inappropriate behavior.)
d. Decreased coughing episodes

Nursing Diagnosis: Alternation in nutritionless than body requirements related to loss of appetite.
Expected Outcome: The patient will resume an adequate nutritional intake prior to discharge as evidenced by:
a. No further weight loss while in the hospital
b. Patient eats three meals and two snacks per day
c. Patient states she feels hungry at mealtime
d. Patient states importance of nutritionally sound diet
- Henry, a 24 year old has been admitted in the surgical ward with acute abdominal pain. A diagnosis of acute appendicitis has been made. Henry is scheduled for surgery this afternoon. He is a college student. His parents are in the hospital with him and they are very anxious about the situation.

NURSING THEORIES AND MODELS

\section*{NURSING THEORIES AND MODELS}
- DEFINITION OF TERMS
- PURPOSES OF NURSING THEORY
- IMPORTANCE OF NURSING THEORIES IN NURSING PROCESS
- COMPONENTS OF A THEORY
- TYPES OF THEORIES
- Theories are not discovered in nature but are human inventions.
- Theory is a creative and rigorous structuring of ideas that projects a tentative, purposeful, and systematic view of phenomena (Chinn \& Kramer, 2004, p. 268).

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}

THEORY: is a supposition or system of ideas that is proposed to explain a given phenomenon.

\section*{NURSING THEORY:}
- It is the body of knowledge that is used to support nursing practice.
- It is a framework designed to organize knowledge and explain phenomena in nursing at a more concrete and specific level.

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- It is a set of concepts, definitions, relationships, and assumptions or propositions derived from nursing models or from other disciplines and project a purposive, systematic view of phenomena by designing specific inter-relationships among concepts for the purposes of describing, explaining, predicting, and /or prescribing.
- Nursing theory is a conceptualization of some aspect of reality (invented or discovered) that pertains to nursing. The conceptualization is articulated for the purpose of describing, explaining, predicting, or prescribing nursing care (Meleis, 1997).

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- CONCEPT: (Building blocks of theories). A mental idea of a phenomenon
- CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK: is a group of related ideas, statements or concepts. e.g Freud's idea of the mind (Id, Ego, Superego).

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- Concepts are basically vehicles of thought that involve images.
- Concepts are words that describe objects, properties, or events and are basic components of theory.
- Types of Concepts:
- Empirical concepts - Easily understood and measured.
- Inferential concepts - Indirectly observable. Cannot be physically measured as easily. Ex: Smiling=happiness
- Abstract concepts - We do not have literal evidence. Nonobservable, not always easily understood, hard to accurately measure. Ex: God, pain.

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- Models - Representations of the interaction between concepts showing patterns.
- CONCEPTUAL MODEL: used interchangeably with conceptual framework. They represent ways of thinking about a problem or ways of representing how complex things work the way that they do.
- NURSING MODELS: are conceptual models, constructed of theories and concepts.

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- A conceptual model shows how various concepts are interrelated and applies theories to predict or evaluate consequences of alternative actions.
- A conceptual model "gives direction to the search for relevant questions about the phenomena of central interest to a discipline and suggests solutions to practical problems"

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- Propositions - Links concepts. Defines relationships between concepts. "BP is high because of increased stress."
- Assumptions - Statements of facts or beliefs. Something one must believe to be true.

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}

Four concepts are generally considered central to the discipline of nursing:
- The person who receives nursing care (the patient or client);
- The environment (society);
- Nursing (goals, roles, functions);
- Health.

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}
- NURSING: the attributes, characteristics and actions of the nurse providing care on behalf of, or in conjunction with the client.
- HEALTH: the degree of wellness or wellbeing that the client experiences.

Health is a wholeness and successful adaptation

Disease: It is unregulated and undisciplined change and must be stopped or death will ensue

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}

ENVIRONMENT: the internal and external surroundings that affect the client. Includes families, friends etc.
I. Internal Environment
- Homeostasis: A state of energy sparing that also provide the necessary baselines for a multitude of synchronized physiological and psychological factors

\section*{DEFINITION OF TERMS}

\section*{II. External Environment}
- Pre-conceptual: Aspect of the world that individuals are able to intercept(interrupt).
- Operational: Elements that may physically affect individuals but not perceived by them: radiation, micro-organism and pollution
- Conceptual: Part of person's environment including cultural patterns characterized by spiritual existence, ideas, values, beliefs and tradition

\section*{PURPOSES OF NURSING THEORY}
- Education - many nursing programs organized curriculum framework basing around one or two models.
- Research - nursing research identifies the philosophical assumptions or theoretical framework from which it proceeds.
- Clinical practice - facilitates reflection, questioning and thinking about what nurses do.

\section*{PURPOSES OF NURSING THEORY}

Nursing theories:-
- are used to describe, develop, disseminate, and use present knowledge in nursing.
- provide a framework for nurses to systematize their nursing actions: what to ask, what to observe, what to focus on and what to think about.
- provide a framework to develop new and validate current knowledge. They help to describe, explain, predict and prescribe.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF NURSING THEORIES IN NURSING PROCESS}
- It should provide the foundations of nursing practice, help to generate further knowledge and indicate in which direction nursing should develop in the future.
- Theory is important because it helps us to decide what we know and what we need to know.

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF NURSING THEORIES IN NURSING PROCESS}
- It helps to distinguish what should form the basis of practice by explicitly describing nursing.
- The benefits of having a defined body of theory in nursing include better patient care, enhanced professional status, improved communication between nurses, and guidance for research and education

\section*{IMPORTANCE OF NURSING THEORIES IN NURSING PROCESS}
- The main exponent of nursing - caring cannot be measured, it is vital to have the theory to analyze and explain what nurses do.
- As medicine tries to make a move towards adopting a more multidisciplinary approach to health care, nursing continues to strive to establish a unique body of knowledge.
- This can be seen as an attempt by the nursing profession to maintain its professional boundaries.

\section*{METAPARADIGMS IN NURSING}
- The metaparadigm for nursing is a framework for the discipline that sets forth the phenomena of interest and the propositions, principles, and methods of the discipline.
- Global concepts that identify the phenomena of interest to a discipline. Broadest description of a discipline. Ex: Environment, Health, Person, Nursing = Nursing Metaparadigm.

\section*{METAPARADIGMS IN NURSING}

\section*{Person}
- Recipient of care, including physical, spiritual, psychological, and sociocultural components.
- Individual, family, or community

\section*{Environment}
- All internal and external conditions, circumstances, and influences affecting the person

\section*{Health}
- Degree of wellness or illness experienced by the person Nursing
- Actions, characteristics and attributes of person giving care.

\section*{NON-NURSING THEORIES USED IN NURSING}

\section*{GENERAL SYSTEMS THEORY}

Developed by Von Bertalanffy $(1969,1976)$
The relationships between the parts of the whole are examined to learn how they work together.
It assumes:-
- All systems must be goal directed.
- A system is more than the sum of its parts
- A system is ever changing.
- Human systems are open and dynamic.

\section*{NON-NURSING THEORIES USED IN NURSING}

HUMAN NEEDS THEORY: MASLOW'S HIERACHY OF HUMAN NEEDS
Human needs are any physiologic or psychological factors necessary for a health existence.
Maslow's hierachy provides a framework for recognizing and prioritizing basic human needs.

\section*{MASLOWS HIERACHY OF HUMAN NEEDS}
1. Physiologic needs
2. Safety needs
3. Love needs

Self-
4. Esteem needs
5. Self- Actualization need actualizatio

Esteem needs

Love needsbelonging

Safety needssecurity
Physiological needs - food, water, air, sleep, rest, sex

\section*{COMPONENTS OF A THEORY}

\section*{CONCEPTS DEFINITIONS}

\section*{PHENOMEN ON}

ASSUMPTIONS

\section*{TYPES OF THEORIES}

\section*{Grand Theories}
-These are conceptual frameworks that define broad perspectives for nursing practice. They are simply known to speak a broad range of important relationship among concepts of a discipline.
-They are the broadest in scope representing universal and broad nursing phenomena.

\section*{TYPES OF THEORIES}

\section*{EXAMPLES}
- Dorothy Johnson - Behavioral System Model
- King, Imogene - Open Systems Theory.
- Levine, Myra Estrin - Conservation Model.
- Neuman, Betty - Systems Theory.
- Nightingale, Florence - Environmental Theory
- Orem, Dorothea E. - Self-Care Deficit Theory
- Parse, Rosemarie R. - Theory of Human Becoming
- Paterson, Josephine and Zderad, Loretta Humanistic Nursing Theory.
- Rogers, Martha - The Science of Unitary Human Beings.
- Roy, Callista - Adaptation Theory.

\section*{TYPES OF THEORIES}

\section*{Middle Range Theories in Nursing}

Middle Range Theories are known to have a narrower and detailed focus compared to grand theories. They have lower level of abstraction than grand theories and they offer a more direct application to research and practice. These theories are specific to nursing practice and specify the area of practice, age range of the patient, nursing action or intervention, and proposed outcome
- Examples
- Dr. Katharine Kolcaba - The Comfort Theory
- Madelaine M Leininger - Transcultural Nursing.
- Ida Jean Orlando - The Deliberative Nursing Process.
- Hildegard E. Peplau - Interpersonal Relations.

\section*{TYPES OF THEORIES}

Micro Range Nursing Theories
- Micro range theories are more tentative than grand and middle range theories and they serve as a means to test working hypotheses so they can be developed in a more organized theoretical system.

\section*{According to Orientation or focus of the theory}
1. Client centered: Nightingale, Henderson
2. Client-nurse dynamics: Watson
3. Client-nurse environment: Leininger

\section*{Categories of nursing theories}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_d26f48b003ea9d7184cbg-044.jpg?height=785&width=910&top_left_y=647&top_left_x=524)

\section*{Client centered theory}
1. Client centered theories are those focused on the needs and problems of clients which are met, resolved or alleviated by nursing interventions
- This category includes theories developed by the following :
Nightingale,Abdellah,Henderson,Ore m,Pender, Roy, Levine, Hall.

\section*{Nurse - client dynamics}
2.Nurse-client-dynamics focus on interaction between the nurse and client. This category includes theories developed by the following: Peplau, Watson, King and Orlando

\section*{Client Nurse Environment Dynamics}
3. CLIENT NURSE ENVIRONMENT- focus on the interaction between nurse and client in an environment that includes broader dimensions of time and space. As well as culture, cultural diversity, and universality. Theories of Neuman and Leininger are discussed under this category.

\section*{MAJOR THEORISTS}
- Florence Nightingale - first nurse theorist.
- Virginia Henderson - Often called "the Nightingale of Modern Nursing,"
- Martha Rogers - saw nursing as both a science and an art.
- Dorothea E. Orem - defined nursing as an art, a helping service and a technology.
- Betty Neuman - defines the concern of nursing is preventing stress invasion.

\section*{FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE}
- The first nurse theorist.
- Defined nursing as the act of utilizing the environment of the patient to assist him in his recovery.
- Linked health with five environmental factors. A deficiency of these factors produced lack of health or illness.
- Stressed the importance of keeping the client warm, maintaining a noise-free environment and attending to their diet.

\section*{FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE}

THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS
1. Pure or fresh air
2. Pure water
3. Efficient drainage
4. Cleanliness
5. Light (especially direct sunlight)

\section*{FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE}
- PERSON: an individual with vital reparative processes to deal with disease.
- ENVIRONMENT: external conditions that affect life and the individual's development.
- HEALTH: focus is on the reparative process of getting well.
- NURSING: goal is to place the individual in the best condition for

\section*{FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE}

\section*{Nursing}
- Nursing is different from medicine and the goal of nursing is to place the patient in the best possible condition for nature to act.
- Nursing is the "activities that promote health (as outlined in canons) which occur in any caregiving situation. They can be done by anyone."

\section*{Person}
- People are multidimensional, composed of biological, psychological, social and spiritual components.

\section*{Health}
- Health is "not only to be well, but to be able to use well every power we have".
- Disease is considered as dys-ease or the absence of comfort.

\section*{Environment}
- "Poor or difficult environments led to poor health and disease".
- "Environment could be altered to improve conditions so that the natural laws would allow healing to occur."

\section*{Assumptions of Nightingale's Theory}
- Natural laws
- Mankind can achieve perfection
- Nursing is a calling
- Nursing is an art and a science
- Nursing is achieved through environmental alteration
- Nursing requires a specific educational base
- Nursing is distinct and separate from medicine

\section*{Application of Nightingale's theory in practice:}
- "Patients are to be put in the best condition for nature to act on them, it is the responsibility of nurses to reduce noise, to relieve patients' anxieties, and to help them sleep."
- As per most of the nursing theories, environmental adaptation remains the basis of holistic nursing care.

\section*{Criticisms}
- She emphasized subservience to doctors.
- She focused more on physical factors than on psychological needs of patient.

\section*{Conclusion}
- Florence Nightingale provided a professional model for nursing organization.
- She was the first to use a theoretical foundation to nursing.
- Her thoughts have influenced nursing significantly.

\section*{VIRGINIA HENDERSON}

HER DEFINITION OF NURSING
- "The unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health or its recovery (or to peaceful death) that he would perform unaided if he had the necessary strength, will, or knowledge and to do this in such a way as to help him gain independence as rapidly as possible.

\section*{VIRGINIA HENDERSON}
- Conceptualized the nurse's role as assisting sick or healthy individuals to gain independence in meeting 14 fundamental needs.
1. Breathing normally
2. Eating and drinking adequately
3. Eliminating body wastes
4. Moving and maintaining a desirable position

\section*{VIRGINIA HENDERSON}

\section*{FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS}
5. Sleeping and resting
6. Selecting suitable clothes
7. Maintaining body temperature within normal range by adjusting clothing.
8. Keeping the body clean and well groomed to protect the integument.
9. Avoiding dangers in the environment and avoiding injuring others.

\section*{VIRGINIA HENDERSON}

\section*{FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS}
10. Communicating with others in expressing emotions, needs, fears or opinions.
11. Worshipping according to one's faith.
12. Working in such a way that one feels a sense of accomplishment.
13. Playing or participating in various forms of recreation.
14. Learning, discovering or satisfying curiosity that leads to normal development and health and using available health facilities.

\section*{VIRGINIA HENDERSON}
- PERSON: an organism striving to reduce tension generated by needs.
- ENVIRONMENT: the interpersonal process is always included.
- HEALTH: ongoing human process that implies forward movement of personality and other human processes in the direction of creative, constructive, productive and community living.
- NURSING: an educative instrument, a maturing force that aims to promote forward movement of personality.

\section*{1. Individual}
- Have basic needs that are component of health.
- Requiring assistance to achieve health and independence or a peaceful death.
- Mind and body are inseparable and interrelated.
- Considers the biological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual components.
- The theory presents the patient as a sum of parts with biopsychosocial needs.

\section*{2. Environment}
- Settings in which an individual learns unique pattern for living.
- All external conditions and influences that affect life and development.
- Individuals in relation to families
- Minimally discusses the impact of the community on the individual and family.
- Basic nursing care involves providing conditions under which the patient can perform the 14 activities unaided
3. Health
- Definition based on individual's ability to function independently as outlined in the 14 components.
- Nurses need to stress promotion of health and prevention and cure of disease.
- Good health is a challenge -affected by age, cultural background, physical, and intellectual capacities, and emotional balance Is the individual's ability to meet these needs independently.

\section*{4. Nursing}
- Temporarily assisting an individual who lacks the necessary strength, will and knowledge to satisfy 1 or more of 14 basic needs.
- Assists and supports the individual in life activities and the attainment of independence.
- Nurse serves to make patient "complete" "whole", or "independent."
- The nurse is expected to carry out physician's therapeutic plan Individualized care is the result of the nurse's creativity in planning for care.
- "Nurse should have knowledge to practice individualized and human care and should be a scientific problem solver."
- In the Nature of Nursing Nurse role is," to get inside the patient's skin and supplement his strength will or knowledge according to his needs."

\section*{Assumptions}

The major assumptions of the theory are:
- "Nurses care for patients until patient can care for themselves once again.
- Nurses are willing to serve and that "nurses will devote themselves to the patient day and night"
- Nurses should be educated at the university level in both arts and sciences.

\section*{Assumptions}
- Independence is valued by the nurse and the patient, more than dependence.
- Health has a meaning shared by the society at large.
- Individuals desire health or a peaceful death and will act in such a way to achieve this.

\section*{Assumptions}
- Individuals will perform activities leading to health if they have the knowledge, capacity or will.
- The individual's goal and the nurse's goal are congruent.
- The 14 basic needs represent nursing's basic function.
- The major explicit assumption is Henderson's contention that the nurse is an independent practitioner.

\section*{Conclusion}
- Henderson provides the essence of what she believes is a definition of nursing.
- Her emphasis on basic human needs as the central focus of nursing practice has led to further theory development regarding the needs of the person and how nursing can assist in meeting those needs.
- Her definition of nursing and the 14 components of basic nursing care are uncomplicated and self-explanatory.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

\section*{GENERAL THEORY OF NURSING Includes 3 related concepts \\ 1. Self - care \\ 2. Self - care deficit \\ 3. Nursing systems}

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

\section*{SELF - CARE THEORY}
- Based on four concepts
i. Self care - those activities an individual performs independently throughout life to promote and maintain personal well being.
ii. Self care agency - the individual's ability to perform self care activities.
iii. Self care requisites/ needs - measures or actions taken to provide self care.
iv. Therapeutic self care demands - all self care activities required to meet existing self-care requisites/ actions to maintain health and wellbeing.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}
- Self - care deficit results when self-care agency is not adequate to meet the known self-care demand.
- Self-care deficit theory shows five methods of helping
- Acting or doing for
- Guiding
- Teaching
- Supporting
- Providing an environment that promotes the individual's abilities to meet current and future demands.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

Identifies three types of nursing systems
1. Wholly compensatory - required for individuals who are unable to control and monitor their environment and monitor their environment and process information.
2. Partly compensatory - designed for individuals who are unable to perform some, but not all self care activities.
3. Supportive-educative - designed for persons who need to learn to perform self-care measures and need assistance to do so.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}
- PERSON: Biopsychosocial being capable of self-care.
- ENVIRONMENT: internal and external stimuli.
- HEALTH: state of wholeness or integrity of human beings and the environment.
- NURSING: a creative effort of one human being to help another human being. Consists 3 systems- wholly compensatory, partially compensatory and supportive/ educative.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

\section*{Person:}

Man is an integrated WHOLE - a unity functioning biologically, symbolically and socially.
- Man is self-reliant and responsible for self-care and wellbeing of his or her dependents and self-care is a requisite for all.
- Man is a logical organism with rational powers.
- Man's capacity to reflect on his/her own experience and the environment and his/her use of symbols/ideas/words that distinguished him/her from other species.
- A patient is an individual who is in need of assistance in meeting specific health-care demands because of lack of knowledge, skills, motivation, or orientation.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

\section*{Health:}

State of wholeness or integrity of the individual human beings, his parts, and his modes of functioning.
- This concept is inherent in her nursing systems since the goal in each system is optimal wellness relative to that system.
- Responsibility of a total society and all its members.
- A healthy person is likely to have sufficient self-care abilities to meet his/her universal self-care needs.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

Environment: Encompasses the elements external to man but she considered man and environment as an integrated system related to self-care.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}
- Environmental conditions conducive to development include opportunities to be helped: being with other persons or groups where care is offered; opportunities for solitude and companionship; provision of help for personal and group concerns without limiting individual decisions and personal pursuits: shared respect , belief, and trust; recognition and fostering of developmental potential.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

\section*{Nursing:}
- To Orem, nursing arises through a mandate from society which defines scopes, limits, and credentials of nursing practice (agency).
- Through the nursing process, the nurse can select the nursing model appropriate for the patient.
- It is a community service, an art, and a technology.

\section*{Assumptions}
- Self-care is learned through human interaction and communication.
- Self-care includes deliberate and systematic actions performed to meet needs for care.
- People should be self- reliant and responsible for their own care needs as well as others in the family who are not able to care for themselves.

\section*{Assumptions}
- Nursing is a deliberate, purposeful helping service performed by nurses for the sake of others over a period of time.
- Persons are capable and willing to perform self care for self or for dependent members of the family.
- Education and culture influence individuals.

\section*{Assumptions}
- People are individuals with entities that are distinct from others and from their environments.
- Self care is part of life that is necessary for health human development \& well-being.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

THERAPEUTIC SELF CARE DEMAND: DEFICIENT AREA: FOOD
ADEQUACY OF SELF CARE AGENCY: INADEQUATE
NURSING DIAGNOSIS - Inability to maintain the ideal nutrition related to inadequate intake and knowledge deficit
OUTCOMES AND PLAN
a. Outcome:
- Improved nutrition
- Maintenance of a balanced diet with adequate iron supplementation.
b. Nursing Goals and objectives
- Goal: to achieve optimal levels of nutrition.

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

Objectives: Mrs. X will:
- state the importance of maintaining a balanced diet.
- List the food items rich in iron, that are available in the locality.
c. Design of the nursing system:
- supportive educative
d. Method of helping:
- guidance
- support
- Teaching
- Providing developmental environment

\section*{DOROTHEA OREM}

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}
- Mutually planned and identified the objectives and the patient were made to understand about the required changes in the behaviour to have the requisites met.

\section*{EVALUATION}
- Mrs. X understood the importance of maintaining an optimum nutrition.
- She told that she will select the iron rich diet for her food.
- She listed the foods that are rich in iron and that are locally available.
- The self care deficit in terms of food will be decreased with the initiation of the nutritional intake.
- The supportive educative system was useful for Mrs. X

\section*{BETTY NEUMAN}
- Developed a model based on the individual's relationship to stress, the reaction to it and reconstitution factors that are dynamic in nature.
- Views a client as an open system consisting of a basic structure (physiologic, sociocultural, developmental and spiritual) sorrounded by two concentric boundaries referred to as rings of resistance.

\section*{BETTY NEUMAN}
- Lines of resistance represent internal factors that help defend against a stressor e.g WBC
- The inner/ normal line of defense (solid line) represents the person's state of equilibrium/ adaptation developed and maintained over time.
- Flexible line (broken line) is dynamic and can be rapidly altered over a short period of time.

\section*{BETTY NEUMAN}
- Categorizes stressors as
- Intra-personal - occur within the individual e.g infection.
- Inter-personal - occur between individuals e.g unrealistic role expectations.
- Extrapersonal - occur outside the person e.g financial concerns.

\section*{BETTY NEUMAN}

Nursing interventions focus on retaining or maintaining system stability. The preventive levels are:-
1. Primary prevention - focuses on protecting the normal line of defense and strengthening the flexible line.
2. Secondary prevention - focuses on strengthening internal lines of resistance, reducing reaction and increasing resistance factors.
3. Tertiary prevention - focuses on re-adaptation and stability and protects reconstitution or return of wellness following treatment.

\section*{BETTY NEUMAN}

OUTER LINE: flexible line of defense
Mid-line: normal line of defense
Inner line: lines of resistance

\section*{Flexible Lines of Defense}
- Is the outer boundary to the normal line of defense, the line of resistance, and the core structure.
- Keeps the system free from stressors and is dependent on the amount of sleep, nutritional status, as well as the quality and quantity of stress an individual experiences.
- If the flexible line of defense fails to provide adequate protection to the normal line of defense, the lines of resistance become activated.

\section*{Normal Line of Defense}
- Represents client's usual wellness level.
- Can change over time in response to coping or responding to the environment, which includes intelligence, attitudes, problem solving and coping abilities. Example is skin which is constantly smooth and fair will eventually form callous over times.
