\section*{Procedure}

Handwashing
- The most important infection control practice is handwashing.
- You must begin every physical assessment with a thorough handwash.

\section*{Assessment Techniques:}
- Physical assessment findings, or objective data, are obtained through the use of four specific diagnostic techniques: inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.
- Usually, these assessment techniques are performed in this order when body systems are assessed.
- An exception is in the assessment of the abdomen, when auscultation is performed prior to percussion and palpation, as the latter two can alter bowel sounds.
- These four techniques validate information provided by a patient in the health history, or they can verify a suspected physical diagnosis.

\section*{Assessment Techniques:}

The order of techniques is as follows (A-D) except for the abdomen where you inspect then auscultate
A. Inspection - critical observation
1. Take time to -observe|| with eyes, ears, nose (all senses)
2. Use good lighting
3. Look at color, shape, symmetry, position
4. Odors from skin, breath, wound
5. Develop and use nursing instincts
6. Inspection is done alone and in combination with other assessment techniques

\section*{Assessment Techniques:}
B. Palpation - light and deep touch
1. Back of hand (dorsal aspect) to assess skin temperature
2. Fingers to assess texture, moisture, areas of tenderness
3. Assess size, shape, and consistency of lesions
C. Percussion - sounds produced by striking body surface
1. Produces different notes depending on underlying mass (dull, resonant, flat, tympani)
2. Used to determine size and shape of underlying structures by establishing their borders and indicates if tissue is air-filled, fluid-filled, or solid

\section*{Assessment Techniques:}
D. Auscultation - listening to sounds produced by the body
1. Direct auscultation - sounds are audible without stethoscope e.g wheeze
2. Indirect auscultation - uses stethoscope
3. Know how to use stethoscope properly (practice)
4. Fine-tune your ears to pick up subtle changes (practice)

\section*{Inspection}
- "A conscientious nurse is not necessarily an observing nurse; and life or death may lie with the good observer." This statement by Florence Nightingale provides inspiration and direction for inspection, which is usually the first assessment technique used during the assessment process.
- Inspection is an ongoing process that you use throughout the entire physical assessment and patient encounter. Inspection is the use of one's senses of vision and smell to consciously observe the patient.

\section*{Inspection}

\section*{Vision}
- Use of sight can reveal many facts about a patient.
- The process of visual inspection necessitates full exposure of the body part being
- inspected, adequate overhead lighting.

\section*{Smell}
- The nurse's olfactory sense provides vital information about a patient's health status. The patient may have a fruity breath odor characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis. The classic odor that is emitted by a Pseudomonas infection is another well-recognized smell to the experienced nurse.

\section*{Palpation}
- The second assessment technique is palpation, which is the act of touching a patient in a therapeutic manner to elicit specific information.
- Prior to palpating a patient, some basic principles need to be observed.
- You should have short fingernails to avoid hurting the patient as well as yourself.
- You should warm your hands prior to placing them on the patient; cold hands can make a patient's muscles tense, which can distort assessment findings.

\section*{Palpation}
- Encourage the patient to continue to breathe normally throughout the palpation.
- If pain is experienced during the palpation, discontinue the palpation immediately.
- Most significantly, inform the patient where, when, and how the touch will occur, especially when the patient cannot see what you are doing.

\section*{Palpation}

\section*{Order of Assessment Procedures}
- A good rule of thumb to follow when sequencing assessment procedures is to progress from the least intrusive to the most intrusive. That is, assessments that may cause discomfort should be performed last whenever possible in order to prevent patient anxiety, fear, and muscle guarding, which could affect the assessment process.

\section*{Palpation}
- For example, palpation of a tender area in the abdomen should be performed last. In the pediatric patient, the assessment of the ears and throat is usually performed last because these are the most uncomfortable for the child and may cause crying.

\section*{Palpation}
- Different sections of the hands are best used for assessing certain areas of the body.
- The dorsum of the hand is most sensitive to temperature changes in the body. Thus, it is more accurate to place the dorsum of the hand on a patient's forehead to assess the body temperature than it is to use the palmar surface of the hand.

\section*{Palpation}
- The palmar surface of the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints, the ball of the hand, and the ulnar surface of the hand best discriminate vibrations, such as a cardiac thrill and fremitus.
- The finger pads are the portion of the hand used most frequently in palpation. The finger pads are useful in assessing fine tactile discrimination, skin moisture, and texture; the presence of masses, pulsations, edema, and crepitation; and the shape, size, position, mobility, and consistency of organs.

\section*{Palmar surface}

\section*{Dorsal surface}

\section*{Palpation}
- Remember to observe standard precautions when you are performing palpation.
- Gloves must be worn when examining any open wounds, skin lesions, a body part with discharge, as well as internal body parts such as the mouth and rectum.

\section*{Types of palpation}
- There are two distinct types of palpation: light and deep palpation.
Light palpation is done more frequently than deep palpation and is always performed before deep palpation.
- It is superficial, delicate, and gentle.
- In light palpation, the finger pads are used to gain information on the patient's skin surface to a depth of approximately 1 centimeter (cm) below the surface.
- Light palpation reveals information on skin texture and moisture; overt, large, or superficial masses; and fluid, muscle guarding, and superficial tenderness.

\section*{To perform light palpation:}
1. Keeping the fingers of your dominant hand together, place the finger pads lightly on the skin over the area that is to be palpated. The hand and fore- arm will be on a plane parallel to the area being assessed.
2. Depress the skin 1 cm in light, gentle, circular motions.
3. Keeping the finger pads on the skin, let the depressed body surface rebound to its natural position.
4. If the patient is ticklish, lift the hand off the skin before moving it to another area.

\section*{To perform light palpation:}
5. Using a systematic approach, move the fingers to an adjacent area and repeat the process.
6. Continue to move the finger pads until the entire area being examined has been palpated.
7. If the patient has complained of tenderness in any area, palpate this area last.

\section*{Light palpation}

\section*{Types of palpation}

Deep palpation can reveal information about the position of organs and masses, as well as their size, shape, mobility, consistency, and areas of discomfort.
- Deep palpation uses the hands to explore the body's internal structures to a depth of 4 to 5 cm or more.
- This technique is most often used for the abdominal and male and female reproductive assessments. Variations in this technique are single-handed and bimanual palpation.

\section*{Deep palpation}

\section*{Percussion}
- Percussion is the technique of striking one object against another to cause vibrations that produce sound.
- The density of underlying structures produces characteristic sounds. These sounds are diagnostic of normal and abnormal findings.
- The presence of air, fluid, and solids can be confirmed, as can organ size, shape, and position. Any part of the body can be percussed, but only limited information can be obtained in specific areas such as the heart.
- The thorax and abdomen are the most frequently percussed locations.

\section*{Percussion}
- Percussion sound can be analyzed according to its intensity, duration, pitch (frequency), quality, and location. Intensity refers to the relative loudness or softness of the sound. It is also called the amplitude.
- Duration of percussed sound describes the time period over which a sound is heard when elicited.

\section*{Percussion}
- Frequency describes the concept of pitch. It is caused by the sound's vibrations, or the highness or lowness of a sound. Frequency is measured in cycles per second (cps) or hertz (Hz). More rapidly occurring vibrations have a pitch that is higher than that of slower vibrations.
- The quality of a sound is its timbre, or how one perceives it musically. Location of sound refers to the area where the sound is produced and heard.

\section*{Percussion}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_02_57688fe758c40e2da67ag-026.jpg?height=1318&width=1972&top_left_y=419&top_left_x=261)

\section*{Percussion}
- Amplitude = height of vibration
- Frequency = cycles per second
- The process of percussion can produce five distinct sounds in the body: flatness, dullness, resonance, hyperresonance, and tympany.
- Specific parts of the body elicit distinct percussable sounds. Therefore, when an unexpected sound is heard in a particular part of the body, the cause must be further investigated.

\section*{Percussion}

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Percussion}
- Sound waves are better conducted through a solid medium than through an air-filled medium because of the increased concentration of molecules.
- The basic premises underlying the sounds that are percussed are:
1. The more solid a structure, the higher its pitch, the softer its intensity, and the shorter its duration.
2. The more air-filled a structure, the lower its pitch, the louder its intensity, and the longer its duration.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}
- There are four types of percussion techniques: immediate, mediate, direct fist percussion, and indirect fist percussion.
- It is important to keep in mind that the sounds produced from percussion are generated from body tissue up to 5 cm below the surface of the skin.
- If the abdomen is to be percussed, the patient should have the opportunity to void before the assessment.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}

Immediate or direct percussion is the striking of an area of the body directly.
To perform immediate percussion:
1. Spread the index or middle finger of the dominant hand slightly apart from the rest of the fingers.
2. Make a light tapping motion with the finger pad of the index finger against the body part being percussed.
3. Note what sound is produced.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}
- Mediate percussion is also referred to as indirect percussion. This is a skill that takes time and practice to develop and to use effectively. Most sounds are produced using mediate percussion.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}

\section*{Steps to perform mediate percussion:}
1. Place the nondominant hand lightly on the surface to be percussed.
2. Extend the middle finger of this hand, known as the pleximeter, and press its distal phalanx and distal interphalangeal joint firmly on the location where percussion is to begin. The pleximeter will remain stationary while percussion is performed in this location.
3. Spread the other fingers of the nondominant hand apart and raise them slightly off the surface. This prevents interference and, thus, dampening of vibrations during the actual percussion.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}
4. Flex the middle finger of the dominant hand, called the plexor. The fingernail of the plexor finger should be very short to prevent undue discomfort and injury to the patient. The other fingers on this hand should be fanned.
5. Flex the wrist of the dominant hand and place the hand directly over the pleximeter finger of the nondominant

\section*{Percussion techniques:}
6. With a sharp, crisp, rapid movement from the wrist of the dominant hand, strike the pleximeter with the plexor. At this point, the plexor should be perpendicular to the pleximeter. The blow to the pleximeter should be between the distal interphalangeal joint and the fingernail. Use the finger pad rather than the fingertip of the plexor to deliver the blow. Concentrate on the movement to create the striking action from the dominant wrist only.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}
7. As soon as the plexor strikes the pleximeter, withdraw the plexor to avoid dampening the resulting vibrations. Do not move the pleximeter finger.
8. Note the sound produced from the percussion.
9. Repeat the percussion process one or two times in this location to confirm the sound.
10. Move the pleximeter to a second location, preferably the contralateral location from where the previous percussion was performed. Repeat the percussion process in this manner until the entire body surface area being assessed has been percussed.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}

Direct fist percussion is used to assess the presence of tenderness and pain in internal organs, such as the liver or the kidneys.
To perform direct fist percussion:
1. Explain this technique thoroughly so the patient does not think you are hitting him or her.
2. Draw the dominant hand up into a fist.
3. With the ulnar aspect of the closed fist, directly hit the area where the organ is located. The strike should be of moderate force, and it may take some practice to achieve the right intensity.
The presence of pain in conjunction with direct fist percussion indicates inflammation of that organ or a strike of too high an intensity.

\section*{Percussion techniques:}

\section*{Indirect Fist Percussion}

Indirect method is preferred over the direct method.
Steps to perform indirect fist percussion:
1. Place the palmar side of the nondominant hand on the skin's surface over the organ to be examined. Place the fingers adjacent to one another and in straight alignment with the palm.
2. Draw up the dominant hand into a closed fist.
3. With the ulnar aspect of the closed fist, use moderate intensity to hit the outstretched nondominant hand on the dorsum. The nondominant hand absorbs some of the force of the striking hand. The resulting intensity should be of sufficient force to produce pain in the patient if organ inflammation is present.

\section*{Auscultation}
- Auscultation is the act of active listening to body organs to gather information on a patient's clinical status.
- Auscultation includes listening to sounds that are voluntarily and involuntarily produced by the body. A deep inspiration a patient takes with the lung assessment illustrates a voluntary sound, and heart sounds illustrate involuntary sounds.
- A quiet environment is necessary for auscultation.
- Auscultated sounds should be analyzed in relation to their relative intensity, pitch, duration, quality, and location.
- There are two types of auscultation: direct and indirect.

\section*{Auscultation}

Direct or immediate auscultation is the process of listening with the unaided ear.
- This can include listening to the patient from some distance away or placing the ear directly on the patient's skin surface. An example of immediate auscultation is the wheezing that is audible to the unassisted ear in a person having a

\section*{Auscultation}
- Indirect or mediate auscultation describes the process of listening with some amplification or mechanical device.
- The nurse most often performs mediate auscultation with an acoustic stethoscope, which does not amplify the body sounds, but instead blocks out environmental sounds.
- Amplification of body sounds can also be achieved with the use of a Doppler ultrasonic stethoscope.

\section*{The acoustic stethoscope.}
- The earpieces block out noises in the environment.
- The earpieces and binaurals should be angled toward the nose. This angle permits the natural direction of the ear canal to be accessed. In this manner, sounds will be
- directed toward the adult tympanic membrane.
- The rubber or plastic tubing should be between 30.5 and 40 cm (12-18 in.). Stethoscopes with longer tubing will diminish the body sounds that are auscultated.
- The acoustic stethoscope has two listening heads: the bell and the diaphragm. The diaphragm is flat and the bell is a concave cup. The diaphragm transmits high-pitched sounds and the bell transmits low-pitched sounds.
- Breath sounds and normal heart sounds are examples of highpitched sounds. Heart murmurs are examples of low-pitched sounds.

\section*{Auscultation}
- Prior to auscultating, remove dangling necklaces or bracelets that can move during the examination and cause false noises.
- Warm the headpieces of the stethoscope in your hands prior to use, because shivering and movement can obscure assessment findings.
- To use the diaphragm, place it firmly against the skin surface to be auscultated. If the patient has a large quantity of hair in this area, it may be necessary to wet the hair to prevent it from interfering with the sound that is being auscultated. Otherwise, a grating sound may be heard.

\section*{Auscultation}
- To use the bell, place it lightly on the skin surface that is to be auscultated.
- The bell will stretch the skin and act like a diaphragm and transmit high-pitched sounds if it is pressed too firmly on the skin. In both instances, auscultation requires a great deal of concentration.
- It may be helpful to close your eyes during the auscultation process to help you isolate the sound. Sometimes you can hear more than one sound in a given location. Try to listen to each sound and concentrate on each separately. It is important to clean your stethoscope after each patient to prevent the transfer of pathogens.
Remember, auscultation is a skill that requires practice and patience. Don't expect to become an expert overnight.

\section*{Reflective thinking}
- You are inserting a vaginal speculum into a patient when she says, "I've changed my mind. I don't want to do this." How would you respond to this patient?
- While performing a breast exam on a patient, the patient shrieks, "What do you think you are doing?" How would you respond to this patient?
- During deep palpation of the abdomen, your patient responds, "Ouch, you hurt me!" How would you respond?

\section*{Golden Rules for Physical Assessment}
- Stand on the right side of the patient; establishing a dominant side for assessment will decrease your movement around the patient.
- Perform the assessment in a head-to-toe approach.
- Always compare the right- and left-hand sides of the body for symmetry.
- Proceed from the least invasive to the most invasive procedures for each body system.
- Always perform the physical assessment using a systematic approach; if it is performed the same way each time, you are less likely to forget some part of the assessment.

\section*{Preparing for a Physical}
- Arrange for a well-lit, warm, and private room.
- Ensure that all the necessary equipment is ready for use and within reach.
- Introduce yourself to the patient: "My name is Veronica Rojas. I am the nurse who is caring for you today. I need to assess how your lungs are today."
- Clarify with the patient how he or she wishes to be addressed: Miss Jones, José, Dr. Casy, Rev. Grimes, etc.

\section*{Preparing for a Physical Assessment}
- Explain what you plan to do and how long it will take; allow the patient to ask questions.
- Instruct the patient to undress; the underpants can be left on until the end of the assessment; provide a gown and drape for the patient and explain how to use them.
- Allow the patient to undress privately; inform the patient when you will return to start the assessment.
- Have the patient void prior to the assessment.

\section*{Preparing for a Physical Assessment}
- Wash your hands in front of the patient to show your concern for cleanliness.
- Observe standard precautions and transmissionbased precautions, as indicated.
- Ensure that the patient is accessible from both sides of the examining bed or table.
- If a bed is used, raise the height so that you do not have to bend over to perform the assessment.
- Position the patient as dictated by the body system being assessed;

\section*{Preparing for a Physical Assessment}
- Enlist the patient's cooperation by explaining what you are about to do, where it will be done, and how it may feel.

- $\triangle$ Palpate apical impulse (verbalize location: fourth or fifth intercostal space, left midclavicular line)
- $\diamond$ Auscultate 4 cardiac areas with diaphragm and bell (verbalize areas and location)
- Abdomen (lower HOB if necessary):
- $\triangle$ Inspect contour, symmetry, skin, pulsations
- $\checkmark$ Auscultate bowel sounds in 4 quadrants (start in Right Lower Quadrant)
- $\diamond$ Light palpation of all quadrants (note muscle guarding, rigidity, large masses, tenderness)

\section*{Inspection of the abdomen}
- Inspect for skin integrity (Pigmentation, lesions, striae, scars, veins, and umbilicus). Contour (flat, rounded, scapold) Distension Respiratory movement. Visible peristalsis. Pulsations
- Normal Findings: Skin color is uniform, no lesions. Some clients may have striae or scar. No venous engorgement. Contour may be flat, rounded or scapoid Thin clients may have visible peristalsis. Aortic pulsation maybe visible on thin clients.

\section*{Auscultation of the Abdomen}
- This method precedes percussion because bowel motility, and thus bowel sounds, may be increased by palpation or percussion. The stethoscope and the hands should be warmed; if they are cold, they may initiate contraction of the abdominal muscles. Light pressure on the stethoscope is sufficient to detect bowel sounds and bruits. Intestinal sounds are relatively high-pitched, the bell may be used in exploring arterial murmurs and venous hum.

\section*{Peristaltic sounds}
- These sounds are produced by the movements of air and fluids through the gastrointestinal tract. Peristalsis can provide diagnostic clues relevant to the motility of bowel. Listening to the bowel sounds can be facilitated by following these steps: Divide the abdomen in four quadrants. Listen over all auscultation sites, starting at the right lower quadrants, following the cross pattern of the imaginary lines in creating the abdominal quadrants. This direction ensures that we follow the direction of bowel movement.

\section*{Peristaltic sounds}
- Peristaltic sounds are quite irregular. Thus it is recommended that the examiner listen for at least 5 minutes, especially at the periumbilical area, before concluding that no bowel sounds are present.
- The normal bowel sounds are high-pitched, gurgling noises that occur approximately every $5-15$ seconds. It is suggested that the number of bowel sound may be as low as 3 to as high as 20 per minute, or roughly, one bowel sound for each breath sound.

\section*{Peristaltic sounds}

Some factors that affect bowel sound:
- Presence of food in the GI tract.
- State of digestion.
- Pathologic conditions of the bowel (inflammation, Gangrene, paralytic ileus, peritonitis).
- Bowel surgery Constipation or Diarrhea.
- Electrolyte imbalances.
- Bowel obstruction.

\section*{Percussion of the abdomen}
- Abdominal percussion is aimed at detecting fluid in the peritoneum (ascites), gaseous distension, and masses, and in assessing solid structures within the abdomen. The direction of abdominal percussion follows the auscultation site at each abdominal guardant.

\section*{Percussion of the abdomen}
- The entire abdomen should be percussed lightly or a general picture of the areas of tympany and dullness. Tympany will predominate because of the presence of gas in the small and large bowel. Solid masses will percuss as dull, such as liver in the RUQ, spleen at the 6th or 9th rib just posterior to or at the mid axillary line on the left side.
Percussion in the abdomen can also be used in assessing the liver span and size of the spleen.

\section*{Percussion of the liver}
- The palms of the left hand are placed over the region of liver dullness. The area is strucked lightly with a fisted right hand. Normally tenderness should not be elicited by this method. Tenderness elicited by this method is usually a result of hepatitis or cholecystitis.

\section*{Renal Percussion}
- Can be done by either indirect or direct method.
- Percussion is done over the costovertebral junction.
- Tenderness elicited by such method suggests renal inflammation.

\section*{Palpation of the Abdomen}

\section*{Light palpation}
- It is a gentle exploration performed while the client is in supine position. With the examiner's hands parallel to the floor. The fingers depress the abdominal wall, at each quadrant, by approximately 1 cm without digging, but gently palpating with slow circular motion. This method is used for eliciting slight tenderness, large masses, and muscles, and muscle guarding. Tensing of abdominal musculature may occur because of: The examiner's hands are too cold or are pressed to vigorously or deep into the abdomen. The client is ticklish or guards involuntarily. Presence of subjacent pathologic condition.

\section*{Palpation of the Abdomen}

Normal Findings:
- No tenderness noted.
- With smooth and consistent tension.
- No muscles guarding.

\section*{Deep Palpation}
- It is the indentation of the abdomen performed by pressing the distal half of the palmar surfaces of the fingers into the abdominal wall. The abdominal wall may slide back and forth while the fingers move back and forth over the organ being examined. Deeper structures, like the liver, and retro peritoneal organs, like the kidneys, or masses may be felt with this method. In the absence of disease, pressure produced by deep palpation may produce tenderness over the cecum, the sigmoid colon, and the aorta.

\section*{Liver palpation}
- There are two types of bi manual palpation recommended for palpation of the liver.
- The first one is the superimposition of the right hand over the left hand. Ask the patient to take 3 normal breaths. Then ask the client to breath deeply and hold. This would push the liver down to facilitate palpation. Press hand deeply over the RUQ The second methods: The examiner's left hand is placed beneath the client at the level of the right 11th and 12th ribs.

\section*{Liver palpation}
- Place the examiner's right hands parallel to the costal margin or the RUQ.
- An upward pressure is placed beneath the client to push the liver towards the examining right hand, while the right hand is pressing into the abdominal wall.
- Ask the client to breath deeply. As the client inspires, the liver maybe felt to slip beneath the examining fingers.

\section*{Liver palpation}

\section*{Normal Findings:}
- The liver usually can not be palpated in a normal adult.
- However, in extremely thin but otherwise well individuals, it may be felt the costal margins. When the normal liver margin is palpated, it must be smooth, regular in contour, firm and non-tender.
- Lower extremities:
- $\diamond$ Inspect symmetry, skin, hair distribution
- $\diamond$ Test ROM on one joint
- $\diamond$ Test muscle strength of lower extremities (press both feet against resistance)
- $\diamond$ Palpate one dorsalis pedis pulse

\section*{Extremities}

\section*{Inspection}
- Observe for size, contour, bilateral symmetry, and involuntary movement.
- Look for gross deformities, edema, presence of trauma such as ecchymosis or other discoloration.
- Always compare both extremities.

\section*{Palpation}
- Feel for evenness of temperature. Normally it should be even for all the extremities. Tonicity of muscle. (Can be measured by asking client to squeeze examiner's fingers and noting for equality of contraction). Perform range of motion. Test for muscle strength. (performed against gravity and against resistance) Table showing the Lovett scale for grading for muscle strength and functional level

\section*{Normal Findings}
- Both extremities are equal in size.
- Have the same contour with prominences of joints.
- No involuntary movements.
- No edema Color is even.
- Temperature is warm and even.
- Has equal contraction and even.
- Can perform complete range of motion.
- No crepitus must be noted on joints.
- Can counter act gravity and resistance on ROM.
- Neurologic:
- $\checkmark$ Sensory (have patient close eyes, randomly touch forehead, cheek, chin, upper and lower extremities and note sensation)
- $\checkmark$ Motor (verbalize performance of Romberg test and how it is performed)

\section*{Inspection of the Breast}
- There are 4 major sitting position of the client used for clinical breast examination. Every client should be examined in each position. The client is seated with her arms on her side. The client is seated with her arms abducted over the head. The client is seated and is pushing her hands into her hips, simultaneously eliciting contraction of the pectoral muscles. The client is seated and is learning over while the examiner assists in supporting and balancing her.

\section*{Inspection of the Breast}
- While the client is performing these maneuvers, the breasts are carefully observed for symmetry, bulging, retraction, and fixation. An abnormality may not be apparent in the breasts at rest a mass may cause the breasts, through invasion of the suspensory ligaments, to fix, preventing them from upward movement in position 2 and 4. Position 3 specifically assists in eliciting dimpling if a mass has infiltrated and shortened suspensory ligaments.

\section*{Inspection of the Breast}

\section*{Normal Findings:}
- The overlying the breast should be even. May or may not be completely symmetrical at rest.
- The areola is rounded or oval, with same color, (Color varies from light pink to dark brown depending on race).
- Nipples are rounded, everted, same size and equal in color. No "orange peel" skin is noted which is present in edema.
- The veins maybe visible but not engorge and prominent.
- No obvious mass noted.
- Not fixated and moves bilaterally when hands are abducted over the head, or is learning forward. No retractions or dimpling.

\section*{Palpation of the Breast}
- Palpate the breast along imaginary concentric circles, following a clockwise rotary motion, from the periphery to the center going to the nipples. Be sure that the breast is adequately surveyed. Breast examination is best done 1 week post menses. Each areolar areas are carefully palpated to determine the presence of underlying masses. Each nipple is gently compressed to assess for the presence of masses or discharge.
