\section*{I. HEALTH ASSESSMENT}

\section*{History Taking}

Definition
History taking in its simplest form involves asking appropriate questions of patients or their relatives or carers to obtain information to aid diagnosis. It is identified as a core clinical skill for professional competence.

\section*{Purpose}

The purpose of obtaining a health history is to gather subjective data from the patient and/or the patient's family so that the health care team and the patient can collaboratively create a plan that will:
- promote health,
- address acute health problems, and
- minimize chronic health conditions.

\section*{Procedure Steps}
1. Introduce yourself, identify your patient and gain consent to speak with them. ...
2. Step 02 - Presenting Complaint (PC) ...
3. Step 03 - History of Presenting Complaint (HPC) ...
4. Step 04 - Past Medical/Surgical History (PMH/PSH) ...
5. Step 05 - Drug History (DH) ...
6. Step 06 - Family History (FH) ...
7. Step 07 - Social History (SH)
8. Step 08 -Review of Systems (ROS)
9. Step 09 -Summary of History
10. Step 10 -Patients' Questions/Feedback

\section*{11. Step 11 -Thanking the Patient}

\section*{Procedure Steps}

Step 01
Introduce yourself, identify your patient and gain consent to speak with them. Should you wish to take notes as you proceed, ask the patients permission to do so.

\section*{Step 02 - Presenting Complaint (PC)}

This is what the patient tells you is wrong, for example: chest pain.

\section*{Step 03 - History of Presenting Complaint (HPC)}

Gain as much information you can about the specific complaint.
Sticking with chest pain as an example you should ask:
- Site: Where exactly is the pain?
- Onset: When did it start, was it constant/intermittent, gradual/ sudden?
- Character: What is the pain like e.g. sharp, burning, tight?
- Radiation: Does it radiate/move anywhere?
- Associations: Is there anything else associated with the pain, e.g. sweating, vomiting.
- Time course: Does it follow any time pattern, how long did it last?
- Exacerbating / relieving factors: Does anything make it better or worse?
- Severity: How severe is the pain, consider using the 1-10 scale?

The SOCRATES acronym can be used for any type of pain history.

\section*{Step 04 - Past Medical History (PMH)}

Gather information about a patients other medical problems (if any).
In the past surgical history, inquire about history of falls, blood transfusion, injuries, road traffic accidents, operations, burns etc

Step 05 - Drug History (DH)

Find out what medications the patient is taking, including dosage and how often they are taking them, for example: once-a-day, twice-a-day, etc.

At this point it is a good idea to find out if the patient has any allergies.

\section*{Step 06 - Family History (FH)}

Gather some information about the patients family history, e.g diabetes or cardiac history. Find out if there are any genetic conditions within the family, for example: polycystic kidney disease.

\section*{Step 07 - Social History (SH)}

This is the opportunity to find out a bit more about the patient's background. Remember to ask about smoking and alcohol. Depending on the PC it may also be pertinent to find out whether the patient drives, e.g. following an MI patient cannot drive for one month. You should also ask the patient if they use any illegal substances, for example: cannabis, cocaine, etc.

Also find out who lives with the patient. You may find that they are the carer for an elderly parent or a child and your duty would be to ensure that they are not neglected should your patient be admitted/remain in hospital.

\section*{Step 08 - Review of Systems (ROS)}

Gather a short amount of information regarding the other systems in the body that are not covered in your HPC.

The above example involves the CVS so you would focus on the others.
These are the main systems you should cover:
- CVS
- Respiratory
- GI
- Neurology
- Genitourinary/renal
- Musculoskeletal
- Psychiatry

Please note these are the main areas, however some courses will also teach the addition of other systems such as ENT/ophthalmology.

\section*{Step 09 - Summary of History}

Complete your history by reviewing what the patient has told you. Repeat back the important points so that the patient can correct you if there are any misunderstandings or errors.

You should also address what the patient thinks is wrong with them and what they are expecting/hoping for from the consultation. A useful acronym for this is ICE [I]deas, [C]oncerns and $[\mathrm{E}] \times p e c t a t i o n s$.

\section*{Step 10 - Patient Questions / Feedback}

During or after taking their history, the patient may have questions that they want to ask you. It is very important that you don't give them any false information. As such, unless you are absolutely sure of the answer it is best to say that you will ask your seniors about this or that you will go away and get them more information (e.g. leaflets) about what they are asking. These questions aren't necessarily there to test your knowledge, just that you won't try and 'blag it'.

\section*{Step 11 Thanking the Patient}

When you are happy that you have all of the information you require, and the patient has asked any questions that they may have, you must thank them for their time and say that one of the doctors looking after them will be coming to see them soon.

\section*{Nutritional Assessment}

Definition: A nutrition assessment is an in-depth evaluation of both objective and subjective data related to an individual's food and nutrient intake, lifestyle, and medical history.

Definition: Nutrition assessment includes taking anthropometric measurements and collecting information about a client's medical history, clinical and biochemical characteristics, dietary practices, current treatment, and food security situation.

Once the data on an individual is collected and organized, the practitioner can assess and evaluate the nutritional status of that person.

\section*{Purpose}

The purpose of nutritional screening is to:
I. Rapidly identify patients at high nutritional risk.
II. Define a patient's nutritional status
III. Define clinically relevant malnutrition
IV. Monitor changes in nutritional status.

\section*{Importance of Nutrition assessment}
1. To identify people at risk of malnutrition for early intervention or referral before they become malnourished.
2. To identify malnourished clients for treatment- malnourished people who are not treated early have longer hospital stays, slower recovery from infection and complications, and higher morbidity and mortality.
3. To track child growth.
4. To identify medical complications that affects the body's ability to digest food and utilize nutrients.
5. To detect practices that can increase the risk of malnutrition and infection
6. To inform nutrition education and counselling.
7. To establish appropriate nutrition care plans.

The results of a client's nutrition assessment and classification of nutritional status determine all the other elements of nutrition assessment, counselling, and support (NACS) for that individual -including counselling, treatment, and referral to food security and other support.

If health care providers can't assess every client's nutritional status, what clients should they prioritize?
i. Children under 2 years of age, especially if they are not breastfed
ii. Women who are pregnant or up to 6 months postpartum
iii. People who report unintentional weight loss
iv. People who have been prescribed specialized food products to treat malnutrition
v. People with disease-related symptoms that can be managed through diet
vi. People with HIV, tuberculosis (TB), or other chronic diseases.

A comprehensive nutritional assessment includes:
(1) anthropometric measurements of body composition;
(2) biochemical measurements of serum protein, micronutrients, and metabolic parameters;
(3) clinical assessment of altered nutritional requirements and
(4) social or psychological issues that may preclude adequate intake

\section*{Nutrition screening?}

Full nutrition assessment can be preceded by rapid and simple identification of people who may be malnourished or at risk of malnutrition and need more detailed nutrition assessment. Nutritionists and trained facility-based health care providers or community service providers can do nutrition screening in health care facilities, during growth monitoring or home-based care, and during support group meetings. Simple nutrition screening can include:
- Checking for bilateral pitting edema,
- Measuring weight and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and
- Asking about recent illnesses and appetite.

Nutrition screening requires standardized training in line with national and local health policy. Special training materials may be needed for low-literacy or illiterate populations. Community service providers need government-approved recording and referral materials, and clear guidance on provider roles, whom to screen,

\section*{How often should nutrition assessment be done?}

The frequency of nutrition assessment depends on a client's age and pregnancy and disease status and on national policies.
The recommendations below should be adjusted based on national guidelines.

\section*{Frequency of Nutrition Assessment}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline sno & Group & When to come for Nutritional assessment \\
\hline 1 & Pregnant/postpartum women & On every antenatal visit \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Methods of Nutritional Assessment}

An easy way to remember types of nutrition assessment is ABCD :
Anthropometric, Anthropometry is the measurement of the size, weight, and proportions of the body. Common anthropometric measurements include:
i. weight,
ii. height,
iii. MUAC,
iv. head circumference, and
v. skinfold

Body mass index (BMI) and weight-for-height are anthropometric measurements presented as indexes.

Recommended pre-pregnancy BMI

\section*{Pre-pregnancy nutritional status}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline S/no. & Category & Weights \\
\hline 1 & Pre-pregnancy BMI Underweight & Less than 18.5 \\
\hline 2 & Normal weight & 18.5-24.9 \\
\hline 3 & Overweight & 25.0-29.9 \\
\hline 4 & Obese & 30 or more \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note: BMI is not an accurate indicator of nutritional status during pregnancy; during that period, MUAC should be used.

Weight- taken by use of a weighing scale that is well serviced for accuracy.
Length for height- Measuring length or height requires a height board or measuring tape marked in centimeters (cm).
Weight for height
MUAC- MUAC is the circumference of the left upper arm measured at the mid-point between the tip of the shoulder and the tip of the elbow, using a measuring or MUAC tape. MUAC measurements in millimeters ( mm ) are more accurate than measurements in cm .

\section*{MUAC cutoffs to classify nutritional status in children 6 months to 14 years of age}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Age & \begin{tabular}{l}

\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline $5-9$ years & $<135 \mathrm{~mm}$ & $\geq 135$ to $<145 \mathrm{~mm}$ & $\geq 145 \mathrm{~mm}$ \\
\hline $10-14$ years & $<160 \mathrm{~mm}$ & $\geq 160$ to $<185 \mathrm{~mm}$ & $\geq 185 \mathrm{~mm}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{MUAC cutoffs to classify nutritional status in adults}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & Non-pregnant & Non-postpartum Pregnant & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Postpartum \\
status
\end{tabular} \\
\hline 1 & $<185 \mathrm{~mm}$ & $<190 \mathrm{~mm}$ & SAM \\
\hline 2 & $\geq 185 \mathrm{to}<220 \mathrm{~mm}$ & $\geq 190 \mathrm{to}<230 \mathrm{~mm}$ & Moderate malnutrition \\
\hline 3 & $\geq 220 \mathrm{~mm}$ & $\geq 230 \mathrm{~mm}$ & Normal nutritional status \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The anthropometric indicator cutoffs included in this module are the recommended standards. However countries may use different cutoffs.

\section*{BMI}

BMI is an anthropometric indicator based on weight to-height ratio. It is used to classify malnutrition in nonpregnant/non-postpartum adults. BMI is not an accurate indicator of nutritional status in pregnant women or adults with edema. Use MUAC for these groups. Calculate BMI by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of the person's height in meters. You will have to convert measurements in cm to $\mathrm{m}(100 \mathrm{~cm}=1 \mathrm{~m})$.

BMI $=$ weight (kg) /height2 (m)
BMI can also be found using look-up tables or a BMI wheel. BMI values below or above the WHO range for normal nutritional status (shown in the table below) indicate a need for nutrition interventions to slow or reverse weight.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline BMI & Nutritional status \\
\hline < 16.0 & Severe malnutrition \\
\hline $\geq 16.0$ to < 17.0 & Moderate malnutrition \\
\hline $\geq 17.0$ to < 18.5 & Mild malnutrition \\
\hline $\geq 18.5$ to < 25.0 & Normal nutritional status \\
\hline $\geq 25.0$ to < 30.0 & Overweight \\
\hline $\geq 30.0$ & Obesity \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Biochemical assessment}

Biochemical assessment means checking levels of nutrients in a person's blood, urine, or stools. Lab test results can give trained medical professionals useful information about medical problems that may affect appetite or nutritional status.

Clinical Assessment: Clinical assessment includes:
Checking for visible signs of nutritional deficiencies such as:
- bilateral pitting edema,
- emaciation (a sign of wasting, which is loss of muscle and fat tissue as a result of low energy intake and/or nutrient loss from infection),
- hair loss,
- Changes in hair colour.

It also includes:
- taking a medical history to identify comorbidities with nutritional implications,
- opportunistic infections,
- other medical complications,
- usage of medications with nutrition related side effects,
- food and drug interactions,
- risk factors for disease (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, overweight) that affect or are affected by diet and nutritional status.

Assessment of nutritional status in infants less than 6 months involves:
- Checking for clinical signs of acute malnutrition such as visible wasting,
- Bilateral pitting oedema
- Inability to suckle
- Ineffective breastfeeding and
- Recent weight loss or failure to gain weight,
- Risk factors such as insufficient breast milk or absence of the mother.

Clinical nutrition assessment for this age group should also assess:
Infant feeding practices, especially access to breast milk.
Checking for or asking clients about symptoms of infection that can increase nutrient needs (e.g., fever) and nutrient loss (e.g., diarrhea and vomiting), as well as medical conditions (e.g., HIV, celiac disease) that impair digestion and nutrient absorption and increase the risk of developing malnutrition.
Medical records should provide information about:
- Illness,
- Hospitalizations,
- Operations,
- Diagnostic tests and therapies,
- Medications that can affect nutritional status.

Some medications can interfere with nutrient absorption, digestion, metabolism, and utilization. Likewise, nutritional status and diet can affect how medications work. Information about the medications clients are taking allows health care providers to counsel them on how to manage drug-food interactions and drug side effects.

Nutrition Counselling. For children, clinical assessment may also include history of growth patterns, patterns, onset of puberty, and developmental history.

\section*{Bilateral pitting edema, also called nutritional edema:}

Is swelling in both feet and legs (bilateral) caused by the accumulation of excess fluid under the skin in the spaces within tissues? Either too much fluid moves from the blood vessels into the tissues or not enough fluid moves from the tissues back into the blood vessels. This imbalance can cause swelling in one or more parts of the body.
Bilateral pitting edema is characterized by pitting in the skin (i.e., a visible indentation that persists after the pressure is released from skin that has been pressed by a thumb).
Edema is a sign of severe malnutrition ONLY if it exists in both feet and both legs.

Other causes of edema, especially in adults, that are not related to nutrition include:
1. Congestive heart disease
2. Lymphatic disorders
3. Kidney disease
4. Among other conditions.

Bilateral pitting edema is a sign of severe malnutrition on its own, regardless of the results of anthropometric assessment. Anyone with severe bilateral pitting edema (Grade +++), even with appetite and no medical complications, should be admitted for inpatient management of severe acute malnutrition. A person with bilateral pitting edema Grades + or ++ with appetite and no medical complications should be treated for severe acute malnutrition on an outpatient basis Anthropometry is the measurement of the size, weight, and proportions of the body. Common anthropometric measurements include weight, height, MUAC, head circumference, and skinfold

\section*{Dietary.}

Assessing food and fluid intake is an essential part of nutrition assessment. It provides information on dietary quantity and quality, changes in appetite, food allergies and intolerance, and reasons for inadequate food intake during or after illness. The results are compared with recommended intake such as recommended dietary allowance (RDA)7 to counsel clients on how to improve their diets to prevent malnutrition or treat conditions affected by food intake and nutritional status (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia). Several common ways to assess dietary intake are described next.
1. 24-hour recall this method was designed to quantify the average dietary intake for a group of people, although it can be used to assess individual nutrition intake. During a recall, a client is asked to remember in detail every food and drink consumed during the previous 24 hours. The method can be repeated on several occasions to account for day to-day variation in intake. Health care providers may prompt clients to remember what they ate or drank by time periods or activities (e.g., just after waking up, before going to bed) or to estimate portion sizes by looking at household measures, food models, household utensils, photographs, or actual food.
2. Food frequency questionnaire A food frequency questionnaire is designed to obtain information on overall dietary quality rather than nutrient composition and intake. The food frequency questionnaire examines how often someone eats certain foods, and sometimes the size of the portions. This method is quick and inexpensive but underreporting is common.
3. Food group questionnaire Another way to do dietary assessment is to show clients pictures of different food groups (often available from national nutrition authorities) and ask whether they ate or drank any of those foods the previous day.

\section*{Physical Examination:}

Definition: Physical examination is the process of evaluating objective anatomic findings through the use of observation, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. The information obtained must be thoughtfully integrated with the patient's history and pathophysiology.

Definition : Physical assessment is a systematic data collection method that uses the senses of sight, hearing, smell and touch to detect health problems. There are four techniques used in physical assessment and these are:- Inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Usually history taking is completed before physical examination

\section*{What does Physical examination entail.}

A physical examination may include checking vital signs, including temperature examination, Blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. ... Four actions are taught as the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen).

\section*{Purpose of Physical Examination}

A physical examination is recommended at least once a year, especially in people over the age of 50. These exams are used to:
- check for possible diseases so they can be treated early
- identify any issues that may become medical concerns in the future
- update necessary immunizations
- ensure that you are maintaining a healthy diet and exercise routine
- build a relationship with your PCP

\section*{Sequence of physical examination}

The order of techniques is as follows
(Inspect - Palpation - Percussion - Auscultation) except for the abdomen which is Inspect Auscultation - Percuss - Palpate.

\section*{Techniques of Physical examination}

There are four techniques used in Physical Examination:
i. inspection,
ii. palpation,
iii. percussion, and
iv. auscultation.

\section*{Principles of physical examination}

Physical examination is the process of evaluating objective anatomic findings through the use of observation, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. The information obtained must be thoughtfully integrated with the patient's history and pathophysiology.

\section*{Inspection}

It's the use of vision to distinguish the normal from the abnormal findings. Body parts are inspected to identify color, shape, symmetry, movement, pulsation and texture.

\section*{Principles of inspection}
- Availability of adequate light
- Position and expose body part to view all surfaces
- Inspect each area for size, shape, color, symmetry, Position and abnormalities.
- If possible compare each area inspected with the same area on the opposite side.
- Use additional light to inspect body cavities

\section*{Palpation}

It involves use of hands to touch body parts for data collection. The EMT uses fingertips and palms to determine the size, shape, and configuration of underlying body structure and pulsation of blood vessels. It help to detect the outline of organs such as thyroid, spleen or liver and mobility of masses. It detects body temperature, moisture, turgor, texture, tenderness, thickness, and distension.

\section*{Principles of palpation}
- Help client to relax and be comfortable because muscle tension impairs effective assessment.
- Advise client to take slow deep breaths during palpation \#
- Palpate tender areas last and note nonverbal signs of discomfort.
- Rub hands to warm them, have short fingernails and use gentle touch

\section*{Percussion}

It is the technique in which one or both hands are used to strike the body surface to produce a sound called percussion note that travels through body tissue. The character of the sound determines the location, size and density of underlying structure to verify abnormalities. An abnormal sound suggest a mass or substance like air, fluid in an organ or cavity.

\section*{Auscultation}

It involves listening to sounds and a stethoscope is mostly used. Various body systems like cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal have characterized sounds. Bowel, breath, heart and blood movement sounds are heard using the stethoscope. It is important to know the normal sound to distinguish from abnormal.

\section*{Preparation for Physical examination}

Infection prevention Follow IP precaution through out procedure Environment P/A requires privacy and away from other destructors throughout Equipment Get all the necessary equipment, other equipment needs to be warmed before being placed on the body e.g. rubbing diaphragm of the stethoscope briskly between hands. Patient preparation Prepare the patient physically and make the patient comfortable throughout the physical assessment for successful exam. Explain to the patient everything to be done.

\section*{Head to toe assessment}

General survey The assessment of the patient/client begins on the first contact. It includes apparent state of health, level of consciousness, and signs of distress. The general height, weight, and build can be noted including skin colour, dressing, grooming, personal hygiene, facial expression, gait, odour, posture and motor activity.

Note: If there is a sign of acute distress comprehensive health assessment is deferred until when patient is stable.

\section*{Vital signs}

Assessment of vital signs is the first in physical assessment because positioning and moving the client during examination interferes with obtaining accurate results. Specific vital signs can be also obtained during assessment of individual body system.

\section*{Skin,hair,sculp and nails}

Inspect all skin surfaces first or gradually while assessing the systems. Use the skills of inspection, palpation, and olfactory to assess the function. Skin Inspect skin for color, edema, lesions, scars and vascularity. Palpate to notice moisture, temperature, and skin turgor,

\section*{Hair and scalp}

Assess and note type of hair i.e. long, coarse, thick, brittle. Note the color, distribution, quantity, thickness, texture and lubrication. On inspection separate the hair to determine the scalp. Wear clean gloves if lesions and lice are probable.

\section*{Nails}

The condition of the nails reflects the general health, state of nutrition, occupation, and level of self care. Nail biting can reveal the person's psychological state. Inspect the nail bed for color, cleanliness, length, texture, angle between nail and nail bed and folds around the nail. Palpate the nail for inflammation

\section*{Head and Neck}

The assessment of the head includes:- eyes, ears, nose, mouth and pharynx. The assessment of the neck includes:- lymph nodes, carotid artery, thyroid gland and trachea.

\section*{Eyes,ears}

Assess visual acuity, position and alignment of the eyes, eyebrows and eyelids. Note any abnormal discharges and color of conjunctiva and sclera. It determines the integrity of the ear structures and hearing acuity. Inspect for sore and discharges

\section*{Nose and Sinuses}

Assess the integrity of the nose and sinuses by using inspection and palpation. Nose Observe for shape, size, skin color, and presence of deformity or inflammation. Sinuses The exam involves palpation. Incase of allergy or infection the inside is inflamed and swollen so palpate for tenderness

\section*{Mouth and Pharynx}

Assess mouth and pharynx to determine overall health and hygiene. Use pen light and tongue depressor to assess oral cavity. Lips Inspect lips for color, texture, hydration, contour, sores and lesions.

\section*{Buccal mucosa, gums, teeth}

Ask client to clench teeth and smile to observe to observe teeth occlusion, symmetry. A symmetrical smile shows normal nerve function. Inspect teeth for hygiene, position, and alignment. Let client open with lips relaxed, use tongue depressor to inspect the mucosa for color, moisture and sores. Inspect gums for color, edema, retraction, bleeding and lesions.

\section*{Tongue and floor of mouth}

Carefully inspect tongue on all sides as well as floor of mouth for color, size, position, texture, moisture sores and lesions. Palate Have client extend the head backwards, holding the mouth open, inspect the hard and soft palate for color, shape, texture and extra bonny prominences or defects.

\section*{Pharynx}

Let the client tip the head back slightly, open mouth wide and say "Ah", with penlight inspect the uvula and soft palate, they should rise centrally as the client say "Ah" to determine the function of cranial( vagus ) nerve function. Check the uvula and tonsils for redness and inflammation.

\section*{Neck}

Palpate the muscles, lymph nodes, carotid artery jugular veins for tenderness and distention. Thyroid gland Ask client to hyperextend the neck and view the thyroid and palpate for masses. Normally thyroid gland is not visible.

\section*{Chest}

Inspect the skin for scars, sores, color, lesions, chest, movement and respiratory rate. Palpate to notice any masses, and tenderness in axillae and breast. Lungs Auscultate to assess respiratory and sounds from the lungs and chest cavity. Percussion is done to detect accumulation of fluid or air in the chest cavity.

\section*{Heart}

Auscultate to hear the heart sound. Learn to know the normal heart sound to be able to detect the abnormal Breast Inspect the breast for skin color, scars and lesions. Palpate to notice any presence of masses.

\section*{Extremities}

Upper and lower extremities Inspect hand and legs for symmetry, alignment, skin color, temperature, sores, scars, lesions inflammation and varicosity. Palpate for tenderness, edema and pulsation of arteries. Use the brachial, radial, ulna, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibia and dorsalis pedis pulses. Check capillary refill on nails, clubbed toes /fingers and joint mobility.

\section*{Deep tendon reflexes}

Normally done on high risk patients and needs specialized practice and special hammer to assess the reflexes. Areas that are assessed are on biceps, triceps, patella, and Achilles.

\section*{Abdomen}

Inspect the skin for color, sores, lesions, scars, position of umbilicus, distention and contours. Palpate for tenderness, masses and enlargement of other organs like liver, spleen and kidney. Ask for bowel and bladder elimination. Percussion is used to detect the location of organs that are normally palpable e.g. liver, spleen and intestines. Always auscultate before palpation or percussion because touching can alter mobility of bowel and increase sound.

\section*{Genitalia}

Start assessment of genitalia with asking questions and do inspection to confirm a positive answer. Female Ask about presence of abnormal discharge, sores, warts and itching Male Ask any presence of sores, itching, warts and abnormal discharge.

\section*{Rectum and anus}

Inspect for the skin color, sores, hemorrhoids and lesions. Do digital palpation to examine the anal canal for masses and sphincters function only when important.

\section*{II. THE NURSING PROCESS}

\section*{NURSING PROCESS}

\section*{Definition:}

Is a systematic and dynamic method of problem solving approach.
It is a systematic, problem solving approach toward giving individual nursing care that focuses on identifying and treating unique responses of individuals or groups to actual or potential alterations in health.
It involves the application of critical thinking to client care activities.
It allows nurses to communicate plans and activities to clients, other health care professionals and families
It encourages orderly thought, analysis, and planning.
It is specific to nursing.

\section*{Process}

A series of steps or acts that lead to accomplishment of some goal or purpose

\section*{Advantages of the Nursing Process}
1. Provides individualized care
2. Client is an active participant
3. Promotes continuity of care
4. Provide more effective communication among nurses and healthcare professionals
5. Develops a clear and efficient plan of care
6. Provides personal satisfaction as you can see client achieve goals
7. Professional growth as you evaluate effectiveness of your interventions

\section*{Purpose}

Is to provide client care that is:
- Individualized
- Holistic
- Effective
- Efficient

Nursing process is central to nursing actions
It is an efficient method of organizing thought processes for clinical decision making and problem solving
Provides framework within which the individualized needs of the client, family and community can be met.
Ensures that care is planned, individualized and reviewed over period of time that patient and nurse have a professional relationship.

Why do we need to plan care?
Patient has a right to expect to receive complete and high quality care. Gaps will exist if care planning is not done.
Care planning and its documentation provide and promote means of professional communication.
Care planning provides a comfort level for providing ready reference to help ensure that care is complete.
Provide a guideline for documentation and promotes practice within legally defined standards.
Care planning provide legal protection of the nurse
The accreditation status of health care agency, can depend on consistent documentation that planning of care has been done.

\section*{Characteristics/Properties of Nursing Process}
1. It is a framework for providing nursing care to individuals, families and communities.
2. It is orderly and systematic (assessment, diagnosis, outcome identification, planning, implementation, evaluation).
3. Dynamic (continuous change)
4. Interpersonal and collaborative (interactive and reciprocal relationship between nurse and patient)
5. Flexible (can be adapted to nursing practice, phrases may be used sequentially or concurrently)
6. Theoretically based (derived from a broad base knowledge....Science and Humanities)
7. Goal oriented
8. Universally applicable.
9. Interdependent.
10. Provides specific care for individuals, families and communities
11. It is client centered, using the client's strength.
12. It is appropriate for use throughout the lifespan.
13. It can be used in all settings.

Application of the nursing process in the provision of quality nursing care.
Nursing process is dynamic and requires creativity in its application.
Steps remain the same
Application and results are different.
Used throughout the lifespan in any care setting.

\section*{Step \#1 ASSESSMENT}

Is the systematic collection of data
It begins with the nurse's first contact with the client and continues as long as a need for healthcare exists.
During assessment, the nurse collects information to determine areas of abnormal function, risk factors that contribute to health problems and client strengths.
It involves:
i. Collecting data (from variety of sources)
ii. Validating data - act of "double checking or verifying data to confirm that it is accurate or factual.
iii. Organizing the data
iv. Interpreting the data: relevant versus irrelevant, bridging gaps that may arise, identifying patterns that have resemblance.
v. Documenting the data.

Goal of Assessment: establishing a data base about the client's response to health concerns or illness.
The assessment techniques are basically 4 :
i. Interviews
ii. Physical examination
iii. Observation
iv. Laboratory investigations

\section*{Types of assessment}
1. Comprehensive assessment
2. Focused assessment
3. Ongoing assessment

\section*{1. Comprehensive assessment}

Provides the baseline data for continued evaluation.
Is physical and psychological
Is the initial information about the client's physical, emotional, social and spiritual health.
It is lengthy and comprehensive.

Nurse obtains data base information during the admission interview and physical examination.
Information obtained serves as a reference for comparing all future data and provides the evidence used to identify the client's initial problems.
Comparing of ongoing assessments with baseline data helps determine whether the client's health is improving deteriorating or remaining unchanged.

\section*{2. Focused assessment}

Limited in scope
Involves screening for a specific problem.
It is short stay
It gives information that provides more details about specific problems and expands the original data base. e.g. During the initial interview the client tell the nurse that "constipation is the rule rather than the exception." More questions follow. The nurse obtains data about:
- The client's dietary habits
- Level of activity
- Fluid intake
- Current medications
- Frequency of bowel elimination
- Stool characteristics

The nurse may tell the client to save the stool specimen for inspection.
Focus assessments generally are repeated or done on a schedule basis to determine trends in a client's condition and responses to therapeutic interventions e.g. conducting postoperative surgical assessments, monitoring the client's level of pain before and after administering medications.

\section*{3. Ongoing assessment}

Done during follow-up
Reason for monitoring and observation related to specific problems

\section*{SOURCES OF DATA}

\section*{Primary sources include:}
- Client
- Interview
- Physical examination

\section*{Secondary sources}
- Family members
- Other healthcare providers-have discussions with them
- Medical records -gives information in current and past
- Reports
- Test results

\section*{TYPES OF DATA}

Data are either:
I. Objective
II. Subjective

\section*{1. Objective data}

Are observable and measurabales anationd a if stude crign of a disorder e.g.
- a client's BP measurement
- Main ways to collect objective data:
- Physical examination
- Lab and diagnostic testing

\section*{2. Subjective data}

Consists of information that only the client feels and can describe.
They are called symptoms e.g. pain, feelings, perceptions, concerns.
The main way to collect subjective data:
Interview
Examples of subjective and objective data.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Objective data & Subjective data \\
\hline Weight & Pain \\
\hline Temperature & Nausea \\
\hline Skin colour & Depression \\
\hline Blood cell count & Fatigue \\
\hline Vomiting & Anxiety \\
\hline Bleeding & Loneliness \\
\hline Diarrhea & \\
\hline Pulse rate & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Organizing of data}

Interpretation of data is easier if information is organized.
Organization involves:
- Grouping related information.
- Using knowledge and past experiences, nurses can cluster related data.
- Data organized into small groups is easier to analyze and takes on more significance than when the nurse considers each fact separately or examines the entire group at once e.g.
On assessment findings you get:
i. Lassitude
ii. Distended abdomen
iii. Dry, hard stool passed with difficulty
iv. Fever
v. Weak cough
vi. Thick sputum

\section*{Related clusters:}
I. Lassitude, fever
II. Weak cough, sputum
III. Distended abdomen. Dry, hard stool passed with difficulty

\section*{Differentiate between Cues and Inferences}

Cues-objective and subjective data observed or given by the client or the client's companion Inferences -Nurses conclusion of the cues.
e.g.
the nurse observes that the patient has dry skin and mucous membranes (cues) but records that the patient is dehydrated (Inference).

\section*{NURSING DIAGNOSIS}

\section*{Content:}
i. Changes in nursing diagnosis
ii. Components of the nursing diagnosis
iii. Types of nursing diagnosis
iv. Classification of nursing diagnosis
v. Review of formulation of nursing diagnosis
vi. Exercise on formulation of nursing diagnosis.
1. Changes in nursing diagnosis What has changed?
- Definition: includes the individual family and community.
- Now NANDA-1 (in response to the broadening scope of its membership)
- Cluster of cues
- 2-yearly reviews/updates
- New diagnostic labels
- Diagnoses grouped into 13 domains

\section*{NANDA-1 (North American Nursing Diagnosis Association)}

Nursing knowledge has expressed through standardized nursing diagnosis language, is what makes NANDA-1 terminology a global standard.
NANDA international has approved more than 200 diagnoses for clinical use, testing and refinement.

\section*{Definition of Nursing Diagnosis}

A clinical judgment concerning a human response to health conditions/life processes, or a vulnerability for that response, by an individual, family, group or community.
It provides a basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcomes for which the nurse has accountability. (Approved at the $9^{\text {th }}$ NANDA Conference; amended in 2009 and 2013)

\section*{Steps in the Diagnostic process}

There are 4 steps involved in the diagnostic phase.:
1. Data analysis
2. Formulation of the nursing diagnosis
3. Verification
4. Documentation

\section*{Analyzing data}

Compare data against standards. (e.g. patient's BP within normal parameters)
Cluster cues and make inferences about data determining the relatedness of facts and their meaning. (e.g. cluster of Pulse-weak, increased rate 100/minute), rhythm change, failure to return to pre-activity level in 5 minutes)
Problem: Activity Intolerance

\section*{Cues versus inferences}

Cues-objective and subjective data observed or given by the client/companion.
Inference-Nurse's conclusion of the cues.
e.g. the nurse observes that patient has dry skin and mucous membranes but records patient is dehydrated.
- Dry skin and mucous membranes are cues
- Dehydrated is an inference

On examination of the eyes, matimantehas anadisshar er nstudioudis able to see.

Nurse reports: Eyes normal
20 year old female patient crying all the time.
Nurse reports: Patient depressed
Analyzing data identifies gaps and inconsistencies which could arise from: measurement errors; unreliable reports; expectations etc.
It determines problems-Actual, Risk, Possible.
Determines whether the problem is a nursing diagnosis.
Determine strengths and establish resources or ability to cope.

\section*{The Nursing Diagnosis}

States a clear and concise health problem.
Derived from existing evidences about the client.
It is potentially amenable to nursing therapy.
It is the basis for planning and carrying out nursing care.
Confirms to NANDA-1 criteria
PES format (Problem, Etiology. Signs and Symptoms)
Cluster of cues
Accuracy etc
Upto date (review after 2 years)
Components of the Nursing Diagnosis
NANDA-1 Criteria
1. The problem (Diagnostic label) $=\mathrm{P}$ differentiates it from other diagnoses
2. Etiology -related factors and joined to the label by the phrase "related to" $=\mathrm{E}$
3. Defining characteristics -signs and symptoms and joined to the etiology by the phrase "as evidenced by" $=\mathrm{S}$

\section*{Diagnostic Label}

Contains qualifier/adjective and the noun.
- Deficient -inadequate in amount, quality, degree, deficient, incomplete
- Impaired -made worse, weakened, damaged, reduced, deteriorated.
- Ineffective -not producing the desired effect

Its purpose is to direct the formation of client's goals and desired outcomes e.g. Activity Intolerance
N/B
Altered and Potential for were removed and are no longer used
Etiology (the "related to" phrase)
- These are those factors that appear to show some type of patterned relationship with the diagnostic label.
- Ideally it should be something that can be treated by the nurse (independent nursing diagnosis)
- If medical intervention is also necessary(a collaborative diagnosis)
- Contains one or more causes of the health problem
- Contributing factors that have influenced the change in health status.
- Gives direction to the required nursing therapy and enables the nurse to individualize the client's care

Related factors are divided into 4 categories
1. Pathophysiologic, Biologic or Psychological
2. Treatment related
3. Situational
4. Maturational.

\section*{Pathophysiologic, Biologic or Psychological}

Cardiovascular factors e.g. CCF, MI, Angina, Arteriosclerosis-inadequate circulation
Hematological e.g. anemia- Compromised oxygen transport
Pulmonary e.g. COPD- deficient tissue oxygenation

\section*{Treatment related}

Can be surgery, medication, diagnostic studies, therapies. (E.g. medications can cause nausea, radiation, fatigue; scheduled surgery can cause anxiety)

\section*{Situational}

Environmental, home, institutional, roles, life experiences. (e.g a flood in a community can contribute to risk for infection; Divorce can cause grieving; Obesity contribute to Activity Intolerance).

\section*{Maturational}

Old age and other age related influences (e.g. elderly-at risk for social isolation; infants at risk for injury; adolescents -risk for infection transmission.)

\section*{Defining characteristics}

The cluster of signs and symptoms that indicate the presence of a diagnostic label.
In an actual nursing diagnosis defining characteristics are the signs and symptoms.
Risk diagnosis do NOT have signs and symptoms but there are factors/ conditions that cause the client to be at increased risk to the problem.

\section*{Types of Defining Characteristics}
I. Major-must be present
II. Minor -may or may not be present

\section*{Example:}

Defining characteristics for Activity Intolerance
Major -Ineffective physiologic response to activity e.g. Increased respiratory rate, shortness of breath.
Minor -Vertigo, Diaphoresis.

\section*{Types of Nursing Diagnosis}

According to parts contained in the statement.
$1^{\text {st }}$ part $=$ Readiness for enhanced nutrition
$2^{\text {nd }}$ part $=$ Activity Intolerance related to deficient oxygen transport
$3^{\text {rd }}$ part $=$ Activity Intolerance related to deficient oxygen transport as evidenced by weak, irregular and increase pulse rate of 115 per minute after 5-10 minutes.
NB: The course emphasizes the 3 part statement.

\section*{Classification of Nursing Diagnosis}
1. Actual
2. Risk
3. Wellness
4. Syndrome
5. Possible

\section*{The course emphasizes Actual and Risk Diagnoses}

\section*{Actual Nursing Diagnosis}

Definition- a clinical judgment that the problem exists at the time of assessment.
Represents a problem that has been validated by the presence of major defining characteristics e.g.
1. Imbalanced Nutrition less than body requirement R/T decreased appetite AEB weight loss of 4 kg .
2. Disturbed sleep pattern R/T cough AEB client verbalization of not feeling rested

\section*{Risk Nursing Diagnosis}

Definition-a clinical judgment where an individual, family or community is more vulnerable to develop the problem than others in the same or similar problem.
The problem does not exist but presence of risk factors indicates that the problem will develop unless the nurse intervenes.
Examples:
1. Risk for impaired skin integrity (lateral aspect left ankle) $R / T$ decrease in peripheral circulation
2. Risk for infection R/T compromised immune system.

\section*{Wellness Nursing Diagnosis}

A clinical judgment about an individual, group, or community in transition from a specific level of wellness to a higher level of wellness.
There must be 2 cues:
1. A desire of increased wellness
2. Effective present status or function

Are 1 part: label begins with "Readiness for enhanced" e.g.
Readiness for enhanced family processes.
Readiness for enhanced communication
Readiness for enhances family processes

\section*{Syndrome Nursing Diagnosis}

Comprise a cluster of actual or high risk nursing diagnosis. R/T a certain event or situation, and are best addressed together and through similar interventions.
Two or more nursing diagnoses must be used as defining characteristics.
Are 1 part statements:
e.g.
1. Disuse syndrome
2. Rape trauma syndrome
3. Relocation stress syndrome
4. Risk for relocation stress syndrome

\section*{Possible Nursing Diagnosis}

Statements that describe a suspected problem requiring additional data. The statement indicates uncertainty.
The nurse has some, but insufficient data to support a confirmed diagnosis.
They are 2 part
e.g.

Possible disturbed self-concept R/T recent loss of role responsibility.
Possible sexual dysfunction R/T anxiety

\section*{Types of Nursing Diagnosis (a different school of thought)}
1. Problem focused
2. Health promotion
3. Risk
4. Syndrome
1. Problem focused

Reflects clinical judgment concerning undesirable human response to health conditions or life processes that exists in a patient.
To make it certain elements must be present including defining characteristics (S/S)- that can be grouped to form recognizable patterns and related factors that are somehow related to , or lead up to the identified problem.
E.g.

Sleep deprivation R/T pain
Impaired bed mobility R/T left sided paralysis
Decreased cardiac output due to MI

\section*{2. Health promotion}

Concerns the motivation and desire to increase well-being and move closer to a person's own optimum health potential.
These diagnoses use terms related to a patient's readiness for specific health behavior's
To make a health promotion diagnosis, there must be:
Defining characteristics that begin with the phrase "express desire to enhance"
e.g.

Sedentary lifestyle
Risk prone behavior
Readiness for enhanced immunization status

\section*{3. Risk nursing diagnoses}

This examines the patients' vulnerability to a health condition or life process.
It requires identification of specific personalized risk factors, such as smoking, advanced age and obesity.
e.g.

Risk for infection
Risk for falls
4. Syndrome

This diagnosis identifies specific groups diagnoses that occur together in a pattern and are best addressed together through similar nursing interventions.
Making a syndrome diagnosis requires 2 or more nursing diagnoses that serve as defining characteristics and related factors, if they add clarity. However related factors are not required.
Example:
Risk for decreased cardiac tissue perfusion
Ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion
Ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion
Related to dysfunctional ventilator response.
A nursing diagnosis encompasses Maslow's hierarchy of needs and helps to prioritize and plan care based on patient centereshs outherome available on

Basic physiological needs/goals must be met before higher needs/goals can be achieved such as self-esteem and self-actualization.
Physiological and safety needs provide the basis for the implementation of nursing care and nursing intervention.
Therefore they are at the base of Maslow's pyramid laying the foundation for physical and emotional health.
1. Basic Physiological Needs: nutrition (water and food), elimination (toileting), airway (suction), breathing (oxygen), circulation (pulse, cardiac monitor, BP), (ABC).
2. Safety and Security: Injury prevention (side rails, call lights, hand hygiene, isolation, suicide precaution, fall precautions, car seats, helmets, seat belts), fostering a climate of trust and safety (therapeutic relationship relationship) patient education/modifiable risk factors for stroke, heart disease.
3. Love and Belonging: foster supportive relationships, methods to avoid social isolation/bullying employ active listening techniques, therapeutic communication, and sexual intimacy.
4. Self-esteem: acceptance: acceptance in the community workforce, personal achievement, sense of control or empowerment, accepting one's physical appearance or body habits.
5. Self-Actualization: Empowering environment, spiritual growth, ability to recognize the point of view of others, reaching one's maximum potential

\section*{CASE STUDY 1}

A 65 year old man has been admitted to the medical ward with a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). He states that "he has difficulty breathing, when walking short distances, his heart feels like it is racing" at the same time HR is $115 \mathrm{~b} / \mathrm{m}, \mathrm{He}$ is tired all the time and while talking to you, he is continually wringing his hands and looking out the window.

\section*{THE SYMPTOMS LIST}
- Difficulty breathing when walking short distances
- Heart feels like it is racing
- Tired all the time
$\checkmark$ Continually wringing his hands
$\checkmark$ Looking out the window

\section*{INTERPRETE THE SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS}
(Patient statement)
"Difficulty breathing when walking short distances" = Exertional discomfort
Defining characteristic for? Nursing diagnosis.
"Heart feels like it is racing" = heart rate response to activity
Defining characteristic for? Nursing diagnosis
"Tired all the time" = verbal report of weakness
Defining characteristic for? Nursing Diagnosis
Activity intolerance R/T deficient tissue oxygenation AEB
"Continually wringing his hands" = Extraneous movement of hands, arms
Defining characteristic for? Nursing Diagnosis
"Looking out of the window" = Poor eye contact, glancing about.....defining characteristic for? Nursing diagnosis.

\section*{NOTE:}

A carefully written individualized R/T statement enables the nurse to plan nursing interventions that will assist the client in accomplishing goals and return to a state of optimum health.
Etiology is not the medical diagnosis.
Should be appropriate for the individual client.

\section*{GUIDELINES IN WRITING THE NURSING DIAGNOSIS}
1. Use R/T -identifies relationship between problem and etiology.
2. Write the nursing diagnosis in legally advisable terms -(e.g. "risk for impaired skin integrity R/T frequent turning.
3. Write the nursing diagnosis without value judgement ("poor" "good")
4. Avoid reversing the clauses (e.g. disorientation R/T sleep pattern disturbance.
5. The first part of the nursing diagnosis should include problems not signs and symptoms
6. The etiology should be expressed in terms that can be changed by nursing intervention (e.g. impaired comfort R/T surgical incision ) is incorrect.
7. The medical diagnosis should not be included in the nursing diagnostic statement.

\section*{EXERCISE}
1. Anxiety $\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{T}$ the disease process
2. Chronic sorrow R/T crying and inability to sleep
3. Risk for injury R/T dizziness secondary to High BP
4. Impaired parenting $\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{T}$ frequent screaming at child
5. Risk for constipation R/T reports of bowel movement once a week.

\section*{ANSWERS}
1. Incorrect- disease process does not communicate what interventions are needed.
2. Incorrect-crying and inability to sleep. Signs and symptoms and not relating factors.
3. Correct
4. Incorrect -frequent screaming at child is a sign of a problem not a "related to" factor.
5. Incorrect -weekly bowel movement is a symptom of constipation, not related to a risk diagnosis.

\section*{Assignment}
1. Formulate 2 actual diagnoses
2. Formulate 2 risk diagnoses.

\section*{PLANNING}

Is the $3^{\text {rd }}$ step in the nursing process.
Definition: A deliberate systematic phase that involves decision making and problem solving. It refers to determining how to prevent, reduce or resolve identified priority client problems.
Determining how to support client's strength
Determining how to implement nursing interventions in an organized individualized and goal directed manner.
Act of determining what can be done to assist the patient to restore, maintain and promote health.

\section*{GOALS}
1. Develop an individualizedraties alanthat sp clfigttiolocidirected outcomes

\section*{2. Related nursing interventions}

\section*{Another definition:}

It is the process of prioritizing nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems, identifying measurable goals and outcomes, selecting appropriate interventions, and documenting the plan of care.
Whenever possible, the nurse consults the client while developing a revising plan.
The assessment data and diagnostic statement direct formulation of client goals and designing nursing interventions to prevent, reduce and eliminate client's problems.
A nursing intervention is any treatment based upon clinical judgment and knowledge that a nurse performs to enhance patient outcomes.
To be effective, a nurse plans care with clients and support persons but not for them.

\section*{TYPES OF PLANNING}

Planning starts from $1^{\text {st }}$ contact with client and continues until nurse-client relationship ends.
All planning is multidisciplinary.

\section*{TYPES}
1. Initial planning
2. Ongoing planning
3. Discharge planning

\section*{Initial Planning}

Comprehensive plan of care developed following admission statement.
Initiated as soon as possible after the initial assessment.

\section*{Ongoing Planning}

What are the patients' needs?
New information, evaluation of client's response to be used for individualized care.
Done at the beginning of the shift

\section*{Purpose}
- Determine whether client's health status has changed.
- Set priorities for the client's care during the shift.
- Decide which problem to focus on during the shift.
- Coordinate nurse's activities so that each problem can be addressed at each client contact.

\section*{Discharge planning}

The process of anticipating and planning for needs after discharge.
Should be addressed in each client's care plan.
Average stay in acute care settings shorter thus people are discharged still needing care.
Effective discharge planning begins at $1^{\text {st }}$ client contact and involves comprehensive and ongoing assessments to obtain information about the client's ongoing needs.
Whose role it is?
- Client?
- Nurse?
- Health care team-collaborative

\section*{Planning process}

Activities of planning process/Components of planning
i. Establishing priorities by ranking nursing diagnoses.
ii. Establishing client goals and criteria (outcome criteria for provide direction for patient's nursing interventions and set standards for determining effectiveness of intervention.
iii. Selecting nursing intervention and activities- actions designed to assist the client in moving from the present level in health status to a status that is described in an expected outcome.
iv. Scientific rationale- reason to support nursing intervention
v. Writing individualized nursing intervention on care plans- outcome of the planning phase.

\section*{Setting priorities}

Prioritization involves ranking from those that are most serious or immediate to those of less importance.
The process of establishing preference order for addressing nursing diagnoses and interventions. The nurse and the client decide on the nursing diagnoses that require first attention.

High priority- life threatening (physiological, psychological and sociological) e.g. impaired respiratory function, cardiac function etc.

Medium priority- health threatening problems e.g. acute and decreased copying ability.
Low priority- requires minimal nursing support arising from normal developmental needs.
Maslow hierarchy of needs.- Physiological needs like food, air and water are basic to life and receive priority than security or activity.
- Consider ABC (airway, breathing, circulation)
- Resolve all priority diagnoses before addressing others
- Priorities change as the clients' responses, problems and therapies change.

\section*{Factors to consider when assigning priorities.}
1. Client's values and beliefs- values concerning health may be important to the nurse than the client
2. Client's priorities- involve client in prioritizing
3. Resources available to the client and nurse, finances, equipment, personnel etc.
4. Urgency of the health problem-life threatening are high priority
5. Medical treatment plan- must be in harmony with other treatment plans.

\section*{Questions}

Assigning priorities to diagnoses for Amanda Aqurlini.

\section*{Nursing diagnoses}
1. Ineffective airway clearance R/T viscous secretion, secondary to deficient fluid volume and shallow chest expansion, secondary pain and fatigue ( high priority)

\section*{Rationale}

Loss of respiratory functioning is a life threatening problem. The nurses' primary concern must be to promote Amanda's oxygenation by addressing the etiologies of this problem.
2. Deficient fluid volume- intake is insufficient to replace fluid loss R/T fever and diaphoresis (high priority)

\section*{Rationale}

Severe fluid volume deficit is life threatening although not that severe for Amanda; it is a high priority problem because it is also a contributing factor to ineffective airway clearance.
Collaborative efforts to improve her hydration have already begun (IVF), the nurse must immediately and continuously assess and promote Amanda's hydration.
3. Anxiety R/T difficulty breathing and concerns over work and parenting roles (Medium priority)

\section*{Rationale}

Although she is concerned about work and parenting roles, these are not a threat to life. Also treatment of her high priority problem, ineffective airway clearance will relieve one of the etiologies of this problem (dyspnea).Meanwhile the nurse must provide symptomatic relief of Amanda's anxiety during periods of dyspnea because extreme anxiety could further compromise her oxygenation by causing her to breathe ineffectively and increase the rate at which she uses oxygen.
4. Risk of interrupted family processes $\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{T}$ mother's illness and potential temporary unavailability of father to provide childcare. (low priority)

\section*{Rationale}

Amanda's child is currently being cared for, if Amanda's husband returns as planned, this problem won't develop into an actual problem. No interventions are needed at present except for continued assessment and reassurance.
5. Impaired nutrition: Less than body requirements R/T decreased appetite, nausea and increased metabolism secondary disease process. (low priority)

\section*{Rationale}

This problem is currently not health threatening but it could be if it were to persist. It will almost certainly resolve in a day or two as the medical problem does not resolve quickly, this will change to medium priority.
6. Bathing/ Hygiene self-care deficit R/T weakness, secondary to ineffective airway clearance and sleep pattern disturbance. (Low priority)

\section*{Rationale}

This problem is caused by the other higher priority problems therefore it will resolve as the high priority problems resolve, meanwhile the nurse merely needs to assist Amanda with bathing so on to support conserve her energy until she is strong enough to resume her own care.
7. Sleep pattern disturbance R/T with cough, pain, orthopnea, fever and diaphoresis. (Low priority)

\section*{Rationale}

Lack of sleep is health threatening, but for the moment (until night) the nurse does not need to address this problem. Sleep pattern disturbance does contribute to Amanda's ineffective airway clearance but it is not the main cause therefore measures to promote sleep will be low priority until evening. After nurse has attended to Amanda's oxygenation and hydration needs, this problem priority will change.
8. Acute pain (chest) R/T cough secondary to pneumonia. (Not on care plan)

The nurse did not include pain as a problem on the care plan because pain is to be addressed as the etiology of sleep pattern disturbance and ineffective airway clearance. The pain etiologies (cough and pneumonia) will be treated with medications (collaborative interventions). Independent nursing interventions would address the problem rather than the etiology and would be the same as the nursing actions for ineffective airway clearance.

\section*{Desired outcome/Client goal.}
- A goal (expected or desired outcome) helps the nursing team know whether the nursing care has been appropriate for managing the client's nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems therefore a written goal accompanies each one.
- The goal statement or outcome contains the criteria or objective evidence for verifying that the client has improved.
- Nurses and clients set goals for each diagnosis after setting priorities.
- Goals are broad statement e.g. improved nutritional status.
- Desired outcomes are more specific e.g. gain 5 kg by May $30{ }^{\text {th }}$. Described in terms of observable client responses and what the nurse hopes to achieve by implementing nursing intervention.

\section*{Purpose.}
1. Provides direction for planning nursing interventions
2. Serve as criteria for evaluating client's progress
3. Enable client and nurse to determine when problem has been resolved
4. Provides a sense of achievement to client and nurse thus motivate them to continue with the plan.
Goals may be short term or long term goals.
Short term goals; for clients who require health care for a short time and clients frustrated by long term goals that are difficult to attain. Short term goals take hours to days but less than a week.
Long term goals takes weeks to months.
For every nursing diagnosis write a desired outcome(s) that when achieved problem will be resolved.

\section*{Questions to ask when developing outcomes/goals}
- What is the client's problem
- What is the opposite, healthy response
- How will the client look/ behave when the healthy response is achieved
- What must the client do and how well do they do it to achieve problem resolution

\section*{COMPONENTS OF GOAL/DESIRED OUTCOME STATEMENT.}
- Subject (noun) is the client, any part of the client, any attribute of the client e.g. Client's pulse or urinary output.
- Verb- action the client is to perform e.g. what the client is to do, learn or experience.
- Conditions or modifiers- explain circumstances under which the behavior is to be performed. They explain what, where, when and how.
- Criteria of desired performance- indicates the standard by which a performance is evaluated or the level at which the client will perform the specified behavior.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR WRITING GOALS/DESIRED OUTCOMES.}
- Write goals and outcomes in of client response not nursing activities.
- Should be realistic for client's capabilities, limitations, designated time span
- Should be compatible with therapies of other professionals.
- Each goal should be derived from the nursing diagnoses
- Use observable, measurable terms for outcomes. Avoid vague words that may require interpretation and judgment by observer e.g. increase daily exercise and improve knowledge of nutrition.
- Make sure the client considers the goal/desired outcomes importance and values them.

\section*{EXAMPLES OF COMPONENTS OF GOALS/DESIRED OUTCOMES}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & & & & OF DESIRED PERFORMANCE \\
\hline 1 & Client & drink s & 2500 ml of fluid & daily (time) \\
\hline 2 & Client & administers & Correct insulin dose & Using aseptic technique (quality standard) \\
\hline 3 & Client & Lists & Three hazards of smocking & Accuracy indicated by 3 hazards \\
\hline 4 & Client & Recalls & Symptoms of diabetes before discharge & Accuracy indicated by 5 symptoms \\
\hline 5 & Client & walks & The length of the hall without cane & By date of discharge (time) \\
\hline 6 & Client & Measures & Less than 10 inches in circumference & In 48 hours (time) \\
\hline 7 & Client & Performs & Leg of ROM exercises as taught & Every 48 hours (time) \\
\hline 8 & Client & Identifies & Foods high in salt from prepared list & Before discharge (time) \\
\hline 9 & Client & states & The purposes of his medications & Before discharge (time) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{SELECTING INTERVENTIONS AND ACTIVITIES (ORDERS)}
- Interventions are nursing actions that a nurse performs to achieve client goals.
- Specific interventions focus on elimination or reducing the etiology of the nursing diagnosis.
- Interventions for risk diagnosis focus on measures to reduce client's risk factors.
- Correct identification of the etiologies during diagnosis phase provides framework for choosing successful nursing interventions.

\section*{TYPES OF NURSING INTERVENTIONS}
1. Direct care- an intervention performed by a nurse through interaction with the client
2. Indirect care- an intervention delegated by the nurse to another provider or performer away from but on behalf of the client e.g. interdisciplinary collaboration or management of care environment.
3. Independent interventions- activities a nurse is licensed to initiate on their basis of knowledge and skills (physical care, ongoing assessment, emotional support and comfort, teaching, counseling, environmental management and referrals)
4. Dependent interventions- are carried out under order or supervision of physician or other healthcare authorized provider e.g. giving medications, IVF, diagnostic tests

\section*{5. Collaborative interventions- carried out by a nurse in collaboration with other care.}

The role of the nurse is to inform and coordinate client's care.

\section*{CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING APPROPRIATE NURSING INTERVENTIONS}

The plan must be;
1. Safe and appropriate for individual's age and health condition
2. Achievable with the resources available
3. Congruent with client's values, beliefs and culture
4. Congruent with other therapies
5. Based on nursing knowledge of best practices
6. Each goal should be derived from one nursing diagnosis
7. Established standards of care as determined by law/MOH/NCK

\section*{PLANNING: DEVELOPING NURSING CARE PLAN (NCP)}

NCP -end product of planning phase.
Maybe Formal or informal plan.
- Informal plan (NCP)-a strategy for action that exists in the nurse's mind.
- Formal NCP=written /computerized guide that organizes information about client's care (provides continuity)
- Standardized Care Plan- a formal plan that specifies the nursing care for groups of clients with common needs (e.g. Myocardial infarction)
- Individualized Care Plan-meets unique needs of a specific client.
- Formal Care Plans directs what needs to be documented in client progress notes, guide delegating and assigning staff to care for clients

Care plans include: the actions nurses must take to address clients' nursing diagnosis and produce desired outcomes.
During planning the nurse must decide which of the client's problems need individualized plans and which can be addressed by standardized plans and routine care.
Write individualized desired outcomes and nursing interventions for client's problems that require nursing interventions beyond preplanned routine care.

\section*{STANDARDIZED APPROACHES TO CAREPLANNING}

Standards of care, standardized care plans, protocols, policies and procedures are developed and accepted in order to:
Ensure that minimally accepted criteria are met.
Promote efficient use of nurses' time by removing the need to author common activities done repeatedly for many of the clients on a nursing unit
Standards of care -
- Describe nursing actions for clients with similar medical conditions rather than individuals.
- Describe achievable rather than ideal nursing care
- Define interventions for which nurses are held accountable

Standardized care plans are pre-developed guides for the nursing care of a client who has a need that arises frequently.
Protocols pre-developed to indicate the actions commonly required for a particular group of clients.
Policies and procedures govern the handling of frequently occurring situations.
Standing orders
Written documents about policies, rules, regulations or orders regarding client care.

\section*{FORMATS FOR THE NURSING CARE PLAN(NCP)}

It has 4 sections:
1. Assessment data
2. Problem/Nursing diagnosis
3. Goals/desired outcomes
4. Evaluation
* Student care plans-maybe more detailed for learning (adding rationale)
* Concept map-a visual tool with ideas, data enclosed in circles/boxes. Relationships between these are indicated connecting lines/arrows.
* Computerized Care Plans-computer generates standardized and individual care plans
* MCP-standardized plan that outlines the care required for clients with common predictable, usually medical conditions with collaborative care plans and critical pathways.

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR WRITING NURSING CARE PLANS (NCP)}
- Date and sign the plan-the date the plan is written is essential for evaluation review and future planning. The nurse's signature demonstrates accountability to client and nursing profession.
- Use category headings "Nursing diagnosis"," Goals/Outcome criteria", "Evaluation". Use a date for evaluation of each goal.
- Use standardized/approved medical terms.
- Be specific with the expected timing of interventions.
- Refer to procedure manual or other sources of information rather than including all steps on a written plan.
- Tailor the plan to the unique characteristics of the client by including client's choices, reinforces client's individuality and sense of control.
- Ensure the Nursing Care Plan incorporates preventive and health maintenance as well as restorative aspects.
- Ensure the plan contains on-going assessments of the client (e.g. inspect incision sites $8{ }^{\text {th }}$ post-operative day)
- include collaborative and coordination activities in the plan.
- Include plans for client's discharge and homecare.

\section*{EXERCISE}
1. Organize nursing diagnosis according to priorities
2. Formulate goals/desired outcomes for each nursing diagnosis
3. Select nursing interventions
4. Write nursing orders
5. Develop a nursing care plan
6. Present nursing care plan for discussion

\section*{IMPLEMENTATION}

\section*{Definition :}
1. Carrying out (or delegating) and documenting planned nursing interventions.
2. Execution of the nursing care plan.

Involves delegation
DO IT
DO IT RIGHT
DO IT RIGHT NOW
3. Action phase
4. Doing and documenting the activities that are specific nursing actions needed to carry out the interventions.

\section*{Goals:}
i. Assist the client to meet desired goals/outcomes
ii. Promote wellness
iii. Prevent illness and disease
iv. Restore health
v. Facilitate coping with altered functioning

The nurse and the client work to achieve mutually planned objectives using actual nursing interventions.
It consists of:
- Execution of the nursing care plan
- Doing, delegating
- Implementing steps that provides the actual nursing activity and client responses that are evaluated in the final step (evaluation)

\section*{Describe the process of selecting and choosing nursing interventions}

Nursing interventions and activities are actions that the nurse performs to achieve goals or desired outcomes
They focus on reducing or eliminating aetiology of the nursing diagnosis.
Treat signs /symptoms and the defining characteristics
Before implementation:
i. Explain intervention to the client
ii. What will be done, what sensations to expect
iii. What he/she is expected to do
iv. What is the expected outcome
v. Ensure privacy-doors, curtains, drape the client.

\section*{Implementation skills}
1. Cognitive/intellectual-include problem solving, decision making, critical thinking and creative thinking, basic sciences
2. Interpersonal-verbal and non-verbal skills for communication-listening.
3. Therapeutic use of self
4. Being willing and being able to care, self-understanding, responsiveness and attitude.
5. Positive attitude translates to attitude meaning higher levels of performance
6. Nurse use of therapeutic communication to understand client and in turn be understood.

\section*{Interpersonal skills include:}
- Conveying knowledge
- Attitude, feelings, interest
- Appreciation of the client's cultural values and lifestyle.

\section*{Technical skills include:}
- Psychomotor for manipulation of equipment
- These are purposeful hands-on skills
- Also called tasks, procedures or psychomotor skills.
- Physical actions controlled by the mind.

\section*{Nursing Interventions}
- Actions taken to help client attain stated goals or outcomes
- Planned using the person's strengths toward self and possibilities
- Derived from scientific knowledge, nursing theories based on research and past nursing experiences.

\section*{Categories of interventions}
1. Diagnostic actions help nurse and client determine needs and course of action e.g.
- observe non-verbal behaviour
- skin colour change
- progress in ambulation
- response to medication
- monitor-check vital signs, blood sugar, weigh the client
- listen -voice tones, listen for cues, clues to a person's need, concerns, wishes, auscultate using a stethoscope
2. Therapeutic
3. Nursing actions planned to maintain strengths and treat problems.
4. Listen-provide opportunity for person to verbalize, sit, touch, acknowledge strengths.
5. Support physiologic needs (ADL)
6. Education -Heath education information

\section*{TYPES OF NURSING INTERVENTIONS}
1. Direct interventions
2. Indirect interventions
3. Independent interventions
4. Dependent interventions
5. Collaborative interventions
1. Direct Care-is an intervention performed through interaction with the client.
2. Indirect care-is an intervention performed away from but on behalf of the client such as interdisciplinary collaboration or management of the care environment.
3. Interdependent interventions-those activities that nurses are licenced to initiate on the basis of their knowledge and skills.
4. Dependent interventions-activities carried out under the primary care providers' orders or supervision or according to specified routines.
5. Collaborative interventions-actions the nurse carries out in collaboration with other health team members. The nurse must choose interventions that are most likely to achieve the goal/desired outcome.

\section*{Criteria for choosing appropriate intervention}
- Should be safe and appropriate for the client's age, health and condition.
- Achievable with the resources available
- Congruent with the client's values, beliefs and culture
- Congruent with other therapies
- Based on nursing knowledge and experience or knowledge from relevant sciences
- Should be within established standards of care

\section*{Activities of the implementation phase}
1. Reassessment of the patient-
- done first before carrying out the procedure to determine if action is still relevant or if other more urgent issues have cropped up.
- The client condition could have changed
- New data may indicate a need to change priorities of care or intervention

\section*{2. Determining the nurse's need for assistance}
- Nurse maybe unable to perform alone, assistance may reduce client's stress, nurse may lack required knowledge, attitude and skills
3. Implementing nursing interventions/orders
- Patient preparation, actual observance of procedure guidelines, scheduling client's contacts, serving as liaison.
- Nursing orders/interventions may be independent, dependent or collaborative measures.
4. Supervising delegated care
- Determines who to carry out what actions
- Ensures actions are in accordance with policy guidelines and care plan.
- NB-remember what, when, where and who to (skills match), delegate to.
5. Communicating Nursing Action

Documentation-interventions and client responses-recurrent, routine, urgent.
- Avoid duplication of activities especially in unconscious patients
- Communication to other members of the health team
- Legal documents

\section*{GUIDELINES}
* Base interventions on Scientific knowledge
* Clearly understand the nursing orders
* Question any that is not understood
* Adapt activity to individual client-individualized care
\$ Implement safe care-infection prevention, barrier nursing etc
* Provide teaching, support and comfort
* Be holistic-physically, socially, spiritually.
$\star$ Respect dignity of client, enhance client's self-esteem.
* Encourage client to participate actively in implementation
* Supervise delegated care
* Document the intervention and client responses in the nursing progress report notes. NB: The degree of participation will depend on the client's health status

\section*{EVALUATION}
$6{ }^{\text {th }}$ Step
Determining whether the client's goals have been met, partially met or not met.
- Means assessing what progress has been made toward meeting expected outcomes.
- Is the feedback and control part of the nursing process
- It requires continuous assessment that began in assessment phase
- Data collected in this phase, measure patient's progress.

Identifying factors that positively or negatively influence goal achievement

\section*{GOAL:}

Determine whether to continue, modify or terminate the plan of care

\section*{Explain how evaluating relates to other phases of the nursing process'}

It depends on the effectiveness of the phases that precede it.
Assessment and nursing diagnosis must be accurate
Goals/desired outcomes must be stated behaviourally to be useful for evaluating
Without implementation phase, there would be nothing to evaluate
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_05_81bfc68a92fd5a7f3421g-38.jpg?height=60&width=1391&top_left_y=2618&top_left_x=367)

In this phase the nurse compares the client's behavioural responses with predetermined client goals and outcome criteria (Craven 1996)
- It is the final step of the nursing process
- Involves making judgment or appraising the extent to which goals are achieved
- Determines whether nursing interventions should be terminated, continued or changed

\section*{TYPES OF EVALUATION}

\author{
Formative/Terminal
}

E,g.
Nursing Diagnosis: impaired skin integrity related to
Intervention -pressure sore dressing
Back care
Change position 2 hourly
Ambulate
Protein rich diet
Evaluation -wound healing observed, tissue red and healthy.
- To determine if the expected outcomes are met, not the nursing interventions.
- Expected outcomes are the standards against which the nurses judges if the goal has been met, and if care is successful
- Helps provide care in a timely, competent and cost effective manner
- Evaluation will determine the effectiveness of care, make necessary modifications and continuously ensure favourable client outcomes.

\section*{PURPOSE}
1. Determine client behavioural response to nursing interventions
2. Compare client's response with predetermined outcome criteria
3. Appraise the extent to which client goals are attained
4. Assess the collaboration of client with healthcare team members
5. Identify the errors in the plan of care
6. Monitor the quality of care

\section*{ACTIVITIES OF EVALUATION}
i. Review outcome criteria-indicated criteria at the planning step
ii. Collect data about desired outcomes both subjective and objective-client response
iii. Compare the client's response to goals and outcome criteria
iv. Interpret e.g. skin turgor indicates degree of dehydration.
v. Summarizing findings
vi. Documenting findings
vii. Care plan revision

NB:
Identifying criteria and standards --the nurse will evaluate the nursing care by knowing what to look for
A client goal and expected outcomes give the objectives criteria needed in a client's response to care.

To write an evaluation statement -make decision about client status and progress.
1. Whether the goal is met and supporting data (list of responses that support conclusion)
2. Evaluate measures to include: assessment skills, technique, auscultation, communication, inspection
3. Draw conclusions about problem status whether the care plan was effective in meeting client's goals e.g.
Actual problem -stated in the nursing diagnosis is solved -Goal completely met. Risk problem diagnosis is prevented but risks still exists to the problem still included in future care plans.
- Actual problem still exists through some part of the goal is met -goal partially met.
- New problem and nursing diagnosis have developed.
- The goal was completely unmet
4. Conclusion drawn-using the evidence above......may result in
- Change of care plan
- No revision in care plan but more time given
- Modification or termination of client care plan
- Review of all phases of the process.
- Ask yourself what were the:
- Successes
- Barriers
- Why, what, where, who?
- Remember to document!!!!

Care plan revision
- Evaluate expected outcomes
- Determine if goal of care has been met
- Adjust the plan or-------
- Discontinue as necessary

\section*{COMPONENTS OF EVALUATION}
1. Collecting data
2. Comparing data
3. Relating nursing activities to outcomes
4. Drawing conclusions
5. Continuing, modifying, terminating care

\section*{CONCLUSION}

All phases can be evaluated.
Assessment
Diagnosis
Planning
Implementation and
Documentation

Evaluation is a planned, on-going, purposeful activity in which clients and healthcare professionals determine the client's progress toward achievement of goals/ outcomes and the effectiveness of the Nursing Care Plan (NCP)
Successful evaluation depends on the effectiveness of the steps that precede it.

Assessment data must be accurate and complete so the nurse can formulate appropriate nursing diagnosis and goals/desired outcomes.
The goals/desired outcomes must be stated concretely in behavioural terms to be useful for evaluating client responses
Without the implementing phase in which the plan is put into action, there would be nothing to evaluate-The evaluation and assessment phases overlap.

During the assessment phase the nurse collects data for the purpose of making diagnoses.
During the evaluation step the nurse collects data for the purpose of comparing the data to preselected goals and judging the effectiveness of the nursing care. The act of assessing (data collection) is the same.
The difference lies in when the data are collected and how the data are used.

\section*{COMPONENTS OF THE EVALUATION PROCESS}
1. Collecting data related to the desired outcomes
2. Comparing the data with outcomes
3. Relating nursing activities to outcomes
4. Drawing conclusions about problem status
5. Continuing, modifying or terminating the nursing care plan

\section*{III. CRITICALLY ILL AND THE UNCONSCIOUS PATIENTS}

\section*{CRITICAL CARE NURSING}

This is the nursing care given to a patient whose health is in danger or in a crisis, so as to save their life or prevent complications.

Critical is defined as 'at a crisis'.
The word 'crisis' is defined in the Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary as: 'The turning point of a disease for better or worse, especially a sudden change
Purpose
- To maintain accurate continuous observations of the patient's vital functions and to treat or support a failing or failed biological system.
- It focuses on the whole body system so as to maintain health.

The patient is considered critical depending on the following factors:
i. The magnitude or extent of anatomical structural damage, for example, second degree burns of more than $25 \%$
ii. Severe injuries to the head or chest
iii. The effect of the disease/condition on circulation, breathing, and electrolyte balance
iv. The organs affected by the disease, for example, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, pulmonary distress, and renal failure
These patients include:
1. Post-operative patients during the first 48 hours
2. Unconscious patients
3. Patients under special procedures, for example under water seal drainage
4. Patients with severe respiratory distress

Note: The patient's survival rate will highly depend on your quick and accurate intervention.
These interventions should be prioritized on the $\mathbf{C A B}$ principles of first aid care, which state that:
- Circulation must be promoted and maintained
- Airway must be established and maintained
- Breathing established

\section*{Critical Care Facilities}

\section*{1. ACUTE ROOM}
- Patients who are nursed here require life support equipment and continuous monitoring or observation.
- Hence this room must be located closer to the nursing station than others.
- These patients do not only need close observation but also full time communication with the nursing team and other health care providers. This ensures continuity of care.
- It is recommended that a nurse should always be in the acute room, preferably at a ratio of one nurse to two patients at any given time.
- An acute room can, therefore, be set up in a ward where one cubicle/corner can be identified and set aside for patients needing critical care in hospitals without established intensive care units.

\section*{Equipment in Acute Room}
- Suction equipment
- Oxygen administration equipment fully assembled, ready for use
- Intravenous administration apparatus
- Adequate stocks of linen as patients nursed in this room often require frequent changing of bed linen.
- Other requirements include observation equipment, a torch, diagnostic sets,

\section*{2. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU)}
- It is a room/unit in which a critically ill patient is being actively treated as well as monitored.
- Intensive care units are more advanced than acute rooms.
- The purpose of intensive care is to maintain life until the precipitating causes of body failure can be identified and successfully treated to allow the system to regain selfcontrol.
- Generally, there is no universally ideal plan for an intensive care unit and each unit varies according to the needs of the patients it will take care of.
- The ratio of nurse to patient should be 1:1 at any given time.
- Ideally, no new hospital should be built without an intensive care unit. Provincial or regional and national hospitals are bound to have ICUs.
- The size of the unit depends on the size of the hospital; one bed for every 50 beds in the hospital is the most ideal

\section*{Types of Intensive Care Units}

\section*{a) General Intensive Care Unit}
- This is where one unit admits all types of patients.
- This is the most common in Kenya. It admits: adults, neonates, pediatrics, cardiac care patients and burns patients
b) Coronary Care Unit
- This admits only those suffering from coronary and heart related emergencies e.g. myocardial infarction and heart surgeries.
c) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)

These admit general pediatric emergencies
e) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)
- Neonates requiring critical care are admitted and managed here.

\section*{f) High Dependent Unit (HDU)}
- These function as a step down to ICU.

Patients are nursed in these units after discharge from ICU before getting to the general wards

\section*{3. BURNS UNIT}
- Used for the care of the patients with burns, however, in the Kenyan health facilities, most burns patients receive care in the general ward of a hospital (due to lack of space or financial capacity).
- The burns unit is basically designed to reduce the risk of infection. Infection in burns occurs as a result of the loss of the mechanical barrier provided by the skin cover.
- It must therefore be maintained at a very high level of cleanliness.
- Infection control measures such as management of visitors and changing of garments and shoes before entering the unit must be adhered to.
- The unit must be well ventilated.
- Medical staff should avoid working in the unit when they have upper respiratory tract infections.
- In an ideal situation, a burns unit is supposed to meet all the requirements of an intensive care unit.

\section*{4. RENAL DIALYSIS UNIT}
- This room is designed to ensure maintenance and sustenance of the life of patients during the dialysis procedure.
- The unit is piped with a specially treated water system to ensure an acceptable electrolytes concentration.
- In addition to the dialysis equipment, the room must be equipped with resuscitation and monitoring equipment just like an intensive care unit.

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CRITICAL ILLNESS}
- Low blood pressure
- Weak peripheral pulse
- Cold extremities and peripheral cyanosis. Poor cardiac output produces constriction of arterioles and stimulation of sweat glands, resulting in characteristically cold, pale and clammy skin.
- Cerebral function alteration: The most frequent signs of impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues .
- Chest pain
- Coma is an obvious sign of severe illness. Drastic changes in mental status may indicate serious hemodynamic or metabolic abnormalities.
- Reduced urinary output
- Dyspnea
- High temperature
- Unexplained fatigue
- Tachycardia or palpitation

\section*{NEEDS OF A CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT}
- Interference of oxygen intake and hence require basic life support in their management.
- Nutrition, for example, those that require artificial feeding such as nasal gastric tube feeding.
- Fluid and electrolyte balance, for example, dehydration.
- Skin integrity, for example, risk of developing bedsores.
- Mobility, for example, lack of movement of joints and muscles.
- The affective domain, for example, feelings, lack of verbal communication.
- Social or cultural issues, for example, family and relatives' anxiety.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF UNCONSCIOUS PATIENTS}

\section*{The Unconscious Client}

\section*{The Consciousness}

A state of wakefulness and awareness of self and the environment
Wakefulness-depends on the integrity of the cerebral hemisphere and the ascending reticular activating system (RAS) in the brain.

Awareness-of one's own existence, sensations, thoughts, surroundings....
Capable of responding rationally to stimuli.
Protective reflexes are on alert

\section*{The Human Brain}

Requires a constant supply of oxygen and glucose for normal function
Interruption of this supply will cause loss of consciousness within a few seconds and may also cause permanent brain damage.

\section*{Unconsciousness}

A state of unarousable responsiveness where the client is unaware of the self or the surroundings and no purposeful response can be obtained to external stimuli.
May be:
Brief -lasting for few seconds to an hour
Sustained-lasting for a few hours or longer

\section*{COMA}

A state of sustained unconsciousness in which the client does not respond to verbal stimuli, does not move voluntarily, does not blink, may have altered respiratory pattern, altered pupillary response to light and varying response to painful stimuli.

\section*{Levels of unconsciousness}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Sno & Levels & Clinical features \\
\hline 1 & Consciousness & Normal, alert, oriented to self, place and time Open eyes spontaneously, respond to stimuli appropriately \\
\hline 2 & Confused & Impaired or slowed thinking; disoriented \\
\hline 3 & Delirious & Disoriented, restless, attention deficit, possible incidence of hallucinations and delusions \\
\hline 4 & Somnolent & Excessive drowsiness; responds to verbal stimuli although slow and inappropriate \\
\hline 5 & Obtunded & Decreased alertness slowed motor responses, sleepiness. \\
\hline 6 & Stuporous & Sleep like state, can be aroused only by vigorous and repeated noxious stimuli; little or no activity; responsiveness only to pain \\
\hline 7 & Comatose & Unarousable and unresponsive, no gag reflex or pupillary response \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Etiology/causes}
- Blood oxygenation problems
- Blood circulation problems
- Metabolic problems (Diabetes Mellitus, Over dosage)
- Central Nervous System problems (head injury, stroke, tumors, epilepsy)

\section*{Focal Brain Dysfunction-etiology (Causes)}
- Brain tumor
- Vascular events (CVA)
- Demyelination
- Infection (brain abscess)
- Focal head injury

\section*{Diffuse brain dysfunction}
- Infection-meningitis, encephalitis
- Epilepsy
- Hypoxia and hypercapnia
- Drug poisoning and overdoses (including alcohol)
- Metabolic/endocrine causes-diabetic coma, hepatic or renal failure, hypothyroidism, severe electrolyte disturbances.
- Hypotension or hypotensive crisis
- Diffuse head injury
- Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage
- Hypothermia, hyperthermia

\section*{Assessment of unconscious client}
$\checkmark$ Need for frequent systemic and objective assessments....
$\checkmark$ For effective care
$\checkmark$ Client is unable to report any problem
$\checkmark$ Perform neurologic assessment for 15 minutes
$\checkmark$ Gather history on:.....
- Present history
- Past illness/surgeries-allergies, medication, illnesses (epilepsy, diabetes), last meal, event (what happened?)
- Personal history
- Nutritional history
- Socio-economic and environmental status

\section*{Physical assessment}

Signs and symptoms
- Levels of consciousness-varied
- Some are more serious than others
- Levels include unconscious episodes that are:
i. Brief-fainting or blacking out
ii. Longer-victim is incoherent when roused
iii. Prolonged-victim is motionless and not at all aware of his surroundings for a very long time.

\section*{Patterns of respiration}
i. Hyperventilation
ii. Hypoventilation
iii. Cheyne-stoke respiration
iv. Ataxic respiration (completely irregular breathing)

\section*{Eyes responses}

Types of eye movements
i. Saccades-a simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation in same direction
ii. Smooth pursuit movements-the eyes move smoothly instead of in jumps
iii. Vergence movements-two eyes moving in opposite direction
iv. Vestibule-ocular movements-stabilizes the eye relative to the external world

\section*{Facial symmetry}

Normally symmetric
Asymmetry-sagging or decrease in wrinkles in paralysis

\section*{Swallowing reflex}

Drooling versus spontaneous swallowing
( $10^{\text {th }}$ to $12^{\text {th }}$ cranial nerves)-meningitis, deep coma

\section*{Neck}

Stiff neck e.g. in Meningitis
Absence of spontaneous neck movement e.g. in fracture or dislocation of cervical spine.

\section*{Motor responses}

Elicited by applying peripheral noxious stimuli e.g. pinching of limbs/rubbing the sternum to elicit pain
- Appropriate response-brushing away the source of the stimulus
- Inappropriate response-decerebrate or decorticate rigidity
- Motor response is also of localizing value
- Paralyzed limb will show no response
- Decerebrate rigidity -indicate brain stem damage
- Complete flaccidity with no response to noxious stimuli-severe CNS depression due to drug overdose.

\section*{Reflexes}
1. Superficial and cutaneous reflexes( abnominal, plantar, corneal, pharyngeal, cremasteric and anal) - absent in pyramidal tract disorders -biceps, triceps, ankle and knee jerks
2. Pathological reflexes e.g Babinski (big toe bends up and back to the top of the foot and the other toe fans out)

\section*{Note}

Planter reflex-flexion of great toe
Corneal reflex -blink reflex-an involuntary blinking of the eyelids elicited by stimulation of the cornea
Pharyngeal reflex-gag reflex-reflex during contraction of the back of the throat, evoked by touching the roof of the mouth
Cremasteric reflex-is a superficial reflex found in human males that is elicited when the inner part of the thigh is stroked. Stroking of the skin causes the cremasteric muscle to contract and pull up the ipsilateral testicle toward the inguinal canal

\section*{Investigations}

Blood-CBC, biochemistry, electrolyte, sugar, urea, ammonia, PT, Creatinine, ABG, drug levels Lumbar puncture-shows infection or bleeding
EEG-in suspected epilepsy
MRI
PET-Positron Emission Tomography Scan- it uses a special dye containing radioactive tracers. Certain organs and tissues then absorb the tracers. This scan reveals metabolic changes in an organ or tissue earlier at celthlai abdement is available on studocu

\section*{Nursing Diagnoses of the unconscious clients and managements}
1. Ineffective airway clearance R/T upper airway obstruction by tongue and soft tissue and secretions

\section*{Management}
- Positioning -lateral
- Insert oral airway - if tongue is paralyzed
- Assess the respiratory rate, pattern, lung sounds, obstruction of the airway by tongue/ vomitus
- Suction airway intermittently
- Administer humidified oxygen before and after suctioning
- Initiate chest physiotherapy and postural drainage (unless contraindicated)
- Connect mechanical ventilators if needed
- Increase fluid intake at least 2.5 liters per day
- Auscultate chest 6 to 8 hourly
- Monitor ABGs
- Respiratory system-hypostatic pneumonia/aspiration pneumonia
- Watch out for tachypnea, intercostal retraction, fever, noisy breathing, restlessness
- Suction airway when necessary
- Change position 2 hourly
- Chest physiotherapy and postural drainage
- Precautions while feeding
* Ensure proper placement of patient before starting
* Ensure no excess residual feed before initiating feeding

Unconsciousness:
- Unconsciousness is a condition in which there is a depression of cerebral function ranging from stupor to coma.
- Coma results from impairment in both the arousal and the awareness of consciousness.
- The arousal of consciousness is mediated by the reticular activating substance (RAS) in the brain stem.
- The awareness component of consciousness is mediated by the cortical activity within the cerebral hemispheres.
Consciousness:
- It is the state of being aware of self environment.
- The level at which a patient is able to respond to stimuli is referred to as level of consciousness
Note: Both arousal and awareness are assessed when using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
Causes of altered state of consciousness
- Hypoxemia
- Trauma
- Vascular disorders
- Neoplasms
- Degenerative and infectious disorders as well as a
- Metabolic disorders and
- Structural neurologic lesions.

Note: Diagnostic evaluation and management depend on the underlying cause, overall intracranial dynamics, age, comorbidities, and general state of health.

\section*{GLASGOW COMA SCALE}

It is a numerical system used to evaluate patients level of consciousness especially after head injury

Assessment of Unconscious Patients
- History taking
- Physical Examination
- Ability of patient to respond to stimuli, which is done by determining the degree of consciousness impairment by evaluating behavioral response in three areas, with points adding to 15: Eye Opening (4); Verbal Response(5) and Motor Response (6)

Glasgow Coma Scale
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Parameter & Finding & Score \\
\hline 1. Eye Opening & Spontaneously & 4 \\
\hline & To Speech & 3 \\
\hline & To Pain & 2 \\
\hline & Do Not Open & 1 \\
\hline 2. Verbal Response & Oriented & 5 \\
\hline & Confused & 4 \\
\hline & Inappropriate Speech & 3 \\
\hline & Incomprehensi ble Sounds & 2 \\
\hline & No Verbalization & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline 3. Motor Respon se & Obeys Command & 6 \\
\hline & Localizes Pain & 5 \\
\hline & Withdraws from Pain & 4 \\
\hline & Abnormal Flexion & 3 \\
\hline & Abnormal Extension & 2 \\
\hline & No Motor Response & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
1. Eye Opening (4 grades)
- No eye opening: 1
- Opening to response to pain: 2
- Eye opening in response any speech (or shout, not necessarily request to open eyes): 3
- Spontaneous eye opening: 4

\section*{2. Verbal Response ( $\mathbf{5}$ grades)}

Record best level of speech.
- Orientated: Patient knows who he is, where he is and why, the year, season, and month: 5
- Confused Conversation: Patient responds to questions in a conversational manner but some disorientation and confusion: 4
- Inappropriate Speech: Random or exclamatory articulated speech, but no conversational exchange: 3
- Incomprehensible Speech: Moaning but no words: 2
- None: 1

\section*{3. Motor Responses (6 grades)}
- Obeying Command: The patient does simple things you ask (beware of accepting a grasp reflexes in this category): 6
- Localizing Pain: Put pressure on the patient's finger nail bed with a pencil then try supraorbital and sternal pressure: purposeful movements towards changing painful stimuli is a 'localizing' response: 5
- Withdraws to Pain: Pulls limb away from painful stimulus: 4
- Abnormal flexor response to pain: Pressure on the nail bed causes abnormal flexion of limbs - "decorticate posture": 3
- Extensor posturing to pain: The stimulus causes limb extension (adduction, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm) - "decerebrate posture": 2
- No response to pain: 1

\section*{Interpretation:}

The score is expressed in the form "GCS $9=\mathrm{E} 2 \mathrm{~V} 4 \mathrm{M} 3$ at 07:35 Am"
- Best Score $=15$, this shows that the patient is fully conscious
- A score of 13 or higher correlates with a mild head (brain) injury,
- A score of 9 to 12 is a moderate head (brain) injury
- A score of 8 or less a severe head (brain) injury.
- Worst Score = 3, this shows severe neurological impairment
- Changes from baseline are most important
- When using the GCS, coma may be defined as no eye opening on stimulation, absence of comprehensible speech, and failure to obey commands.
Note: The GCS is designed to provide a rapid assessment of level of consciousness (LOC) and does not provide a means to monitor or localize neurologic dysfunction.

\section*{AVPU}

The AVPU scale (an acronym from "alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive") is a system by which a health care professional can measure and record a patient's level of consciousness. It is mostly used in emergency medicine protocols, and within first aid.

It is a simplification of the Glasgow Coma Scale, which assesses a patient response in three measures: eyes, voice and motor skills. The AVPU scale should be assessed using these three identifiable traits, looking for the best response of each.

\section*{Meaning of the mnemonic}

The AVPU scale has four possible outcomes for recording (as opposed to the 13 possible outcomes on the Glasgow Coma Scale). The assessor should always work from best (A) to worst (U) to avoid unnecessary tests on patients who are clearly conscious. The four possible recordable outcomes are:
- Alert: The patient is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented). This patient will have spontaneously open eyes, will respond to voice (although may be confused) and will have bodily motor function.
- Verbal: The patient makes some kind of response when you talk to them, which could be in any of the three component measures of eyes, voice or motor - e.g. patient's eyes open on being asked "Are you OK?". The response could be as little as a grunt, moan, or slight move of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer.
- Pain: The patient makes a response on any of the three component measures on the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_05_81bfc68a92fd5a7f3421g-54.jpg?height=63&width=1508&top_left_y=2619&top_left_x=371)
peripheral stimulus such as squeezing the fingers. A patient with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious patient would not require a pain stimulus) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their body (including abnormal posturing).
- Unresponsive: Sometimes seen noted as 'unconscious', this outcome is recorded if the patient does not give any eye, voice or motor response to voice or pain.

In first aid, an AVPU score of anything less than A is often considered an indication to get further help, as the patient is likely to be in need of more definitive care. In the hospital or long term healthcare facilities, caregivers may consider an AVPU score of less than A to be the patient's normal baseline.

In some emergency medical services protocols, "Alert" can be subdivided into a scale of 1 to 4, in which 1,2,3 and 4 correspond to certain attributes, such as time, person, place, and event. For example, a fully alert patient might be considered "alert and oriented x 4" if he/she could correctly identify the time, their name, their location, and the event.

EMS crews may begin with an AVPU assessment, to be followed by a GCS assessment if the AVPU score is below "A."

The AVPU scale is not suitable for long-term neurological observation of the patient; in this situation, the Glasgow Coma Scale is more appropriate.

\section*{Limitations}

As mentioned above, it should not be used for long-term follow up of neurological status.

\section*{Comparison with other classification systems}

When compared to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) the AVPU classification of alertness has been suggested to correspond in the following manner:
- Alert = 15 GCS
- Voice Responsive $=12$ GCS
- Pain Responsive $=8$ GCS
- Unconscious $=3$ GCS

\section*{Care of the Unconscious Patients}

The management pathway is divided as follows:

\section*{1. Basic Ventilatory Support/Airway Care -}
- This is airway control through positioning.
- The recovery position is best as it encourages drainage of secretions from the oral cavity.
- Suction of the airways to remove secretion and administration of oxygen, intubation of the trachea and artificial ventilation may be required.

\section*{2. Monitoring of Respiration}
- This is meant to enable early detection of any changes that may indicate complication, for example, increase in respiration rate, abnormal respiration sounds, etc.

\section*{3. Ensuring Adequate Circulation}
- This is achieved through maintaining adequate blood volume by administering enough fluids through the intravenous route to supplement the nasal gastric tube feeding.
- A meticulous input/output chart must be maintained.
- The use of physiotherapy to exercise the joints and muscles also helps to improve circulation.
- Monitoring of circulation functions by taking and recording blood pressure and pulse rates, ECG, and oxygen saturation are important.

\section*{4. Nutritional Management}
- Can be achieved through insertion of a nasal gastric tube and using it for feeding.
- The intravenous route is also used to give parenteral feeds if the patient is not digesting, and to maintain fluid and electrolyte balances.
- Intravenous fluids are selected and administered to meet the electrolyte need in the body.

\section*{5. Skin Integrity}

This is maintained through proper skin hygiene, which includes
- Daily bathing,
- Two (2)-hourly turning of the patient and
- Keeping the patient's bed linen clean and dry.

\section*{6. Elimination}
- Adequate fluid intake ensures that kidney function is maintained.
- Some patients may require catheterization to keep them dry and for proper monitoring of urine production.
- Adequate fluids and feeding help to maintain bowel motion.

\section*{7. Psychosocial Needs}
- This includes addressing the patient by their name at all times, while providing care.
- It is important to assume that the patient can hear and, therefore, you should inform the patient of any intended action that you intend to perform on them.
- Relatives should be informed of patient's progress and encouraged to provide the social support necessary to reassure the patient that they are not abandoned.

\section*{8. General Monitoring of the Vital Signs}
- This must be done to evaluate the patient's progress and identify early any impending complication

\section*{IV. INTRODUCTION TO NURSING CARE STUDY}

\section*{Introduction to Care Studies}

\section*{Nursing case studies}

A nursing case study is an in-depth study of a patient that is encountered during the student's daily practice in a practicum. They are important learning experiences because the student can apply classroom/theoretical learning to an actual situation and perhaps make some conclusions and recommendations.

Case study is a research methodology, typically seen in social and life sciences. There is no one definition of case study research. However, very simply... 'a case study can be defined as an intensive study about a person, a group of people or a unit, which is aimed to generalize over several units'. A case study has also been described as an intensive, systematic investigation of a single individual, group, community or some other unit in which the researcher examines indepth data relating to several variables.

Researchers describe how case studies examine complex phenomena in the natural setting to increase understanding of them. Indeed, Sandelowski suggests using case studies in research means that the holistic nature of nursing care can be addressed. Furthermore, when describing the steps undertaken while using a case study approach, this method of research allows the researcher to take a complex and broad topic, or phenomenon, and narrow it down into a manageable research question(s). By collecting qualitative or quantitative datasets about the phenomenon, the researcher gains a more in-depth insight into the phenomenon than would be obtained using only one type of data. This is illustrated in the examples provided at the end of this paper.

Often there are several similar cases to consider such as educational or social service programmes that are delivered from a number of locations. Although similar, they are complex and have unique features. In these circumstances, the evaluation of several, similar cases will provide a better answer to a research question than if only one case is examined, hence the multiple-case study. Stake asserts that the cases are grouped and viewed as one entity, called the quintain. 'We study what is similar and different about the cases to understand the quintain better'.

\section*{Method}

The steps when using case study methodology are the same as for other types of research. The first step is defining the single case or identifying a group of similar cases that can then be incorporated into a multiple-case study. A search to determine what is known about the case(s) is typically conducted. This may include a review of the literature, grey literature, media, reports and more, which serves to establish a basic understanding of the cases and informs the development of research questions. Data in case studies are often, but not exclusively, qualitative in nature. In multiple-case studies, analysis within cases and across cases is conducted. Themes arise from the analyses and assertions about the cases as a whole, or the quintain, emerge.

\section*{Benefits and limitations of case studies}

If a researcher wants to study a specific phenomenon arising from a particular entity, then a single-case study is warranted and will allow for a in-depth understanding of the single phenomenon and, as discussed above, would involve collecting several different types of data. This is illustrated in example 1 below.

Using a multiple-case research study allows for a more in-depth understanding of the cases as a unit, through comparison of similarities and differences of the individual cases embedded within the quintain. Evidence arising from multiple-case studies is often stronger and more reliable than from single-case research. Multiple-case studies allow for more comprehensive exploration of research questions and theory development.

Despite the advantages of case studies, there are limitations. The sheer volume of data is difficult to organise and data analysis and integration strategies need to be carefully thought through. There is also sometimes a temptation to veer away from the research focus. Reporting of findings from multiple-case research studies is also challenging at times, particularly in relation to the word limits for some journal papers.

\section*{Examples of case studies}

\section*{Example 1: nurses' paediatric pain management practices}

One of the authors of this paper (AT) has used a case study approach to explore nurses' paediatric pain management practices. This involved collecting several datasets:
1. Observational data to gain a picture about actual pain management practices.
2. Questionnaire data about nurses' knowledge about paediatric pain management practices and how well they felt they managed pain in children.
3. Questionnaire data about how critical nurses perceived pain management tasks to be.

These datasets were analysed separately and then compared and demonstrated that nurses' level of theoretical did not impact on the quality of their pain management practices.Nor did individual nurse's perceptions of how critical a task was effect the likelihood of them carrying out this task in practice. There was also a difference in self-reported and observed practices; actual (observed) practices did not confirm to best practice guidelines, whereas self-reported practices tended to.

\section*{Example 2: quality of care for complex patients at Nurse Practitioner-Led Clinics (NPLCs) e.g. the dispensaries, health centres}

The other author of this paper (RH) has conducted a multiple-case study to determine the quality of care for patients with complex clinical presentations in NPLCs in Ontario, Canada. Five NPLCs served as individual cases that, together, represented the quatrain. Three types of data were collected including:
1. Review of documentation related to the NPLC model (media, annual reports, research articles, grey literature and regulatory legislation).
2. Interviews with nurse practitioners (NPs) practising at the five NPLCs to determine their perceptions of the impact of the NPLC model on the quality of care provided to patients with multimorbidity.
3. Chart audits conducted at the five NPLCs to determine the extent to which evidencebased guidelines were followed for patients with diabetes and at least one other chronic condition.

The three sources of data collected from the five NPLCs were analysed and themes arose related to the quality of care for complex patients at NPLCs. The multiple-case study confirmed that nurse practitioners are the primary care providers at the NPLCs, and this positively impacts the quality of care for patients with multimorbidity. Healthcare policy, such as lack of an increase in salary for NPs for 10 years, has resulted in issues in recruitment and retention of NPs at NPLCs. This, along with insufficient resources in the communities where NPLCs are located and high patient vulnerability at NPLCs, have a negative impact on the quality of care.

\section*{Conclusion}

These examples illustrate how collecting data about a single case or multiple cases helps us to better understand the phenomenon in question. Case study methodology serves to provide a framework for evaluation and analysis of complex issues. It shines a light on the holistic nature of nursing practice and offers a perspective that informs improved patient care.

In our case the care study must include:
i. Selection and approval of the client- state reasons why you have chosen the client, objectives of conducting the case study, definition of terms. You must also introduce the care study in documentation
ii. Biographic data
iii. Personal history
iv. Head to toe examination
v. Investigations
vi. Management of the client
vii. Literature review (description of the disease, comparison of the actual and ideal management, Health education to the client, Home visits (at least 3),(objectives for every visit, reporting of findings, problems identified during the visits),
viii. Conclusion of the care study
ix. Recommendations
