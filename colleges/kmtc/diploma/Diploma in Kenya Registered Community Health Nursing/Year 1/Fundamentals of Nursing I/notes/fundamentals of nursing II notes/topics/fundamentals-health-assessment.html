                            <li>promote health,</li>
                            <li>address acute health problems, and</li>
                            <li>minimize chronic health conditions.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-01"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 01</h4>
                        <p>Introduce yourself, identify your patient and gain consent to speak with them. Should you wish to take notes as you proceed, ask the patients permission to do so.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-02"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 02 - Presenting Complaint (PC)</h4>
                        <p>This is what the patient tells you is wrong, for example: chest pain.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-03"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 03 - History of Presenting Complaint (HPC)</h4>
                        <p>Gain as much information you can about the specific complaint. Sticking with chest pain as an example you should ask:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Site: Where exactly is the pain?</li>
                            <li>Onset: When did it start, was it constant/intermittent, gradual/ sudden?</li>
                            <li>Character: What is the pain like e.g. sharp, burning, tight?</li>
                            <li>Radiation: Does it radiate/move anywhere?</li>
                            <li>Associations: Is there anything else associated with the pain, e.g. sweating, vomiting.</li>
                            <li>Time course: Does it follow any time pattern, how long did it last?</li>
                            <li>Exacerbating / relieving factors: Does anything make it better or worse?</li>
                            <li>Severity: How severe is the pain, consider using the 1-10 scale?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The <dfn>SOCRATES</dfn> acronym can be used for any type of pain history.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-04"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 04 - Past Medical History (PMH)</h4>
                        <p>Gather information about a patients other medical problems (if any). In the past surgical history, inquire about history of falls, blood transfusion, injuries, road traffic accidents, operations, burns etc</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-05"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 05 - Drug History (DH)</h4>
                        <p>Find out what medications the patient is taking, including dosage and how often they are taking them, for example: once-a-day, twice-a-day, etc.</p>
                        <p>At this point it is a good idea to find out if the patient has any allergies.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-06"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 06 - Family History (FH)</h4>
                        <p>Gather some information about the patients family history, e.g diabetes or cardiac history. Find out if there are any genetic conditions within the family, for example: polycystic kidney disease.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-07"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 07 - Social History (SH)</h4>
                        <p>This is the opportunity to find out a bit more about the patient's background. Remember to ask about smoking and alcohol. Depending on the PC it may also be pertinent to find out whether the patient drives, e.g. following an MI patient cannot drive for one month. You should also ask the patient if they use any illegal substances, for example: cannabis, cocaine, etc.</p>
                        <p>Also find out who lives with the patient. You may find that they are the carer for an elderly parent or a child and your duty would be to ensure that they are not neglected should your patient be admitted/remain in hospital.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-08"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 08 - Review of Systems (ROS)</h4>
                        <p>Gather a short amount of information regarding the other systems in the body that are not covered in your HPC.</p>
                        <p>The above example involves the CVS so you would focus on the others. These are the main systems you should cover:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CVS</li>
                            <li>Respiratory</li>
                            <li>GI</li>
                            <li>Neurology</li>
                            <li>Genitourinary/renal</li>
                            <li>Musculoskeletal</li>
                            <li>Psychiatry</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Please note these are the main areas, however some courses will also teach the addition of other systems such as ENT/ophthalmology.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-09"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 09 - Summary of History</h4>
                        <p>Complete your history by reviewing what the patient has told you. Repeat back the important points so that the patient can correct you if there are any misunderstandings or errors.</p>
                        <p>You should also address what the patient thinks is wrong with them and what they are expecting/hoping for from the consultation. A useful acronym for this is ICE <dfn>I</dfn>deas, <dfn>C</dfn>oncerns and <span class="math-inline">$[E]xpectations$</span>.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-10"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 10 - Patient Questions / Feedback</h4>
                        <p>During or after taking their history, the patient may have questions that they want to ask you. It is very important that you don't give them any false information. As such, unless you are absolutely sure of the answer it is best to say that you will ask your seniors about this or that you will go away and get them more information (e.g. leaflets) about what they are asking. These questions aren't necessarily there to test your knowledge, just that you won't try and 'blag it'.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="procedure-step-11"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Step 11 Thanking the Patient</h4>
                        <p>When you are happy that you have all of the information you require, and the patient has asked any questions that they may have, you must thank them for their time and say that one of the doctors looking after them will be coming to see them soon.</p>

                        <p>A <dfn>nutrition assessment</dfn> is an in-depth evaluation of both objective and subjective data related to an individual's food and nutrient intake, lifestyle, and medical history.</p>
                        <p>Definition: Nutrition assessment includes taking anthropometric measurements and collecting information about a client's medical history, clinical and biochemical characteristics, dietary practices, current treatment, and food security situation.</p>
                        <p>Once the data on an individual is collected and organized, the practitioner can assess and evaluate the nutritional status of that person.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="nutritional-assessment-purpose"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Purpose</h3>

                            <li>Rapidly identify patients at high nutritional risk.</li>
                            <li>Define a patient's nutritional status</li>
                            <li>Define clinically relevant malnutrition</li>
                            <li>Monitor changes in nutritional status.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <ol>
                            <li>To identify people at risk of malnutrition for early intervention or referral before they become malnourished.</li>
                            <li>To identify malnourished clients for treatment- malnourished people who are not treated early have longer hospital stays, slower recovery from infection and complications, and higher morbidity and mortality.</li>
                            <li>To track child growth.</li>
                            <li>To identify medical complications that affects the body's ability to digest food and utilize nutrients.</li>
                            <li>To detect practices that can increase the risk of malnutrition and infection</li>
                            <li>To inform nutrition education and counselling.</li>
                            <li>To establish appropriate nutrition care plans.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The results of a client's nutrition assessment and classification of nutritional status determine all the other elements of nutrition assessment, counselling, and support (NACS) for that individual -including counselling, treatment, and referral to food security and other support.</p>
                        <p>If health care providers can't assess every client's nutritional status, what clients should they prioritize?</p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li>Children under 2 years of age, especially if they are not breastfed</li>
                            <li>Women who are pregnant or up to 6 months postpartum</li>
                            <li>People who report unintentional weight loss</li>
                            <li>People who have been prescribed specialized food products to treat malnutrition</li>
                            <li>People with disease-related symptoms that can be managed through diet</li>
                            <li>People with HIV, tuberculosis (TB), or other chronic diseases.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A comprehensive nutritional assessment includes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>anthropometric measurements of body composition;</li>
                            <li>biochemical measurements of serum protein, micronutrients, and metabolic parameters;</li>
                            <li>clinical assessment of altered nutritional requirements and</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="nutritional-screening"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Nutrition screening?</h3>
                        <p>Full nutrition assessment can be preceded by rapid and simple identification of people who may be malnourished or at risk of malnutrition and need more detailed nutrition assessment. Nutritionists and trained facility-based health care providers or community service providers can do nutrition screening in health care facilities, during growth monitoring or home-based care, and during support group meetings. Simple nutrition screening can include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Checking for bilateral pitting edema,</li>
                            <li>Measuring weight and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and</li>
                            <li>Asking about recent illnesses and appetite.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nutrition screening requires standardized training in line with national and local health policy. Special training materials may be needed for low-literacy or illiterate populations. Community service providers need government-approved recording and referral materials, and clear guidance on provider roles, whom to screen,</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="how-often-nutrition-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>How often should nutrition assessment be done?</h3>
                        <p>The frequency of nutrition assessment depends on a client's age and pregnancy and disease status and on national policies. The recommendations below should be adjusted based on national guidelines.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="bmi-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>BMI</h4>
                        <p>BMI is an anthropometric indicator based on weight to-height ratio. It is used to classify malnutrition in nonpregnant/non-postpartum adults. BMI is not an accurate indicator of nutritional status in pregnant women or adults with edema. Use MUAC for these groups. Calculate BMI by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of the person's height in meters. You will have to convert measurements in cm to m (100 cm = 1 m).</p>
                        <div class="equation">BMI = weight (kg) /height<sup>2</sup> (m)</div>
                        <p>BMI can also be found using look-up tables or a BMI wheel. BMI values below or above the WHO range for normal nutritional status (shown in the table below) indicate a need for nutrition interventions to slow or reverse weight.</p>

                        <p>Clinical assessment includes: Checking for visible signs of nutritional deficiencies such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>bilateral pitting edema,</li>
                            <li>emaciation (a sign of wasting, which is loss of muscle and fat tissue as a result of low energy intake and/or nutrient loss from infection),</li>
                            <li>hair loss,</li>
                            <li>Changes in hair colour.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It also includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>taking a medical history to identify comorbidities with nutritional implications,</li>
                            <li>opportunistic infections,</li>
                            <li>other medical complications,</li>
                            <li>usage of medications with nutrition related side effects,</li>
                            <li>food and drug interactions,</li>
                            <li>risk factors for disease (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, overweight) that affect or are affected by diet and nutritional status.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Assessment of nutritional status in infants less than 6 months involves:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Checking for clinical signs of acute malnutrition such as visible wasting,</li>
                            <li>Bilateral pitting oedema</li>
                            <li>Inability to suckle</li>
                            <li>Ineffective breastfeeding and</li>
                            <li>Recent weight loss or failure to gain weight,</li>
                            <li>Risk factors such as insufficient breast milk or absence of the mother.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Clinical nutrition assessment for this age group should also assess: Infant feeding practices, especially access to breast milk. Checking for or asking clients about symptoms of infection that can increase nutrient needs (e.g., fever) and nutrient loss (e.g., diarrhea and vomiting), as well as medical conditions (e.g., HIV, celiac disease) that impair digestion and nutrient absorption and increase the risk of developing malnutrition. Medical records should provide information about:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Illness,</li>
                            <li>Hospitalizations,</li>
                            <li>Operations,</li>
                            <li>Diagnostic tests and therapies,</li>
                            <li>Medications that can affect nutritional status.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some medications can interfere with nutrient absorption, digestion, metabolism, and utilization. Likewise, nutritional status and diet can affect how medications work. Information about the medications clients are taking allows health care providers to counsel them on how to manage drug-food interactions and drug side effects.</p>
                        <p>Nutrition Counselling. For children, clinical assessment may also include history of growth patterns, patterns, onset of puberty, and developmental history.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="bilateral-pitting-edema"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Bilateral pitting edema, also called nutritional edema:</h4>
                        <p>Is swelling in both feet and legs (bilateral) caused by the accumulation of excess fluid under the skin in the spaces within tissues? Either too much fluid moves from the blood vessels into the tissues or not enough fluid moves from the tissues back into the blood vessels. This imbalance can cause swelling in one or more parts of the body. Bilateral pitting edema is characterized by pitting in the skin (i.e., a visible indentation that persists after the pressure is released from skin that has been pressed by a thumb). Edema is a sign of severe malnutrition ONLY if it exists in both feet and both legs.</p>
                        <p>Other causes of edema, especially in adults, that are not related to nutrition include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Congestive heart disease</li>
                            <li>Lymphatic disorders</li>
                            <li>Kidney disease</li>
                            <li>Among other conditions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Bilateral pitting edema is a sign of severe malnutrition on its own, regardless of the results of anthropometric assessment. Anyone with severe bilateral pitting edema (Grade +++), even with appetite and no medical complications, should be admitted for inpatient management of severe acute malnutrition. A person with bilateral pitting edema Grades + or ++ with appetite and no medical complications should be treated for severe acute malnutrition on an outpatient basis Anthropometry is the measurement of the size, weight, and proportions of the body. Common anthropometric measurements include weight, height, MUAC, head circumference, and skinfold</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dietary-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Dietary.</h4>
                        <p>Assessing food and fluid intake is an essential part of nutrition assessment. It provides information on dietary quantity and quality, changes in appetite, food allergies and intolerance, and reasons for inadequate food intake during or after illness. The results are compared with recommended intake such as recommended dietary allowance (RDA)7 to counsel clients on how to improve their diets to prevent malnutrition or treat conditions affected by food intake and nutritional status (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia). Several common ways to assess dietary intake are described next.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>24-hour recall</strong> this method was designed to quantify the average dietary intake for a group of people, although it can be used to assess individual nutrition intake. During a recall, a client is asked to remember in detail every food and drink consumed during the previous 24 hours. The method can be repeated on several occasions to account for day to-day variation in intake. Health care providers may prompt clients to remember what they ate or drank by time periods or activities (e.g., just after waking up, before going to bed) or to estimate portion sizes by looking at household measures, food models, household utensils, photographs, or actual food.</li>
                            <li><strong>Food frequency questionnaire</strong> A food frequency questionnaire is designed to obtain information on overall dietary quality rather than nutrient composition and intake. The food frequency questionnaire examines how often someone eats certain foods, and sometimes the size of the portions. This method is quick and inexpensive but underreporting is common.</li>
                            <li><strong>Food group questionnaire</strong> Another way to do dietary assessment is to show clients pictures of different food groups (often available from national nutrition authorities) and ask whether they ate or drank any of those foods the previous day.</li>

                        <p><dfn>Physical examination</dfn> is the process of evaluating objective anatomic findings through the use of observation, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. The information obtained must be thoughtfully integrated with the patient's history and pathophysiology.</p>
                        <p>Definition : <dfn>Physical assessment</dfn> is a systematic data collection method that uses the senses of sight, hearing, smell and touch to detect health problems. There are four techniques used in physical assessment and these are:- Inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Usually history taking is completed before physical examination</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="physical-examination-entails"><span class="heading-icon"></span>What does Physical examination entail.</h3>
                        <p>A physical examination may include checking vital signs, including temperature examination, Blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. ... Four actions are taught as the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="physical-examination-purpose"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Purpose of Physical Examination</h3>
                        <p>A physical examination is recommended at least once a year, especially in people over the age of 50. These exams are used to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>check for possible diseases so they can be treated early</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="technique-inspection"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Inspection</h4>
                        <p>It's the use of vision to distinguish the normal from the abnormal findings. Body parts are inspected to identify color, shape, symmetry, movement, pulsation and texture.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Principles of inspection</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Availability of adequate light</li>
                            <li>Position and expose body part to view all surfaces</li>
                            <li>Inspect each area for size, shape, color, symmetry, Position and abnormalities.</li>
                            <li>If possible compare each area inspected with the same area on the opposite side.</li>
                            <li>Use additional light to inspect body cavities</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="technique-palpation"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Palpation</h4>
                        <p>It involves use of hands to touch body parts for data collection. The EMT uses fingertips and palms to determine the size, shape, and configuration of underlying body structure and pulsation of blood vessels. It help to detect the outline of organs such as thyroid, spleen or liver and mobility of masses. It detects body temperature, moisture, turgor, texture, tenderness, thickness, and distension.</p>
                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Principles of palpation</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Help client to relax and be comfortable because muscle tension impairs effective assessment.</li>
                            <li>Advise client to take slow deep breaths during palpation #</li>
                            <li>Palpate tender areas last and note nonverbal signs of discomfort.</li>
                            <li>Rub hands to warm them, have short fingernails and use gentle touch</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="technique-percussion"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Percussion</h4>
                        <p>It is the technique in which one or both hands are used to strike the body surface to produce a sound called percussion note that travels through body tissue. The character of the sound determines the location, size and density of underlying structure to verify abnormalities. An abnormal sound suggest a mass or substance like air, fluid in an organ or cavity.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="technique-auscultation"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Auscultation</h4>
                        <p>It involves listening to sounds and a stethoscope is mostly used. Various body systems like cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal have characterized sounds. Bowel, breath, heart and blood movement sounds are heard using the stethoscope. It is important to know the normal sound to distinguish from abnormal.</p>

                        <p>Infection prevention Follow IP precaution through out procedure Environment P/A requires privacy and away from other destructors throughout Equipment Get all the necessary equipment, other equipment needs to be warmed before being placed on the body e.g. rubbing diaphragm of the stethoscope briskly between hands. Patient preparation Prepare the patient physically and make the patient comfortable throughout the physical assessment for successful exam. Explain to the patient everything to be done.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="head-to-toe-assessment-detailed"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Head to toe assessment</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="general-survey"><span class="heading-icon"></span>General survey</h4>
                        <p>The assessment of the patient/client begins on the first contact. It includes apparent state of health, level of consciousness, and signs of distress. The general height, weight, and build can be noted including skin colour, dressing, grooming, personal hygiene, facial expression, gait, odour, posture and motor activity.</p>
                        <p>Note: If there is a sign of acute distress comprehensive health assessment is deferred until when patient is stable.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="vital-signs"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Vital signs</h4>
                        <p>Assessment of vital signs is the first in physical assessment because positioning and moving the client during examination interferes with obtaining accurate results. Specific vital signs can be also obtained during assessment of individual body system.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="skin-hair-scalp-nails"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Skin,hair,sculp and nails</h4>
                        <p>Inspect all skin surfaces first or gradually while assessing the systems. Use the skills of inspection, palpation, and olfactory to assess the function. Skin Inspect skin for color, edema, lesions, scars and vascularity. Palpate to notice moisture, temperature, and skin turgor,</p>
                        
                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Hair and scalp</h5>
                        <p>Assess and note type of hair i.e. long, coarse, thick, brittle. Note the color, distribution, quantity, thickness, texture and lubrication. On inspection separate the hair to determine the scalp. Wear clean gloves if lesions and lice are probable.</p>
                        
                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Nails</h5>
                        <p>The condition of the nails reflects the general health, state of nutrition, occupation, and level of self care. Nail biting can reveal the person's psychological state. Inspect the nail bed for color, cleanliness, length, texture, angle between nail and nail bed and folds around the nail. Palpate the nail for inflammation</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="head-neck"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Head and Neck</h4>
                        <p>The assessment of the head includes:- eyes, ears, nose, mouth and pharynx. The assessment of the neck includes:- lymph nodes, carotid artery, thyroid gland and trachea.</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Eyes,ears</h5>
                        <p>Assess visual acuity, position and alignment of the eyes, eyebrows and eyelids. Note any abnormal discharges and color of conjunctiva and sclera. It determines the integrity of the ear structures and hearing acuity. Inspect for sore and discharges</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Nose and Sinuses</h5>
                        <p>Assess the integrity of the nose and sinuses by using inspection and palpation. Nose Observe for shape, size, skin color, and presence of deformity or inflammation. Sinuses The exam involves palpation. Incase of allergy or infection the inside is inflamed and swollen so palpate for tenderness</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Mouth and Pharynx</h5>
                        <p>Assess mouth and pharynx to determine overall health and hygiene. Use pen light and tongue depressor to assess oral cavity. Lips Inspect lips for color, texture, hydration, contour, sores and lesions.</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Buccal mucosa, gums, teeth</h5>
                        <p>Ask client to clench teeth and smile to observe to observe teeth occlusion, symmetry. A symmetrical smile shows normal nerve function. Inspect teeth for hygiene, position, and alignment. Let client open with lips relaxed, use tongue depressor to inspect the mucosa for color, moisture and sores. Inspect gums for color, edema, retraction, bleeding and lesions.</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Tongue and floor of mouth</h5>
                        <p>Carefully inspect tongue on all sides as well as floor of mouth for color, size, position, texture, moisture sores and lesions. Palate Have client extend the head backwards, holding the mouth open, inspect the hard and soft palate for color, shape, texture and extra bonny prominences or defects.</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Pharynx</h5>
                        <p>Let the client tip the head back slightly, open mouth wide and say "Ah", with penlight inspect the uvula and soft palate, they should rise centrally as the client say "Ah" to determine the function of cranial( vagus ) nerve function. Check the uvula and tonsils for redness and inflammation.</p>

                        <h5 style="font-weight:bold;">Neck</h5>
                        <p>Palpate the muscles, lymph nodes, carotid artery jugular veins for tenderness and distention. Thyroid gland Ask client to hyperextend the neck and view the thyroid and palpate for masses. Normally thyroid gland is not visible.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="chest-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Chest</h4>
                        <p>Inspect the skin for scars, sores, color, lesions, chest, movement and respiratory rate. Palpate to notice any masses, and tenderness in axillae and breast. Lungs Auscultate to assess respiratory and sounds from the lungs and chest cavity. Percussion is done to detect accumulation of fluid or air in the chest cavity.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="heart-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Heart</h4>
                        <p>Auscultate to hear the heart sound. Learn to know the normal heart sound to be able to detect the abnormal Breast Inspect the breast for skin color, scars and lesions. Palpate to notice any presence of masses.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="extremities-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Extremities</h4>
                        <p>Upper and lower extremities Inspect hand and legs for symmetry, alignment, skin color, temperature, sores, scars, lesions inflammation and varicosity. Palpate for tenderness, edema and pulsation of arteries. Use the brachial, radial, ulna, femoral, popliteal, posterior tibia and dorsalis pedis pulses. Check capillary refill on nails, clubbed toes /fingers and joint mobility.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="dtr-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Deep tendon reflexes</h4>
                        <p>Normally done on high risk patients and needs specialized practice and special hammer to assess the reflexes. Areas that are assessed are on biceps, triceps, patella, and Achilles.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="abdomen-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Abdomen</h4>
                        <p>Inspect the skin for color, sores, lesions, scars, position of umbilicus, distention and contours. Palpate for tenderness, masses and enlargement of other organs like liver, spleen and kidney. Ask for bowel and bladder elimination. Percussion is used to detect the location of organs that are normally palpable e.g. liver, spleen and intestines. Always auscultate before palpation or percussion because touching can alter mobility of bowel and increase sound.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="genitalia-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Genitalia</h4>
                        <p>Start assessment of genitalia with asking questions and do inspection to confirm a positive answer. Female Ask about presence of abnormal discharge, sores, warts and itching Male Ask any presence of sores, itching, warts and abnormal discharge.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="rectum-anus-assessment"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Rectum and anus</h4>
                        <p>Inspect for the skin color, sores, hemorrhoids and lesions. Do digital palpation to examine the anal canal for masses and sphincters function only when important.</p>
