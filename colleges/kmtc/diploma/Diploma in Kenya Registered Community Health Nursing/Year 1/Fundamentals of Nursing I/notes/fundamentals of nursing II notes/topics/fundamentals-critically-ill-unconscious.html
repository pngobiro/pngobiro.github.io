                        <p>Critical is defined as 'at a crisis'.<br>
                        The word 'crisis' is defined in the Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary as: 'The turning point of a disease for better or worse, especially a sudden change</p>

                            <li>The magnitude or extent of anatomical structural damage, for example, second degree burns of more than $25\%$</li>
                            <li>Severe injuries to the head or chest</li>
                            <li>The effect of the disease/condition on circulation, breathing, and electrolyte balance</li>
                            <li>The organs affected by the disease, for example, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, pulmonary distress, and renal failure</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These patients include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Post-operative patients during the first 48 hours</li>
                            <li>Unconscious patients</li>

                        <p>Note: The patient's survival rate will highly depend on your quick and accurate intervention.<br>
                        These interventions should be prioritized on the <span class="math-inline">$\mathbf{C A B}$</span> principles of first aid care, which state that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Circulation must be promoted and maintained</li>

                            <li>Breathing established</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="critical-care-facilities"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Critical Care Facilities</h3>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="facility-acute-room"><span class="heading-icon"></span>1. ACUTE ROOM</h4>
                        <p>Patients who are nursed here require life support equipment and continuous monitoring or observation.<br>
                        Hence this room must be located closer to the nursing station than others.<br>
                        These patients do not only need close observation but also full time communication with the nursing team and other health care providers. This ensures continuity of care.<br>
                        It is recommended that a nurse should always be in the acute room, preferably at a ratio of one nurse to two patients at any given time.<br>
                        An acute room can, therefore, be set up in a ward where one cubicle/corner can be identified and set aside for patients needing critical care in hospitals without established intensive care units.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" id="acute-room-equipment">Equipment in Acute Room</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Suction equipment</li>
                            <li>Oxygen administration equipment fully assembled, ready for use</li>
                            <li>Intravenous administration apparatus</li>
                            <li>Adequate stocks of linen as patients nursed in this room often require frequent changing of bed linen.</li>
                            <li>Other requirements include observation equipment, a torch, diagnostic sets,</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="facility-icu"><span class="heading-icon"></span>2. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU)</h4>
                        <p>It is a room/unit in which a critically ill patient is being actively treated as well as monitored.<br>
                        Intensive care units are more advanced than acute rooms.<br>
                        The purpose of intensive care is to maintain life until the precipitating causes of body failure can be identified and successfully treated to allow the system to regain selfcontrol.<br>
                        Generally, there is no universally ideal plan for an intensive care unit and each unit varies according to the needs of the patients it will take care of.<br>
                        The ratio of nurse to patient should be 1:1 at any given time.<br>
                        Ideally, no new hospital should be built without an intensive care unit. Provincial or regional and national hospitals are bound to have ICUs.<br>
                        The size of the unit depends on the size of the hospital; one bed for every 50 beds in the hospital is the most ideal</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" id="icu-types">Types of Intensive Care Units</h5>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

                                This is where one unit admits all types of patients.<br>
                                This is the most common in Kenya. It admits: adults, neonates, pediatrics, cardiac care patients and burns patients</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Coronary Care Unit</strong><br>
                                This admits only those suffering from coronary and heart related emergencies e.g. myocardial infarction and heart surgeries.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)</strong><br>
                                These admit general pediatric emergencies</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)</strong><br>
                                Neonates requiring critical care are admitted and managed here.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>High Dependent Unit (HDU)</strong><br>
                                These function as a step down to ICU.<br>
                                Patients are nursed in these units after discharge from ICU before getting to the general wards</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="facility-burns-unit"><span class="heading-icon"></span>3. BURNS UNIT</h4>
                        <p>Used for the care of the patients with burns, however, in the Kenyan health facilities, most burns patients receive care in the general ward of a hospital (due to lack of space or financial capacity).<br>
                        The burns unit is basically designed to reduce the risk of infection. Infection in burns occurs as a result of the loss of the mechanical barrier provided by the skin cover.<br>
                        It must therefore be maintained at a very high level of cleanliness.<br>
                        Infection control measures such as management of visitors and changing of garments and shoes before entering the unit must be adhered to.<br>
                        The unit must be well ventilated.<br>
                        Medical staff should avoid working in the unit when they have upper respiratory tract infections.<br>
                        In an ideal situation, a burns unit is supposed to meet all the requirements of an intensive care unit.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="facility-renal-dialysis-unit"><span class="heading-icon"></span>4. RENAL DIALYSIS UNIT</h4>
                        <p>This room is designed to ensure maintenance and sustenance of the life of patients during the dialysis procedure.<br>
                        The unit is piped with a specially treated water system to ensure an acceptable electrolytes concentration.<br>
                        In addition to the dialysis equipment, the room must be equipped with resuscitation and monitoring equipment just like an intensive care unit.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="avpu-scale"><span class="heading-icon"></span>AVPU</h3>
                        <p>The <dfn>AVPU</dfn> scale (an acronym from "alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive") is a system by which a health care professional can measure and record a patient's level of consciousness. It is mostly used in emergency medicine protocols, and within first aid.</p>
                        <p>It is a simplification of the Glasgow Coma Scale, which assesses a patient response in three measures: eyes, voice and motor skills. The AVPU scale should be assessed using these three identifiable traits, looking for the best response of each.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="avpu-meaning"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Meaning of the mnemonic</h4>
                        <p>The AVPU scale has four possible outcomes for recording (as opposed to the 13 possible outcomes on the Glasgow Coma Scale). The assessor should always work from best (A) to worst (U) to avoid unnecessary tests on patients who are clearly conscious. The four possible recordable outcomes are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Alert:</strong> The patient is fully awake (although not necessarily oriented). This patient will have spontaneously open eyes, will respond to voice (although may be confused) and will have bodily motor function.</li>
                            <li><strong>Verbal:</strong> The patient makes some kind of response when you talk to them, which could be in any of the three component measures of eyes, voice or motor - e.g. patient's eyes open on being asked "Are you OK?". The response could be as little as a grunt, moan, or slight move of a limb when prompted by the voice of the rescuer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pain:</strong> The patient makes a response on any of the three component measures on the

                                peripheral stimulus such as squeezing the fingers. A patient with some level of consciousness (a fully conscious patient would not require a pain stimulus) may respond by using their voice, moving their eyes, or moving part of their body (including abnormal posturing).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Unresponsive:</strong> Sometimes seen noted as 'unconscious', this outcome is recorded if the patient does not give any eye, voice or motor response to voice or pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In first aid, an AVPU score of anything less than A is often considered an indication to get further help, as the patient is likely to be in need of more definitive care. In the hospital or long term healthcare facilities, caregivers may consider an AVPU score of less than A to be the patient's normal baseline.</p>
                        <p>In some emergency medical services protocols, "Alert" can be subdivided into a scale of 1 to 4, in which 1,2,3 and 4 correspond to certain attributes, such as time, person, place, and event. For example, a fully alert patient might be considered "alert and oriented x 4" if he/she could correctly identify the time, their name, their location, and the event.</p>
                        <p>EMS crews may begin with an AVPU assessment, to be followed by a GCS assessment if the AVPU score is below "A."</p>
                        <p>The AVPU scale is not suitable for long-term neurological observation of the patient; in this situation, the Glasgow Coma Scale is more appropriate.</p>

                        <p>As mentioned above, it should not be used for long-term follow up of neurological status.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="avpu-comparison"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Comparison with other classification systems</h4>
                        <p>When compared to the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) the AVPU classification of alertness has been suggested to correspond in the following manner:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alert = 15 GCS</li>
                            <li>Voice Responsive = 12 GCS</li>
                            <li>Pain Responsive = 8 GCS</li>
                            <li>Unconscious = 3 GCS</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading" id="unconscious-care-pathway"><span class="heading-icon"></span>Care of the Unconscious Patients</h3>
                        <p>The management pathway is divided as follows:</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-ventilation"><span class="heading-icon"></span>1. Basic Ventilatory Support/Airway Care -</h4>
                        <p>This is airway control through positioning.<br>
                        The recovery position is best as it encourages drainage of secretions from the oral cavity.<br>
                        Suction of the airways to remove secretion and administration of oxygen, intubation of the trachea and artificial ventilation may be required.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-respiration-monitoring"><span class="heading-icon"></span>2. Monitoring of Respiration</h4>
                        <p>This is meant to enable early detection of any changes that may indicate complication, for example, increase in respiration rate, abnormal respiration sounds, etc.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-circulation"><span class="heading-icon"></span>3. Ensuring Adequate Circulation</h4>
                        <p>This is achieved through maintaining adequate blood volume by administering enough fluids through the intravenous route to supplement the nasal gastric tube feeding.<br>
                        A meticulous input/output chart must be maintained.<br>
                        The use of physiotherapy to exercise the joints and muscles also helps to improve circulation.<br>
                        Monitoring of circulation functions by taking and recording blood pressure and pulse rates, ECG, and oxygen saturation are important.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-nutrition"><span class="heading-icon"></span>4. Nutritional Management</h4>
                        <p>Can be achieved through insertion of a nasal gastric tube and using it for feeding.<br>
                        The intravenous route is also used to give parenteral feeds if the patient is not digesting, and to maintain fluid and electrolyte balances.<br>
                        Intravenous fluids are selected and administered to meet the electrolyte need in the body.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-skin-integrity"><span class="heading-icon"></span>5. Skin Integrity</h4>
                        <p>This is maintained through proper skin hygiene, which includes</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Daily bathing,</li>
                            <li>Two (2)-hourly turning of the patient and</li>
                            <li>Keeping the patient's bed linen clean and dry.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-elimination"><span class="heading-icon"></span>6. Elimination</h4>
                        <p>Adequate fluid intake ensures that kidney function is maintained.<br>
                        Some patients may require catheterization to keep them dry and for proper monitoring of urine production.<br>
                        Adequate fluids and feeding help to maintain bowel motion.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-psychosocial"><span class="heading-icon"></span>7. Psychosocial Needs</h4>
                        <p>This includes addressing the patient by their name at all times, while providing care.<br>
                        It is important to assume that the patient can hear and, therefore, you should inform the patient of any intended action that you intend to perform on them.<br>
                        Relatives should be informed of patient's progress and encouraged to provide the social support necessary to reassure the patient that they are not abandoned.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" id="care-pathway-monitoring-vitals"><span class="heading-icon"></span>8. General Monitoring of the Vital Signs</h4>
                        <p>This must be done to evaluate the patient's progress and identify early any impending complication</p>
