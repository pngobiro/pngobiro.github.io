                        <p>It is the process of prioritizing nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems, identifying measurable goals and outcomes, selecting appropriate interventions, and documenting the plan of care.<br>
                        Whenever possible, the nurse consults the client while developing a revising plan.<br>
                        The assessment data and diagnostic statement direct formulation of client goals and designing nursing interventions to prevent, reduce and eliminate client's problems.<br>
                        A nursing intervention is any treatment based upon clinical judgment and knowledge that a nurse performs to enhance patient outcomes.<br>
                        To be effective, a nurse plans care with clients and support persons but not for them.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" id="planning-priority-questions-diagnoses">Nursing diagnoses</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>Ineffective airway clearance R/T viscous secretion, secondary to deficient fluid volume and shallow chest expansion, secondary pain and fatigue ( high priority)</p>
                                <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
                                <p>Loss of respiratory functioning is a life threatening problem. The nurses' primary concern must be to promote Amanda's oxygenation by addressing the etiologies of this problem.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Deficient fluid volume- intake is insufficient to replace fluid loss R/T fever and diaphoresis (high priority)</p>
                                <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
                                <p>Severe fluid volume deficit is life threatening although not that severe for Amanda; it is a high priority problem because it is also a contributing factor to ineffective airway clearance. Collaborative efforts to improve her hydration have already begun (IVF), the nurse must immediately and continuously assess and promote Amanda's hydration.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Anxiety R/T difficulty breathing and concerns over work and parenting roles (Medium priority)</p>
                                <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
                                <p>Although she is concerned about work and parenting roles, these are not a threat to life. Also treatment of her high priority problem, ineffective airway clearance will relieve one of the etiologies of this problem (dyspnea).Meanwhile the nurse must provide symptomatic relief of Amanda's anxiety during periods of dyspnea because extreme anxiety could further compromise her oxygenation by causing her to breathe ineffectively and increase the rate at which she uses oxygen.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Risk of interrupted family processes R/T mother's illness and potential temporary unavailability of father to provide childcare. (low priority)</p>
                                <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
                                <p>Amanda's child is currently being cared for, if Amanda's husband returns as planned, this problem won't develop into an actual problem. No interventions are needed at present except for continued assessment and reassurance.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Impaired nutrition: Less than body requirements R/T decreased appetite, nausea and increased metabolism secondary disease process. (low priority)</p>
                                <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
                                <p>This problem is currently not health threatening but it could be if it were to persist. It will almost certainly resolve in a day or two as the medical problem does not resolve quickly, this will change to medium priority.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Bathing/ Hygiene self-care deficit R/T weakness, secondary to ineffective airway clearance and sleep pattern disturbance. (Low priority)</p>
                                <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
                                <p>This problem is caused by the other higher priority problems therefore it will resolve as the high priority problems resolve, meanwhile the nurse merely needs to assist Amanda with bathing so on to support conserve her energy until she is strong enough to resume her own care.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Sleep pattern disturbance R/T with cough, pain, orthopnea, fever and diaphoresis. (Low priority)</p>
                                <p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
                                <p>Lack of sleep is health threatening, but for the moment (until night) the nurse does not need to address this problem. Sleep pattern disturbance does contribute to Amanda's ineffective airway clearance but it is not the main cause therefore measures to promote sleep will be low priority until evening. After nurse has attended to Amanda's oxygenation and hydration needs, this problem priority will change.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Acute pain (chest) R/T cough secondary to pneumonia. (Not on care plan)</p>
                                <p>The nurse did not include pain as a problem on the care plan because pain is to be addressed as the etiology of sleep pattern disturbance and ineffective airway clearance. The pain etiologies (cough and pneumonia) will be treated with medications (collaborative interventions). Independent nursing interventions would address the problem rather than the etiology and would be the same as the nursing actions for ineffective airway clearance.</p>

                        <p>A goal (expected or desired outcome) helps the nursing team know whether the nursing care has been appropriate for managing the client's nursing diagnoses and collaborative problems therefore a written goal accompanies each one.<br>
                        The goal statement or outcome contains the criteria or objective evidence for verifying that the client has improved.<br>
                        Nurses and clients set goals for each diagnosis after setting priorities.<br>
                        Goals are broad statement e.g. improved nutritional status.<br>
                        Desired outcomes are more specific e.g. gain 5 kg by May $30 ^{\text {th }}$. Described in terms of observable client responses and what the nurse hopes to achieve by implementing nursing intervention.</p>

                        Short term goals; for clients who require health care for a short time and clients frustrated by long term goals that are difficult to attain. Short term goals take hours to days but less than a week.<br>
                        Long term goals takes weeks to months.<br>
                        For every nursing diagnosis write a desired outcome(s) that when achieved problem will be resolved.</p>

                        <p>All phases can be evaluated.<br>
                        Assessment<br>
                        Diagnosis<br>
                        Planning<br>
                        Implementation and<br>
                        Documentation</p>
                        <p>Evaluation is a planned, on-going, purposeful activity in which clients and healthcare professionals determine the client's progress toward achievement of goals/ outcomes and the effectiveness of the Nursing Care Plan (NCP)<br>
                        Successful evaluation depends on the effectiveness of the steps that precede it.</p>
                        <p>Assessment data must be accurate and complete so the nurse can formulate appropriate nursing diagnosis and goals/desired outcomes.<br>
                        The goals/desired outcomes must be stated concretely in behavioural terms to be useful for evaluating client responses<br>
                        Without the implementing phase in which the plan is put into action, there would be nothing to evaluate-The evaluation and assessment phases overlap.</p>
                        <p>During the assessment phase the nurse collects data for the purpose of making diagnoses.<br>
                        During the evaluation step the nurse collects data for the purpose of comparing the data to preselected goals and judging the effectiveness of the nursing care. The act of assessing (data collection) is the same.<br>
                        The difference lies in when the data are collected and how the data are used.</p>
