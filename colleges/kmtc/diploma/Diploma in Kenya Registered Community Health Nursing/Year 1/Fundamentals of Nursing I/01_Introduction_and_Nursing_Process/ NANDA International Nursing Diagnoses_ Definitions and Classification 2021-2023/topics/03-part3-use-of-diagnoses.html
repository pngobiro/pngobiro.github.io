                        <p>Health care is delivered by various types of health care professionals, including nurses,
                            physicians, and physical therapists, to name just a few. This is true in hospitals as well
                            as other settings across the continuum of care (e.g., clinics, homecare, long-term care,
                            community centers, prisons, schools). Each health care discipline brings its unique body of
                            knowledge to the care of the client. In fact, a unique body of knowledge is a critical
                            characteristic of a profession.</p>
                        <p>Collaboration, and at times overlap, occurs between professionals in providing care (Fig.
                            5.1). For example, a physician in a hospital setting may write an order for the client to
                            walk twice per day. Physical therapists focus on core muscles and movements necessary for
                            walking. Respiratory therapists may be involved if oxygen therapy is needed to enable the
                            patient's activity tolerance, due to an underlying respiratory condition. Social workers may
                            be involved with insurance coverage for necessary equipment. Nurses have a holistic view of
                            the patient, including working with the patient on balance and muscle strength related to
                            walking, breathing pattern and oxygenation to conserve energy during activity, teaching the
                            patient how to use accessory devices to support walking, as well as supporting the patient's
                            confidence and motivation.</p>

                        <p>Each health profession has a way to describe "what" the professional knows and "how" it acts
                            on what it knows. This chapter is primarily focused on the "what". A profession may have a
                            common language that is used to describe and code its knowledge. Physicians treat diseases
                            and use the International Classification of Disease (ICD) taxonomy to represent and code the
                            medical problems they treat. Psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health
                            professionals treat mental health disorders, and use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
                            of Mental Disorders (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although nurses learn a
                            lot about diagnoses contained in both the ICD and the DSM, it is important to remember that
                            nurses independently diagnose and treat human responses to health problems and/or life
                            processes, and use the NANDA International, Inc. (NANDA-I) nursing diagnosis classification.
                            The nursing diagnosis taxonomy, the process of diagnosing, and the use of the NANDA-I
                            terminology, will be described further.</p>
                        <p>The NANDA-I taxonomy provides a way to classify and categorize areas of concern to the
                            nursing professional (i.e., diagnostic foci). It contains 267 nursing diagnoses grouped into
                            13 domains and 47 classes. A domain is a "sphere of knowledge" and the NANDA-I domains
                            identify the unique knowledge of the nursing discipline (Table 5.1). The 13 NANDA-I domains
                            are further divided into classes (groupings that share common attributes). Urinary function,
                            for example, is a class in the Elimination and exchange domain. Each of the classes contain
                            relevant nursing diagnoses. Urinary retention (00023) is a nursing diagnosis in the class,
                            Urinary function, within the domain of Elimination and exchange.</p>

                        <p>Understanding the NANDA-I taxonomy helps the nurse identify and review diagnoses within the
                            same class. For example, in the Comfort domain, in the Physical comfort class, a nurse will
                            find nursing diagnoses related to pain, comfort, and nausea. A nursing diagnosis is a
                            clinical judgment concerning a human response to health conditions /life processes, or
                            susceptibility to that response, by an individual, family, group or community. Each nursing
                            diagnosis has a label, definition, and diagnostic indicators. Examples of nursing diagnosis
                            labels include chronic pain (00133) and ineffective health self-management (00276).</p>
                        <p>Nurses deal with responses to health conditions/life processes among individuals, families,
                            groups, and communities. Such responses are the central concern of nursing care and fill the
                            circle ascribed to nursing in Fig. 5.1. A nursing diagnosis can be focused on a problem, a
                            potential risk, or a strength.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Problem-focused diagnosis</strong> - a clinical judgment concerning an
                                undesirable human response to a health condition/life process that exists in an
                                individual, caregiver, family, group, or community</li>
                            <li><strong>Risk diagnosis</strong> - a clinical judgment concerning the susceptibility of
                                an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community for developing an undesirable
                                human response to health conditions/life processes</li>
                            <li><strong>Health promotion diagnosis</strong> - a clinical judgment concerning motivation
                                and desire to increase well-being and to actualize health potential. These responses are
                                expressed by a readiness to enhance specific health behaviors, and can be used in any
                                health state. In cases where individuals are unable to express their own readiness to
                                enhance health behaviors, the nurse may determine that a condition for health promotion
                                exists and then act on the client's behalf. Health promotion responses may exist in an
                                individual, caregiver, family, group, or community.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Although limited in number in the NANDA-I taxonomy, a syndrome can also be diagnosed by a
                            nurse. A syndrome is a clinical judgment concerning a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses
                            that occur together, and is therefore best addressed through similar interventions. An
                            example of a syndrome diagnosis is chronic pain syndrome (00255). The nursing diagnosis,
                            chronic pain (00133) is recurrent or persistent pain that has lasted at least 3 months and
                            that significantly affects daily functioning or well-being. Chronic pain syndrome is
                            differentiated from chronic pain in that, in addition to the chronic pain, it significantly
                            impacts other human responses, and thus a syndrome includes other nursing diagnoses, such as
                            disturbed sleep pattern (00198), fatigue (00093), impaired physical mobility (00085), or
                            social isolation (00053).</p>

                        <p>The nursing process requires nursing knowledge (theory/nursing science/ underlying nursing
                            concepts) (Herdman, 2013), and includes assessing, diagnosing, planning outcome(s) and
                            interventions, implementing, and evaluating (Fig. 5.2). Nurses use assessment and clinical
                            judgment to formulate hypotheses or explanations about presenting problems, risks, and/or
                            health promotion opportunities. Application of the knowledge of underlying concepts of
                            nursing science and nursing theory are required before patterns can be identified in
                            clinical data or accurate diagnoses can be made.</p>
                        <p>The components of the nursing process occur more or less simultaneously in the nurse's
                            thought processes. Note that the rectangles have the closest start line on the left and the
                            most distant end line on the right. This asymmetry represents the time period after the
                            beginning of data collection, when the nurse uses reasoning and clinical judgment to begin
                            to identify diagnoses, set patient-specific outcomes, and decide on interventions. While
                            completing these operations, the nurse can start implementing these decisions and evaluating
                            their outcomes (Bachion, 2009).</p>

                        <h3 id="principles-knowledge">5.3 Principles of Nursing Diagnosis: Knowledge of Nursing Concepts
                        </h3>
                        <p>Knowledge of key concepts, or nursing diagnostic foci, is necessary before beginning an
                            assessment. Examples of critical concepts important to nursing practice include breathing,
                            elimination, thermoregulation, physical comfort, self-care, and skin integrity.
                            Understanding such concepts allows the nurse to see patterns in the data and accurately
                            diagnose. Key areas to understand within the concept of pain, for example, include
                            manifestations of pain, theories of pain, at-risk populations, related pathophysiological
                            concepts (fatigue, depression), and management of pain. Full understanding of key concepts
                            is needed, as well, to differentiate diagnoses.</p>
                        <p>For example, to understand issues related to coping and stress tolerance that might be
                            specific to an immigrant population, a nurse must first understand the core concepts related
                            to potential problems, risks, or health promotion opportunities. In looking simply at
                            problems that can occur with coping and stress tolerance, the nurse may need to consider the
                            diagnoses of risk for complicated immigration transition (00260), and maladaptive grieving
                            (00135); concerns with resilience may lead the nurse to the diagnosis, impaired resilience
                            (00210); while issues related to activity planning might lead to a diagnosis of ineffective
                            activity planning (00199). As you can see, although each of these diagnoses is related to
                            coping and stress tolerance, they are not all concerned with the same core concept. Thus,
                            the nurse may collect a significant amount of data, but without a sufficient understanding
                            of the core concepts of immigration transition, grieving, resilience and activity planning,
                            the data needed for accurate diagnosis may be omitted, and patterns in the assessment data
                            can go unrecognized.</p>

                        <h3 id="assessing">5.4 Assessing</h3>
                        <p>Assessing involves the collection of subjective and objective data (e.g., vital signs,
                            patient/family interview, physical exam, laboratory and diagnostic imaging results) and
                            review of historical information provided by the patient/ family, or found within the
                            patient chart. Nurses also collect data on patient/ family strengths (to identify health
                            promotion opportunities) and risks (to prevent or postpone potential problems). Assessments
                            should be based on theoretical frameworks, including, but not limited to, nursing theories,
                            such as Careful Nursing, Culture Care Theory, and Theory of Transpersonal Caring. The
                            elements in the theoretical frameworks can be operationalized through assessment frameworks,
                            such as Marjory Gordon's Functional Health Patterns (FHPs). More information will be
                            provided about Gordon's FHPs in the chapter on assessment (Chapter 7.3). Nursing-centric
                            frameworks provide a way of categorizing large amounts of data into a manageable number of
                            related patterns or categories of data. In the upcoming chapter on assessment, we will
                            discuss this in more detail. However, it is important to consider that there are different
                            approaches to assessment, which can range from very broad to very narrow in focus, and
                            include risk assessment tools, patient reported assessment tools, and in-depth nursing
                            assessment tools, to name just a few.</p>
                        <p>The foundation of nursing diagnosis is clinical reasoning. Clinical reasoning involves the
                            use of clinical judgment to decide what is wrong with a patient, and clinical
                            decision-making to decide what needs to be done (Levett-Jones et al 2010). Clinical judgment
                            is "an interpretation or conclusion about a patient's needs, concerns, or health problems,
                            and/or the decision to take action (or not)" (Tanner 2006, p. 204). Key issues, or
                            diagnostic foci, may be evident early in the assessment (e.g., altered skin integrity,
                            loneliness) and allow the nurse to begin the diagnostic process. For example, a patient may
                            report insomnia, irritability, anguish, and/or show facial tension, hand tremors, and
                            increased perspiration. The experienced nurse will recognize the client's anxiety (00146)
                            based on client report and/or anxiety behaviors. Expert nurses can quickly identify clusters
                            of clinical cues from assessment data and seamlessly progress to nursing diagnoses. Novice
                            nurses take a more sequential process in determining appropriate nursing diagnoses.</p>
                        <p>As another example, after initial assessment of a patient experiencing breathing difficulties
                            with activity, several potential diagnoses may be considered. Nurses might use valid and
                            reliable instruments that measure actual responses, to further assess for these diagnoses,
                            and confirm or refute their diagnostic hypothesis. Some examples might include use of the
                            Multidimensional Dyspnea Scale (Kalluri et al., 2019), the International Sedentary
                            Assessment Tool (Prince et al., 2019), or the Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire (Rosenberg
                            et al., 2010).</p>
                        <p>As another example, if upon initial assessment, a potential diagnosis related to coping with
                            pain is identified, nurses might work with patients to use valid and reliable instrument or
                            scale that measures risk or signs/symptoms of an actual response, to further assess this
                            possibility and confirm or refute their diagnostic hypothesis. Some examples might include
                            use of the Morse Fall Scale (Morse, 1997), Multidimensional Dyspnea Scale (Kalluri et al,
                            2019), or the Braden Scale (Bergstrom et al, 1987).</p>

                        <h3 id="diagnosing">5.5 Diagnosing</h3>
                        <p>A nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment concerning a human response to health
                            conditions/life processes, or susceptibility to that response, by an individual, caregiver,
                            family, group, or community (NANDA-I DDC communication, 2019). It is the outcome of
                            diagnostic reasoning (Gordon, 1994) and it is typically stated in two parts: (1) descriptor
                            or modifier and (2) focus of the diagnosis or its key concept, such as with the diagnosis,
                            ineffective activity planning (00199) (Table 5.2). There are some exceptions in which a
                            nursing diagnosis is only one word, such as anxiety (00146), constipation (00011), fatigue
                            (00093), and nausea (00134). In these diagnoses, the modifier and focus are inherent in the
                            one term.</p>

                        <p>Nurses diagnose health problems, risk states, and readiness for health promotion.
                            Problem-focused diagnoses should not be viewed as being more important than risk diagnoses.
                            Sometimes a risk diagnosis can be the diagnosis with the highest priority for a patient. An
                            example may be a patient who has the nursing diagnoses of impaired oral mucous membrane
                            integrity (00045), impaired memory (00131), readiness for enhanced health self-management
                            (00293), and risk for adult pressure injury (00249), and has been newly admitted to a
                            skilled nursing facility. Although impaired oral mucous membrane integrity and impaired
                            memory are the problem-focused diagnoses, the patient's risk for adult pressure injury may
                            be the number one priority diagnosis. This may be especially true when related risk factors
                            are identified during the assessment (e.g., decreased physical mobility, protein-energy
                            malnutrition, dehydration, inadequate caregiver knowledge of pressure injury prevention
                            strategies) in an individual known to be part of an at-risk population (elderly; Individuals
                            in community, aged care, and rehabilitation settings; wheelchair bound).</p>
                        <p>Each nursing diagnosis has a label and a clear definition. It is important to state that
                            merely having a label or picking from a list of labels is insufficient. It is critical that
                            nurses know the definitions of the diagnoses they most commonly use. In addition, they need
                            to know the "diagnostic indicators" - the information that is used to diagnose and
                            differentiate one diagnosis from another. These diagnostic indicators include defining
                            characteristics and related factors or risk factors (Table 5.3). Defining characteristics
                            are observable cues/inferences that cluster as manifestations of a diagnosis (e.g., signs or
                            symptoms). An assessment that identifies the presence of a number of defining
                            characteristics lends support to the accuracy of the nursing diagnosis. Related factors are
                            an integral component of all problem-focused nursing diagnoses. Related factors, also called
                            etiological factors, are antecedent factors shown to have a patterned relationship with the
                            human response (e.g., cause, contributing factor). These factors must be modifiable by
                            independent nursing interventions, and whenever possible, interventions should be aimed at
                            these etiological factors. A review of client history often helps to identify related
                            factors. Whenever possible, nursing interventions should be aimed at these etiological
                            factors in order to remove the underlying cause of the nursing diagnosis. Risk factors are
                            antecedent factors that increase the susceptibility of an individual, caregiver, family,
                            group, or community to an undesirable human response (e.g., environmental, psychological).

                        <p>A nursing diagnosis does not need to contain all types of diagnostic indicators (i.e.,
                            defining characteristics, related factors, and/or risk factors). Problem-focused nursing
                            diagnoses contain defining characteristics and related factors. Health promotion diagnoses
                            usually have defining characteristics only; related factors could be used if they would
                            improve the clarity of the diagnosis. Only risk diagnoses have risk factors.</p>
                        <p>A nursing plan of care does not need to contain each type of nursing diagnosis. The example
                            below illustrates the use of problem and risk diagnoses, as well as the dynamic process of
                            determining nursing diagnoses.</p>

                                past year, and he is providing all her care by himself. The nurse states she will be

                        <p>A common format used by students when learning to document nursing diagnoses includes: _____
                            [nursing diagnosis] related to _____ [cause/ related factors] as evidenced by _____
                            [symptoms/defining characteristics]. For example, ineffective breastfeeding (00104) related
                            to maternal anxiety, inadequate family support, and pacifier use as evidenced by infant
                            crying at breast, infant unable to latch on to maternal breast correctly, and sustained
                            infant weight loss. Many nurse educators support this method as a helpful method for
                            students to learn to think critically, while it a also provides faculty members with a way
                            to evaluate clinical reasoning. Further, some argue that all nursing diagnoses should be
                            documented in the patient chart using this three-part format. However, it has always been
                            the position of NANDA-I that it is appropriate to document the label only, provided that the
                            related/risk factors and defining characteristics can be recognized in the assessment data,
                            nursing notes, or plan of care sections within the patient record, in order to provide
                            support for the nursing diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, most electronic health records (EHRs) in use today will not include the
                            "related to" and "as evidenced by" components. Therefore, it is important that the nursing
                            assessment tool within the EHR system contains the diagnostic indicators necessary for
                            diagnosis, to allow for documentation of the nursing diagnosis label only within the patient
                            problem list. After all, simply documenting a diagnosis does not prove its accuracy. As with
                            our colleagues in medicine, we must have our diagnostic indicators appear within the patient
                            record to support our diagnoses. Without this information, it is impossible to verify
                            diagnostic accuracy, which puts the quality of nursing care in question.</p>

                        <p>Once diagnoses are identified, prioritizing of selected nursing diagnoses must occur to
                            determine care priorities. High-priority nursing diagnoses need to be identified (i.e.,
                            urgent need, diagnoses with high level of congruence with defining characteristics, related
                            factors, or risk factors) so that care can be directed to resolve these problems or lessen
                            the severity or risk of occurrence (in the case of risk diagnoses).</p>
                        <p>Nursing diagnoses are used to identify intended outcomes of care and plan nursing-specific
                            interventions sequentially. A nursing outcome, according to the authors of the Nursing
                            Outcome Classification (NOC), refers to "a measurable individual, family, or community
                            state, behavior or perception that is measured along a continuum in response to nursing
                            interventions". The NOC is one example of a standardized nursing language that can be used
                            when planning care, to represent outcome measures related to a nursing diagnosis (Moorhead,
                            Swanson, Johnson, & Maas, 2018, p. 3). Nurses often, and incorrectly, move directly from
                            nursing diagnosis to nursing intervention without consideration of desired outcomes.
                            Instead, outcomes need to be identified before interventions are determined. The order of
                            this process is similar to planning a road trip. Simply getting in a car and driving will
                            get a person somewhere, but that may not be the place the person really wanted to go. It is
                            better to first have a clear location (outcome) in mind, and then choose a route
                            (intervention), to get to a desired location.</p>
                        <p>An intervention, according to the authors of the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC),
                            is defined as "any treatment, based upon clinical judgment and knowledge that a nurse
                            performs to enhance patient/client outcomes" (Butcher, Bulechek, Docterman, & Wagner, 2018,
                            p.xii). The NIC is an example of a standardized nursing intervention language that nurses
                            may use across various care settings. Using nursing knowledge, nurses perform both
                            independent and interdisciplinary interventions. These interdisciplinary interventions
                            overlap with care provided by other health care professionals (e.g., physicians, respiratory
                            and physical therapists).</p>
                        <p>Hypertension is a medical diagnosis, yet nurses perform both independent and
                            interdisciplinary interventions for these clients who have various types of problems or risk
                            states. Often nurses initiate standing protocols to manage medical diagnoses for patients,
                            and may believe that they are providing independent nursing interventions because they do
                            not require a direct order from a physician to begin the protocol. However, these standing
                            protocols are, in fact, dependent medical orders that are performed and monitored by nurses;
                            they are not independent nursing interventions. However, nurses do perform independent
                            interventions for those clients diagnosed with nursing diagnoses, such as risk for unstable
                            blood pressure (00267), which is a common nursing diagnosis in many settings. In reviewing
                            the related (etiological factors) for this diagnosis, the nurse would determine an
                            appropriate outcome for this patient, and then determine what nursing intervention(s) might
                            be initiated to achieve this outcome, aimed at the related factors of the diagnosis.</p>

                        <h3 id="kamitsuru-model">5.7 Kamitsuru's Tripartite Model of Nursing Practice</h3>
                        <p>Kamitsuru's Tripartite Model of Nursing Practice provides nurses with a clear understanding
                            of the types of interventions nurses perform, and the basis of knowledge that underlies
                            those different types.</p>
                        <p>Nurses often work with a patient who has medical problems. However, from a legal point of
                            view, physicians are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of these medical problems.
                            In the same way, nurses are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of nursing problems.
                            The important point is that nursing problems are different from medical problems. Moreover,
                            we do not rename medical diagnoses or terms to create nursing diagnoses, nor do we need a
                            nursing diagnosis for every nursing intervention or action.</p>
                        <p>To make these points clear, let's examine how nursing practice exists within health care,
                            from a broader perspective, based on the Three Pillar Model of Nursing Practice (Kamitsuru,
                            2008), Fig. 5.3. This model depicts three major components of nursing practice, which are
                            distinct but interrelated. In clinical practice, nurses are expected to perform various
                            actions.</p>
                        <p>First, we have practices/interventions that are driven by medical diagnoses. Nursing actions
                            may be related to related to medical treatments, patient surveillance and monitoring, as
                            well as interdisciplinary collaboration. For instance, when a physician diagnoses an
                            unconscious patient as having a cerebral infarction and orders intravenous (IV) medications,
                            the nurse implements the IV order as directed and carefully monitors the patient's response
                            to the medications. Nurses take these actions in response to medical diagnoses, and use
                            medical standards of care as the basis for these nursing actions.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_26_0fd2cb78757565eb0be7g-091-1.jpg"

                            <figcaption>Fig. 5.3 Kamitsuru's Tripartite Model of Nursing Practice</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Secondly, practice may be driven by nursing diagnoses. Independent nursing interventions do
                            not require physician approval or permission. For instance, for the above patient with a
                            cerebral infarction, the nurse positions the patient in a careful manner to prevent
                            aspiration, as well as pressure injury. Supportive care may also be provided to the
                            patient's spouse, who is also taking care of an elderly person with dementia at home. Nurses
                            take these actions based on nursing diagnoses, and use nursing standards of care as the
                            basis for these nursing actions.</p>
                        <p>Finally, practice may be driven by organizational protocols. These can be actions related to
                            basic care, such as changing linen, providing hygiene and daily care. These actions are not
                            specifically related to either medical diagnoses or nursing diagnoses, but they are based on
                            organizational standards of care.</p>
                        <p>All three actions combine to form the practice of nursing. Each has a different knowledge
                            base, and different responsibilities. The three parts are equally important for nurses to
                            understand, but only one of them relates to the unique disciplinary knowledge of nursing -
                            and that is the area we know as nursing diagnosis. This model also shows why we do not need
                            to rename medical diagnoses as nursing diagnoses. Medical diagnoses already exist in the
                            medical domain. However, medical diagnoses do not always explain everything that nurses
                            understand about patients, judgments made about their human responses, or interventions
                            implemented for patients. So, nursing diagnoses are used to explain independent clinical
                            judgments nurses make about their patients. Thus, nursing diagnoses provide the underpinning
                            of independent nursing interventions.</p>

                        <h3 id="evaluating">5.8 Evaluating</h3>
                        <p>A nursing diagnosis "provides the basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve
                            outcomes for which nursing has accountability" (Herdman & Kamitsuru 2018, p. 133). The
                            nursing process is often described as a stepwise process, but in reality a nurse will go
                            back and forth between steps in the process. Nurses will move between assessment and nursing
                            diagnosis, for example, as additional data are collected and clustered into meaningful
                            patterns and the accuracy of nursing diagnoses is evaluated. Similarly, the effectiveness of
                            interventions and achievement of identified outcomes is continuously evaluated as the client
                            status is assessed. Evaluation should ultimately occur at each step in the nursing process,
                            as well as once the plan of care has been implemented. Several questions to consider include

                        <h3 id="principles-clinical-app">5.9 Principles of Nursing Diagnosis: Clinical Application</h3>
                        <p>This description of nursing diagnosis basics, although aimed primarily at novices, can
                            benefit many nurses in that it highlights critical steps in using nursing diagnosis and
                            provides examples of areas in which inaccurate diagnosing can occur. An area that needs
                            continued emphasis, for example, includes the process of linking knowledge of underlying
                            nursing concepts to assessment, and ultimately nursing diagnosis. The nurse's understanding
                            of key concepts (or diagnostic foci) directs the assessment process and interpretation of
                            assessment data. Relatedly, nurses diagnose problem, risk and strength responses. Any of
                            these types of diagnoses can be the priority diagnosis (or diagnoses), and the nurse makes
                            this clinical judgment.</p>
                        <p>In representing the knowledge of nursing science, the NANDA-I taxonomy provides the structure
                            for a standardized language in which to communicate nursing diagnoses. Using the NANDA-I
                            terminology (the diagnoses themselves), nurses can communicate with each other, as well as
                            professionals from other health care disciplines, about "what" nurses uniquely know. The use
                            of nursing diagnosis in our interactions with patients/family members can help them to
                            understand the issues on which nurses will be focusing, and can engage them in their own
                            care. The terminology provides a shared language for nurses to address health problems, risk
                            states, and health promotion opportunities. NANDA-I's nursing diagnoses are used
                            internationally, with translation into more than 20 languages. In an increasingly global and
                            electronic world, NANDA-I also allows nurses involved in scholarship to communicate about
                            phenomena of concern to nursing in manuscripts and at conferences, in a standardized way,
                            thus advancing the science of nursing.</p>
                        <p>Nursing diagnoses are peer reviewed, and submitted for acceptance/revision to NANDA-I by
                            nurses in practice, nurse educators, and nurse researchers around the world. Submissions of
                            new diagnoses and/or revisions to existing diagnoses have continued to grow in number over
                            the nearly 50 years of the NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology. Continued submissions (and
                            revisions) to NANDA-I will further strengthen the scope, extent, and supporting evidence of
                            the terminology.</p>

                        <h3 id="chapter-summary">5.10 Brief Chapter Summary</h3>
                        <p>This chapter describes types of nursing diagnoses (i.e., problem-focused, risk, health
                            promotion) and steps in the nursing process. The nursing process begins with an
                            understanding of underlying concepts of nursing science, and nursing theories. Assessing
                            follows and involves collection and clustering of data into meaningful patterns. Diagnosing
                            involves clinical judgment about a human response to a health condition or life process, or
                            susceptibility to that response, by an individual, caregiver, family, group, or a community.
                            The nursing diagnosis components were reviewed in this chapter, including the label,
                            definition, and diagnostic indicators (i.e., related factors, risk factors, at risk
                            populations, and associated conditions). Given that a patient assessment will typically
                            generate a number of nursing diagnoses, prioritizing of nursing diagnoses is needed to
                            direct care delivery. Critical next steps in planning/ implementing include identification
                            of nursing outcomes and nursing interventions to eliminate the causative or risk factors of
                            a diagnosis, or to minimize their impact on the individual's, caregiver's, family's,
                            group's, or community's well-being. Evaluating occurs throughout the nursing process, and at
                            the conclusion of patient care.</p>

                        <h3 id="commonalities-global">6.1 Nursing Commonalities Around the Globe</h3>
                        <p>There are approximately 19 million nurses and midwives in the world, according to the World
                            Health Organization (WHO, 2013). Visualize this large number of nurses providing nursing
                            care across the world in various types of healthcare settings, speaking different languages,
                            using a range of equipment and technologies, and following countless and varied
                            institutional protocols. Although differences are evident, commonalities are numerous among
                            this professional group and its members' collective provision of nursing care.</p>
                        <p>Nurses have similar professional values (e.g., caring, dignity of the patient, collaboration)
                            and share foundational nursing knowledge. The individual (or recipient of care) is the
                            central focus of nursing. Nurses deal with individuals' responses to health problems and
                            life processes among individuals, caregivers, families, groups, and, communities.</p>
                        <p>Nurses use NANDA-I nursing diagnoses to communicate their clinical judgments about human
                            responses/life processes, or susceptibilities for these responses, that their patients are
                            experiencing. The nurse's clinical judgment "provides the basis for selection of nursing
                            interventions to achieve outcomes for which nursing has accountability" (Herdman &
                            Kamitsuru, 2018, p. 133).</p>

                        <h3 id="education-practice">6.2 Nursing Education and Practice</h3>
                        <p>Many schools of nursing have curricula that integrate nursing diagnosis, and linkages to
                            outcomes and interventions. Critical in the curricula is the importance of assessment to
                            guide identification and validation of nursing diagnoses. Also important is that members of
                            the faculty and administrative staff value and have knowledge of nursing diagnosis
                            terminology.</p>
                        <p>The NANDA-I Nursing Diagnoses: Definitions and Classification publication is a core textbook
                            for many nursing education programs, and is published in over 20 languages (Table 6.1).
                            Newer language translations and distribution in the last book cycle reflect broader interest
                            in our work within, countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Indian subcontinent.
                            A number of countries have shown recent interest in adopting NANDA-I via activities such as
                            international workshops, developing a NANDA-I Network Group, attending NANDA-I conferences,
                            requesting online seminars, or other learning activities to build knowledge of the NANDA-I
                            taxonomy and terminology.</p>

                            diagnosis, in nursing education equips each aspiring nurse with knowledge and skills
                            necessary for professional nursing practice. Integrating NANDA-I nursing diagnoses
                            throughout the curriculum involves content threaded into lecture courses, skills courses,
                            and simulation and clinical experiences. There are numerous ways to integrate standardized
                            nursing languages (SNL), including NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, into the curriculum.
                            Developing plans of care as clinical assignments are very common, and can be an effective
                            learning opportunity after students have been exposed to diagnosing. Problematic approaches
                            include teaching nursing diagnoses in a way that links them directly to medical diagnoses,
                            using standardized care plans for specific nursing diagnoses without linking assessment data
                            to diagnosis, and/ or without customization of interventions and outcomes for the patient. A
                            medical diagnosis should be considered by the nurse as part of the assessment, but should
                            never be used exclusively as the rationale for a nursing diagnosis. Similarly, a
                            standardized care plan can be a starting template, but must be customized to the patient and
                            the specific concerns or needs of each patient, as identified through nursing assessment.
                        </p>
                        <p>Healthcare settings use nursing diagnoses or "patient problems" to identify and prioritize
                            the areas of concern to nursing. Many healthcare organizations have moved from paper medical
                            records to electronic health records (EHR) to document nursing care. NANDA-I contracts with
                            major EHR vendors to license the NANDA-I terminology, and EHR vendors then customize the
                            terminology for each unique healthcare institution's HER, and customized builds can link
                            assessment data to diagnoses. NANDA-I also contracts directly with organizations (e.g.,
                            hospitals, home health, long-term care) for the use of the terminology, through its
                            publishing partners. With the popularity of EHRs, it is important to note that it is a
                            violation of copyright law to use NANDA-I terminology in an EHR without permission from
                            NANDA-I, in the form of a written contract from the publishing partner that manages digital
                            rights in the language of the user.</p>
                        <p>The presence of SNLs in EHRs offers new ways to study diagnostic accuracy (correspondence
                            between assessment data and the patient's current condition) and nursing documentation.
                            Studies have shown a need to improve diagnostic reasoning and accuracy among students and
                            nurses in practice (Johnson, Edwards, & Giandinoto, 2017; Larijani & Saatchi, 2019; Freire,
                            Lopes, Keenan, & Lopez, 2018). A wealth of clinical information can be mined when SNLs are
                            contained within the EHR, and when diagnoses can be validated through the use of data within
                            standardized nursing assessments.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>The NANDA-I professional association connects nurses (and others with interest in nursing
                            diagnosis) with interest in the pursuit of diagnostic terminology development and
                            refinement, as well as best practices for education, research, and use of the NANDA-I
                            terminology. Members of the association include students, nurses in practice,
                            administrators, educators, informaticists, and researchers. Members are connected through
                            its website and social media channels, as well as having the opportunity to present their
                            research and share experiences at NANDA-I conferences. The NANDA-I journal, International
                            Journal of Nursing Knowledge, publishes research on worldwide efforts to identify nursing
                            knowledge, develop and apply SNLs in practice, education, informatics and research.</p>
                        <p>NANDA-I has been linked to several nursing classifications, and, with permission, several

                        <p>Most research in the area of SNLs has been conducted on NANDA-I diagnoses, followed by "NNN",
                            which is the combined use of NANDA-I, the Nursing Outcomes and Nursing Interventions
                            Classifications (NOC and NIC, respectively), and their linkages (Tasten et al, 2014; Herdman

                            this writing, NANDA-I is collaborating with members of SNOMED to consider the possibilities
                            of developing a reference set within SNOMED CT so that its users could access NANDA-I terms

                        <h3 id="international-implementation">6.4 International Implementation</h3>
                        <p>There are many ways that colleges and universities, healthcare organizations, professional
                            associations, and even government entities have worked together to educate and implement
                            nursing diagnosis terminology. Widespread implementation of nursing diagnosis terminology
                            has been advanced in some countries by mandates for use. Several countries in Latin America
                            (e.g., Peru, Mexico, Brazil) have included the use of nursing process and nursing diagnosis
                            in professional nursing regulations or governmental laws. The following exemplars, in
                            alphabetical order of country, provide a global perspective on the status of implementation
                            in some parts of the world of the NANDA-I terminology.</p>

                        <h4 id="brazil">6.4.1 Brazil</h4>
                        <p>The Federal Nursing Council (COFEN) has regulated nursing since 1986, and requires that
                            nursing care be performed according to the nursing process elements in every healthcare
                            institution, and states that nurses have the right to do so (Brasil, 1986, 1987; COFEN,
                            2002, 2009, 2017). Prior to these regulations, nurses in Brazil promoted the scientific
                            advancement of nursing. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dr. Wanda de Aguiar Horta, from the
                            University of São Paulo (EEUSP), promoted scientific methods and the use of nursing
                            diagnosis and the nursing process (Paula, Nara, & Horta, 1967; Horta, Hara, & Paula, 1971;
                            Horta, 1972; Horta, 1977). In the late 1980s, two groups adopted NANDA diagnoses, the EEUSP
                            (led by Dr. Edna Arcuri) and Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) (led by Dr. Marga Coler)
                            (Coler, Nóbrega, Garcia, & Coler-Thayer, 2009; Cruz, 1991).</p>
                        <p>Knowledge of the NANDA taxonomy and terminology was further disseminated through publications
                            and conferences. In 1990, publication of the manual, Nursing diagnosis: a conceptual and
                            practical approach, contained a translation of the revised NANDA-I Taxonomy 1 (Farias,
                            Nóbrega, Perez, & Coler, 1990). The first National Symposium on Nursing Diagnoses was
                            promoted in 1991 by Dante Pazzanese Cardiology Institute (IDPC) and the current Paulista
                            Nursing School (EPE-Unifesp); the first International Symposium on Nursing Diagnoses
                            followed, in 1995, promoted by EEUSP. The first official translation of the NANDA
                            classification was completed in 1999. In 2002, EPE-Unifesp held the 6th National Symposium
                            on Nursing Diagnoses occurred along with the first International Symposium on Nursing
                            Classifications. The events helped nurses to understand the linkages between NANDA, NOC and
                            NIC.</p>
                        <p>The nursing process is taught across all nursing programs. This stems in part from the
                            National Curricular Guidelines of Undergraduate Nursing Courses, established in 2001, which
                            affirmed that nurses can diagnose (Conselho Nacional de Educação, 2001). The Commission on
                            the Organization of Nursing Practice (COMSISTE ABEn Nacional), established in 2006 by the
                            Brazilian Nursing Association (ABEn), educates nurses on the nursing process, and promotes
                            effective implementation of the nursing process and SNL in practice (ABEn, 2017a; ABEn
                            2017b). Graduate programs have contributed widely to the use of nursing diagnosis in Brazil,
                            and during the period of 2006-2016, 85% of 216 accessible theses and dissertations focused
                            on nursing diagnoses and NANDA-I nursing diagnoses (Hirano, Lopes, & Barros, 2019). Other
                            educational initiatives include the distance learning Update Program on Nursing Diagnoses
                            (PRONANDA) produced in Brazil since 2013 (NANDA International, Herdman, & Carvalho, 2013).
                            Implementation of SNL in EHRs has contributed to the expanded use of NNN. Since 2013, nearly
                            400 licensed sales have been made by Grupo A to a total of 32 health care settings.</p>
                        <p>Despite this favorable scenario, implementation and use of the nursing process and SNL remain
                            inconsistent in the country. For example, in 416 sectors with 40 institutions in São Paulo
                            State, 78.8% documented assessment, 78.8% documented diagnoses, but only 56.0% documented
                            assessment, diagnosis, interventions and outcomes, whereas 5.8% documented no phase of the
                            nursing process or nursing notes (Azevedo, Guedes, Araújo, Maia, & Cruz, 2019). In 2020, the
                            Nursing Process Research Network (REPPE) was created by researchers from several regions in
                            the country, aimed at generating, synthesizing, and sharing knowledge on the nursing process
                            and SNL (REPPE, n.d.). The continuous promotion of events by ABEn, COMSISTE's actions and
                            bedside discussions using SNL, such as those promoted by IDPC, Hospital de Clínicas de Porto
                            Alegre (HCPA), and Hospital Universitário da USP, are valuable initiatives for the
                            advancement of the nursing process and SNL implementation in practice in Brazil.</p>

                        <h4 id="japan">6.4.2 Japan</h4>
                        <p>In the 1990s, nursing diagnosis fascinated many Japanese nurses who sought independent
                            practice based upon professional knowledge. Although there is no regulation mandating
                            nursing diagnosis use, it is used or taught by nearly 60% of hospitals and 50% of nursing
                            schools. Nursing diagnosis is not included in the standard nursing curriculum. Whether
                            nursing diagnosis is taught in undergraduate programs depends on the expertise and
                            perspective of the instructors at each nursing school. Since there are no guidelines for
                            nursing diagnosis education, instructors are often confused about what or how to teach.</p>
                        <p>In the last 20 years, the introduction of EHR systems has spread throughout the country, and
                            nursing diagnosis is viewed as an essential standardized language. Hospitals that use
                            nursing diagnosis terminology incorporate its training into in-service education. Some
                            hospitals invite outside instructors to provide such training periodically, while others
                            utilize internal and external instructors to enhance staff members' diagnostic skills and
                            knowledge. It is a challenge for many hospitals to develop and retain their own instructors.
                        </p>
                        <p>Although present in EHRs, nursing leadership has not taken full advantage of nursing
                            diagnosis data for healthcare improvement (e.g., staffing, patient outcomes). Continued
                            efforts are needed in Japan to strengthen the knowledge and confidence of nurses in their
                            diagnostic judgments. Nursing diagnosis is used most effectively in hospitals where nurse
                            administrators value its use in the EHR, and are committed to staff development with a
                            long-term perspective.</p>

                        <h4 id="mexico">6.4.3 Mexico</h4>
                        <p>Since the early 1970's, educational activities focused on the nursing process were promoted
                            by educational and service organizations and institutions, especially the National
                            Association of Nursing Schools, the National Association of Universities and Higher
                            Education Institute, and National Nurses Association. Collaborations resulted in guidance
                            and unified criteria for standardized care plans, and criteria for teaching and application
                            of the nursing process to improve nursing performance (Moran, nd).</p>
                        <p>In 2007 the creation of the Permanent Nursing Commission (PNC) was reported in the official
                            newspaper of the Federation (government), Diario Oficial de la Federación. The PNC is the
                            nursing advisory body of the Federal Government, with the purpose of establishing policies
                            for the practice and training of nurses. The PNC developed nine recommendations to
                            strengthen the culture of quality in the nursing services of health facilities and
                            standardization of nursing care. The most significant were related to the nursing process
                            (NP) and implementation of the NP in medical units (Recommendation 1); standardization of
                            nursing care through nursing care plans for main health problems using diagnostic labels
                            (Recommendation 2); and proposed development of a catalog of nursing care plans
                            (Recommendation 9) (Hernández, 2011).</p>
                        <p>The nursing process has been incorporated into nursing curricula. There remains, however, a
                            gap between theory and practice, as well as a minimal implementation in healthcare settings.
                            Professionals apply knowledge mediated by a series of values inherent to the profession,
                            however there is a difference between how the academic area applies the nursing process, and
                            how it is implemented in the clinical area. In hospital practice, there are few nursing
                            professionals who apply NNN as a helpful tool for the development of professional practice.
                            Nurses typically put more emphasis on the development of technical skills than on the
                            methodological knowledge of necessary for planning care. The collection of data, or
                            assessment, is conducted quickly, and often incompletely, which limits decision-making
                            regarding human responses, with greater weight attributed to pathophysiological responses of
                            patients, with the predominant biomedical model prevailing in the hospital setting.</p>
                        <p>Nursing in Mexico has made progress in terms of the nursing care modalities and the use of
                            standardized language. More research is needed in Mexico to contribute to the development of
                            nursing diagnosis terminology.</p>

                        <h4 id="peru">6.4.4 Peru</h4>
                        <p>Nursing in Peru has gone through a process of development and transition in both education
                            and clinical practice. Since the adoption of the Peruvian University Law in 1983, only
                            universities can offer a professional degree, and the curriculum for nursing schools has
                            been strengthened. The nursing process was incorporated into nursing courses, which includes
                            identification of problems and/or needs of the patient. In this context, three stages were
                            taught: assessing, implementing and evaluating, which allowed the nurse to identify patient
                            needs, to develop individual, caregiver, group, family, or community care plans.</p>
                        <p>In the 1980s, further development of the nursing process led to use of five stages:
                            assessing, diagnosing, planning, implementing, and evaluating. The role of universities was
                            essential for education and outreach of this process. The NANDA-I diagnosis classification
                            began to spread, and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, started the first collaborative
                            work between a university and a hospital (State Hospital Arzobispo Loayza). Professors from
                            the university began educating nurses at this hospital on the NANDA-I diagnosis
                            classification. This was replicated at three additional state hospitals.</p>
                        <p>The support of the College of Nursing Professionals and approval of the Peruvian Nurse Law in
                            2002 further increased the use of nursing diagnosis terminology, as the Law required
                            inclusion of the nursing process in the nursing documentation system. Teaching methodologies
                            have varied among universities, hospitals, and regions. In some settings the NANDA-I
                            classification has been implemented, and in others, this is still in process. Professional
                            Certification by the College of Nursing Professionals began in 2010, and was implemented by
                            the Professional Competencies Assessments, Evaluation Centers, which are accredited by the
                            National System for the Evaluation, Accreditation, and Certification of University Quality.
                            In addition, the use of NANDA-I nursing diagnosis was formalized by the Professional
                            Competences' regulations in 2015. This included the use of the NANDA-I classification in the
                            evaluation instruments used in the process, such as the nursing progress notes, which shows
                            the importance of the use of the SNL in the safe care of the patient. Moreover, policy
                            entities, such as the Ministry of Health, approved Nursing Intervention Guides that
                            strengthened the use of the NANDA-I classification in the clinical area of the State
                            Hospitals nationwide, as well as "Nursing Progress Notes", which have been approved and
                            published at the entities' web pages.</p>
                        <p>Significant integration of NANDA-I diagnoses has occurred at multiple state hospitals.
                            Electronic health records are currently being implemented, based on the National Registry of
                            Electronic Clinical Records implementation plan.</p>
                        <p>The acquisition of NANDA-I diagnosis knowledge by university professors, and their interest
                            in promoting this knowledge in the education of nurses, is the primary force driving the
                            implementation of NANDA-I diagnosis forward. The NANDA-I Network: Peru continues to
                            strengthen the understanding and implementation of SNLs. This network meets with
                            stakeholders to make nursing visible for the benefit of society and nursing professionals.

                        <h4 id="ireland">6.4.5 Republic of Ireland</h4>
                        <p>The Republic of Ireland serves as an interesting exemplar of how NNN is being integrated into
                            educational and healthcare settings (Murphy, McMullin, Brennan, & Meehan, 2017).
                            Implementation of the Careful Nursing Philosophy and Professional Practice Model (Careful
                            Nursing) has been underway since 2009. Central to nursing practice is the Practice
                            Competence and Excellence dimension, which includes the concept,
                            diagnoses-outcomes-interventions, as well as a care planning structure using NANDA-I. An
                            essential first step in this care planning structure is the identification of the patient's
                            NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. At this time, Careful Nursing is being implemented in ten
                            hospitals and four nursing schools, primarily in the southwest and southern areas of the
                            Republic of Ireland.</p>
                        <p>NANDA-I is implemented in the Republic of Ireland because nurses in hospital practice want to
                            or are required to use it (initially because of Careful Nursing), but also because hospital
                            Directors of Nursing have found that NANDA-I is usable "at the bedside". Nurses in practice
                            recognize that NANDA-I nursing diagnoses give them the ability to name what they know, and
                            diagnose nursing needs of people for whom they provide care. This encourages nurse educators
                            to prioritize and thread knowledge of NANDA-I through all levels of the undergraduate
                            curriculum. The shared perspectives of practicing nurses and nurse educators is truly
                            helping to narrow the theory-practice gap.</p>

                        <h4 id="spain">6.4.6 Spain</h4>
                        <p>Implementation of SNL in Spain occurred more than 20 years ago. Nurses began to use SNL in
                            practice, mainly with the incorporation of the EHR and, as a consequence, the Health
                            Ministry created legislation on the necessity to use SNL, specifically NNN, for nursing
                            documentation. There was collaboration between clinical nurses and university nursing
                            faculty to decide how SNL would be included in the electronic systems. From the beginning of
                            electronic system implementation in the Spanish Territory, the efforts have multiplied. The
                            use of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses in nursing practice is not questioned. The Spanish Health
                            Ministry includes NNN languages in updates made to any nursing protocol.</p>
                        <p>Nursing colleges, and many clinical nurses working in hospitals or primary healthcare, have
                            been part of the change forces regarding SNL. The development of primary healthcare services
                            was a major impetus for SNL to be taught at all levels, through continuing education for
                            nursing professionals and at the colleges of nursing. The creation of the Spanish
                            Association for Nomenclature, Taxonomy and Nursing Diagnoses (AENTDE) in 1996 was crucial
                            for thousands of Spanish nurses to learn and discuss with colleagues from NANDA-I, and other
                            international associations, the significance of using SNL in general, and nursing diagnoses
                            in particular.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish Health Ministry has been very involved in the implementation and use of SNL. One
                            of the first projects, together with the Consejo Nacional de Enfermería (National
                            Organization of Spanish Nurses) and AENTDE, was the calculation of the cost of nursing care
                            using standardized nursing care plans that included NNN for different clinical processes,
                            both at hospitals and in Primary Health Care (Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo, n.d.). By
                            2010, there were more than 100 Spanish hospitals using the same electronic system, called
                            "GACELA", that incorporated NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. Some parts of the Spanish territory
                            were using the system at all levels of clinical care.</p>
                        <p>Electronic systems have clearly facilitated the implementation of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses.
                            In the EHR, nursing has the most complete SNL and it is also the most complex, including
                            assessments, diagnoses, outcomes, outcome indicators, interventions, activities, etc., and
                            all of these are interrelated. The electronic record is a tool that must facilitate the work
                            of professionals who use it and, indeed it does this. The EHR facilitates planning and
                            recording of care, while producing data to foster management.</p>
                        <p>The future is positive for continued use of SNL in general and NANDA-I nursing diagnosis
                            terminology, specifically. Another important area to consider is the incorporation of the
                            Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) in the electronic systems of
                            many of the European Countries, which will occur in Spain in the not too distant future.
                            Information technology innovations will continue to improve nursing software and information
                            management, along with the use of innovations such as business intelligence or data
                            warehouses, which allow analysis of huge amounts of data and can enhance areas of nursing,
                            such as management and leadership, research, evidence-based nursing interventions, and
                            practice improvement.</p>

                        <h4 id="usa">6.4.7 United States</h4>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association (ANA) recommends that nurses document using the nursing
                            process within the patient record, and recognizes 13 SNLs. NANDA-I is the most recognized
                            and researched of the languages on the ANA's list (Tastan, Linch, Keenan, Stifter, McKinney,
                            Fahey, Lopez, Yao & Wilkie, 2014). The unwillingness of the ANA to take a stand in terms of
                            which SNLs should be used in clinical practice has led to a lack of consensus nationally,
                            which has undermined the importance of diagnostic reasoning, and overall clinical reasoning
                            related to the nursing process, within education and practice. Unfortunately, because there
                            are no professional regulations or requirements guiding use of nursing diagnosis, or SNLs
                            related to outcomes or interventions, it remains the decision of each individual nursing
                            school as to the degree to which it includes NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology and that
                            of other SNLs - in the curriculum. This leaves the USA at a distinct disadvantage due to its
                            inability to harvest data from EHRs to better understand nurses' impact on patient care,
                            what the actual cost of nursing care is, and which nursing diagnoses may prolong hospital
                            stays, lead to increased readmissions, or result in preventable sequelae.</p>
                        <p>It is not known how many healthcare institutions have implemented the use of SNLs for
                            electronic nursing documentation in the United States. In a rare study, usage of EHRs in the
                            state of Minnesota (USA) was examined, with 92% of healthcare systems (e.g., hospitals,
                            clinics, public health) in the state using EHRs. Of these organizations, only 30% used a SNL
                            (Huard & Monsen, 2017). However, it is well known that many organizations do indeed
                            incorporate NANDA-I nursing diagnoses labels into documentation systems, without procuring a
                            license. In many of these cases, nurses are unaware that they are documenting with NANDA-I
                            labels, because they are not properly referenced, and many nurses, especially those with
                            associate degree education, have not learned nursing diagnosis content in their curricula.
                            This problem is certainly not unique to the USA, and is probably a reflection of the
                            continued lack of economic support for nursing as a professional, independent discipline.
                        </p>
                        <p>The EHR is part of the healthcare landscape in the USA. Incentives in the federal Health
                            Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 put adoption of
                            EHRs on the fast track for healthcare organizations. Standards issued by the government
                            (Department of Health and Human Services) require that EHRs contain an up-to-date problem
                            list of current diagnoses that users can electronically enter and modify. However, there are
                            no standards for languages that must be used in problems lists, and thus problem lists vary
                            widely among healthcare institutions, and often the problem lists include only medical
                            diagnoses. Again, this lack of consistency significantly limits the availability of well
                            defined, high quality big data sets for nursing research.</p>
                        <p>The apparent lack of use of SNLs creates a gap between what knowledge nursing schools use to
                            prepare nurses for practice, and what nurses actually see and use in healthcare settings.
                            That said, many undergraduate schools of nursing do teach NANDA-I nursing diagnosis in the
                            curriculum, but it is often taught in an early course and not well integrated into advanced
                            content as students move through their programs. Furthermore, it is often incorrectly linked
                            to medical diagnosis, with little to no education provided on diagnostic reasoning, or how
                            assessment should drive nursing diagnosis. Nursing faculty members often received little or
                            confusing education themselves on diagnosing, and therefore are often unsure about how to
                            teach nursing diagnosis. One very positive aspect is the new relationship between Boston
                            College and NANDA-I, which cofounded the Marjory Gordon Program for Knowledge Development
                            and Clinical Reasoning. This partnership will advance development of educational materials,
                            tools, and learning strategies to support nursing educators as they teach diagnostic
                            reasoning and nursing diagnosis terminology, as well as foster the development of nursing
                            knowledge.</p>

                        <h3 id="summary-6">6.5 Summary</h3>
                        <p>It takes a global community to inform, teach, and implement NANDA-I nursing diagnosis
                            terminology. Indeed, it is a global phenomenon! The NANDA-I taxonomy provides a way to
                            classify areas of concern (diagnostic foci) to nurses and the patients for whom we provide
                            care. The NANDA-I nursing diagnoses describe human responses to health problem/life
                            processes and inform the identification of outcomes and interventions. What is clear is that
                            NANDA-I nursing diagnoses support the clinical reasoning process and provide a
                            discipline-specific language to describe the unique knowledge of the nursing discipline.</p>
                        <p>Innovative practices for implementation of nursing diagnosis are occurring in many places
                            across the globe (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Italy, Spain, Brazil) too many to name! There are
                            many professionals dedicated to these efforts, including clinical nurses, nurse educators,
                            administrators, informaticists, and researchers.</p>
                        <p>The NANDA-I nursing terminology is the only SNL that is continually updated with current
                            evidence, and assigned level of evidence criteria, to best reflect the full scope of nursing
                            practice. Nursing diagnoses are submitted for acceptance (new diagnoses) or revision
                            (existing diagnoses) to NANDA-I by practicing nurses, nurse educators, graduate students,
                            and nurse researchers. It is clear that NANDA-I has a global reach to support the millions
                            of nurses making clinical judgments (nursing diagnoses) related to patient health problems,
                            risks, and strengths, and to drive relevant interventions and outcomes.</p>

                            arrive at a valid conclusion; in nursing, it is used to describe the way a nurse "analyzes
                            and understands a patient's situation and forms conclusions" (p. 58). Tanner (2006) sees it
                            as the process by which nurses make clinical judgments by selecting from alternatives,
                            weighing evidence, using intuition and pattern recognition. Similarly, Banning (2008)
                            defined clinical reasoning as the application of knowledge and experience to a clinical
                            situation, in a concept analysis of clinical reasoning, dating from 1964 to 2005 . The study
                            identified the need for tools to measure clinical reasoning in nursing practice.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that clinical reasoning is a process, informed and reformed by new
                            data or evidence. It is not a step-by-step, linear process, but rather an evolving one. It
                            occurs over time, often across multiple patient/family encounters. The process is also an
                            iterative one. The more information we obtain, the more information we are able to
                            synthesize, uncovering the problem(s) and discovering pattern formation. For the more novice
                            nurses early in their careers, this process may take time. Nurses with more experience may
                            move through the process more quickly, having developed knowledge from seeing many patients
                            over time. Nevertheless, each patient situation is unique and requires nurses to fully
                            engage in all of the components of the reasoning process to uncover pattern formation or
                            problem identification.</p>

                        <h3 id="clinical-reasoning-nursing-process">7.2 Clinical Reasoning within the Nursing Process
                        </h3>
                        <p>Many authors focus on the nursing process, without taking the time to ensure that we
                            understand the concepts of nursing science; yet, the nursing process begins with - and
                            requires - an understanding of these underlying concepts of nursing and the human
                            experience. If we do not understand our disciplinary concepts (or ideas defined by our
                            knowledge), we will struggle to identify how pattern formation of the whole is experienced
                            by our patients, families, and communities.</p>
                        <p>A concept is as an image or an abstract idea. Central concepts of the discipline of nursing
                            include environment, health, nursing, and person (Walker & Avant, 2019). Other concepts
                            emerge as we describe phenomena of concern to nursing, such as well-being, stress, or
                            activity. It is critical that we know (and teach) these concepts so that nurses can
                            recognize normal human responses and patterns inconsistent with usual responses, identify
                            risks or threats to health, and promote health and wellness. Engaging in the nursing process
                            (assessing, diagnosing, planning, intervening, and evaluating) is meaningless if we do not
                            understand underlying nursing concepts and if we cannot identify them from the individual
                            patterns manifested within the data we collect during assessment.</p>
                        <p>Without a solid grounding in concepts, the knowledge or phenomena of concern to nursing, it
                            is difficult to articulate hypotheses or statements of probability about patients and their
                            experiences. Without this knowledge, we lack the ability to engage in a more in-depth
                            assessment and obtain new data that will confirm or eliminate a tentative problem or
                            diagnosis. Although conceptual knowledge has not generally been included within the nursing
                            process, knowing this information enhances our ability to understand the human experience to
                            its fullest.</p>

                            <h4>Example. What do we mean by pattern formation or data synthesis?</h4>
                            <p>We are talking about how our minds pull together information from a variety of data
                                points to form a picture of what we are seeing, and then recognize a name. Let us first
                                look at a nonclinical scenario.</p>
                            <p>Assume you are out for a walk, and you go past a group of men seated at a picnic bench at
                                a park. You notice that they are doing something with little rectangular objects, and
                                they are speaking in very loud voices - some are even shouting - as they slam these
                                objects on the table between them. The men seem very intense, and it appears they are
                                arguing about these objects, but you cannot understand what these objects are or what
                                exactly the men are doing with them. As you slow down to watch them, you notice a small
                                crowd has gathered. Some of these individuals occasionally nod their heads or comment in
                                what seems to be an encouraging manner, some seem concerned, and others appear to be as
                                confused by what they are watching as you are.</p>
                            <h5>Linking concepts and data.</h5>
                            <p>What is happening here? What is it that you are observing? It may be hard for you to
                                articulate what you are seeing if it is something with which you have no experience.
                                When we do not understand a concept, it is hard to move forward with our thinking
                                process. Suppose that we told you that what you were observing was men playing Mahjong,
                                a type of tile-based board game. The tiles are used like cards, only they are small,
                                rectangular objects traditionally made of bone or bamboo. Although you may not know
                                anything about Mahjong, you can understand the concept "game". With this understanding,
                                you might begin to look at the scene unfolding before you in a different way. You might
                                begin to see the four men as competitors, each hoping to win the game, which might
                                explain their intensity. You might begin to consider their raised voices as a form of
                                good-natured taunting of one another, rather than angry shouting. Once you understand
                                the concept of "game", you can begin to paint a picture in your mind as to what is
                                happening in this scene, and you can begin to interpret the data you are collecting
                                (cues) in a way that makes sense within the context of a game. Without the "game"
                                concept, though, you might continue the struggle to make sense of your observations.</p>
                            <p>Now let us look at the idea of nursing concepts (knowledge) using a clinical scenario.
                                Lisa is on her first clinical placement as a nursing student, under the supervision of
                                Prof. Leonard, a faculty member in an elderly independent/ assisted living facility. On
                                one of her placement days, Lisa is assessing Mr. Smith, while assisted by her professor.
                                Mr. Smith is 75 years old and has lived in the facility for 12 months. He tells Lisa
                                that he feels that he is lacking energy all the time, he cannot concentrate, and most
                                days he has not even brushed his teeth. He is very concerned that there is something
                                wrong with his heart. Lisa begins by taking his vital signs, but as she is doing this,
                                she asks Mr. Smith to tell her what has been happening in his life since he began living
                                at the facility. He indicates that he had to move in after his wife died from a heart
                                attack, because he could not take care of the house chores and run errands all by
                                himself, and his only daughter lived abroad with her husband and 4 children. He denies
                                any chest pain, heart palpitations, or shortness of breath. When Prof. Leonard asks him
                                why he's worried about his heart, he says "well, this thought keeps repeating in my mind
                                every day, that my wife wouldn't have died if I had insisted that she went to see a
                                cardiologist earlier".</p>
                            <p>Lisa asks him how often his daughter gets to visit him. Mr. Smith indicates that she had
                                to leave immediately after his wife's funeral, because she and her husband had a lot of
                                work activities, and they had not been able to visit him since then, but they usually
                                spoke on the phone once a week. He notes that he doesn't really have an interest in the
                                living facility activities, and it was hard to leave his neighborhood because there was
                                a couple who lived across the street and they were very good friends. They met at least
                                three times a week for dinner, or they watched TV or played board games, and they even
                                traveled together a couple of times. Now they only talk by phone. Although he is glad he
                                gets to talk with them, he says it isn't the same as enjoying dinner with his wife and
                                them. He points out that his wife was the strong link to the relationship with the
                                neighbors, because she was always proposing and planning different activities. He even
                                has a voice message from her on his phone that he listens to every day, proposing that
                                they all should go to a party together that weekend.</p>
                            <p>Lisa tells Mr. Smith that his vital signs are very good. Prof. Leonard suggests to Lisa
                                that he may be suffering from a change in his grieving process, and suggests that they
                                try a few adjustments to see if that can impact Mr. Smith's feelings of restfulness and
                                being at peace with himself. First, he recommends that they speak with Mr. Smith, and
                                then with the environmental services director to get him enrolled in a bereavement
                                support group, and begin counseling with mental health staff at the nursing home, so
                                that he can express his grieving process. He also tells her that Mr. Smith should be
                                assessed for the development of clinical depression. Finally, he suggests talking with
                                Mr. Smith about reconnecting with his neighborhood friends, in person, and to the
                                director of resident life to find out how he might be able to visit his friends, or have
                                them come to the facility to see his new apartment to slowly get Mr. Smith involved in
                                his new community.</p>
                            <p>Lisa is amazed that Prof. Leonard almost immediately identified a potential problem with
                                Mr. Smith. Prof. Leonard draws Lisa's attention to the nursing diagnosis, maladaptive
                                grieving (00301), and she realizes that his assessment data are defining characteristics
                                and related factors of this diagnosis. Lisa's professor talks with her about the
                                grieving process, and the things that can impact it, such as inadequate social support
                                (Mr. Smith's recent move; lack of connection with his daughter and friends). He quickly
                                considered this nursing diagnosis because he understood the normal grieving process, and
                                identified factors that contribute to a disturbance in this normal pattern. Further, he
                                identified probable etiological (related) factors. Lisa, as a nursing student, did not
                                yet have the conceptual knowledge from which to draw; for her, this diagnosis did not
                                seem obvious.</p>
                            <p>This is the reason why studying concepts underlying diagnoses is so important. We cannot
                                understand an individual's usual human response patterns without drawing on conceptual
                                knowledge throughout the nursing process.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3 id="nursing-process">7.3 The Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p>Without a complete nursing assessment, there can be no patient-centered nursing diagnosis,
                            nor can we identify evidence-based, patient-centered, independent nursing interventions.
                            Assessment should not be conducted to fill in the blank spaces on a form or computer screen.
                            If this form of rote assessment rings a bell for you, it is time to take a new look at the
                            purpose of assessment!</p>

                        <h4>Assessing.</h4>
                        <p>Nurses engage in assessment to come to know the person and his experiences, accurately
                            identify patient concerns, and implement nursing interventions with the purpose of achieving
                            optimal patient care outcomes. As a discipline, nursing has developed knowledge that
                            comprises nursing science. Nursing diagnosis, which is a clinical judgment, is the outcome
                            of a nursing assessment that describes health conditions/life processes, or a susceptibility
                            for that response. That diagnosis then provides the basis for selection of nursing
                            interventions to achieve outcomes for which the nurse has accountability: the focus here is
                            "human response".</p>
                        <p>Assessment of human responses within a nursing assessment framework is a way to identify
                            nurse-focused phenomena of concern and address problems within the scope of professional
                            nursing practice. Human beings are complex and dynamic, and will respond uniquely to the
                            same situation. Human responses are influenced by many factors, including genetics,
                            physiology, health conditions, and experiences with illness/injury. These responses are also
                            influenced by the patient's age, culture, ethnicity, religion/spiritual beliefs, economics,
                            gender, and family experiences.</p>
                        <p>A comprehensive nursing assessment framework provides for a person's unique response to
                            illness, health, or wellness to be shared with others. Nursing diagnoses provide
                            standardized terms to describe human responses, with clear definitions and assessment
                            criteria that represent nursing knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Nurses view assessing as an opportunity to engage with a patient, in a process where data is
                            shared, transformed into information, and organized into meaningful categories of nursing
                            content, also known as nursing diagnoses. Assessing provides an important opportunity for
                            nurses' knowledge and contributions to patient care to be realized.</p>

                        <h5>Nurse-patient relationship.</h5>
                        <p>The relationship between the nurse and patient is core to optimal nursing practice (Roy &
                            Jones, 2007, Watson, Smith, 2019). Within this relationship, the nurse comes to know the
                            individual as a whole person and to view illness as part of health (MacLeod, 2011; Smith,
                            2011, Jones, 2013). Dossey and Keegan (2013, p. 17) describe the relationship between the
                            nurse/patient/family/community as one of "self-awareness, patient experiences of health and
                            illness, and developing and maintaining a caring relationship and effective communication".
                        </p>
                        <p>Nursing knowledge, expertise, skills, and values contribute to establishing trust and
                            connecting with a person in a meaningful way. Within the practice setting, the environment
                            of care enables the nurse to come to know the person through relationship. Being with
                            patients and families requires presence, awareness, careful listening, and observing. These
                            responses help to actualize the professional role of the nurse in delivery of cost
                            effective, high quality, safe, knowledge-driven patient care (Jones, 2013).</p>
                        <p>The engagement of the nurse and patient is a mutual care experience (Newman, 2008). It moves
                            nursing beyond doing (focusing on tasks that help to manage care) to understanding the
                            patient experience holistically, identifying mutual areas of concern, and providing
                            information to assist the person to engage in changes and take actions that can be
                            transforming (Newman, 2008; Jones, 2013).</p>

                        <h5>Intentional authentic presence.</h5>
                        <p>Intentional presence requires a "genuine dialogue, commitment, full engagement and openness,
                            free flowing attentiveness and transcendent oneness" (Smith, 2011). When nurses are present
                            with a person, they are engaged in the moment and consciously aware of their environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>The authentic presence of the nurse in a patient caring experience promotes engagement and
                            enhances relationship (Newman, 2008; Newman, Smith, Pharris and Jones, 2008). The experience
                            can be transformational for both the nurse and the patient. Presence is a matter of
                            consciousness and is reflected in the holistic beings that are both nurse and patient
                            (Chase, 2011).</p>
                        <p>Intentional presence allows the nurse to experience verbal and non-verbal expressions and
                            responses to a situation, in the moment. Exploring patient experiences helps to uncover what
                            is meaningful to the individual, fosters reflection, increases awareness about choices,
                            actions and behaviors that enhance health, and provides insights that can lead to discovery,
                            change, and personal transformation (Jones, 2013, 2006; Newman, 2008; Jones & Flanagan,
                            2007; Doona, Chase & Haggerty, 1999).</p>
                        <p>When the nurse is able to create a safe space, the patient may feel free to disclose his
                            concerns and freely express his fears (Jones, 2013). As the nurse and patient engage in the
                            process of assessing, the patient may experience new awareness and insights (Newman, 2008)
                            and recognize new opportunities for making personal changes in his life, and engage in
                            health promotion actions.</p>
                        <p>According to Willis et al., "meaning is a human's arrived-at understanding of life
                            experiences and their significance that comes from processing those experiences" (2008, p.
                            E34).</p>

                        <h5>Knowing the person.</h5>
                        <p>"Knowing the patient encompasses the complex processes whereby the nurse acquires
                            understanding of a specific patient as a unique individual, which enhances clinical
                            decision-making" (Whittemore, 2000, p. 75). Benner (1984) initially describes nurses' skill
                            in being mindful of the person and his environment, and experiencing an "intuitive" response
                            to assess a situation. Often this is associated with a nurse's clinical expertise. The nurse
                            may describe an experience as, "I don't know what it is, but I just know something is
                            wrong". Some call this intuitive knowing, when the nurse is able to recognize a complex set
                            of clues that draws attention to a potential problem or situation, without necessarily being
                            able to name the response.</p>
                        <p>As nurses gain experience and observe responses in populations over time, they expand their
                            knowledge and process information (cues) more rapidly, as they recognize responses as being
                            usual or problematic. As nurses care for a patient over time, they can become increasingly
                            sensitive to changes in the patient's response pattern. As the nurse engages in assessing,
                            there is an accumulative knowledge about the patient's pattern of responses and she is able
                            to quickly make judgments (Gordon, 1994). It is essential that nurses engage in obtaining
                            adequate assessment data to validate clinical judgments, or nursing diagnoses, in all
                            situations.</p>
                        <p>Nursing assessment and the nurse-patient relationship promote patient satisfaction and
                            enhance nursing visibility in practice. Watson & Smith (2004) discussed the importance of a
                            caring relationship, describing it as the hallmark of the discipline. In a study conducted
                            by Somerville (2009), patients described a feeling of being known by their nurse when they
                            were "recognized as a unique human being, felt safe within the care environment, experienced
                            a connection with the nurse they perceived as meaningful, and felt empowered by the nurse to
                            actively participate in their care" (p.3). Data from this initial qualitative study informed
                            the development of the Patients' Perceptions of Feeling Known by Their Nurse Scale (PPFKNS,
                            Somerville, 2009). The PPFKNS is a valid and reliable, four component scale that can be used
                            to evaluate patients perceptions of "being known" by the nurse.</p>

                        <h5>Nursing Assessment: a holistic process.</h5>
                        <p>"There are multiple approaches that can be used by nurses to understand the person's response
                            to illness and the behaviors they engage in to promote a healthy lifestyle" (Jones, 2013, p.
                            95). Nursing theories (Newman, 2008; Roy, 2007) offer unique approaches to understanding the
                            human experience, and can be used alone or integrated into an assessment framework, such as
                            the Functional Health Pattern (FHP) Assessment (Gordon, 1994). Each theory offers a
                            framework within which data representing the patient's experiences are studied. Organizing
                            patient responses within the FHP framework may be a way to compliment knowledge generated by
                            the theory with knowledge gained from nursing practice. The knowledge gained may help to
                            expand nursing science.</p>

                        <h5>Approaches to assessing and data collection.</h5>
                        <p>Process/dialogue and problem solving are two approaches that can help the nurse come to know
                            the patient's experience. These approaches offer different ways of accessing and analyzing
                            data, and the interventions and outcomes vary in structure and description. They are both
                            designed to understand how life experiences affect living and impact health and well being.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Assessing as a dialogue process.</h5>
                        <p>Assessing, as a process, occurs within the context of a dialogue or discussion. This approach
                            to assessing is inductive and focuses on "the nature of a relationship that is
                            transformative for both nurse and patient" (Newman et al., 2008). Data collection is less
                            systematic, and content evolves through purposeful discussions within the nurse-patient
                            relationship. The nurse may begin the conversation with an open-ended question, such as:
                            "Can you tell me what your day was like for you?"</p>
                        <p>As the nurse is present in the moment and carefully listening, the patient's story unfolds.
                            When needed, the nurse may ask questions to seek additional information to uncover new
                            information or seek clarification. Events and people who are part of the individual's
                            experiences help give meaning to life events and responses. The interaction involves a
                            mutual interaction between the nurse and the patient. Meaningful data discussed within the
                            dialogue helps to inform an unfolding pattern of the whole (Flanagan, 2009; Newman, 2008).
                            Margaret Newman's theoretical framework within Health as Expanding Consciousness (HEC) is an
                            example of a process assessment. The goal of the process/dialogue approach is to "grasp
                            meaning" and come to know the pattern of the whole. Reflection and discussion promotes
                            increasing awareness, reflection, and opportunities for change (Newman, 2008).</p>

                        <h5>Assessing as problem solving.</h5>
                        <p>Problem solving is a deductive reasoning process that involves a systematic approach to data
                            collection. Though some might consider the process linear, others argue that as new data
                            becomes available, clinical judgments are revised and diagnoses are re-evaluated (Gordon,
                            1994). The problem-solving assessment perspective views humans as holistic, bio-psychosocial
                            beings interacting (functioning) within the environment and shaped by age, developmental
                            stage, health status and culture and ethnicity (Jones, 2007).</p>
                        <p>The problem solving approach to assessing incorporates both subjective and objective data to
                            inform the assessment and subsequent problem identification. The naming of the problem
                            (nursing diagnosis) and identification of the probable cause (related factors) direct
                            interventions designed to eliminate or relieve the originating problem and reduce risk. The
                            Functional Health Pattern Assessment is an example of a problem-solving approach to
                            assessment.</p>

                        <h5>Subjective and objective data.</h5>
                        <p>Nurses collect and document two types of data related to the patient experience: subjective
                            and objective data. While physicians value objective over subjective data for medical
                            diagnoses, nurses value both types of data for nursing diagnoses (Gordon, 2008). Nurses
                            collect these subjective data through the assessment process or interview.</p>
                        <p>Subjective data is information obtained from patients' verbal reports about their
                            perceptions, thoughts, and experiences related to their health, daily life, comfort,
                            relationship, and so on. For instance, a patient may report, "I need to manage my health
                            better", or "My partner never talks about anything important with me".</p>
                        <p>Family members/close friends can also provide this type of data, although patient data should
                            be obtained from the person (family, community) whenever possible, because it is the
                            patient's data. Sometimes, however, the patient is unable to provide subjective data, so we
                            must rely on these other sources. For example, a patient with significant dementia who is no
                            longer verbally competent may require family members to provide subjective information,
                            based on their knowledge of the individual's behavior. An example might be an adult child of
                            the patient telling the nurse, "She always likes to listen to soft music when she eats, it
                            seems to calm her".</p>
                        <p>Objective data is information that nurses observe about the patient. These data are sometimes
                            referred to as empirical or measurable evidence. Objective data is obtained through physical
                            examinations and diagnostic test results. Here, "to observe" does not only mean the use of
                            eyesight: it requires the use of all senses and forms of measurement. For example, nurses
                            look at the patient's general appearance, listen to his lung sounds, they may smell foul
                            wound drainage, and feel the skin temperature using touch. Additionally, nurses use various
                            instruments and tools with the patient to collect numerical data (e.g., body weight, blood
                            pressure, oxygen saturation, pain level). To collect reliable and accurate objective data,
                            nurses must have appropriate knowledge and skills to perform physical assessment and to use
                            standardized tools or monitoring devices.</p>

                        <h5>Problem solving and nursing assessment.</h5>
                        <p>To date, nursing lacks a standardized approach to assessment. There are multiple assessment
                            forms created by nurses to collect data but, unlike the review of systems in medicine,
                            nurses use a variety of strategies to obtain patient information. In some settings nurses
                            use a head to toe approach, others use an assessment checklist, while some nurses develop
                            focused assessment forms (e.g., assessment for pain or fall risk).</p>
                        <p>These tools provide data, but often the information is incomplete and focuses on the illness
                            experience by discussing the patient's chief complaint or presenting health concern(s).
                            These approaches also lack a holistic approach to understanding the patient responses to
                            health and illness within the nurse patient relationship. Within a problem-solving approach
                            to assessment, Gordon's eleven Functional Health Patterns (Gordon, 1994) offer a
                            nurse-driven, organized approach to understanding the person's response to illness and
                            health promotion.</p>

                        <h5>Functional Health Pattern Assessment Framework.</h5>
                        <p>Gordon (1994) notes that a structured assessment helps the nurse to focus, organize, and
                            synthesize subjective and objective clinical data. The Functional Health Pattern (FHP)
                            assessment provides nurses with a standardized, holistic approach to care that is useful for
                            the collection of subjective and objective data across clinical settings, cultures,
                            populations, ages, and health conditions. Data is collected within a nursing framework and
                            used by the nurse within the nurse-patient care experience to develop patient problems
                            (tentative hypotheses), test and validate clinical judgments/nursing diagnoses. The goal of
                            assessment is to determine an individual's perception of optimal functional health, as
                            determined by assessing the eleven FHPs (Gordon, 2008, 1994).</p>
                        <p>The FHP assessment describes client strengths and functions, lifestyle management, and
                            overall health status for each pattern. Table 7.1 shows the FHP and some potential questions
                            that could be explored at each pattern. Phenomena of concern identified by the nurse help to
                            guide care and increase the visibility of nursing's contribution to patient outcomes.</p>
                        <p>During the assessment, data obtained within each pattern create a story that incorporates
                            information about the patient's health, including her response to acute and chronic
                            illnesses. When nurses engage the individual in a FHP assessment, they use purposeful
                            questioning and branching (or expanded questions) to obtain an unfolding picture of
                            functional health. As data are collected and considered, the information obtained provides
                            an individual's perceptions of function, along with objective (measurable) data about her
                            health. When the assessment is completed, information from all eleven patterns is then
                            synthesized by the nurse, and risks, problems and strengths are identified (Jones, 2013).
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, it is essential to assess all eleven health patterns before making a clinical
                            judgment about the information under analysis. Table 7.1 can be used to capture critical
                            data about the person's usual responses, as well as changes within patterns. In addition, it
                            is important to remember that all assessment data within each pattern are open to revision.
                            When data change, a re-synthesis of data and a reevaluation of the original nursing
                            diagnoses identified is required.</p>

                        <h5>Types of assessment formats within FHP.</h5>
                        <p>There are several types of data collection formats within in the FHP assessment framework.
                            These include partial, screening, and in-depth assessments. A partial assessment refers to
                            data collected within several patterns at a given point in time. For example, the nurse may
                            collect data about the nutritional metabolic pattern or activity/ exercise for a patient
                            with obesity. Again, while assessment data about a pattern are collected, it is critical the
                            no clinical judgment be finalized until data from all eleven patterns is obtained.</p>
                        <p>A screening assessment may be similar to a partial assessment, but could also contain limited
                            information from all eleven functional patterns. A data collection form might require
                            inclusion of vital signs, for example. The nurse obtains and inputs those data into the
                            assessment form. The form requires that information is collected about the patient's various
                            physiologic systems, and the nurse completes all the blank spaces on the form that deal with
                            this system (heart rhythm, presence of a murmur, pedal pulses, lung sounds, bowel sounds,
                            etc.), along with basic psychosocial and spiritual data. Until a more complete database
                            involving the patient's story is included in the assessment, information needed to confirm
                            the nursing diagnosis may not be sufficient (Jones & Lunney et al., 2011; Lunney, 2009).</p>
                        <p>A full assessment involves complete evaluation of all health patterns. The process usually
                            takes between 30 minutes to an hour to complete. The nurse generates a series of initial
                            questions, and then follow up questions, to explore patient perceptions of each pattern
                            (Herdman & Kamitsuru, 2018; Gordon, 2004, 1994; Jones & Lepley, 1986). A complete assessment
                            of all eleven health patterns can help the nurse determine if there are other human
                            responses occurring that are of concern, indicate risks, or that suggest health promotion
                            opportunities. A full assessment is critical to data synthesis, identification of a nursing
                            diagnosis, and identification of the etiology or precipitating factors of these areas of
                            concern that can guide interventions, and promote achievement of the desired outcome for the
                            patient.</p>

                        <h5>Instruments used to measure FHPs.</h5>
                        <p>A recent integrative literature review aimed to identify essential patient data used by
                            nurses in research, education, and clinical practice, in order to update a standardized
                            comprehensive nursing assessment screening tool. Taking into account the huge number of
                            publications addressing different assessment tools, the search was narrowed to the tools
                            based on the FHP, or on minimum data set (MDS) elements. This search strategy recalled 384
                            manuscripts in three databases, among which 14 were included in the final sample. Of these,
                            11 validated items or tools for nursing assessment were identified.</p>

                            condition, problems (nursing assessment and diagnosis, risk assessment), nursing outcomes,
                            nursing interventions, nursing intensity, and healthcare institutional data should be
                            elements of the Austrian nursing MDS. Shimanouchi, Uchida, Kamei, Sasaki and Shinoda (2001)
                            found that the refinement of the assessment form for home care, which included information
                            on the family, caregiver, living situation, and nursing care significantly shortened
                            documentation time and helped with the identification of client's needs.</p>
                        <p>Three tools used the FHP framework to assess patients with head and neck cancer and older
                            adults, and to use in clinical and teaching settings. All tools had some modification of the
                            FHPs, either with additions, removals, changing names, or combining of two FHP together.
                            Beyea & Matzo (1989) and Fernández-Sola, Granero-Molina, Mollinedo-Mallea, Gonzales,
                            Aguilera-Manrique & Ponce (2012) did not integrate physical assessment in the FHP
                            assessment, so they added a physical examination section to their tools. In the tool
                            developed by Rodrigues, Cunha, Aquino, Rocha, Mendes, Firmeza, et al. (2018)
                            Activity/Exercise and Sleep/Rest were integrated into one pattern, called Activity/Rest, a
                            Safety/protection section was added, and another FHP was renamed.</p>
                        <p>Standardized tools developed within Gordon's FHPs are available in the literature (Rodriquez,
                            Cunha, et al., 2018, Zega, D'Agostino, 2014, Jones, Barrett, et al., 1997). In particular,
                            the Functional Health Pattern Assessment Screening Tool (FHPAST) is a comprehensive,
                            reliable, and valid tool aimed at screening patients' FHP (Jones & Foster, 1999).</p>

                        <h5>The Functional Health Pattern Assessment Screening Tool (FHPAST).</h5>
                        <p>Screening assessment tools are often used in response to challenges with time and patient
                            availability (Jones, 2013). Each item is presented in declarative sentence, based on the FHP
                            definitions and relevant literature. The original tool has been adapted over the years,
                            based on additional research, which resulted in the current tool having 57 items which are
                            representative of the 11 FHPs (Jones, Foster, Flanagan & Duffy, 2012; Beyea & Matzo,1989).
                            Current revisions are underway.</p>
                        <p>The FHPAST is useful in clinical practice to map health problems or risks and inform
                            patients' responses to illness, or changes in health status over time. Additionally, it
                            provides clinicians and researchers with information on patients' readiness for health,
                            describes responsiveness to nursing interventions, and provides data on patient outcomes
                            (Jones, Foster, Flanagan & Duffy, 2012).</p>
                        <p>Responses to the screening questions are completed by the patient, or by someone designated
                            by the patient (e.g., family member or a nurse). In practice, the nurse can review data from
                            the FHPAST prior to seeing the patient, isolate patient problems or risks, and seek
                            additional information and conduct pattern exploration during a more complete assessment.
                            The FHPAST can serve as a guide for nursing assessment, as it allows the nurse to respond to
                            patient concerns quickly, and provides information about his changing health status, or
                            helps to identify risks of strengths.</p>

                        <h5>Translation and the FHPAST.</h5>
                        <p>Over the years, the FHPAST has been translated into many languages. To enable clinicians and
                            researchers to use the FHPAST in other cultures, the translation, cultural adaptation, and
                            validation in a sample representative of that culture is required. For example, Barros,
                            Michel, & Nobrega (2003) validated the 58-item version of the FHPAST in Brazil. Although the
                            tool that was translated into Portuguese had excellent reliability, the authors mentioned
                            that further language adaptation was needed in order for the FHPAST to be sensitive to the
                            Brazilian culture. A more recent tool is under review and has been revised for further
                            validation of the FHPAST-revised Brazilian version (FHPAST-VBR).</p>

                        <p>In the previous chapter, we discussed objective and subjective data collection. Once the
                            nurse has collected data and transformed it into information, the next step is to begin to
                            answer the question: what are my patient's human responses? This requires the substantive
                            knowledge of a variety of theories and models from nursing, as well as several related
                            disciplines. And, as previously noted, it requires knowledge about the concepts that
                            underlie the nursing diagnoses themselves.</p>
                        <p>In other words, assessment techniques are meaningless if we do not know how to use the data
                            we collect! Figure 8.1 provides an example of how objective and subjective data can be
                            converted to information through the application of nursing knowledge for a case study of
                            Mrs. H, a 36-year-old woman with an HbA1c of 9.0% and an exudative ulcer on the medial
                            malleolar region. If the nurse who assessed Mrs. H did not know the normal blood glucose
                            level, he would not have been able to interpret that patient's HbA1c as being abnormal. If
                            he did not understand theories related to tissue integrity, pain, and blood glucose level
                            management, then he might not identify other susceptibilities or problem responses exhibited
                            by this woman.</p>

                        <h3 id="identifying-potential-diagnoses">8.2 Identifying Potential Nursing Diagnoses (Diagnostic
                            Hypotheses)</h3>
                        <p>At this point in the decision-making, or problem-solving process, the nurse looks at the
                            information that is coming together to form a pattern; it provides him with a way of seeing
                            what human responses the patient may be experiencing. Initially, the nurse considers all
                            potential diagnoses that may come to mind. In the expert nurse, this can happen in seconds -
                            for novice or student nurses, it may take support from more expert nurses or faculty members
                            to guide their thinking.</p>
                        <p>Seeing patterns in the data requires an understanding of the concept that supports each
                            diagnosis. For example, you might find yourself providing care to Mr. K, who has been
                            hospitalized for 14 days due to an infected ankle ulcer, which became septic. Mr. K used to
                            live with his daughter and primary caregiver, Janine, his son-in-law, Don, and his two
                            grandchildren (ages 3 and 6).</p>
                        <p>Janine and Don had agreed to separate two months before. While handling divorce arrangements,
                            Janine started looking for a job and interviewing candidates to serve as caregivers to Mr.
                            K, when his ankle wound infected and he had to be taken to the hospital with respiratory
                            discomfort.</p>
                        <p>Mr. K is expected to be discharged the following week. During the visiting hours, Janine is
                            clearly tired, and admits she has not been able to get much sleep because she has not been
                            able to find a job yet and she does not want to place Mr. K in a nursing home, but she is
                            afraid that she will not be able to afford a caregiver.</p>
                        <p>Throughout your conversation with Janine, you observe that she seems frustrated and nervous,
                            and she frequently refers to not being sure if she has been doing the right thing for Mr. K
                            and her children. She is sure that her lack of care during the divorce process caused his
                            father to have the infection. She is clearly very concerned about her father, but also
                            mentions that her younger daughter had almost been run over by a car the day before, because
                            she dozed off while watching her play and nearly missed her running towards the traffic.</p>
                        <p>What does all of this tell you? Unless you have a good understanding of family dynamics,
                            stress, coping, role strain and grief theories, it may not tell you very much at all! You
                            may know that Mr. K has a severe infection. But would you know to also focus on the family,
                            and look for a cause (related factors) or other data (defining characteristics) to determine
                            an accurate diagnosis for Janine?</p>
                        <p>Although you might be assigned to Mr. K, if you aren't attentive to what is happening in the
                            family, are you truly attending to Mr. K's needs? Such a situation can lead to the nurse
                            simply focusing on the patient of record, rather than considering the family and its impact
                            on patient outcomes. Or, if the nurse did realize the need to address what is happening with
                            Janine, but did not have good baseline knowledge of the previously noted theories, she might
                            simply "pick a diagnosis" from a list to describe his response. Conceptual knowledge of each
                            nursing diagnosis allows the nurse to assign accurate meanings to the data collected from
                            the patient, and prepares her to perform the in-depth assessment.</p>
                        <p>When you have this type of conceptual knowledge, you will begin to look at the data you
                            collect in a different way. You will turn that data into information, and begin to observe
                            how that information starts to group together to form patterns, or to "paint a picture" of
                            what might be happening with your patient. Take another look at Fig. 8.1. With conceptual
                            nursing knowledge of blood glucose level, tissue integrity, pain theories and pain
                            management, you might begin to see the information as possible tentative nursing diagnoses,
                            such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Risk for unstable blood glucose level (00179)</li>
                            <li>Impaired tissue integrity (00044)</li>
                            <li>Acute pain (00132)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is not enough, however, to merely "select/choose/pick" a diagnosis label. Unfortunately,
                            this step is often where nurses stop - they develop a list of diagnoses, and either launch
                            directly into action (determining interventions) or they simply "pick" one of the nursing
                            diagnoses that sounds most appropriate for a patient's medical condition, based on what they
                            think the nursing diagnosis label represents, and then move on to selecting interventions
                            for those diagnoses. Others may determine that they wish to obtain a certain outcome, and
                            simply aim interventions at that outcome. These are not appropriate methods for diagnosing,
                            and can lead to poor patient outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Determining a nursing diagnosis requires synthesizing all of the information available to
                            determine what the real problem might be, based on objective and subjective data (defining
                            characteristics), and what you think may be causing the response (related factors), in order
                            to plan the best interventions and achieve the desired outcome. Unless we know the problem
                            and its cause (etiology), the interventions selected may be completely inappropriate for
                            this particular patient. For diagnoses to be accurate, they must be validated - and that
                            requires additional, in-depth assessment based upon data unique to each patient to confirm
                            or to refute, or "rule out", the possibility of a diagnosis. Only when we use nursing
                            knowledge, and reflect on the patient's manifestation of his response to the health/illness
                            experience, can a nursing diagnosis be generated: this is the essence of diagnosing the
                            response of an individual, caregiver, group, or community.</p>

                        <h3 id="refining-diagnosis">8.3 Refining the Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>As you review information from your assessment it is important to determine if the responses
                            (probabilities) are normal responses, abnormal (or unusual responses), represent a risk
                            (susceptibility) or a strength. Those items that are not considered normal, or were seen as
                            a susceptibility, should be considered in relation to a problem-focused or risk diagnosis.
                            Areas in which the patient indicates a desire to improve something (for example, to enhance
                            nutrition) should be considered as a potential health promotion diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>If some data are interpreted as abnormal, further in-depth assessment is crucial to
                            accurately diagnose the patient. It is important to remember that if one simply collects
                            data to complete a required form, without considering the importance of the data, this can
                            lead to critical data being overlooked. Take another look at Fig. 8.1 which related to our
                            first case in this chapter: Mrs. H. The nurse could have stopped his assessment here, and
                            simply moved on to the diagnoses of risk for unstable blood glucose level, impaired tissue
                            integrity, acute pain. He could have administered analgesics, applied a dressing, provided
                            education about how to administer insulin correctly, how to apply dressings, and how to take
                            the analgesics at home, for example. However, while all those things might be appropriate,
                            he would have neglected to identify some major issues which are probably significant and
                            which, if not addressed, will lead to continued issues with Mrs. H's status.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. H's nurse, however, understood the need for an in-depth assessment and was therefore
                            able to identify her recent remarriage, potential areas of concern in her family processes,
                            relationships, and personal identity (Fig. 8.2). He learned that Mrs. H had problems
                            consistent with a stressful new life situation (recent remarriage, moving to her husband's
                            house, family conflicts, change in exercise pattern, forgetting to take her insulin, arguing
                            at work). However, he also identified that Mrs. H had an important strength in the support
                            she received from her mother, and her verbalized desire to improve the way she was
                            responding to this situation: these are all very important things to build into any plan of
                            care! So, with this additional in-depth assessment, the nurse could now revise his potential
                            diagnoses:</p>

                        <h3 id="confirming-refuting-diagnoses">8.4 Confirming/Refuting Potential Nursing Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>Whenever new data is collected, and processed into information, it is time to reconsider our
                            diagnostic hypotheses. During this period, there are three primary things to consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Did the in-depth assessment provide new data that would rule out or eliminate one or
                                more of your potential diagnoses?</li>
                            <li>Did the in-depth assessment point toward new diagnoses that you had not previously
                                considered?</li>
                            <li>How can you differentiate between similar diagnoses?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is essential that other nurses continue to validate the diagnosis, and to understand how
                            you arrived at your diagnosis. It is for this reason that it is important to use
                            standardized terms, such as the NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, which provide not only a label
                            (e.g., dysfunctional family processes, Code 00063), but also a definition and assessment
                            criteria (defining characteristics and related factors, or risk factors) so that other
                            nursing professionals can continue to validate - or perhaps refute - the diagnosis as new
                            data become available for the patient.</p>
                        <p>The nurse might create a term, such as ineffective family communication, to address the
                            issues he identified when listening to Mrs. H talk about her communication with her new
                            husband, and how her children and he relate to each other. But what does this diagnosis
                            mean? How is it defined, and how would other nurses be able to recognize the diagnosis when
                            they completed their assessments? Terms that are simply constructed by nurses at the
                            bedside, without validated definitions and, most importantly, assessment criteria, have no
                            consistent meaning and cannot be clinically validated or confirmed. When a NANDA-I nursing
                            diagnosis does not exist that fits a pattern you identify in a patient, it is safer to
                            describe the condition in detail rather than to "make up" a term that will have different
                            meanings to different nurses. If you asked ten nurses to define the "created" diagnosis of
                            ineffective family communication, and to identify defining characteristics and related
                            factors, it is quite possible you would have ten different definitions, and a laundry list
                            of potential diagnostic indicators. This is neither helpful nor safe when we are considering
                            the health and well-being of the patients for whom we provide care.</p>

                        <h3 id="eliminating-diagnoses">8.5 Eliminating Possible Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>One of the goals of in-depth assessment is to eliminate, or "rule out", one or more of the
                            potential diagnoses you were considering. You do this by synthesizing the information you
                            have obtained, and comparing it to what you know about the diagnoses. It is critical that
                            the assessment data support each diagnosis. Diagnoses that are not well supported through
                            the assessment criteria provided by NANDA-I (defining characteristics, related/risk factors)
                            and/or that are not supported by etiological factors (causes or contributors to the
                            diagnoses) are not appropriate for a patient. It is important to remember that nurses must
                            be able to independently address related (or risk) factors. In other words, medical
                            diagnoses or physician-ordered treatments are not related (or risk) factors, although they
                            may be associated conditions. If the nurse cannot independently resolve or diminish the
                            effect of an etiological factor, then it is not a related (or risk) factor.</p>
                        <p>As we look at Fig. 8.2 and consider the potential diagnoses that Mrs. H's nurse identified,
                            we can begin to eliminate some of these as valid diagnoses. Sometimes it is helpful to do a
                            side-to-side comparison of the diagnoses, focusing on those defining characteristics and
                            related factors that were identified throughout the assessment and patient history. An
                            example of a comparison of diagnoses within one domain is provided in (Table 8.1).</p>

                        <p>For example, Mrs. H's nurse quickly eliminates from consideration the diagnoses, relocation
                            stress syndrome and impaired memory. Although Mrs. H does indicate she feels tense all the
                            time, the nurse considers that this is more related to her personal identity, family
                            processes, and relationship, than to a disturbance following the move from one environment
                            to another, or a persistent inability to remember something.</p>

                        <h3 id="new-diagnoses-potential">8.6 Potential New Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>It is very possible, such as in the case of Mrs. H (Fig. 8.2) that new data will lead to new
                            information, and in turn, to new diagnoses. The same questions that you used to eliminate
                            potential diagnoses should be used as you consider these diagnoses.</p>

                        <h3 id="differentiating-diagnoses">8.7 Differentiating Similar Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>It is helpful to narrow down your potential diagnoses by considering those that are very
                            similar, but that have a distinctive feature which makes one more relevant to the patient
                            than the other. Let's take another look at our patient, Mrs. H. After the in-depth
                            assessment, the nurse had 11 potential diagnoses; two diagnoses were eliminated, leaving 9
                            potential diagnoses. One way to start the process of differentiation is to look at where the
                            diagnoses are located within the NANDA-I taxonomy. This gives you a clue about how the
                            diagnoses are grouped together into the broad area of nursing knowledge (domain) and the
                            subcategories, or group of diagnoses with similar attributes (class).</p>
                        <p>After eliminating two diagnoses, her nurse is considering: three diagnoses in the role
                            relationship domain (dysfunctional family processes, ineffective relationship and
                            interrupted family processes), two diagnoses in the coping/stress tolerance domain
                            (ineffective coping and readiness for enhanced resilience); one in the nutrition domain
                            (risk for unstable blood glucose level), one in the self-perception domain (disturbed
                            personal identity), and one in the safety/ protection domain (impaired tissue integrity),
                            and one in the comfort domain (acute pain). The nurse realizes that dysfunctional family
                            processes, ineffective relationship, interrupted family processes, and disturbed personal
                            identity cluster into disturbed family identity syndrome (00283).</p>
                        <p>When reviewing patient information in light of similar nursing diagnoses, consider the
                            following questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do the diagnoses share a similar focus, or is it different?</li>
                            <li>If the diagnoses share a similar focus, is one more focused/specific than the other?
                            </li>
                            <li>Does one diagnosis potentially lead to another that I have identified? That is, could it
                                be the causative factor of that other diagnosis?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As the nurse considers what he knows about Mrs. H, he can look at the responses he identified
                            as potential diagnoses in light of these questions. Mrs. H clearly has a diabetes-related
                            injury (impaired tissue integrity), it appears that her susceptibility for a variation in
                            serum levels of glucose from the normal range (risk for unstable blood glucose level) is
                            actually a consequence of her excessive stress due to disturbed family identity syndrome.
                            Therefore, although the nurse is concerned about her pain and will need to treat her injury,
                            he believes he can best address these issues for the long-term by addressing her disturbed
                            family identity syndrome, which he believes is the underlying causes of her current health
                            status.</p>
                        <p>After talking with Mrs. H, it appears that using the health promotion diagnosis, readiness
                            for enhanced resilience, will best support her in setting goals around her blood glucose
                            level management and family identity, while reinforcing her ability to regain control over
                            her life and improving her resilience.</p>
                        <p>The nurse recognizes that she has verbalized a desire to improve her resilience, and feels
                            that working with her on this issue from a health promotion perspective (readiness for
                            enhanced resilience) could be more positive for her. This, coupled with the previously
                            mentioned belief that goal setting could be used within this diagnosis to address risk for
                            unstable blood glucose level, makes this diagnosis more appropriate for Mrs. H. He feels it
                            is imperative to acknowledge her family identity, and to work with her on this response.</p>
                        <p>Finally, it is important to manage the acute pain that Mrs. H is experiencing. Because one of
                            the goals is to get her more active to improve blood glucose levels, and to assist with
                            overall wellbeing, it is important to increase her comfort so that her pain does not
                            prohibit her from increasing her level of activity.</p>

                        <p>Remember that the nursing process, which includes continuous re-evaluation of the diagnosis,
                            is an ongoing process. This means that as more data becomes available, or as the patient's
                            condition changes, the diagnoses may also change - or the prioritization may change. Think
                            back for a moment to the initial screening assessment the nurse performed on Mrs. H. Do you
                            see that, without further follow up, he would have missed the very important diagnosis of
                            disturbed family identity syndrome, along with the health promotion opportunity for Mrs. E
                            (readiness for enhanced resilience), and he might have designed a plan to address issues
                            that would not have resolved her underlying issues?</p>
                        <p>Can you see why the idea of just "picking" a nursing diagnosis to go along with the medical
                            diagnosis simply isn't the way to go? The in-depth, ongoing assessment provided so much more
                            information about Mrs. H, that can be used to determine not only the appropriate diagnoses,
                            but realistic outcomes and interventions that will best meet her individual needs.</p>

                        <h3 id="summary-8">8.9 Summary</h3>
                        <p>Assessment is a critical role of professional nurses, and requires disciplinary knowledge of
                            nursing theories, concepts, and foci of concern to the discipline upon on which nursing
                            diagnoses are developed. Collecting data only for the sake of completing some mandatory form
                            or computer screen is a waste of time, and it certainly does not support individualized care
                            for our patients. Establishing an effective nurse-patient relationship enables the nurse to
                            come to know the person and his/her experiences with health and illness. Having an organized
                            approach to a nursing assessment, such as Gordon's Functional Health Pattern assessment,
                            provides the nurse with an assessment framework that can guide data collection to
                            appropriately diagnose, and to identify causative factors which will be responsive to
                            nursing interventions and evidence-driven outcomes. Developing, refining, and prioritizing
                            nursing diagnoses based upon data analysis and synthesis, is the hallmark of professional
                            nursing.</p>
                        <p>Assessing, followed by synthesizing of data, is essential for diagnosing. Selecting nursing
                            diagnoses without assessment can result in inaccurate diagnoses, inappropriate outcomes, and
                            ineffective and/or unnecessary interventions for diagnoses that are not relevant to the
                            patient - and may lead to completely missing the most important clinical judgment about your
                            patient!</p>

                        <h3 id="intro-taxonomy">9.1 Introduction to Taxonomy</h3>
                        <p>NANDA International, Inc. provides a standardized terminology of nursing diagnoses, and it
                            presents its diagnoses in a classifications scheme, more specifically a taxonomy. It is
                            important to understand a little bit about a taxonomy, and how taxonomy differs from
                            terminology. So, let us take a moment to talk about what taxonomy actually represents.</p>
                        <p>A terminology is the body of terms used with a particular technical application in a subject
                            of study, profession, etc. (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).</p>
                        <p>With regard to nursing, the NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology includes the defined terms
                            (labels) that are used to describe clinical judgments made by professional nurses: the
                            diagnoses themselves. A definition of the NANDA-I taxonomy might be "a systematic ordering
                            of phenomena/clinical judgments that define the knowledge of the nursing discipline". More
                            simply put, the NANDA -I taxonomy of nursing diagnoses is a classification schema to help us
                            organize the concepts of concern (nursing judgments or nursing diagnoses) for nursing
                            practice. A classification is the arrangement of related phenomena in taxonomic groups
                            according to their observed similarities; a category into which something is put (English
                            Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).</p>
                        <p>A taxonomy is the branch of science concerned with classification, especially of organisms;
                            systematics (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020). A taxonomy can be compared to a
                            filing cabinet - in a drawer (domain) you may file all information you have related to your
                            bills/debts. Within that drawer, you may have individual file folders (classes) for
                            different types of bills/debt: household, automobile, health care, child care, animal care,
                            etc. Within each file folder (class), you would then have individual bills representing each
                            type of debt (nursing diagnoses). The current biological taxonomy originated with Carl
                            Linnaeus in 1735. He originally identified three kingdoms (animal, plant, and mineral),
                            which were then divided into classes, orders, families, genera, and species (Quammen 2007).
                            You probably learned about the revised biological taxonomy in a basic science class in your
                            high school or university setting.</p>
                        <p>Terminology, on the other hand, is the language that is used to describe a specific thing; it
                            is the language used in a particular discipline to describe its knowledge. Therefore, the
                            nursing diagnoses form a discipline-specific language, so when we want to talk about the
                            diagnoses themselves, we are talking about the terminology of nursing knowledge. When we
                            want to talk about the way that we structure or categorize the NANDA-I diagnoses, then we
                            are talking about the taxonomy.</p>
                        <p>Classification systems in health care denote disciplinary knowledge and demonstrate how a
                            specific group of professionals perceive what are the significant areas of knowledge of the
                            discipline. Therefore, a classification system in health care has multiple functions,
                            including to</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>provide a view of the knowledge and practice area of a specific profession.</li>
                            <li>organize phenomena in a way that refers to changes in health, processes, and mechanisms
                                that are of concern to the professional.</li>
                            <li>show the logical connection between factors that can be controlled or manipulated by
                                professionals in the discipline (von Krogh 2011).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let us think about taxonomy as it relates to something we all deal with in our daily lives.
                            When you need to buy food, you go to the grocery store. Suppose that there is a new store in
                            your neighborhood, Classified Groceries, Inc., so you decide to go there to do your
                            shopping. When you enter the store, you notice that the layout seems very different from
                            your regular store, but the person greeting you at the door hands you a diagram to help you
                            learn your way around (Fig. 9.1).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_26_0fd2cb78757565eb0be7g-142-1.jpg"
                                alt="A diagram representing the layout of a grocery store, with aisles labeled as domains (e.g., proteins, grains) and shelves as classes (e.g., meat, fish)."
                                class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Fig. 9.1 Domains and classes of Classified Groceries, Inc.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>You can see that this store has organized the grocery items into eight main categories or
                            grocery store aisles: proteins, grain products, vegetables, fruits, processed foods, snack
                            foods, deli foods, and beverages. These categories/aisles could also be called "domains" -
                            they are broad levels of classification that divide phenomena into main groups. In this
                            case, the phenomena represent "groceries".</p>
                        <p>You may also have noticed that the diagram does not just show the eight aisles; each aisle
                            has a few key phrases identified that further help us to understand what types of foods
                            would be found in each aisle. For example, in the aisle (domain) entitled "Beverages", we
                            see six subcategories: "Coffee", "Tea", "Soda", "Water", "Beer/hard cider", and "Wine/sake".
                            Another way of saying this would be that these subcategories are "Classes" of products that
                            are found under the "Domain" of beverages.</p>
                        <p>One of the rules people try to follow when they develop a taxonomy is that the classes should
                            be mutually exclusive - in other words, one type of grocery product should not be found in
                            multiple classes. This is not always possible, but this should still be the goal, because it
                            makes it much clearer for people who want to use the structure. If you find cheddar cheese
                            in the protein aisle, but find cheddar cheese spread in the snack foods aisle, it makes it
                            hard for people to understand the classification system that is being used.</p>
                        <p>Looking back at our store diagram, there is additional information to be added (Fig. 9.2).
                            Each of the grocery aisles is further explained, providing a more detailed level of
                            information about the groceries that are found in the various aisles. As an example, Fig.
                            9.2 shows the detailed information provided on the "Beverages" aisle. You will note the six
                            "classes" along with additional detail for each of those classes. These represent various
                            types (or concepts) of beverage products, all of which share similar properties that cluster
                            them together into one group.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Given the information with which we have been provided, we could easily manage our shopping
                            list. If we wanted to find some herbal soda, we would quickly be able to find the aisle
                            marked "Beverages", the shelf marked "Sodas", and we could confirm that herbal sodas would
                            be found there. Likewise, if we wanted some loose leaf green tea, we would again look at the
                            aisle marked "Beverages", find the shelf marked "Tea", and then we would find "Green loose
                            leaf teas".</p>
                        <p>The purpose of this grocery taxonomy is to help the shopper quickly determine what section of
                            the store contains the grocery supplies that he/she wants to buy. Without this information,
                            the shopper would have to walk up and down each aisle and try to make sense of what products
                            were in which aisle; depending on the size of the store, this could be a very frustrating
                            and confusing experience! Thus, the diagram being provided by the store personnel provides a
                            "concept map", or a guide for shoppers to quickly understand how the groceries have been
                            classified into locations within the store, with the goal of improving the shopping
                            experience.</p>
                        <p>By now, you are probably getting a good idea of the difficulty of developing a taxonomy that
                            reflects the concepts it is trying to classify in a clear, concise, and consistent manner.
                            Thinking about our grocery store example, can you imagine different ways that items in the
                            store could be grouped together?</p>
                        <p>This example of a grocery taxonomy may not meet the goal of avoiding overlap between concepts
                            and classes in a way that is logical for all shoppers. For example, tomato juice is found in
                            the domain Vegetables (vegetable juices), but not in the domain Beverages. Although one
                            group of individuals might find this categorization logical and clear, others might suggest
                            that all beverages should be together. What is important is that the distinction between the
                            domains is well-defined, i.e., all vegetables and vegetable products are found within the
                            vegetable domain, whereas the beverage domain contains beverages that are not
                            vegetable-based. The problem with this distinction might be that we could then argue that
                            wine and hard cider should be in the fruit aisle, and beer and sake should be in the grain
                            aisle!</p>
                        <p>Taxonomies are works in progress - they continue to grow, evolve, and even dramatically
                            change as more knowledge is developed about the area of study. There is often significant
                            debate about what structure is best for categorizing phenomena of concern to different
                            disciplines. There are many ways of categorizing things, and truly, there is no "absolutely
                            right" way. The goal is to find a logical, consistent way to categorize similar things while
                            avoiding overlap between the concepts and the classes. For users of taxonomies, the goal is
                            to understand how it classifies similar concepts into its domains and classes to quickly
                            identify specific concepts as needed.</p>

                        <h3 id="organizing-knowledge">9.2 Organizing Nursing Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>Professions organize their formal knowledge into consistent, logical, conceptualized
                            dimensions so that it reflects the professional domain and makes it relevant for clinical
                            practice. For professionals in health care, the knowledge of diagnosis is a significant part
                            of professional knowledge and is essential for clinical practice. Knowledge of nursing
                            diagnoses must therefore be organized in a way that legitimizes professional nursing
                            practice and consolidates the nursing profession's jurisdiction (Abbott 1988).</p>
                        <p>Within the NANDA-I nursing diagnostic taxonomy, we use a hierarchical graphic to show our
                            domains and classes (Fig. 9.3). The diagnoses themselves are not depicted in this graphic,
                            although they could be. The primary reason we do not include the diagnoses is that there are
                            267 of them, and that would make the graphic very large - and very hard to read!</p>
                        <p>In nursing, it is most important that the diagnoses are classified in a way that makes sense
                            clinically, so that when a nurse is trying to identify a diagnosis that he/she may not see
                            very often in practice, he/she can logically use the taxonomy to find the appropriate
                            information on possible related diagnoses. Although the NANDA-I Taxonomy II (Fig. 9.3) is
                            not intended to function as a nursing assessment framework, it does provide structure for
                            classifying nursing diagnoses into domains and classes, each of which is clearly defined.
                        </p>
                        <p>To provide an example of what it would look like if we included the nursing diagnoses in the
                            graphic representation of the taxonomy, Fig. 9.4 shows only one domain with its classes and
                            nursing diagnoses. As you can see, this is a lot of information to depict in graphic form.

                        <h3 id="using-taxonomy">9.3 Using NANDA-I Taxonomy</h3>
                        <p>Although the taxonomy provides a way of categorizing nursing phenomena, it can also serve
                            other functions. It can help faculty to develop a nursing curriculum, for example, and it
                            can help a nurse identify a diagnosis, perhaps one that he/she may not use frequently, but
                            that he/she needs for a specific patient. Let us look at both situations.</p>

                        <h4 id="structuring-curricula">9.3.1 Structuring Nursing Curricula</h4>
                        <p>Although the NANDA-I nursing taxonomy is not intended to be a nursing assessment framework,
                            it can support the organization of undergraduate education. For example, curricula can be
                            developed around the domains and classes, allowing courses to be taught that are based on
                            the core concepts of nursing practice, and which are categorized in each of the NANDA-I
                            domains.</p>
                        <p>A course might be built around the Role relationship domain (Fig. 9.4) with units based on
                            each of the classes. In Unit 1, the focus could be on caregiving roles, and the concept of
                            parenting would be explored in depth. What is it? How does it impact individual and family
                            health? What are some of the common parenting problems that our patients encounter? In what
                            types of patients might we be most likely to identify these conditions? What are the primary
                            etiologies? What are the consequences if these conditions go undiagnosed and/or untreated?
                            How can we prevent, treat, and/or improve these conditions? How can we manage the symptoms?
                        </p>
                        <p>Building a nursing curriculum around these key concepts of nursing knowledge enables students
                            to truly understand and build expertise in the knowledge of nursing science, while also
                            learning about and understanding related medical diagnoses and conditions which they will
                            encounter in everyday practice.</p>
                        <p>Designing nursing courses in this way enables students to learn a lot about the disciplinary
                            knowledge of nursing. Attachment, family processes, relationship, role conflict, role
                            performance, and social interaction are some of the key concepts of Domain 7, Role
                            relationship (Fig. 9.4) - they are the "neutral states" that we must understand before we
                            can identify potential or actual problems with these responses.</p>
                        <p>Understanding role performance, for example, as a core concept of nursing practice, requires
                            a strong understanding of anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology (including related medical
                            diagnoses), and responses from other domains that might coincide with problems in balanced
                            nutrition. Once you truly understand the concept of balanced nutrition (the "normal" or
                            neutral state), identifying the abnormal state is much easier because you know what you
                            should be seeing if role performance were effective, and if you don't see those data, you
                            start to suspect that there might be a problem (or a risk may exist for a problem to
                            develop). So, developing nursing courses around these core concepts enables nursing faculty
                            to focus on the knowledge of the nursing discipline and then to incorporate related medical
                            diagnoses and/or interdisciplinary concerns in a way that allows nurses to focus first on
                            nursing phenomena and then to bring their specific knowledge to an interdisciplinary view of
                            the patient to improve patient care. This then moves into content on realistic patient
                            outcomes and evidence-based interventions that nurses will utilize (dependent and
                            independent nursing interventions) to provide the best possible care for the patient to
                            achieve outcomes for which nurses have accountability.</p>

                        <h4 id="identifying-diagnoses">9.3.2 Identifying Nursing Diagnoses Outside Area of Expertise
                        </h4>
                        <p>Nurses gain expertise in those nursing diagnoses that they most commonly see in their
                            clinical practice. If your area of interest is reproductive health nursing practice, then
                            your expertise may include such key concepts as sexual function, childbearing process,
                            breastfeeding, and parenting, just to name a few! But you will deal with patients who,
                            despite being primarily in your care because of a complication of pregnancy, will also have
                            other issues that require your attention. The NANDA-I taxonomy can help you to identify
                            potential diagnoses for these patients and support your clinical reasoning skills by
                            clarifying what assessment data/diagnostic indicators are necessary for quickly, but
                            accurately, diagnosing your patients.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps, as you are admitting a 36-year old patient, Miss K, with a 34 week pregnancy for the
                            treatment of severe pre-eclampsia, you notice that she is restless and tense. Your patient
                            tells you that she did not receive prenatal care, due to her former partner's domestic
                            violence and stalking; she has been staying at a shelter with her 3-year-old daughter for
                            the last three months. Her parents died from a large mudslide when she was 12, and she grew
                            up in an orphanage. Despite having no relatives or close friends to rely upon for help, Miss
                            K has overcome many difficulties. Her body mass index (BMI) is 38.6. She has chronic
                            hypertension, but has not taken her antihypertensive medication for one year, because she
                            has not been able to afford the prescription. Her current blood pressure is 168/110. She is
                            anxious about the possible emergency delivery.</p>
                        <p>You have not cared for many patients with a complex background such as you are now
                            encountering with Miss K. You want to reflect her risk and/or problems, but you are not sure
                            which nursing diagnosis is the most accurate for this patient in this situation. By looking
                            at the taxonomy, you can quickly form a "cognitive map" that can help you to find more
                            information on diagnoses of relevance to this patient (Fig. 9.5).</p>

                        <p>You are concerned about Miss K's response related to her resilience, and a quick review of
                            the taxonomy leads you to Domain 9 (coping/stress tolerance), Class 2 (coping responses).
                            You then see that there are three diagnoses specifically related to resilience, and you can
                            review the definitions and diagnostic indicators to clarify the most appropriate diagnosis
                            for this patient.</p>
                        <p>Using the taxonomy in this way supports clinical reasoning and helps you to navigate a large
                            volume of information/knowledge (267 diagnoses!) in an effective and efficient manner. A
                            review of the risk factors or the related factors and defining characteristics of these
                            three diagnoses can: (1) provide you with additional data that you need to obtain in order
                            to make an informed decision and/or (2) enable you to compare your assessment with those
                            diagnostic indicators to accurately diagnose your patient.</p>
                        <p>Think about a recent patient - did you struggle to diagnose his/her human response? Did you
                            find it difficult to know how to identify potential diagnoses? Using the taxonomy can
                            support you in identifying possible diagnoses because of the way the diagnoses are grouped
                            together in classes and domains that represent specific areas of knowledge. Do not forget,
                            however, that simply looking at the diagnosis label and "picking a diagnosis" is not safe
                            care! You need to review the definition and diagnostic indicators (defining characteristics,
                            related factors, or risk factors) for each of the potential diagnoses you identify, which
                            will help you to identify what additional data you should collect or if you have enough data
                            to accurately diagnose the patient's human response.</p>

                            <h4>Case Study: Mr. S</h4>
                            <p>Let us suppose that your patient, Mr. S, an 87-year-old widower, presents with complaints
                                of severe, shooting pain in his right hip area. He has been living in an assisted living
                                facility for two years, since his wife died, and the staff members there have noticed
                                that he is very agitated and shows signs of severe pain whenever they try to help him
                                walk. They have brought him in to rule out any possible fracture or need for a hip
                                replacement. They note that he had his other hip replaced three years ago, due to
                                osteoporosis. Apparently, the surgery was very successful.</p>
                            <p>Mr. S has no noticeable edema or bruising to his right hip area, but clearly complains of
                                pain when you palpate the area. He has good lower extremity bilateral peripheral pulses
                                and a lower extremity capillary refill time of 4 seconds. His medical history includes a
                                cerebrovascular attack (stroke) at age 80. According to his medical records, he had
                                initial paralysis on the right side and lost all speech function. He received alteplase
                                IV r-tPA, a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and recovered full mobility and speech.
                                He was in an inpatient rehabilitation center for 26 days, received speech, physical and
                                occupational therapy, and cared for himself independently after he was discharged home.
                                He has moderate coronary artery disease, but otherwise no significant medical history.
                                According to the staff member accompanying him, Mr. S has been active until a few weeks
                                ago when he started to complain of pain. He enjoyed ballroom dancing, exercised at the
                                facility on a regular basis, and was frequently seen walking around the complex speaking
                                to people, or taking walks outdoors on the grounds of the complex when the weather was
                                nice. She also indicates he has become less social recently, and has not attended
                                different activities that he normally enjoys. She indicates the staff members have
                                attributed this to his level of discomfort.</p>
                            <p>What you notice most about Mr. S, however, is that he seems withdrawn, he barely speaks,
                                and rarely makes eye contact. He struggles to answer your questions, and the staff
                                member often jumps in to provide answers rather than allowing him to answer for himself.
                                Although his speech does not appear to be impaired, he seems to be struggling to find
                                answers to even basic questions, such as his age or the year that his wife died.</p>
                            <p>After completing your assessment and reviewing his history, you believe that Mr. S may be
                                dealing with an issue related to cognition, but this is an area of nursing in which you
                                have little experience; you need some review of potential diagnoses. Since you are
                                considering a cognition issue, you look at the NANDA-I taxonomy to identify the logical
                                location of these diagnoses. You identify that Domain 5, Perception/cognition, deals
                                with the human information processing system including attention, orientation,
                                sensation, perception, cognition, and communication. Because you are considering issues
                                related to cognition, you think this domain will contain diagnoses of relevance to Mr.
                                S.</p>
                            <p>You then quickly identify Class 4, Cognition. A review of this class leads to the
                                identification of three potential diagnoses: acute confusion, chronic confusion, and
                                impaired memory.</p>
                            <p>Questions you should ask yourself include: What other human responses should I rule out
                                or consider? What other signs/symptoms, or etiologies, should I look for to confirm this
                                diagnosis?</p>
                            <p>Once you review the definitions and diagnostic indicators (related factors, defining
                                characteristics, and risk factors), you diagnose Mr. S with chronic confusion (00129).
                            </p>
                            <p>Some final questions should include: Am I missing anything? Am I diagnosing without
                                sufficient evidence? If you believe you are correct in your diagnosis, your questions
                                move on to: What outcomes can I realistically expect to achieve with Mr. S? What are the
                                evidence-based nursing interventions that I should consider? How will I evaluate whether
                                or not they were effective?</p>

                        <p>In 1987, NANDA-I published Taxonomy I, which was structured to reflect nursing theoretical
                            models from North America. In 2002, Taxonomy II was adopted, which was adapted from the
                            Functional Health Patterns assessment framework of Dr. Marjory Gordon. This assessment
                            framework is probably the most used nursing assessment framework around the world. Table 9.1
                            demonstrates the domains, classes, and nursing diagnoses and how they are currently located
                            within the NANDA-I Taxonomy II.</p>

                        <h3 id="structure-taxonomy-2">10.1 Structure of Taxonomy II</h3>
                        <p>Taxonomy is defined as the "system for naming and organizing things ... into groups that
                            share similar qualities" (Cambridge Dictionary Online, 2017). Within the taxonomy, the
                            domains are "an area of interest or an area over which one has control"; and the classes are
                            "a group ... with similar structure" (Cambridge Dictionary Online, 2017).</p>
                        <p>We can adapt the definition for a nursing diagnosis taxonomy; specifically, we are concerned
                            with the orderly classification of diagnostic foci of concern to nursing, according to their
                            presumed natural relationships. Taxonomy II has three levels: domains, classes, and nursing
                            diagnoses. Fig. 9.3 depicts the organization of domains and classes in Taxonomy II; Table
                            9.1 shows Taxonomy II with its 13 domains, 47 classes, and 267 current diagnoses.</p>
                        <p>The Taxonomy II code structure is a 32-bit integer (or if the user's database uses another
                            notation, the code structure is a five-digit code). This structure provides for the
                            stability, or growth and development, of the classification structure by avoiding the need
                            to change codes when new diagnoses, refinements, and revisions are added. New codes are
                            assigned to newly approved diagnoses.</p>
                        <p>Taxonomy II has a code structure that is compliant with recommendations from the National
                            Library of Medicine (NLM) concerning health care terminology codes. The NLM recommends that
                            codes do not contain information about the classified concept, as did the Taxonomy I code
                            structure, which included information about the location and the level of the diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>The NANDA-I terminology is a recognized nursing language that meets the criteria established
                            by the Committee for Nursing Practice Information Infrastructure (CNPII) of the American
                            Nurses Association (ANA) (Lundberg et al., 2008). The benefit of a recognized nursing
                            language is the indication that the classification system is accepted as supporting nursing
                            practice by providing clinically useful terminology. The terminology is also registered with
                            Health Level Seven International (HL7), a health care informatics standard, as a terminology
                            to be used in identifying nursing diagnoses in electronic messages among clinical
                            information systems (www.HL7.org).</p>

                        <h3 id="multiaxial-system">10.2 NANDA-I Taxonomy II: A Multiaxial System</h3>
                        <p>The NANDA-I diagnoses are concepts constructed by means of a multiaxial system. An axis, for
                            the purpose of the NANDA-I Taxonomy II, is operationally defined as a dimension of the human
                            response that is considered in the diagnostic process. There are seven axes. The NANDA-I
                            Model of a Nursing Diagnosis displays the seven axes and their relationship to each other.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Axis 1: the focus of the diagnosis</li>
                            <li>Axis 2: subject of the diagnosis (individual, family, group, caregiver, community, etc.)
                            </li>
                            <li>Axis 3: judgment (impaired, ineffective, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Axis 4: location (oral, peripheral, cerebral, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Axis 5: age (neonate, infant, child, adult, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Axis 6: time (chronic, acute, intermittent)</li>
                            <li>Axis 7: the status of the diagnosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The axes are represented in the labels of the nursing diagnoses through their values. In some
                            cases they are named explicitly, such as with the diagnoses ineffective community coping and
                            dysfunctional family processes, in which the subject of the diagnosis is named using the two
                            values "community" and "family" taken from Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis). "Ineffective"
                            and "dysfunctional" are two of the values contained in Axis 3 (judgment).</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the axis is implicit, as is the case with the diagnosis ineffective sexuality
                            pattern, in which the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2 ) is always the patient. In some
                            instances, an axis may not be pertinent to a diagnosis, and therefore is not part of the
                            nursing diagnostic label. For example, the time axis may not be relevant to every diagnosis.
                            In the case of diagnoses without explicit identification of the subject of the diagnosis, it
                            may be helpful to remember that NANDA-I defines a patient as "an individual, a family, a
                            group, or a community".</p>
                        <p>Axis 1 (the focus of the diagnosis) and Axis 3 (judgment) are essential components of a
                            nursing diagnosis. In some cases, however, the focus of the diagnosis contains the judgment
                            (e.g., fear); in these cases, the judgment is not explicitly separated from the focus of the
                            diagnosis in the diagnostic label. Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis) is also essential,
                            although, as described earlier, it may be implied and therefore not included in the label.
                            The Diagnosis Development Committee requires these axes for submission; the other axes may
                            be used where relevant for clarity.</p>
                        <p>A recent basic statistical analysis of diagnostic labels demonstrated that the 2018-2020
                            NANDA-I nursing diagnoses (ND) used Axis 1 (focus) in association with different terms from
                            the other axes, except in situations in which the ND label was a single word (e.g., anxiety,
                            fear, obesity). Axis 3 (judgment) was the second most used axis, contributing to the
                            construction of 82% of the ND. The remaining axes were used to a lesser extent, in 18% of
                            the ND (Miguel, Romeiro, Martins, Casaleiro, Caldeira, & Herdman, 2019).</p>
                        <p>Although there were some additions in the 2021-2023 release of the NANDA-I terminology, there
                            remain few ND which address the elderly (n=2), child and adolescent (n=9), and neonatal
                            (n=4) populations within the ND label. Therefore, it seems the adequacy of ND to such
                            populations, whose specificities make them unique when comparing them to the general
                            population, may remain limited. The absence of a clinical picture consistent with those
                            clients' reality - including differentiated defining characteristics, related and/or risk
                            factors - and the complexity of decisions nurses undertake in caring for them, leads us to
                            think that ND labels are far from being thoroughly developed (Miguel, Romeiro, Martins,
                            Casaleiro, Caldeira, & Herdman, 2019).</p>
                        <p>The adjustments of ND labels to particular contexts, environments, and populations -
                            implicitly including the rights of clinical reasoning advocated by Levett-Jones et al.
                            (2010) - could raise the quality of nursing care. In addition, it would provide the
                            necessary evidence base for the NANDA-I terminology, corroborating the ND hierarchy within
                            taxonomy II, or lead to an appeal for more adequate and clear domains and classes (Miguel,
                            Romeiro, Martins, Casaleiro, Caldeira, & Herdman, 2019).</p>
                        <p>NANDA-I supports developments in the specificity of ND labels, specifically regarding its
                            multiaxial aspects, to increase the specificity and accuracy of the diagnostic process,
                            which is known to be the core of clinical reasoning and practice.</p>

                        <h3 id="definitions-axes">10.3 Definitions of the Axes</h3>
                        <h4 id="axis1">10.3.1 Axis 1: The Focus of the Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>The focus of the diagnosis is the principal element or the fundamental and essential part,
                            the root, of the diagnostic concept. It describes the "human response" that is the core of
                            the diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>The focus of the diagnosis may consist of one or more nouns. When more than one noun is used
                            (e.g., mood regulation), each one contributes a unique meaning to the focus of the
                            diagnosis, as if the two were a single noun; the meaning of the combined term, however, is
                            different from when the nouns are stated separately. Frequently, a noun (conflict) may be
                            used with an adjective (decisional) to denote the focus of the diagnosis decisional
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the focus of the diagnosis and the diagnostic concept are one and the same, as
                            is seen with the diagnosis of hyperthermia (00007). This occurs when the nursing diagnosis
                            is stated at its most clinically useful level and the separation of the focus of the
                            diagnosis adds no meaningful level of abstraction. It can be very difficult to determine
                            exactly what should be considered the focus of the diagnosis. For example, using the
                            diagnoses of bowel incontinence (00014) and stress urinary incontinence (00017), the
                            question becomes: Is the focus of the diagnosis incontinence alone, or are there two foci -
                            bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence? In this instance, incontinence is the focus and
                            the location terms (Axis 4) of bowel and urinary provide more clarification about the focus.
                            However, incontinence in and of itself is a judgment term that can stand alone, and so it
                            becomes the focus of the diagnosis regardless of location.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, however, removing the location (Axis 4) from the diagnostic focus would
                            prevent it from providing meaning to nursing practice. For example, if we look at the focus
                            of the diagnosis risk for female genital mutilation, is the focus of the diagnosis genital
                            mutilation or simply mutilation? Or if you look at the diagnosis impaired skin integrity, is
                            the focus integrity or skin integrity? Decisions about what constitutes the essence of the
                            focus of the diagnosis, then, are made on the basis of what helps to identify the nursing
                            practice implication and whether or not the term indicates a human response. Mutilation
                            could refer to an act or instance of destroying, removing, or severely damaging a limb - so
                            it is important to identify female genital mutilation as the diagnostic focus. Similarly,
                            integrity can mean the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles - again,
                            these are characteristics but not human responses, and are completely unrelated to the
                            diagnosis of impaired skin integrity; skin integrity, however, refers to the health of the
                            skin, and is a human response. In some cases, the focus may seem similar, but is in fact
                            quite distinct: violence and self-directed violence are two different human responses, and
                            therefore must be identified separately in terms of diagnostic foci within Taxonomy II. The
                            diagnostic foci of the NANDA-I nursing diagnoses are shown in Table 10.1.</p>

                        <p>The subject of the diagnosis is defined as the person(s) for whom a nursing diagnosis is
                            determined. The terms in Axis 2 are individual, caregiver, family, group, and community,
                            representing the NANDA-I definition of "patient":</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Individual:</strong> A single human being distinct from others, a person.</li>
                            <li><strong>Caregiver:</strong> A family member or helper who regularly looks after a child
                                or a sick, elderly, or disabled person.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family:</strong> Two or more people having continuous or sustained
                                relationships, perceiving reciprocal obligations, sensing common meaning, and sharing
                                certain obligations toward others; related by blood and/or choice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Group:</strong> A number of people with shared characteristics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community:</strong> A group of people living in the same locale under the same
                                governance. Examples include neighborhoods and cities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When the subject of the diagnosis is not explicitly stated, it becomes the individual by
                            default. However, it is perfectly appropriate to consider such diagnoses for the other
                            subjects of the diagnosis as well. The diagnosis fear (00148) could be applied to an
                            individual who has a learned response to threat and is in an unfamiliar setting, separated
                            from her support system, which is evidenced by her experiencing feelings of dread,
                            apprehension, and uneasiness. The same diagnosis could be applied to a family that is
                            fearful of the outcome of a family member's surgery, which is evidenced by the family
                            members' expressions of concern, restlessness, and sleeplessness. The diagnosis could also
                            be applied to a community that is fearful of an outbreak of a contagious disease, which is
                            evidenced by the community members' avoidance of public places and gatherings.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the subject of the diagnosis is explicitly stated in the diagnostic label, as
                            in the diagnoses ineffective community coping (00053) and dysfunctional family processes
                            (00060 and 00061). In these cases, the subject of the diagnosis is clearly not the
                            individual, but rather the community and the family, respectively. The subject of the
                            diagnosis is an essential component of a nursing diagnosis; therefore, it must be included
                            in every nursing diagnosis, either explicitly or implicitly.</p>
                        <h4 id="axis3">10.3.3 Axis 3: Judgment</h4>
                        <p>A judgment is a descriptor or modifier that limits or specifies the meaning of the focus of
                            the diagnosis. The focus of the diagnosis, together with the nurse's judgment about it,
                            forms the diagnosis. All the definitions used are found in the Oxford Lexico (Oxford
                            University Press, 2019), unless otherwise specified. The values in Axis 3 are found in Table
                            10.2.</p>

                            7 are:</p>
                        <ul>

                                Note: In problem-focused diagnoses this status is assumed in the label itself, there are
                                not standardized terms used for every problem-focused diagnosis</li>
                            <li><strong>Readiness for:</strong> motivation and desire to increase well-being and to
                                actualize human health potential that exists in the current moment (Pender et al 2006)

                        </ul>
                        <p>The terms in Axis 7 (status) are not currently expressed, explicitly, in any of the NANDA-I
                            ND labels (Miguel, Romeiro, Martins, Casaleiro, Caldeira, & Herdman, T.H., 2019). However,
                            the axis is implicit in every diagnosis as this relates to the type of diagnosis that is
                            represented by the label. The DDC plans to move forward a discussion during the next cycle
                            as to whether or not Axis 7 should remain within our multiaxial system.</p>

                        <h3 id="developing-submitting">10.4 Developing and Submitting a Nursing Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>A nursing diagnosis is constructed by combining the terms from Axis 1 (the focus of the
                            diagnosis), Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis), and Axis 3 (judgment), and adding terms from
                            the other axes for relevant clarity. Researchers or interested professional nurses would
                            begin with the focus of the diagnosis (Axis 1) and add the appropriate judgment term (Axis
                            3).</p>
                        <p>Remember that these two axes are sometimes combined into a single diagnostic concept, as can
                            be seen with the nursing diagnosis fear (00148). Next, they would specify the subject of the
                            diagnosis (Axis 2 ). If the subject is an "individual", they need not make it explicit.
                            Finally, as previously stated, NANDA-I supports developments in ND labels with regard to
                            their multiaxial aspects, to increase the specificity and accuracy of the diagnostic
                            process, which is known to be the core of clinical reasoning and practice. Thus, submitters
                            are encouraged to consider whether the distinction possible by use of additional axes could
                            lead to a more precise diagnosis, which could then aid diagnostic reasoning. For example, a
                            review of the diagnoses, Neonatal hypothermia (00280) and Hypothermia (00006) demonstrates a
                            significant difference in defining characteristics and related factors based on the
                            incorporation of the axis 5 term (neonate).</p>
                        <p>NANDA-I does not support the random construction of diagnostic concepts that would occur by
                            simply matching terms from one axis to another to create a diagnosis label to represent
                            judgments based on a patient assessment. Clinical problems/areas of nursing foci that are
                            identified and which do not have a NANDA-I label should be carefully described in
                            documentation to ensure accuracy of other nurses'/health care professionals' interpretation
                            of the clinical judgment.</p>
                        <p>Creating a diagnosis to be used in clinical practice and/or documentation by matching terms
                            from different axes, without development of the definition and other component parts of a
                            diagnosis (defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors, associated
                            conditions, and at-risk populations, as appropriate) in an evidence-based manner, negates
                            the purpose of a standardized language as a method to truly represent, inform, and direct
                            clinical judgment and practice.</p>
                        <p>This is a serious concern with regard to patient safety, because the lack of the knowledge
                            inherent within the component diagnostic parts makes it impossible to ensure diagnostic
                            accuracy. Nursing terms arbitrarily created at the point of care could result in
                            misinterpretation of the clinical problem/area of focus, and subsequently lead to
                            inappropriate outcome setting and intervention choice. It also makes it impossible to
                            accurately research incidence of nursing diagnoses or to conduct outcome or intervention
                            studies related to diagnoses since, without clear component parts of a diagnosis
                            (definitions, defining characteristics, related factors, or risk factors), it is impossible
                            to know if the concept being studied truly represents the same phenomena.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, when discussing construction of diagnostic concepts in this chapter, the intent is
                            to inform clinicians as to how diagnostic concepts are developed and to provide clarity for
                            individuals who are developing diagnoses, for submission into the NANDA-I Taxonomy; it
                            should not be misinterpreted to suggest that NANDA-I supports the creation of diagnosis
                            labels by clinicians at the point of patient care.</p>

                        <h3 id="further-development">10.5 Further Development: Using Axes</h3>
                        <p>NANDA International will be focusing on revision of diagnoses that are currently included in
                            the terminology, but which were "grandfathered" in after the level of evidence criteria was
                            adopted in 2002. There are over 50 such diagnoses, which will be removed from the
                            terminology during the next edition should this revision not occur. Therefore, we strongly
                            discourage the development of new diagnoses at this time, with the focus instead on bringing
                            diagnoses to a minimum level of evidence of 2.1., and raising the level of evidence of other
                            diagnoses.</p>
                        <p>The other focus for NANDA-I will be to strengthen the clinical usefulness of diagnostic
                            indicators (defining characteristics and related/risk factors). Our desire is to be able to
                            identify, through clinical research and meta-analysis/ meta-synthesis, those defining
                            characteristics that are required for a diagnosis to be made ("critical defining
                            characteristics") and to remove those that are not clinically useful. This will strengthen
                            our ability to provide decision support for nurses at the bedside.</p>
                        <p>If individuals are moving forward with developing new diagnoses, or are clinically validating
                            diagnoses in specific patient populations, we encourage them to review the new guidelines
                            prior to submission. Finally, research is needed to provide evidence-based support for
                            interventions that are most effective when addressing specific related factors of our ND.
                            Unfortunately, much of the literature to date on intervention is aimed at symptom control
                            (addressing defining characteristics) which, although important, does not enable us to fully
                            resolve the diagnosis.</p>

                        <h3 id="glossary-nursing-diagnosis">11.1 Nursing Diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>A nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment concerning a human response to health
                            conditions/life processes, or a susceptibility to that response, that is recognized in an
                            individual, caregiver, family, group, or community. A nursing diagnosis provides the basis
                            for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcomes for which the nurse has
                            accountability (approved at the Ninth NANDA Conference; amended in 2009, 2013, and 2019).
                        </p>
                        <h4>11.1.1 Problem-Focused Nursing Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>A clinical judgment concerning an undesirable human response to health conditions/life
                            processes that is recognized in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community.</p>
                        <p>To diagnose a human response a problem-focused diagnosis, the following must be present:
                            defining characteristics that cluster in patterns of related cues or inferences, and related
                            factors.</p>
                        <h4>11.1.2 Health Promotion Nursing Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>A clinical judgment concerning motivation and desire to increase well-being and to actualize
                            health potential that is recognized in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or
                            community.</p>
                        <p>These responses are expressed by a readiness to enhance specific health behaviors, and can be
                            used in any health state. In individuals who are unable to express their own readiness to
                            enhance health behaviors, the nurse may determine a condition for health promotion exists
                            and act on the client's behalf. Health promotion responses may exist in an individual,
                            caregiver, family, group, or community.</p>
                        <p>To diagnose a human response as a health promotion diagnosis, the following must be present:
                            defining characteristics that cluster in patterns of related cues or inferences which
                            reflect a desire to enhance a current behavior or response, or that represent such a
                            possibility in patients who cannot express their own readiness.</p>
                        <h4>11.1.3 Risk Nursing Diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>A clinical judgment concerning the susceptibility for developing an undesirable human
                            response to health conditions/life processes that is recognized in an individual, caregiver,
                            family, group, or community.</p>
                        <p>To diagnose a risk diagnosis, the following must be present: risk factors that contribute to
                            increased susceptibility.</p>
                        <h4>11.1.4 Syndrome</h4>
                        <p>A clinical judgment concerning a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses that occur together,
                            and are best addressed together and through similar interventions.</p>
                        <p>To diagnose a syndrome diagnosis, the following must be present: defining characteristics,
                            which must be two or more nursing diagnoses, and related factors. Other defining
                            characteristics that are not nursing diagnoses may be used, so long as similar interventions
                            may be used to address them.</p>

                        <h3 id="glossary-diagnostic-axes">11.2 Diagnostic Axes</h3>
                        <h4>11.2.1 Axis</h4>
                        <p>An axis is operationally defined as a dimension of the human response that is considered in
                            the diagnostic process. There are seven axes that parallel the International Standards
                            Reference Model for a Nursing Diagnosis.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Axis 1: the focus of the diagnosis</li>
                            <li>Axis 2: subject of the diagnosis (individual, family, group, caregiver, community)</li>
                            <li>Axis 3: judgment (impaired, ineffective, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Axis 4: location (bladder, auditory, cerebral, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Axis 5: age (neonate, infant, child, adult, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Axis 6: time (chronic, acute, intermittent)</li>
                            <li>Axis 7: status of the diagnosis (problem-focused, risk, health promotion).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The axes are represented in the labels of the nursing diagnoses through their terms. In some
                            cases, they are named explicitly, such as with the diagnoses ineffective community coping
                            and compromised family coping, in which the subject of the diagnosis is named using the two
                            terms "community" and "family" taken from Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis). "Ineffective"
                            and "compromised" are two of the terms contained in Axis 3 (judgment).</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the axis is implicit, as is the case with the diagnosis decreased activity
                            tolerance, in which the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2 ) is always the patient. In some
                            instances, an axis may not be pertinent to a particular diagnosis and therefore is not part
                            of the nursing diagnostic label. For example, the time axis may not be relevant to every
                            diagnosis. In the case of diagnoses without explicit identification of the subject of the
                            diagnosis, it may be helpful to remember that NANDA-I defines patient as "an individual,
                            caregiver, family, group, or community".</p>
                        <p>Axis 1 (the focus of the diagnosis) and Axis 3 (judgment) are essential components of a
                            nursing diagnosis. In some cases, however, the focus of the diagnosis contains the judgment
                            (e.g., nausea); in these cases, the judgment is not explicitly separated out in the
                            diagnostic label. Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis) is also essential, although, as
                            described above, it may be implied and therefore not included in the label. The DDC requires
                            these axes for submission; the other axes may be used where relevant for clarity.</p>

                        <h4>11.2.2 Definitions of the Axes</h4>
                        <h5>Axis 1: Focus of the Diagnosis</h5>
                        <p>The focus of the diagnosis is the principal element or the fundamental and essential part,
                            the root, of the diagnostic concept. It describes the "human response" that is the core of
                            the diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>The focus of the diagnosis may consist of one or more nouns. When more than one noun is used
                            (e.g., mood regulation), each one contributes a unique meaning to the focus of the
                            diagnosis, as if the two were a single noun; the meaning of the combined term, however, is
                            different from when the nouns are stated separately. Frequently, an adjective (spiritual)
                            may be used with a noun (distress) to denote the focus of the diagnosis spiritual distress
                            (see Table 10.1).</p>

                        <h5>Axis 2: Subject of the Diagnosis</h5>
                        <p>The person(s) for whom a nursing diagnosis is determined. The terms in Axis 2 that represent
                            the NANDA-I definition of "patient" are the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Individual:</strong> a single human being distinct from others, a person</li>
                            <li><strong>Caregiver:</strong> a family member or helper who regularly looks after a child
                                or a sick, elderly, or disabled person</li>
                            <li><strong>Family:</strong> two or more people having continuous or sustained
                                relationships, perceiving reciprocal obligations, sensing common meaning, and sharing
                                certain obligations toward others; related by blood and/or choice</li>
                            <li><strong>Group:</strong> a number of people with shared characteristics</li>
                            <li><strong>Community:</strong> a group of people living in the same locale under the same
                                governance; examples include neighborhoods and cities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Axis 3: Judgment</h5>
                        <p>A descriptor or modifier that limits or specifies the meaning of the focus of the diagnosis.
                            The focus of the diagnosis together with the nurse's judgment about it forms the diagnosis.
                            The terms in Axis 3 are found in Table 10.2.</p>

                        <h5>Axis 4: Location</h5>
                        <p>Describes the parts/regions of the body and/or their related functions - all tissues, organs,
                            anatomical sites, or structures. For the locations in Axis 4, see Table 10.3.</p>

                        <h5>Axis 5: Age</h5>
                        <p>Refers to the age group of the person who is the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2). The terms
                            in Axis 5 are noted below, with all definitions except that of older adult being drawn from

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fetus:</strong> unborn human more than 8 weeks after conception, until birth
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Neonate:</strong> person < 28 days of age</li>

                        <h5>Axis 6: Time</h5>
                        <p>Describes the duration of the diagnostic concept (Axis 1). The terms in Axis 6 are as
                            follows:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <p>Refers to the actuality or potentiality of the problem/syndrome or health promotion
                            opportunity to the categorization of the diagnosis as a health promotion diagnosis. The
                            terms in Axis 7 are problem-focused, health promotion, risk.</p>

                        <h3 id="glossary-components">11.3 Components of a Nursing Diagnosis</h3>
                        <h4>11.3.1 Diagnosis Label</h4>
                        <p>Provides a name for a diagnosis that reflects, at a minimum, the focus of the diagnosis (from
                            Axis 1) and the nursing judgment (from Axis 3). It is a concise term or phrase that
                            represents a pattern of related cues. It may include modifiers.</p>
                        <h4>11.3.2 Definition</h4>
                        <p>Provides a clear, precise description; delineates its meaning and helps differentiate it from
                            similar diagnoses.</p>
                        <h4>11.3.3 Defining Characteristics</h4>
                        <p>Observable cues/inferences that cluster as manifestations of a problem-focused, health
                            promotion diagnosis or syndrome. This implies not only those things that the nurse can see,
                            but also things that are seen, heard (e.g., the patient/family tells us), touched, or
                            smelled.</p>
                        <h4>11.3.4 Risk Factors</h4>
                        <p>Antecedent factors that increase the susceptibility of an individual, caregiver, family,
                            group, or community to an undesirable human response. These factors must be modifiable by
                            independent nursing interventions, and whenever possible, interventions should be aimed at
                            these factors.</p>
                        <h4>11.3.5 Related Factors</h4>
                        <p>Antecedent factors shown to have a patterned relationship with the human response. Such
                            factors may be described as associated with, related to, or contributing to that response.
                            These factors must be modifiable by independent nursing interventions, and whenever
                            possible, interventions should be aimed at these etiological factors. Problem-focused
                            nursing diagnoses and syndromes must have related factors; health promotion diagnoses may
                            have related factors, if they help clarify the diagnosis.</p>
                        <h4>11.3.6 At-Risk Populations</h4>
                        <p>Groups of people who share sociodemographic characteristics, health/family history, stages of
                            growth/development, exposure to certain events/experiences that cause each member to be
                            susceptible to a particular human response. These characteristics are not modifiable by
                            independent nursing interventions.</p>
                        <h4>11.3.7 Associated Conditions</h4>
                        <p>Medical diagnoses, diagnostic/surgical procedures, medical/surgical devices, or
                            pharmaceutical preparations; these conditions are modifiable by independent nursing
                            interventions.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <h4>11.4.1 Independent Nursing Interventions</h4>
                        <p>Interventions that can be initiated by the professional nurse that go beyond basic
                            monitoring, referral to other professionals, compliance with organizational protocol, and/or
                            that do not require orders from other health professionals. They are sanctioned by
                            professional nurse practice acts or regulations.</p>
                        <h4>11.4.2 Nursing-Sensitive Outcomes</h4>
                        <p>Measurable individual, caregiver, group, family, or community state, behaviors or perceptions
                            in response to nursing interventions.</p>
                        <h4>11.4.3 Nursing Plan of Care</h4>
                        <p>Includes nursing diagnoses, the outcomes, and individualized nursing interventions, based on
                            a complete nursing assessment and understanding of the goals and desires of the individual,
                            caregiver, group, family, or community receiving care.</p>

                        <h3 id="glossary-classification">11.5 Definitions for Classification of Nursing Diagnoses</h3>
                        <h4>11.5.1 Classification</h4>
                        <p>The arrangement of related phenomena in taxonomic groups according to their observed
                            similarities; a category into which something is put (English Oxford Living Dictionary
                            Online 2020).</p>
                        <h4>11.5.2 Level of Abstraction</h4>
                        <p>Describes the concreteness/abstractness of a concept:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Very abstract concepts are theoretical, may not be directly measurable, are defined by
                                concrete concepts, are inclusive of concrete concepts, are disassociated from any
                                specific instance, are independent of time and space, have more general descriptors, and
                                may not be clinically useful for planning treatment.</li>
                            <li>Concrete concepts are observable and measurable, limited by time and space, constitute a
                                specific category, are more exclusive, name a real thing or class of things, are
                                restricted by nature, and may be clinically useful for planning treatment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>11.5.3 Terminology</h4>
                        <p>The body of terms used with a particular technical application in a subject of study,
                            profession, etc. (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).</p>
