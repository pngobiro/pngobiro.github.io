Important note: Medicine is an ever-changing science undergoing continual development. Research and clinical experience are continually expanding our knowledge, in particular our knowledge of proper treatment and drug therapy. Insofar as this book mentions any dosage or application, readers may rest assured that the authors, editors, and publishers have made every effort to ensure that such references are in accordance with the state of knowledge at the time of production of the book.

Nevertheless, this does not involve, imply, or express any guarantee or responsibility on the part of the publishers in respect to any dosage instructions and forms of applications stated in the book. Every user is requested to examine carefully the manufacturers' leaflets accompanying each drug and to check, if necessary in consultation with a physician or specialist, whether the dosage schedules mentioned therein or the contraindications stated by the manufacturers differ from the statements made in the present book. Such examination is particularly important with drugs that are either rarely used or have been newly released on the market. Every dosage schedule or every form of application used is entirely at the user's own risk and responsibility. The authors and publishers request every user to report to the publishers any discrepancies or inaccuracies noticed. If errors in this work are found after publication, errata will be posted at www.thieme.com on the product description page.

Some of the product names, patents, and registered designs referred to in this book are in fact registered trademarks or proprietary names even though specific reference to this fact is not always made in the text. Therefore, the appearance of a name without designation as proprietary is not to be construed as a representation by the publisher that it is in the public domain.

\section*{Dedication}

The Board of Directors of NANDA International, Inc., would like to dedicate this book to nurses working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. We honor your courage and dedication during this time. We especially wish to recognize those nurses who lost their lives while caring for patients and families.

\section*{Preface}

The International Year of the Nurse and Midwife began with a battle with COVID-19. I cannot thank healthcare professionals enough who are caring for patients despite, at times, the lack of protective equipment. I am writing this as the impact of COVID-19 is continuing around the world. I hope that by the time you read this text, effective treatments and preventive measures have been developed and are available to everyone.

A while back, a nurse fighting on the frontline asked me, "Which nursing diagnosis should I use for COVID-19 patients?" This question reminded me of the need to repeatedly emphasize the meaning of nursing diagnosis. Most importantly, patients with the same medical diagnosis do not necessarily have the same human responses (nursing diagnoses). Likewise, patients with the same genotype of coronavirus infection do not necessarily have the same human responses. That is why, prior to providing proper care for each patient, nurses must conduct a nursing assessment and identify his/her unique responses (nursing diagnoses). Even at times like those we are facing today, nurses need to identify what we independently diagnose and treat related to patients and their families, which are different from medical diagnoses. If nurses have properly documented the nursing diagnoses of patients with COVID-19 and their families, then in the near future, we will be able to identify commonalities and differences in their human responses, from an international perspective.

In this 2021-2023 version, the Twelfth Edition, the classification provides 267 diagnoses, with the addition of new diagnoses. Each nursing diagnosis has been the product of one or more of our many NANDA International (NANDA-I) volunteers, and most have a defined evidence base. Each new diagnosis has been reviewed and refined by our Diagnosis Development Committee (DDC) members assigned as primary reviewers, and by content experts, prior to receiving DDC approval. This DDC approval does not mean the diagnosis is "completed" or "ready to be used" across all countries or practice areas. We all know that practice and regulation of nursing varies from region to region. It is our hope that publication of these new diagnoses will facilitate further validation studies in different parts of the world, to achieve a higher level of evidence.

We always welcome submissions for new nursing diagnoses. At the same time, we have a serious need for revision of existing diagnoses to reflect the most recent evidence. In the eleventh edition, we identified approximately

90 diagnoses without an assigned level of evidence (LOE), or which required major updates. Thanks to the cooperation of many volunteers, most of whom were published in the focus area of the diagnosis, the majority of these diagnoses are now revised and have met requirements for our LOE criteria. However, we were not able to complete all revisions, so 32 diagnoses remain without an identified LOE. The intention is to revise or retire these remaining diagnoses by the next edition. I want to strongly encourage all students and researchers to submit their nursing diagnosis-related research results to NANDA-I, to improve the evidence base of the terminology.

The NANDA-I terminology is translated into more than 20 distinct languages. Translating abstract English terms into other languages can often be frustrating. During this cycle, a decision was made to incorporate standardized terms from the United States National Library of Medicine, the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), to facilitate translation. Identifying the MeSH terms, where appropriate, that are found within our diagnostic indicators provides standardized definitions for terms, which we believe will support translators in their work.

The years since the past edition have also been the first in what we hope will be a lasting partnership with our academic partner, Boston College (BC) and the Connell School of Nursing. Under the direction of Dr. Dorothy Jones, the Marjory Gordon Program for Knowledge Development and Clinical Reasoning has been established. We held our first conference at BC in 2018, and had planned our second conference for 2020, which unfortunately was cancelled due to the impact of COVID-19. However, work on an online educational module has been completed as a joint venture between BC and NANDA-I, several postdoctoral scholars have been welcomed into the program from around the world (Brazil, Italy, Spain, Nigeria), and our collaboration continues. We look forward to additional conferences, educational opportunities, postdoctoral scholarships, and future opportunities that this partnership with BC will bring. I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to Dr. Jones, Dean Susan Gennaro, and Associate Dean Christopher Grillo for their collaboration, collegiality, and dedication to making this partnership a reality.

I want to acknowledge the work of all NANDA-I volunteers, committee members, chairpersons, and members of the Board of Directors for their time, commitment, devotion, and ongoing support. I would also like to thank the various content experts who, although not members of NANDA International, contributed countless hours to reviewing and revising diagnoses in
their area of expertise. The NANDA-I staff, led by our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. T. Heather Herdman, is to be commended for its efforts and support.

My special thanks to the members of the DDC and the Expert Clinical Advisory Panel for their outstanding and timely efforts to review and edit the terminology represented within this book, and especially for the leadership of our new DDC Chair, Dr. Camila Takáo Lopes, who began her term in 2019. This remarkable committee, with representation from North and South America and Europe, is the true "powerhouse" of the NANDA-I knowledge content. I am deeply impressed and pleased by the astonishing, comprehensive work of these volunteers during this cycle, and I am confident that you will be, as well.

It has been my honor and privilege to serve as President of this dedicated association of international nurses, and I look forward to where the future will continue to take our work.

\subsection*{1.1 Overview on Changes and Revisions in the NANDA-I 2021-2023 Edition}

Part 1 presents an overview of major changes to this edition: new and revised diagnoses, retired diagnoses, continued revision to standardize diagnostic indicator terms, new level of evidence criteria for diagnosis submission, a proposed refinement to the terminology, and introductory recommendations on nursing diagnoses that require development.

It is our hope that the organization of this 12 th edition will make it efficient and effective to use. We welcome your feedback. If you have suggestions, please send them by email to: admin@nanda.org.

Changes have been made in this edition based on feedback from users, to address both the needs of students, clinicians, and researchers, as well as to provide additional support to educators. New information has been added to assessment. Many diagnoses were revised by international collaborators of the Diagnosis Development Committee Task Force, in order to strengthen their level of evidence. The diagnostic indicators of each diagnosis were revised to decrease ambiguity and improve clarity. Editors referred to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh) whenever possible, to provide standardized definitions, which are available to translators to ensure consistency across languages. Revised level of evidence criteria are presented to ensure that all future diagnoses submitted for inclusion in the classification are at an appropriate level of evidence to represent the current strength of nursing knowledge.

Users who are familiar with previous editions of this text may note that the diagnostic focus is no longer highlighted in the diagnosis label. Instead, the diagnostic focus will be found below the label for each diagnosis in the classification. This was done to facilitate ease of identification of diagnostic foci across languages.

\subsection*{1.2 New Nursing Diagnoses}

A significant body of work representing new and revised nursing diagnoses was submitted to the NANDA-I Diagnosis Development Committee. The editors would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those submitters who
successfully met the level of evidence criteria with their submissions and/or revisions. Forty-six new diagnoses were approved by the Diagnosis Development Committee and were presented to the NANDA-I Board of Directors ( $\triangleright$ Table 1.1), and are now included here for members and users of the terminology. The submitters of each diagnosis are presented following the table.

Submitters of nursing diagnoses. Included here are those contributors who submitted new diagnoses or completed reviews of diagnoses including both label and definition change, or significant content change. Individuals who

\subsection*{1.4 Changes to Nursing Diagnosis Labels}

Changes were made to 17 nursing diagnosis labels to ensure that the diagnostic label was consistent with current literature, and reflected a human response. The diagnostic label changes are shown in $\triangleright$ Table 1.3. Because major changes also occurred to definitions and diagnostic indicators, the original diagnoses were retired from the classification, new diagnoses replaced the originals, and new codes were assigned.

\subsection*{1.5 Retired Nursing Diagnoses}

In the previous edition of the NANDA-I classification, 92 diagnoses were slotted for removal from this edition, unless additional work was completed to bring them to an adequate level of evidence, or to identify appropriate diagnostic indicators. Among those, 52 were successfully revised and submitted to NANDA-I as part of the DDC Task Force, or by individuals who

independently provided revisions. However, we did not receive any revisions on 40 diagnoses. Because of delays between the release in English and translated releases in other countries, we have postponed the removal of these remaining diagnoses, in order to give researchers more time to address their revisions. If additional work is not completed, they will be removed from the 2024-2026 edition. It should be noted that the revision of these diagnoses is considered a priority for NANDA-I in the next cycle of the DDC.

Twenty-three of the 52 diagnoses that were reviewed by context experts were removed from the classification, based on evidence presented to support removal. The diagnoses that have been removed from the classification are listed in $\triangleright$ Table 1.4.

The rationale for retirement of these diagnoses clustered into a few categories: (1) new research is available suggesting previous terms are outdated or have been replaced in the nursing literature, (2) lack of related factors modifiable by independent nursing interventions, (3) diagnosis does not meet the definition of a problem-focused diagnosis.

Ineffective health maintenance, impaired home maintenance, ineffective health management, readiness for enhanced health management, ineffective family health management, risk for metabolic imbalance syndrome, bowel incontinence and functional urinary incontinence were removed because content experts, in the course of literature review, found more appropriate terms
to describe the diagnostic focus. Additionally, clarity to definitions and related factors were provided from these literature reviews. It was indicated that NANDA-I needed to retire old terms, which could be confusing to clinicians, and adopt those with support from current research literature. Refer to - Table 1.3.

Overflow urinary incontinence was removed because it is a defining characteristic of urinary retention, which should be the actual focus of nursing interventions.

The absence of related factors modifiable by independent nursing interventions in the literature led to the removal of reflex urinary incontinence and decreased intracranial adaptive capacity.

Ineffective infant feeding pattern was removed because the phrase "feeding pattern", when translated from English to other languages, might be misleading and inadequately interpreted as the act of being fed, as opposed to the ability of an infant to suck or to coordinate the suck-swallow response. This diagnosis is now represented by the label, ineffective infant suck-swallow response (00295).

Activity intolerance and risk for activity intolerance were removed to enable the creation of diagnostic labels that incorporate a judgment term. These diagnoses were replaced by decreased activity tolerance (00298) and risk for decreased activity tolerance (00299).

No related factors were found by reviewers for latex allergy reaction that were modifiable by independent nursing interventions. However, nurses do assess for, and can independently intervene on, risk for latex allergy reaction (00217), which remains in the classification.

Grieving is a normal human response and therefore does not meet the definition of a problem-focused nursing diagnosis. This does not suggest that nurses do not support patients who are grieving. Nurses should assess for risk for maladaptive grieving (00302) and maladaptive grieving (00301). Additionally, patients may indicate a desire to enhance their grief experience (readiness for enhanced grieving, 00285)

Risk for falls and risk for pressure ulcer were removed because literature reviews performed by content experts provided evidence that there are sufficiently different risk factors for falls and pressure injury among adults, children and/or neonates. Therefore, these diagnoses were replaced by more granular, specific terms. In addition, the diagnostic focus pressure ulcer was updated to pressure injury, according to the most updated specialized literature.

Risk for venous thromboembolism was removed because no sufficiently distinct risk factors for venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboembolism were found that are modifiable by independent nursing interventions. The new diagnosis, risk for thrombosis (00291), includes risk factors for both types of thromboses.

Risk for suicide was removed because the new diagnostic focus, suicidal behavior, represents more accurately the phenomenon of concern to nurses. Suicide - the act of killing oneself - would be an undesirable outcome following suicidal behaviors. This diagnosis was replaced by risk for suicidal behavior (00298).

Risk for delayed development was retired because its definition was more accurately represented by the addition of the age axis, child, to the label. Therefore, this diagnosis was replaced by risk for delayed child development (00305).

\subsection*{1.6 NANDA-I Nursing Diagnoses: Indicator Term Standardization}

Our work to decrease variation in terms used for defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors continued during this twelfth edition of the classification. It involved literature searches, discussion, and consultation with clinical experts in different nursing specialties around the world. Although development of technology made it easier to find similar terms/phrases or those which had difficulties for translation, for example, this was not a simple task and took dozens of hours to complete. Despite this, we know it will not be perfect, and that work will continue into the next edition.

Readers will notice that many diagnoses have minor edits to terms (e.g., alteration in metabolism in the $11^{\text {th }}$ edition will be altered metabolism in the current edition). Work was also completed on all associated conditions and at risk populations, as it was noted in the previous edition that this work would occur during this cycle. This work focused on clarity of terms, and standardizing the way in which terms were stated. These changes are not considered to be content edits, but rather they are editorial changes. Those diagnoses with terms that had editorial changes only do not appear in $\triangleright$ Table 1.2.

The benefits of this revision work are many, but the following three are perhaps the most notable:

\subsection*{1.6.1 Improving Translation}

There have been multiple questions and comments from translators regarding previous terms, which reminded us of the need for this work. For example:
- There are many similar terms/phrases and the way I would translate these terms is exactly the same in my language. Can I use the same term/phrase, or must I translate these terms differently, even if we would not do so in daily practice? To date, we have not required submitters of nursing diagnoses to search the terminology for terms/phrases that already exist to standardize their terms. As a result, the number of diagnostic indicator terms/phrases in the terminology have increased substantially over the years.
- It is important for translators to ensure conceptual clarity when translating the term/phrase. If there is a conceptual difference in two terms in the original English (e.g., helplessness and hopelessness), then they cannot use the same term to represent these two separate concepts. However, translators' struggles often result from a lack of standardization of the original English terms/phrases. Here is one of the examples in the $11{ }^{\text {th }}$ edition: the term, anorexia, was used in eight diagnoses, poor appetite appeared in three diagnoses, decrease in appetite in two diagnoses, and loss of appetite in one diagnosis! It would be difficult, if not impossible to translate these terms in some languages in a way that clearly differentiates the terms.

Decreasing the variation in these terms/phrases should facilitate the translation process, as one term/phrase will now be used throughout the terminology for similar diagnostic indicators. In this edition, we initiated the incorporation of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms whenever possible. The MeSH make up the USA National Library of Medicine's controlled vocabulary thesaurus, used for indexing articles for the MEDLINE ${ }^{®} / \mathrm{PubMED}^{®}$ database. The MeSH terms are defined and serve as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Although the MeSH terms are not viewable in this text, our translators were provided access to the MeSH terms, whenever they were adopted, along with their definitions. These MeSH terms and their definitions should assist translators in creating more precise translation. For the example we discussed above, related to appetite, we have adopted the MeSH term, anorexia, which is defined as "the lack or loss of appetite accompanied by an aversion to food and the inability to eat". This means that this one term replaces the previous four terms.

We have also done our best to condense terms and standardize them, whenever possible.

\subsection*{1.6.2 Improving Terminological Consistency}

We have received other questions that were difficult to answer. For instance: When you say "inadequate" in English, does that mean a lack of quality, or is it the quantity that is lacking? The answer is often, "Both!" Although the duality of this word is well accepted in English, the lack of clarity does not support the clinician in any language, and it makes it very difficult to translate into languages in which a different word would be used depending on the intended meaning. Unfortunately, other similar words, such as insufficient, inadequate, and deficient, have been also used in the terminology. In this edition, we decided to use the term, inadequate, consistently to point a lack of quality and/or lack of quantity, whereas the term, insufficient, is used solely to indicate lack of quantity. Moreover, the word, deficient, is used to mean lacking some elements or characteristics. For example, the phrases, insufficient access to resources and deficient immunity, in the eleventh edition, are revised to inadequate access to resources and inadequate immunity, respectively, in this edition.

Another question identified the need for clear differentiation between commonly used terms: What are the differences, if any, between disease and illness? These terms are not completely exclusive, and the English definitions can be confusing. However, some rules need to be set for consistent use of these terms in the terminology. The MeSH term, disease, is defined as "a definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms". That is, disease is used for a specific medical condition with a clear name and symptoms, which needs to be treated, such as cardiovascular disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Meanwhile, illness is used for the patient's subjective experience of symptoms and unhealthy conditions, which needs to be managed, such as chronic illness or physical illness.

\subsection*{1.6.3 Facilitating Diagnostic Indicator Coding}

We often hear voices from nurses and students confused by the long list of diagnostic indicators. I really do not know if this diagnosis is right for my patient. Do I have to find all defining characteristics and related factors of the diagnosis with my patient? At the current developmental stage of nursing diagnoses, the diagnostic criteria are not as clear as in most medical diagnoses. Identification of nursing diagnostic criteria based on research is an urgent task for the nursing community. Without diagnostic criteria, it is difficult for us to make an accurate nursing diagnosis. Additionally, there is no guarantee that nurses around the world use the same nursing diagnosis for a similar human response.

This work facilitates the coding of the diagnostic indicators, which should facilitate their use for populating assessment databases within electronic health records (EHR). All terms are now coded for use in EHR systems, which is something we have been frequently asked to do by many organizations and vendors alike. In near future, it is possible to find out which defining characteristics most often occur within the assessment data when a nursing diagnosis is documented, which could lead to the identification of critical diagnostic criteria. Additionally, identification of the most common related (causative) factors found for each diagnosis will also facilitate appropriate nursing interventions. This all facilitates the development of decision-support tools regarding accuracy in diagnosis, as well as linking diagnosis to assessment, and linking related/risk factors to appropriate treatment plans.

2 International Considerations on the Use of the NANDA-I Nursing Diagnoses
}

\author{
T. Heather Herdman
}

As we noted earlier, NANDA International, Inc. initially began as a North American organization and, therefore, the earliest nursing diagnoses were primarily developed by nurses from the United States and Canada. However, over the past 20 to 30 years, there has been an increasing involvement by nurses from around the world, and membership in NANDA International, Inc. now includes nurses from nearly 40 countries, with nearly two-thirds of its members coming from countries outside North America. Work is occurring across all continents using NANDA-I nursing diagnoses in curricula, clinical practice, research, and informatics applications. Development and refinement of diagnoses is ongoing across multiple countries, and the majority of research related to the NANDA-I nursing diagnoses is occurring outside North America.

As a reflection of this increased international activity, contribution, and utilization, the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association changed its scope to an international organization in 2002, changing its name to NANDA International, Inc. So, please, we ask that you do not refer to the organiza-
national scope, and it is not the legal name of the organization. We retained "NANDA" within our name because of its status in the nursing profession, so think of it more as a trademark or brand name than as an acronym, since it no longer "stands for" the original name of the association.

As NANDA-I experiences increased worldwide adoption, issues related to differences in the scope of nursing practice, diversity of nurse practice models, divergent laws and regulations, nurse competency, and educational differences must be addressed. In 2009, NANDA-I held an International Think Tank Meeting, which included 86 individuals representing 16 countries. During that meeting, significant discussions occurred as to how best to handle these and other issues. Nurses in some countries are not able to utilize nursing diagnoses of a more physiologic nature because they are in conflict with their current scope of nursing practice. Nurses in other nations are facing regulations aimed to ensure that everything done within nursing practice can be demonstrated
to be evidence-based, and therefore face difficulties with some of the older nursing diagnoses and/or those linked interventions that are not supported by a strong level of research literature. Discussions were therefore held with international leaders in nursing diagnosis use and research, looking for direction that would meet the needs of the worldwide community.

These discussions resulted in a unanimous decision to maintain the taxonomy as an intact body of knowledge in all languages, in order to enable nurses around the world to view, discuss, and consider diagnostic concepts being used by nurses within and outside of their countries, and to engage in discussions, research, and debate regarding the appropriateness of all of the diagnoses. A critical statement agreed upon in that Summit is noted here prior to introducing the nursing diagnoses themselves:

> Not every nursing diagnosis within the NANDA-I taxonomy is appropriate for every nurse in practice - nor has it ever been. Some of the diagnoses are specialty-specific, and would not necessarily be used by all nurses in clinical practice . . . There are diagnoses within the taxonomy that may be outside the scope or standards of nursing practice governing a particular geographic area in which a nurse practices.

Those diagnoses and/or related/risk factors would, in these instances, not be appropriate for practice, and should not be used if they lie outside the scope or standards of nursing practice for a particular geographic region. However, it is appropriate for these diagnoses to remain visible in the classification, because the classification represents clinical judgments made by nurses around the world, not just those made in one region or country. Every nurse should be aware of, and work within, the standards and scope of practice and any laws or regulations within which he/she is licensed to practice. However, it is also important for all nurses to be aware of the areas of nursing practice that exist globally, as this informs discussion and may over time support the broadening of nursing practice across other countries. Conversely, these individuals may be able to provide evidence that would support the removal of diagnoses from the current classification, which, if they were not shown in their translations, would be unlikely to occur.

That said, it is important that you are not avoiding the use of a diagnosis because, in the opinion of one local expert or published textbook, it is not appropriate. I have met nurse authors who indicate that operating room nurses "cannot diagnose because they don't assess", or that intensive care unit nurses "have to practice under strict physician protocol that doesn't include
nursing diagnosis". Neither of these statements is factual, but rather represents the personal opinions of those nurses. It is, therefore, important to truly educate oneself on regulation, law, and professional standards of practice in one's own country and area of practice, rather than relying on the word of one person, or group of people, who may be inaccurately defining or describing nursing diagnosis.

Ultimately, nurses must identify those diagnoses that are appropriate for their area of practice, that fit within their scope of practice or legal regulations, and for which they have competency. Nurse educators, clinical experts, and nurse administrators are critical to ensuring that nurses are aware of diagnoses that are truly outside the scope of nursing practice in a certain geographic region. Multiple textbooks in many languages are available that include the entire NANDA-I terminology, so for the NANDA-I text to remove diagnoses from country to country would no doubt lead to a great level of confusion worldwide. Publication of the classification in no way requires that a nurse utilize every diagnosis within it, nor does it justify practicing outside the scope of an individual's nursing license or regulations to practice.

}

\subsection*{3.1 Research Priorities}

As noted previously, one of the major priorities for the upcoming cycle is the revision or retirement of the 41 diagnoses that were not revised for this $12^{\text {th }}$ edition. Secondly, we encourage clinical validation studies of diagnoses, with large sample sizes and preferably across sites and patient population. Many studies are conducted with patient populations who have a particular medical diagnosis (associated condition), for example the study by Ferreira et al. (2020) on sexual dysfunction (00059) in patients with breast cancer. In other cases, validation studies occur in at-risk populations, such as impaired walking (00088) in the elderly (Marques-Vieria et al., 2018). While these studies are helpful for those working in specialty areas, they do not provide the breadth of understanding of a diagnosis that could occur if an approach looked at all patients admitted to hospital, or receiving in-home care, or being seen in an ambulatory clinic, for example. It is likely that there are core clinical indicators that cross all patients, in addition to those that may only occur within specific patient populations.

Further research is critical that provides information on which assessment indicators are most predictive of a patient developing a condition which is represented by a nursing diagnosis. This will allow us to narrow the list of clinical indicators, or separate the lists into critical defining characteristics (DCs), or those that must be present to make a diagnosis, and supportive DCs. Likewise, there has been little focus on related risk factors for nursing diagnoses in research studies, yet it is the related factors that should primarily drive intervention. Thus, we strongly support studies which provide nurses with information on which related factors are most critical for diagnoses, so that intervention studies can be undertaken to remove or minimize the effects of the causes of diagnoses, or risk factors for a diagnosis.

Since at-risk populations and associated conditions are supportive information for diagnostic reasoning, but not core elements of a diagnosis, research focusing solely on these elements is not encouraged.

\subsection*{3.2 Refinement and Diagnoses to be Developed}

The evolution of our scientific language is an ongoing process; there is no end point at which the terminology will be complete. Rather, there will be continuous revisions and additions to the terminology, along with retirements from it, as knowledge evolves. Some of these evolutions are more editorial in nature, such as developing a specific schema for definitions and phrases of diagnostic indicator terms. Others are more complex and require extensive discussions and research to better position the NANDA-I terminology to be the strongest, most evidence-based, standardized nursing diagnosis language. The following issues represent some of the critical issues to which we hope to draw researchers' immediate attention.

Symptoms or nursing diagnoses? The NANDA-I nursing diagnoses are concepts constructed by means of a multi-axial system; however, some of the current diagnosis labels do not meet the specification of this model. Some labels are constructed with just one term from axis 1 (the focus of diagnosis), and are often considered symptoms: for example, constipation (00011), insomnia (00095), wandering (00154), hopelessness (00124), fear (00148), and hyperthermia (00007). Although some others are constructed with two terms, one from axis 1 and another from axis 6 (time), they also can be symptoms: for example, acute confusion (00128), chronic sorrow (00137), and acute pain (00132). None of these diagnosis labels have explicit terms from axis 3 (judgment), which are supposed to be included in the focus of diagnosis. What exactly do nurses assess, and what is their judgment about these symptoms? Is it the presence, severity, or self-management of the symptom, for example?

There is another issue with these diagnosis labels. Currently, anxiety (00146) and fatigue (00093) are classified as diagnoses within the NANDA-I nursing diagnosis classification. However, these terms are also found as defining characteristics of many other nursing diagnoses. It is difficult to comprehend that they can be both nursing diagnoses and defining characteristics. This is confusing for many users, so we often hear: "Am I supposed to diagnose anxiety itself, or should I consider anxiety as a defining characteristic of other nursing diagnoses?" "I think my patient's problems are fatigue and ineffective coping (00069). Should I document both diagnoses, or just ineffective coping, since it includes fatigue within its defining characteristics?"

We recommend a review of these issues to determine whether symptoms should belong within the current NANDA-I nursing diagnosis classification. We may need to create a secondary classification of symptoms, or we may need to remove them from the classification altogether because these
symptoms do not fit within the multiaxial structure. Recently, the concepts of "symptom control" and "symptom self-management" are receiving a great deal of attention in the nursing literature. We may need to reconceptualize symptom diagnoses within the NANDA-I classification to reflect the most recent evidence. For example, rather than simply naming the symptom of nausea (00134), a clinically useful diagnosis label may be "ineffective nausea control" and/or "ineffective nausea self-management". Likewise, rather than the symptom diagnosis of chronic pain (00133), "ineffective chronic pain control" and/or "ineffective chronic pain self-management" may be more clinically useful. However, it is important that these diagnosis labels represent the patient's human responses, and not indicate a nursing care issue.

Appropriate level of diagnosis granularity. Another frequent topic of discussion is what level of granularity should be used for nursing diagnoses in the terminology. Should the diagnoses be broad (abstract), specific (concrete), or both? For example, there are two problem-focused diagnoses that address issues with body weight: overweight (00233) and obesity (00232). These are specifically diagnosed based on body mass index (BMI). However, there is no broader diagnosis that would address the continuum of body weight management, such as ineffective weight control or ineffective weight self-management. Another example is three diagnoses focusing issues on eating (feeding) dynamics: ineffective adolescent eating dynamics (00269), ineffective child eating dynamics (00270), and ineffective infant feeding dynamics (00271). These are three specific diagnoses based on the age/developmental stage of the subject. However, there is no broader diagnosis that would address the problem of eating dynamics across all age groups, such as ineffective eating dynamics.

The current NANDA-I classification includes nursing diagnoses with various level of granularity. For example, the diagnosis, impaired tissue integrity (00044) is broader than impaired skin integrity (00046) and impaired oral mucous membrane integrity (00045). Some nurses would argue that impaired tissue integrity is all that is required, because problems related to skin and mucous membranes could all be treated using this diagnosis; other nurses prefer the more specific diagnoses. In general, however, more granular, or more specific diagnoses may better direct precise patient care.

Having both broad and specific nursing diagnoses will help us to develop a taxonomy which is more organized and hierarchical. Moreover, our classification of nursing diagnoses, with various level of granularity, may support nurses' clinical reasoning by guiding the categorization of clinical data from the abstract to more concrete. For example, when assessing a patient who is
complaining of incontinence, you may first consider a broad, or more general diagnosis such as, impaired urinary elimination (00085). Then, upon further assessment and/or reflection, you may be able to narrow down the focus to a more specific diagnosis, urge urinary incontinence (00238).

We are not opposed to developing granular diagnoses, because these can direct specific nursing care. However, there is a great need to determine what level of granularity would be considered sufficient. Is there a level of granularity that might be considered too specific? For example, do we really want to have a diagnosis, impaired left thumb mobility?

What is needed to improve translation? The issue of granularity is also important in translation, in the understanding of the focus of the diagnosis in different languages, and in the applicability of diagnoses in clinical practice internationally. An example of this might be the diagnosis, risk for falls (00155). A person can fall down the stairs, fall out of bed, or fall down while walking across the room. However, in the original English language, there is just one term - fall - that is used to express any unintended drop from higher surfaces to lower ones, or from a standing position to a lower position on the same surface. In some languages, these are different concepts, and the terms used are therefore different. As a result, nurses take different precautions for each type of fall, and report on these incidents separately. It might even be considered dangerous to combine two different nursing problems into a single nursing diagnosis. It may be necessary to consider that some languages would be better served to have different nursing diagnoses to address those phenomena which cannot accurately be translated as one term from the original English language.

In this edition, the diagnosis label, activity intolerance (00092) has been revised to decreased activity tolerance (00298). This revision was based on the discussion regarding axes, especially axis 1 (the focus of the diagnosis) and axis 3 (judgment). It has been previously explained that the focus of activity intolerance is activity tolerance, and the diagnosis label contained the judgment "in-". The English, the prefix "in-" generally means "not" or "impossible". However, simply negating the human response of "activity tolerance" does not make sense as a diagnosis label, and it has proven to be difficult to translate this term in some languages. Therefore, the definition was carefully examined, and the judgment term reflected in that definition was determined to be "decreased". This modification will facilitate accurate translation as well as the consistent use of diagnosis labels internationally. Similarly, there are some other diagnosis labels to be considered: for example, imbalanced
nutrition: less than body requirements (00002) and sexual dysfunction (00059) also cause difficulties with translation.

Does the focus of the diagnosis capture the appropriate human response? The focus of a diagnosis (axis 1) describes the human response that is the core of the diagnosis. However, a careful examination of axis 1 of diagnosis labels in the NANDA-I classification revealed questionable labels: deficient knowledge (00126) and readiness for enhanced knowledge (00161). The focus of these diagnoses is obviously "knowledge". However, does knowledge reflect a human response?

The National Library of Medicine's MeSH database defines knowledge as "the body of truths or facts accumulated in the course of time, the cumulated sum of information, its volume and nature, in any civilization, period, or country". The term, knowledge, therefore, does not contain a human response to internal or external stimulus. In some languages, a literal translation of readiness for enhanced knowledge did not make sense, so a local term which means "acquisition" has been added after the term "knowledge". It is possible that, in the original English, the focus of the diagnosis could also be changed to knowledge acquisition, knowledge attainment, or knowledge acquirement.

At the same time, the judgment term should probably be revised from "deficit" to, for example, "impaired" or "insufficient". Thus, we might have a diagnosis label, insufficient knowledge attainment, or impaired knowledge acquisition. Although this term might seem awkward in everyday vernacular in English, and in other languages as well, it is important to remember that we need labels that truly reflect human responses, and that adhere to a multiaxial structure. In practice, nurses may talk about a patient's misunderstanding or lack of knowledge of a patient when speaking with one another or with other health professionals, but the term in the patient record may be different (for example, deficient knowledge, 00126). This is true in medicine, as well, when we talk with patients about their "heart attack", but chart the term, acute myocardial infarction.

Is NANDA-I taxonomy user-friendly? Six new nursing diagnoses appear in this edition of the classification that incorporate a term, "self-management" in the focus of the diagnosis (axis 1). We spent a considerable time discussing where - in which domain - each of these diagnoses should be classified. The problem is that the human response of these diagnoses is not only self-management, but it is combined with specific terms that describe the target of self-management: health, lymphedema, and dry eye. Everyone will agree that health self-management is definitely a human response in Domain 1 (health
promotion). However, where would you look to find lymphedema self-management or dry eye self-management? Nurses previously have addressed patients' responses related to lymphedema with the diagnosis, ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion (00204), which is found within Domain 4 (activity/ rest). Another diagnosis focusing on dry eye, risk for dry eye (00219) has been slotted in Domain 11 (safety/protection) since 2012.

Although definitions of all of these new self-management diagnoses are similar to the definition of Domain 1-Class 2 (health management), we ultimately decided to classify each diagnosis based on user-friendliness. For example, would a nurse think to look in two different domains for a diagnosis to be used with patients having lymphedema? As a result, you will find the lymphedema self-management diagnosis in Domain 4, and the dry eye selfmanagement diagnosis in Domain 11. The domain and class of these diagnoses may change in the future, depending on the advancement of the taxonomic structure, as well as possible changes in our perspectives. However, our goal was to ensure that diagnoses were classified within the taxonomic structure in a way that was clinically consistent.

In terms of clinical usability of the NANDA-I taxonomy, we will continue to examine its structure. Some nurses have struggled to locate diagnoses related to respiration, which are classified in three domains: Domain 3 (elimination and exchange), Domain 4 (activity/rest) and Domain 11 (safety/protection). Other nurses have had difficulty locating emotional response diagnoses, which are classified in three domains: Domain 6 (self-perception), Domain 9 (coping/stress tolerance), and Domain 12 (comfort). There are strong reasons for locating these diagnoses in different domains, when you review the definition of the diagnoses. However, it is critical that the taxonomy provides a structure that makes sense to those who are using it. Even if a perfect taxonomy is not possible, we should strive for it.

We are always faced with new challenges, new knowledge, and new ways of thinking about the human responses that nurses diagnose. We look forward to receiving your feedback and research findings on these and other issues for the further improvement of the NANDA-I terminology.

\subsection*{4.1 Introduction}

This chapter aims to present the new criteria for the evidence levels of validity of the NANDA International (NANDA-I) diagnoses, and how they should be used in the process of submitting new diagnoses. The text was organized starting with presentation and a brief discussion of the concepts of clinical evidence and validity theory, then describing and exemplifying the levels of evidence for nursing diagnoses.

The level of evidence (LOE) used in this edition does not reflect these new changes. Work is underway to convert all LOEs for current diagnoses, and this will be available in the $14{ }^{\text {th }}$ edition. However, we do require all submitters of new diagnoses to refer to these updated LOE criteria.

This section will be primarily of interest to researchers, graduate students, and others who are contemplating development of a new nursing diagnosis, or revision to improve the level of evidence of an existing diagnosis.
"Evidence" is a term that is difficult to define and has generated numerous debates in the health area (Pearson et al., 2005; Miller \& Fredericks, 2003). In
of interventions, presenting a central role for evidence-based practice which seeks to define the best option between different treatments. This notion has been expanded and organizations that are dedicated to the development of
contexts (Pearson et al., 2007); or evidence of the accuracy of a particular diagnostic test (Pearson et al., 2005).

Evidence is a continuous phenomenon and is organized in hierarchies according to its robustness. This means that regardless of the type of evidence, it can be weaker or stronger. Very strong evidence would be a fact - or a set of facts - that, beyond any suspicion, confirms a statement. When it is said that evidence is very weak, it is because it is acknowledged that new facts may arise that contradict the fact that we have today. Several scholars and organizations have endeavored to create criteria to define hierarchies of evidence in health
to assist professionals in making decisions in their practices, including the topic of interventions, among others (Merlin et al., 2009).

NANDA-I is the only association concerned with the criteria for the degrees of evidence of diagnostic validity, in this case, nursing diagnoses. In no other area that uses diagnostic language standardization do criteria exist for the degrees of evidence of their validity. As you will see later, the hierarchy of evidence for the validity of NANDA-I diagnoses is guided by criteria relating to the types of studies that generated them. But before that, it is necessary to relate "clinical evidence" and "theory of validity", since we are dealing with degrees of evidence of validity of nursing diagnoses.

\subsection*{4.2 Relationship Between Clinical Evidence and Validity Theory}

The theory of validity has its origin in the development of instruments for assessing cognitive performance and skills, particularly aimed at the selection of candidates for public office or European and North American universities in the mid-19th century (Gregory, 2010). The first definitions of validity try to represent it as the characteristic of an instrument, meaning that it measures what it proposes to measure. If we transpose this definition to a nursing diagnosis, we would identify that a valid nursing diagnosis would be one whose defining characteristics measure the diagnosis that it is supposed to represent. For example, the acute pain (00132) diagnosis would not be valid in itself; what would be valid would be the set of defining characteristics that supposedly "measure" acute pain, regardless of the clinical context, population, environment, or the subject evaluated.

You might believe that such a definition seems obvious and relatively simple. And indeed it is! However, the simplicity of this initial definition has raised some doubts over time. How does one prove the measurement capacity of an instrument? If an instrument was proven to measure a phenomenon in a specific population, could it be used to measure the same phenomenon in another population if it is clinically distinct from the first? If the evaluation itself is developed to draw a conclusion based on the presence/absence of a phenomenon, is the instrument itself, or the interpretation that is obtained from it, considered to be valid?

To better understand, let's rewrite these same questions in context for nursing diagnoses: how do we prove that the defining characteristics represent a nursing diagnosis, if most human responses are not subject to direct observation (that is, there is no gold standard for most nursing diagnoses)? If a set
of defining characteristics were proven to represent a nursing diagnosis in a specific population (for example, hopelessness, 00124, among adolescents), would they represent the same diagnosis in another population that is clinically distinct from the first (such as, hopelessness among adult cancer patients)? If the assessment itself is developed to conclude with a finding of the presence/absence of a nursing diagnosis, is the set of defining characteristics or the interpretation that is obtained from them (the diagnosis itself) considered to be valid?

These questions led to reformulations of the concept of validity, as well as of the methods that have been developed to identify such a concept, which are commonly called validation. After decades of discussions and developments, the concept of validity among scholars in the fields of psychology and education has evolved, and led to the understanding of validity as the degree to which accumulated evidence and theory support the specific interpretation of test scores (understood as an instrument of evaluation of a psychological attribute) for a given use of this test (American Educational Research Association; American Psychological Association; National Council on Measurement in Education, 2014).

Transporting this definition to the context of nursing diagnoses, we can assume that the validity of a diagnosis is the degree to which evidence and theory support that it (the diagnosis) is the appropriate interpretation, for a given clinical use, of a given set of manifestations (understood as the defining characteristics of the diagnosis). From this definition it can be extrapolated that the validity of a diagnosis: a) can be presented at several levels (degrees); b) depends on the available evidence; c) depends on the underlying theory; d) is a property of the diagnosis and not of its components (the diagnosis is valid, not its characteristics); and, e) depends on the intended clinical use. The process of generating evidence of the validity of a nursing diagnosis is continuous, cumulative, and involves several interrelated steps. These range from the statement of a label, a term or expression to designate a more or less clear idea of a human response pertinent to nursing, to the collection of empirical data that "the observations selected to represent or indicate a concept in fact do so. Assessment of the validity of an operationalization is an ongoing process that requires empirical investigation" (Waltz et al., 2017, p .54).

\subsection*{4.3 Evidence Levels of Validity for NANDA-I Diagnoses}

As we have seen, the validity of a diagnosis is directly related to the evidence of such validity. Evidence of validity of a diagnosis can have different levels,
depending on the methodology used to generate them and the clinical context in which the diagnosis will be used; that is, the validity of a diagnosis depends on a continuous investigation process that allows for expansion of its use for different populations as clinical evidence accumulates. In the NANDA-I terminology, the level of evidence of a diagnosis has been related to the strength of the evidence that supports its development or validation (Herdman \& Kamitsuru, 2018). It is, therefore, evidence of validity. In this review, the evidence level of validity of a diagnosis refers to the degree to which accumulated evidence and theory support the interpretation of the human response, represented by the diagnostic label, is the correct interpretation of the set of attributes (defining characteristics, related factors, risk factors, associated conditions, and at-risk populations) for established clinical purposes (i.e., for the context and/or population from which the respective evidence was extracted). Thus, NANDA-I revised its structure of evidence levels of validity of its diagnoses in order to better reflect the state of science related to evi-dence-based practice, associating them with the types of studies capable of producing results compatible with the interpretations and their expected uses.

This new classification of the evidence level of validity for nursing diagnoses in NANDA-I is organized into two major levels: Level 1 represents the initial stages of development that precede the inclusion of the diagnosis in the terminology, and Level 2 refers to the various stages of clinical development of the diagnosis, according to the strength of the best available evidence, including those produced by expert opinion studies or with populations susceptible to it. Each level consists of sub-levels structured according to the study methods. A diagnosis will have higher levels of evidence the more robust the evidence is, according to the type of research that produced it, from studies of operationalization of concepts, culminating in high quality systematic reviews.

Evidence levels of diagnostic validity are used by the NANDA-I Diagnostic Development Committee (DDC) to make decisions about including new diagnoses in the terminology. Level 1 is assigned to diagnoses that are presented to the DDC to be included in the terminology. This first level deals with the presentation of the initial diagnosis structure to the DDC until the presentation of a theoretical review that proves the structural and conceptual consistency of the diagnostic proposal. After reaching a level of evidence of 1.3., the proposal is recommended for the development of theoretical and clinical studies, starting with conceptual validation, then moving on to content validation by experts and by qualitative analysis of the population supposedly exposed to the diagnosis. Level 2 includes gradually more robust methods of validation, strongly based on epidemiological approaches that aim to establish the
accuracy of clinical indicators, the capacity for diagnostic screening, the potential for prognosis, the ability to differentiate between groups of diagnoses with similar concepts, relationships of causality (including causal interrelationships that can determine diagnostic syndromes), systematic reviews that make it possible to establish relationships between diagnostic components in multiple populations or multiple studies in similar populations, and studies of etiological factors based on case-control and/or cohort approaches. The interpretation of the evidence levels of the diagnoses will always be relative and gradual, that is, higher sub-levels in the classification indicate diagnoses with more robust evidence than diagnoses in lower sub-levels. A summary of the evidence levels of nursing diagnoses can be seen in $\triangleright$ Table 4.1.

\subsection*{4.3.1 Level 1. Proposal Received by the DDC for Development}

If the reader identifies a human response that is not found within NANDA-I's terminology, the first step will be to develop a diagnostic proposal comprising a label, a definition, possible components (defining characteristics/related or risk factors/associated conditions/at-risk population), and the relationship of the alleged diagnosis with possible nursing interventions and outcomes. The diagnostic development processes in this first level include direct monitoring by the DDC and execution by the submitter. Level 1 is divided into three sublevels. The diagnostic proposal can present a structure resulting from the three levels to the DDC, sequentially, or it can consider two or even three sub-levels concurrently.

Level 1.1. Label only. The first task will be to develop a title (label) using the multiaxial system that represents a human response which could be identified as a nursing diagnosis. The level of evidence criterion is defined by a diagnostic label that is considered clear and is supported by a previously conducted literature review, and presented in a report format. The DDC will consult with the submitter, and provide guidance related to diagnostic development through guidelines, written consultation, and workshops. At this stage, the label is categorized as "Received for Development", and identified as such on the NANDA-I website.

Level 1.2. Label and definition. This level of evidence criterion is defined by the presentation of the diagnostic label and a clear and distinct definition from other NANDA-I diagnoses and definitions. The definition should differ from the defining characteristics, and the label and its components should not be included in the definition. A diagnosis must be consistent with the current NANDA-I definition of nursing diagnoses; that is, its proposal must represent

a human response for which the nurse can implement independent nursing interventions. The label and definition must be based on a literature review, which must be presented and evaluated by the DDC. At this stage, the label and its definition are categorized as "Received for Development", and identified as such on the NANDA-I website.

Level 1.3. Diagnostic components, and relationship with outcomes and interventions. A proposal at this level should include the label, definition, and other components of the diagnosis (defining characteristics, related/risk factors, and, when applicable, associated conditions, at risk populations), presented with the references obtained from a literature review. Although proposals at this level are not yet part of the terminology, they should support the discussion of the concept, the assessment of its clinical usefulness and applicability, and its validation through robust research methods. In addition, the proponent will be required to present the relationship of the diagnosis under development with interventions and outcomes as represented in other standardized terminologies (e.g., the Nursing Outcomes and Nursing Interventions Classifications). At this stage, the diagnostic proposal is categorized as "Received for clinical development and validation", and identified as such on the NANDA-I website and in a separate section of the book with the current terminology. It is worth mentioning that the submitter will be able to present a proposal beginning at level 1.3., without having to go sequentially through levels 1.1. and 1.2.

\subsection*{4.3.2 Level 2. Inclusion in Terminology and Clinical Testing}

A new diagnosis is included in the NANDA-I terminology when evidence of second-level validity is generated. This level is subdivided into three sublevels: 2.1. Conceptual validity; 2.2. Content validity; and 2.3. Clinical validity. To include a new diagnosis in the classification, the submitter must identify or develop theoretical studies that allow the construction of evidence of validity of at least the first sub-level, that is, conceptual validity. However, maintaining the diagnosis in the classification will depend on the continuity of studies that allow for the identification of evidence of validity of the third sub-level, that is, clinical validity. Note that each of these sub-levels has other subdivisions that will be characterized and exemplified below.

Level 2.1. Conceptual validity. Conceptual validity refers to the development of a conceptual framework and/or substantive theory that should support the interpretations obtained from the constituent elements of the nursing diagnosis. In the first sub-level, the elements initially developed are subjected to a concept analysis to demonstrate the existence of a body of knowledge underlying the diagnosis. Conceptual analysis provides support for the label and definition, includes a discussion and supports the defining characteristics and related factors (problem-focused diagnoses), risk factors (risk diagnoses), or defining characteristics (health promotion diagnoses). The components known as associated conditions and at-risk populations may be included in this
discussion, if applicable. This level should allow the construction of a substantive theory that, in addition to identifying the components of the diagnosis, leads to an understanding of the clinical and/or psychosocial relationships that underlie the diagnosis. This sub-level has three subdivisions, which are explained below.

Level 2.1.1. Conceptual validity of the elements. In this first level are diagnoses whose level of evidence criterion refers to the development of a concept analysis. This analysis can be developed for three purposes:
1. To explain the scope of the diagnosis, including identifying the appropriate domain and class, and the subject of the diagnosis (individual, caregiver, group, family, community). These studies could include those which develop the analysis within a group of patients who all experience the same clinical condition (associated condition), such as an analysis of impaired coping in patients with breast cancer, for example.
2. To clarify the definition of the diagnosis (and its components), the clinical indicators that will constitute the defining characteristics, and the etiological factors that will compose the set of related/risk factors, and any relevant associated conditions/at-risk populations.
3. To differentiate the diagnosis from others existing in the taxonomy, identifying components that establish its clinical limits in relation to the others, characterizing it as a specific phenomenon. In the case of a syndrome diagnosis, the conceptual analysis should describe the relationships between the components of the diagnostic syndrome, differentiating it from clinical situations that represent only the individual diagnostic components.

The study by Cabaço et al. (2018) is an example of a concept analysis based on the evolutionary method, in which the authors present the structural elements for the development of three nursing diagnoses related to spiritual coping. Its analysis was developed from a literature review of qualitative studies and allowed the development of potential diagnoses, spiritual coping, risk for impaired spiritual coping, and readiness for enhanced spiritual coping.

Level 2.1.2. Theoretical-causal validity. In this second level, the submitter should identify or develop, as a criterion for the level of evidence, a broad theoretical study with the objective of establishing hypotheses for the clinical and causal relationships that justify the components (defining characteristics, related/risk factors, and when indicated, associated conditions/at-risk populations) that make up the diagnosis. The preferred approach for this purpose is the development of middle-range theories, which represent theories composed
of a limited number of concepts and which are aimed at describing, explaining, or predicting clinical practice situations (Lopes, Silva \& Herdman, 2017). An example of the application of this approach is the study by Lemos et al. (2020) which presents a middle-range theory based on an integrative literature review for the nursing diagnosis, dysfunctional ventilatory weaning response (00034), including the main concepts, pictorial diagrams, propositions, and causal relationships for use in clinical practice. In this study, the authors identified 13 clinical antecedent and 21 consequent results related to this nursing diagnosis that occurs when ventilatory weaning fails.

Level 2.1.3. Terminological validity. Terminological validity refers to the adequacy of interpretations obtained from health records of terms that are supposed to represent components of a nursing diagnosis. The level of evidence includes diagnoses submitted to validation processes based on secondary data, for the identification of diagnostic components and/or the diagnostic prevalence. Terminological validity of the diagnosis is verified from the documentation of components (defining characteristics, related/risk factors) in health records. These studies must be based on large samples of health records that allow sufficient data to be obtained to identify the diagnostic components. An important requirement with these studies is verification of the adequacy, precision, and accuracy of the records used. An example of this type of study can be found in the article by Ferreira et al. (2016), who cross-mapped 832 terms found in 256 health records with 52 NANDA-I diagnosis labels in an intensive care unit. It is important to note that terminological validity depends on the description of tools used to verify the quality of the information obtained. Simply having recorded terms in the health record does not guarantee that the interpretations obtained from them are valid.

Level 2.2. Diagnostic content validity. The criteria in any one of the previous levels (2.1.1., 2.1.2., 2.1.3.) must be fulfilled so that the submitter's proposal raises the evidence of validity of the diagnosis to a level of evidence of 2.2. The criterion for this level of evidence is a content analysis study by a group of experts with knowledge about the focus of the diagnosis. Content validity refers to how representative diagnostic components, identified at the previous level, are of the clinical content domain of the diagnosis. This level of evidence has four subdivisions, organized according to the sample size of experts and their respective level of expertise. Content validation is more strongly related to level of expertise than to the sample size of experts. In addition, it is important to consider the inclusion of both experts with clinical experience and researchers on the subject of diagnosis, in order to consider
clinical experience and broader theoretical reflections on the diagnosis. A diagnosis is classified in the terminology based on the most advanced level achieved, according to evaluation led by the DDC and Research Directors. An example of a diagnostic content validation study is the article by Zeleníková, Žiaková, Čáp, \& Jarošová (2014), who validated the nursing diagnosis, acute pain (00132), with Czech and Slovakian nurses, using the Fehring model. A total of 17 defining characteristics were validated.

Level 2.2.1. Initial validity of diagnostic content. Diagnoses whose validation process was developed with a small number of experts, with a predominantly beginner/advanced beginner profile, are found in this level. Group evaluation techniques are used at this level, such as the Delphi technique. The analysis follows a more qualitative approach and tends to confirm the structure built at sub-level 2.1. In addition, validation processes with these characteristics allow for verification of how comprehensive the diagnostic structure is for beginners, in order to glimpse its clarity and possible usefulness in clinical practice. Diagnoses at this level have moderate potential for content validity. A description of the use of the Delphi technique for content validation processes in nursing diagnoses can be found in the article by Grant \& Kinney (1992). An example of this type of study can be found in the study by Melo et al. (2011), who used the Delphi technique with 25 experts in three rounds. In this study, the experts identified eight factors that represented a higher risk for the development of the diagnosis, decreased cardiac output (00270).

Level 2.2.2. Potential validity of diagnostic content. The validation process at this level is developed with a large sample of experts who have a beginner/advanced beginner expertise profile. The research will generally include descriptive and inferential statistical analysis, with the possibility of verifying the adequacy of the diagnosis for use by nurses with little clinical experience. When evaluating diagnoses using this type of studies, the expert sample size must be sufficient to allow for the generalization of opinions. Often these opinions will be obtained from questionnaires, and their statistical analysis will include content validity indexes, proportions tests, and agreement coefficients, among other statistical measures. The previously mentioned study by Paloma-Castro et al. (2014) is an example, although their sample probably included experts with different levels of expertise. The data available in the article did not allow for the identification of the experts' level of expertise who participated in the study.

Level 2.2.3. Advanced validity of diagnostic content. This level requires analyses by participants with a high level of expertise. Most studies base their analysis of expertise on academic criteria, and often a critical analysis of the level of expertise is absent, making it difficult to identify these studies. The validation process is developed with a small number of individuals with predominantly proficient/expert levels of expertise. Diagnoses in this sub-level undergo a qualitative assessment by a group with greater knowledge and experience. The evaluation of these experts should be sufficient to confirm the relevance, adequacy, and clarity of the elements that make up the diagnosis.

Level 2.2.4. Consolidated validity of diagnostic content. The characteristic that differentiates this level from the previous one is the large sample of experts with predominantly proficient/expert levels of expertise. In addition to the difficulty of obtaining a sample of adequate size and quality, data analysis includes content validity indexes, tests of proportions, coefficients of agreement, and analysis of the internal consistency of the experts' assessments. The process can become more complex if the methods used include revisions of the structure, based on suggestions made by the experts. This is the most important subdivision of diagnostic content validation, and also the most difficult. Suggestions for strengthening this process include: obtain a larger sample than may be deemed initially necessary, use objective instruments, use electronic means of contact and data collection, seek experts in different countries, and organize a research schedule that takes into account a longer data collection period.

Level 2.3. Clinical validity. This is the highest and most desirable level for a diagnosis to remain in the classification. A content validation study must be completed prior to a clinical validity study. Prior to clinical validation, it should be established that the diagnosis has undergone content validation: is it classified as level 2.2.? This level has the largest number of subdivisions, and these are tied to the use of the diagnosis in clinical practice. The levels of evidence correspond to the type of clinical inference to be obtained from its clinical components, which may include the period beginning with the establishment of a clinical construct through to the development of causal processes. For better organization, this sublevel is divided into three blocks according to the purposes of the clinical validation process.

The first block includes the first two subdivisions (2.3.1. and 2.3.2.) and refers to descriptive studies that attempt to obtain initial profiles of the diagnostic components in populations that have supposedly experienced the phenomena; thus, this block represents evidence of clinical validity whose
purpose is to identify in which populations a diagnosis may be applicable in practice. The second block includes the subsequent five sub-levels (2.3.3., 2.3.4., 2.3.5., 2.3.6. and 2.3.7.) and refers to validation processes that focus on the utility of defining characteristics for different clinical purposes, including diagnostic inference itself, screening capacity, prognosis establishment, differentiation capacity, and generalization across multiple populations. The third block includes the last three subdivisions (2.3.8. to 2.3.10.) and refers to validation processes that seek to identify related/risk factors, at-risk populations, and associated conditions. The studies developed to reach the levels of evidence in this last block have the purpose of producing evidence regarding the factors that contribute to the occurrence of the nursing diagnosis.

The sublevels were organized considering that defining characteristics represent the main elements for the determination of a nursing diagnosis, and its validity for a specific purpose. Related factors, in turn, are causal elements that can only be identified if there is a certain degree of accuracy in the diagnostic inference process, which is based on defining characteristics. Thus, processes of clinical validation involving related factors (and other causal components) can only be properly designed and conducted for diagnoses with confirmed lower-level validity.

Level 2.3.1. Qualitative validity. Qualitative validity refers to the degree to which diagnostic interpretation is supported by clinical elements captured from individual subjective experiences. In this level, the level of evidence criterion relies on the development of qualitative studies to delimit the phenomenon based on the perception of those individuals believed to be experiencing it. These diagnoses must have been evaluated by a small group of subjects who possibly present with the diagnosis, in order to obtain information about the perception, beliefs, attitudes, and nuances of these individuals that can influence/characterize the phenomenon. Typically, intentional or convenience samples are used, and qualitative approaches are used for analysis. The study by Pinto et al. (2017) is an example of qualitative validation, in which the authors used interpretive content analysis to derive diagnoses related to patient comfort in palliative care. The authors derived 17 different diagnoses from the reported experiences of 15 patients from clinical-surgical units in a hospital in Portugal.

Level 2.3.2. Demographic validity. This is the last subdivision of the first block, and represents the degree to which demographic characteristics of a population can influence the interpretations obtained from the diagnostic components. This is a type of validity that has a strong relationship with
causal components (related/risk factors, associated conditions, and at-risk populations). The evidence level criteria consist of validation studies based on cross-sectional studies to identify elements associated with nursing diagnoses (defining characteristics/related/risk factors). These studies must be developed with large samples of subjects believed to be presenting with the diagnosis, whose selection of subjects can occur consecutively (as patients are admitted, for example) or by a random sampling process. The diagnostic inference process is based on a small group of nurse diagnosticians with proven experience with the diagnosis, and/or who have received specific training to identify it.

Data analysis must include verification of the association between sociodemographic variables, defining characteristics, and factors related to the diagnostic inference performed. In addition, some multivariate analysis techniques, such as logistic regressions, can be used to establish sets of defining characteristics, hierarchical models of related/risk factors, or models of joint association of human responses (for diagnoses that represent syndromes). For example, the study by Oliveira et al. (2016) analyzed the association between related factors and the presence of sedentary lifestyle (00168), adjusted for gender among Brazilian adolescents, to verify possible differences in the genderinfluenced causality. The study included a total of 564 adolescents and identified four defining characteristics and six related factors strongly associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Some related factors showed differences by gender, being more strongly associated with men. In this case, the interpretations obtained from the defining characteristics identified among adolescents must be analyzed considering possible etiological differences by gender.

Level 2.3.3. Clinical construct validity. Unlike previous levels that focused on general exploratory approaches, this level is focused on specific components (defining characteristics) and represents the main category of evidence levels. Clinical construct validity is the degree to which a set of defining characteristics allows the correct interpretation (inference) of the nursing diagnosis from a defined clinical context. At this level, evidence level criteria include studies on the ability of defining characteristics to correctly classify subjects regarding the presence/absence of the diagnosis. Evidence of clinical construct validity should measure the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of each defining characteristic. It can also verify the importance of a group of defining characteristics and the influence of their clinical spectrum to modify the diagnostic inference.

The selection of patients included in these studies occurs in a naturalistic (consecutive) way, with a sufficient number of subjects to allow for the
calculation of diagnostic accuracy. In general, diagnostic inference can be obtained by a panel of nurse diagnosticians, or through latent variable models for direct calculation of diagnostic accuracy. The study by Mangueira \& Lopes (2016) is an example of this type of validation in which the authors evaluated 110 alcoholic patients and measured the diagnostic accuracy of 115 defining characteristics and, using four different latent class models, identified 24 characteristics with statistically significant measures of sensitivity or specificity for dysfunctional family processes (00063).

Clinical construct validity seeks defining characteristics that allow for a more accurate diagnostic inference, representing the nursing diagnosis in its most complete form. The subsequent levels of clinical validity (2.3.4., 2.3.5., and 2.3.6.) differ from clinical construct validity in that they represent more specific uses and interpretations. These studies include those that aim to establish
- specific defining characteristics for screening and rapid decision making,
- defining characteristics which enable differentiation from similar diagnoses,
- and defining characteristics representing clinical deterioration.

The first two levels are applicable to few nursing diagnoses, while the last can be applicable to all diagnoses, and rely on the development of longitudinal studies.

Level 2.3.4. Selective validity (clinical screening). Selective validity refers to the degree to which a minimum set of characteristics can be used in a heuristic manner for a minimally acceptable interpretation of the presence of a nursing diagnosis. This enables rapid decision making in clinical settings such as urgent and emergency situations. The level of evidence criteria include studies that establish conditioned probabilities among small groups of defining characteristics, allowing for a rapid interpretation for use in risk classification protocols or clinical screening scenarios.

It must be taken into account that a clinical construct validation must have been conducted so that, based on these data, a minimum set of defining characteristics can be identified for use in diagnostic screening and rapid clinical decision making. Data analysis techniques for this type of validation, include the use of algorithms for the construction of classification trees. However, this technique requires large samples that allow for the calculation of conditioned probabilities for a pre-established minimum number of defining characteristics that should compose a decision-making model. For these studies, panels
of nurse diagnosticians may be used for diagnostic inference, and the entire validation process of the classification tree must be reported.

The study by Chaves et al. (2018) is an example of the process used to establish this type of validity. The authors developed a classification tree for quick decision making for identifying ineffective airway clearance (00031) among children with acute respiratory infection. Its classification tree was based on comparing the results of three different algorithms in a sample of 249 children with acute respiratory infection. The best performing tree included the defining characteristics, ineffective cough and adventitious breath sounds, which were found to be suitable for screening children with ineffective airway clearance receiving care in the emergency department.

Level 2.3.5. Discriminant validity. Discriminant validity aims to determine the set of defining characteristics that allow for the differentiation between diagnoses that share similar signs and symptoms. This type of validity is defined as the degree to which a set of defining characteristics makes it possible to establish an interpretive boundary between diagnoses with similar clinical components. Thus, to consider investigating discriminant validity for two nursing diagnoses, both must have clinical construct validity: the level 2.3.3. criteria must be met. The level of evidence criteria may include studies with a different number of phases, ranging from a simultaneous concept analysis to an analysis with a population susceptible to the diagnoses to be differentiated. The samples must be large enough to calculate estimates, and the analysis is based on techniques such as multiple correspondence analysis or fuzzy sets (fuzzy logic).

An example of this type of validity can be found in the study by Pascoal et al. (2016a), who developed a discriminant validation study for the diagnoses, ineffective airway clearance (IAC, 00031), ineffective breathing pattern (IBP, 00032) and impaired gas exchange (IGE, 00030) among children with acute respiratory infection. The authors identified 27 defining characteristics that presented discriminating capacity among the three diagnoses.

Level 2.3.6. Prognostic validity. Prognostic validity refers to the degree to which a specific set of defining characteristics supports the interpretation of a patient's clinical deterioration, related to a nursing diagnosis in a specific context. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of lower survival/recovery rates of subjects with those defining characteristics. This criterion includes complex longitudinal studies whose objective is to identify a set of defining characteristics that allows for a prognostic assessment: to establish clinical signs that are markers of deterioration in the patient's clinical
status. In order to achieve this type of validity, the diagnosis must have clinical construct validity (the 2.3.3. criteria must have been fulfilled).

This validation process is based on diagnostic cohort studies, in which the occurrence of defining characteristics must be evaluated and recorded at various points during follow-up. The length of patient follow-up will depend on each diagnosis, especially if its clinical trajectory tends to be acute or chronic, which can take anywhere from days to years of follow-up to establish reliable prognostic markers. Samples are typically obtained consecutively and/or by referral of subjects believed to be experiencing the diagnosis. The analysis of this type of study includes specific statistical techniques, such as measures of relative risk, incidence coefficients, and survival rates. Additionally, statistical models based on multivariate methods are used, such as generalized estimation equations and Cox proportional hazards models.

An example of prognostic validity can be found in the study by Pascoal et al. (2016b), who prospectively analyzed defining characteristics of ineffective breathing pattern (00032) among children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection, to identify markers of clinical deterioration associated with the nursing diagnosis. The authors followed 136 children for a period of ten consecutive days and, after an analysis based on the Cox model extended to time dependent covariables, identified four defining characteristics that can be interpreted as indicative of a poor prognosis for IBP.

Level 2.3.7. Generalizable validity of defining characteristics. This level includes systematic reviews of defining characteristics, and aims to identify clinical signs and symptoms that allow for a generalized interpretation of the nursing diagnosis across populations. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of clinical construct validation studies of the same diagnosis in different populations, using similar methods and describing measures of diagnostic accuracy of the defining characteristics. Thus, the samples are composed of well-designed studies that meet the 2.3.3. clinical construct validity criteria. To confirm generalizable validity, the study should apply metaanalysis techniques to establish summary measures of sensitivity and specificity.

An example of this type of evidence is the article by Sousa, Lopes, \& Silva (2015), who completed a systematic review with meta-analysis to identify defining characteristics of ineffective airway clearance (00031) that presented better diagnostic accuracy in different clinical conditions. The study included a final sample of seven studies, five conducted with children and two with adults. The analysis was initially conducted for all seven studies, and later only
for studies developed for children. The authors concluded that eight characteristics were valid for a generalizable interpretation for IAC.

Level 2.3.8. Diagnosis-specific causal validity. Specific causal validity refers to the degree to which clinical evidence establishes interpretations of the causal relationships between multiple factors in one diagnosis. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of these factors in case-control studies or using other methods that attest to their relationship with the diagnosis. This level of clinical validity refers to studies that are developed to identify multiple risk/related factors for one diagnosis. The methods commonly used include well-designed case-control studies with sufficient samples sizes to determine the magnitude of the effect of potential causal factors, as well as identification of hierarchical structures and sufficient cause for multiple related / risk factors / associated conditions / at-risk populations.

The diagnostic inference for establishing subjects who will compose the case (with the nursing diagnosis) and control (without the nursing diagnosis) groups must be based on diagnostic accuracy measures established by clinical construct validity studies: level 2.3.3. criteria must be met.

This type of validity was used in the study by Medeiros et al. (2018), who completed a case-control study to identify pressure ulcer risk factors in adults in intensive care. The study was conducted with 180 patients ( 90 in each group). By using logistic regression analysis, the authors identified six risk factors for pressure ulcer (00249, revised to risk for pressure injury in this edition).

Level 2.3.9. Causal validity of exposure variable. The causal validity of exposure variable refers to the interpretation of a causal relationship between an etiological factor and a group of diagnoses. The level of evidence criterion is based on results obtained from cohort studies, or other methods that allow for demonstration of how such a factor can modify the interpretations (inferences) about a set of diagnoses. This type of validation allows for establishment of the importance of a related/risk factor for multiple diagnoses, using an exposure cohort design, which is based on two groups: one exposed and one not exposed to the risk/related factor. Such studies can also be useful for the establishment of causal chains, in which multiple diagnoses are clinically associated and have feedback loops, characterizing a syndrome diagnosis.

Samples should be sufficient to determine the magnitude of the risk associated with exposure to the factor, and to identify hierarchical structures that have multifactorial etiologies and/or causal chains. Finally, diagnoses believed to be caused by the same risk/related factor must be evaluated based on
evidence of validity of the clinical construct; each diagnosis to be analyzed must have met the level 2.3.3. criteria for validity. The study by Reis \& Jesus (2015) is an example of an exposure cohort to assess risk for falls (00155) among 271 institutionalized elderly.

Level 2.3.10. Generalized validity of related/risk factors. This type of validity refers to the degree to which the same set of etiological factors allows for the generation of a causal interpretation for different populations across multiple contexts. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of studies validating the etiological factors of the diagnosis in different populations, using similar methods, and describing measures of the effect size of these factors on the diagnosis. Thus, this level is similar to the generalizable validity of defining characteristics, but includes systematic reviews of related/ risk factors. These samples will include well-designed studies that meet the level 2.3.8. criteria, and meta-analysis techniques are used to establish summary measures of the effect size of related/risk factors on the nursing diagnosis. No examples for this type of validity were found, possibly because the number of studies on related/risk factors is still very small. However, it is important to emphasize that the definition of interventions will depend on the causal factor of the diagnosis. Studies on evidence of validity are encouraged.

\subsection*{4.3.3 Final Considerations}

These levels of evidence represent a hierarchy which depicts the degree to which observations identified as describing a diagnosis actually do describe it. The revision of the levels of evidence for the NANDA-I diagnoses should support clinicians in knowing the stage of development of the diagnoses, and their potential to represent the phenomena of the profession. In addition, this revision can help scholars to define their research, expanding the possibilities of practical application of their findings. Validation processes may accelerate the gradual development of accepted and proposed diagnoses, offering greater consistency to the terminology, in addition to improving the clinical decision making process.

In the next cycle of the terminology, work will be undertaken by the Directors of Research to reassign LOE for our diagnoses, using these new criteria.

\subsection*{5.1 Principles of Nursing Diagnosis: Introduction}

Health care is delivered by various types of health care professionals, including nurses, physicians, and physical therapists, to name just a few. This is true in hospitals as well as other settings across the continuum of care (e.g., clinics, homecare, long-term care, community centers, prisons, schools). Each health care discipline brings its unique body of knowledge to the care of the client. In fact, a unique body of knowledge is a critical characteristic of a profession.

Collaboration, and at times overlap, occurs between professionals in providing care ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 5.1). For example, a physician in a hospital setting may write an order for the client to walk twice per day. Physical therapists focus on core muscles and movements necessary for walking. Respiratory therapists may be involved if oxygen therapy is needed to enable the patient's activity tolerance, due to an underlying respiratory condition. Social workers may be involved with insurance coverage for necessary equipment. Nurses have a holistic view of the patient, including working with the patient on balance and muscle strength related to walking, breathing pattern and oxygenation to conserve energy during activity, teaching the patient how to use accessory devices to support walking, as well as supporting the patient's confidence and motivation.

\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig.5.1 Example of a collaborative health care team}
\end{figure}

Each health profession has a way to describe "what" the professional knows and "how" it acts on what it knows. This chapter is primarily focused on the "what". A profession may have a common language that is used to describe and code its knowledge. Physicians treat diseases and use the International Classification of Disease (ICD) taxonomy to represent and code the medical problems they treat. Psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals treat mental health disorders, and use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although nurses learn a lot about diagnoses contained in both the ICD and the DSM, it is important to remember that nurses independently diagnose and treat human responses to health problems and/or life processes, and use the NANDA International, Inc. (NANDA-I) nursing diagnosis classification. The nursing diagnosis taxonomy, the process of diagnosing, and the use of the NANDA-I terminology, will be described further.

The NANDA-I taxonomy provides a way to classify and categorize areas of concern to the nursing professional (i.e., diagnostic foci). It contains 267 nursing diagnoses grouped into 13 domains and 47 classes. A domain is a "sphere of knowledge" and the NANDA-I domains identify the unique knowledge of the nursing discipline ( $\triangleright$ Table 5.1). The 13 NANDA-I domains are further divided into classes (groupings that share common attributes). Urinary function, for example, is a class in the Elimination and exchange domain. Each of the classes contain relevant nursing diagnoses. Urinary retention (00023) is a nursing diagnosis in the class, Urinary function, within the domain of Elimination and exchange.

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 5.1 NANDA-I domains}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Domain & Name \\
\hline 1 & Health promotion \\
\hline 2 & Nutrition \\
\hline 3 & Elimination and exchange \\
\hline 4 & Activity/rest \\
\hline 5 & Perception/cognition \\
\hline 6 & Self-perception \\
\hline 7 & Role relationships \\
\hline 8 & Sexuality \\
\hline 9 & Coping/stress tolerance \\
\hline 10 & Life principles \\
\hline 11 & Safety/protection \\
\hline 12 & Comfort \\
\hline 13 & Growth/development \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Understanding the NANDA-I taxonomy helps the nurse identify and review diagnoses within the same class. For example, in the Comfort domain, in the Physical comfort class, a nurse will find nursing diagnoses related to pain, comfort, and nausea. A nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment concerning a human response to health conditions /life processes, or susceptibility to that response, by an individual, family, group or community. Each nursing diagnosis has a label, definition, and diagnostic indicators. Examples of nursing diagnosis labels include chronic pain (00133) and ineffective health selfmanagement (00276).

Nurses deal with responses to health conditions/life processes among individuals, families, groups, and communities. Such responses are the central concern of nursing care and fill the circle ascribed to nursing in $\triangleright$ Fig. 5.1. A nursing diagnosis can be focused on a problem, a potential risk, or a strength.
- Problem-focused diagnosis - a clinical judgment concerning an undesirable human response to a health condition/life process that exists in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community
- Risk diagnosis - a clinical judgment concerning the susceptibility of an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community for developing an undesirable human response to health conditions/life processes
- Health promotion diagnosis - a clinical judgment concerning motivation and desire to increase well-being and to actualize health potential. These responses are expressed by a readiness to enhance specific health behaviors, and can be used in any health state. In cases where individuals are unable to express their own readiness to enhance health behaviors, the nurse may determine that a condition for health promotion exists and then act on the client's behalf. Health promotion responses may exist in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community.

Although limited in number in the NANDA-I taxonomy, a syndrome can also be diagnosed by a nurse. A syndrome is a clinical judgment concerning a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses that occur together, and is therefore best addressed through similar interventions. An example of a syndrome diagnosis is chronic pain syndrome (00255). The nursing diagnosis, chronic pain (00133) is recurrent or persistent pain that has lasted at least 3 months and that significantly affects daily functioning or well-being. Chronic pain syndrome is differentiated from chronic pain in that, in addition to the chronic pain, it significantly impacts other human responses, and thus a syndrome includes other nursing diagnoses, such as disturbed sleep pattern (00198), fatigue (00093), impaired physical mobility (00085), or social isolation (00053).

\subsection*{5.2 Principles of Nursing Diagnosis: Diagnosing}

The nursing process requires nursing knowledge (theory/nursing science/ underlying nursing concepts) (Herdman, 2013), and includes assessing, diagnosing, planning outcome(s) and interventions, implementing, and evaluating ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 5.2). Nurses use assessment and clinical judgment to formulate hypotheses or explanations about presenting problems, risks, and/or health promotion opportunities. Application of the knowledge of underlying concepts of nursing science and nursing theory are required before patterns can be identified in clinical data or accurate diagnoses can be made.

The components of the nursing process occur more or less simultaneously in the nurse's thought processes. Note that the rectangles have the closest start line on the left and the most distant end line on the right. This asymmetry represents the time period after the beginning of data collection, when the nurse uses reasoning and clinical judgment to begin to identify diagnoses, set patient-specific outcomes, and decide on interventions. While completing these operations, the nurse can start implementing these decisions and evaluating their outcomes (Bachion, 2009).

\subsection*{5.3 Principles of Nursing Diagnosis: Knowledge of Nursing Concepts}

Knowledge of key concepts, or nursing diagnostic foci, is necessary before beginning an assessment. Examples of critical concepts important to nursing practice include breathing, elimination, thermoregulation, physical comfort, self-care, and skin integrity. Understanding such concepts allows the nurse to see patterns in the data and accurately diagnose. Key areas to understand within the concept of pain, for example, include manifestations of pain, theories of pain, at-risk populations, related pathophysiological concepts (fatigue, depression), and management of pain. Full understanding of key concepts is needed, as well, to differentiate diagnoses.

For example, to understand issues related to coping and stress tolerance that might be specific to an immigrant population, a nurse must first understand the core concepts related to potential problems, risks, or health promotion opportunities. In looking simply at problems that can occur with coping and stress tolerance, the nurse may need to consider the diagnoses of risk for complicated immigration transition (00260), and maladaptive grieving (00135); concerns with resilience may lead the nurse to the diagnosis, impaired resilience (00210); while issues related to activity planning might lead to a diagnosis of ineffective activity planning (00199). As you can see, although each of these diagnoses is related to coping and stress tolerance, they are not all concerned with the same core concept. Thus, the nurse may collect a significant amount of data, but without a sufficient understanding of the core concepts of immigration transition, grieving, resilience and activity planning, the data needed for accurate diagnosis may be omitted, and patterns in the assessment data can go unrecognized.

\subsection*{5.4 Assessing}

Assessing involves the collection of subjective and objective data (e.g., vital signs, patient/family interview, physical exam, laboratory and diagnostic imaging results) and review of historical information provided by the patient/ family, or found within the patient chart. Nurses also collect data on patient/ family strengths (to identify health promotion opportunities) and risks (to prevent or postpone potential problems). Assessments should be based on theoretical frameworks, including, but not limited to, nursing theories, such as Careful Nursing, Culture Care Theory, and Theory of Transpersonal Caring. The elements in the theoretical frameworks can be operationalized through assessment frameworks, such as Marjory Gordon's Functional Health Patterns
(FHPs). More information will be provided about Gordon's FHPs in the chapter on assessment (Chapter 7.3). Nursing-centric frameworks provide a way of categorizing large amounts of data into a manageable number of related patterns or categories of data. In the upcoming chapter on assessment, we will discuss this in more detail. However, it is important to consider that there are different approaches to assessment, which can range from very broad to very narrow in focus, and include risk assessment tools, patient reported assessment tools, and in-depth nursing assessment tools, to name just a few.

The foundation of nursing diagnosis is clinical reasoning. Clinical reasoning involves the use of clinical judgment to decide what is wrong with a patient, and clinical decision-making to decide what needs to be done (LevettJones et al 2010). Clinical judgment is "an interpretation or conclusion about a patient's needs, concerns, or health problems, and/or the decision to take action (or not)" (Tanner 2006, p. 204). Key issues, or diagnostic foci, may be evident early in the assessment (e.g., altered skin integrity, loneliness) and allow the nurse to begin the diagnostic process. For example, a patient may report insomnia, irritability, anguish, and/or show facial tension, hand tremors, and increased perspiration. The experienced nurse will recognize the client's anxiety (00146) based on client report and/or anxiety behaviors. Expert nurses can quickly identify clusters of clinical cues from assessment data and seamlessly progress to nursing diagnoses. Novice nurses take a more sequential process in determining appropriate nursing diagnoses.

As another example, after initial assessment of a patient experiencing breathing difficulties with activity, several potential diagnoses may be considered. Nurses might use valid and reliable instruments that measure actual responses, to further assess for these diagnoses, and confirm or refute their diagnostic hypothesis. Some examples might include use of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Scale (Kalluri et al., 2019), the International Sedentary Assessment Tool (Prince et al., 2019), or the Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire (Rosenberg et al., 2010).

As another example, if upon initial assessment, a potential diagnosis related to coping with pain is identified, nurses might work with patients to use valid and reliable instrument or scale that measures risk or signs/symptoms of an actual response, to further assess this possibility and confirm or refute their diagnostic hypothesis. Some examples might include use of the Morse Fall Scale (Morse, 1997), Multidimensional Dyspnea Scale (Kalluri et al, 2019), or the Braden Scale (Bergstrom et al, 1987).

\end{table}

\subsection*{5.5 Diagnosing}

A nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment concerning a human response to health conditions/life processes, or susceptibility to that response, by an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community (NANDA-I DDC communication, 2019). It is the outcome of diagnostic reasoning (Gordon, 1994) and it is typically stated in two parts: (1) descriptor or modifier and (2) focus of the diagnosis or its key concept, such as with the diagnosis, ineffective activity planning (00199) ( $\triangleright$ Table 5.2). There are some exceptions in which a nursing diagnosis is only one word, such as anxiety (00146), constipation (00011), fatigue (00093), and nausea (00134). In these diagnoses, the modifier and focus are inherent in the one term.

Nurses diagnose health problems, risk states, and readiness for health promotion. Problem-focused diagnoses should not be viewed as being more important than risk diagnoses. Sometimes a risk diagnosis can be the diagnosis with the highest priority for a patient. An example may be a patient who has the nursing diagnoses of impaired oral mucous membrane integrity (00045), impaired memory (00131), readiness for enhanced health self-management (00293), and risk for adult pressure injury (00249), and has been newly admitted to a skilled nursing facility. Although impaired oral mucous membrane integrity and impaired memory are the problem-focused diagnoses, the patient's risk for adult pressure injury may be the number one priority diagnosis. This may be especially true when related risk factors are identified during the assessment (e.g., decreased physical mobility, protein-energy malnutrition, dehydration, inadequate caregiver knowledge of pressure injury prevention strategies) in an individual known to be part of an at-risk population (elderly; Individuals in community, aged care, and rehabilitation settings; wheelchair bound).

Each nursing diagnosis has a label and a clear definition. It is important to state that merely having a label or picking from a list of labels is insufficient. It is critical that nurses know the definitions of the diagnoses they most commonly use. In addition, they need to know the "diagnostic indicators" - the

information that is used to diagnose and differentiate one diagnosis from another. These diagnostic indicators include defining characteristics and related factors or risk factors ( $\triangleright$ Table 5.3). Defining characteristics are observable cues/inferences that cluster as manifestations of a diagnosis (e.g., signs or symptoms). An assessment that identifies the presence of a number of defining characteristics lends support to the accuracy of the nursing diagnosis. Related factors are an integral component of all problem-focused nursing diagnoses. Related factors, also called etiological factors, are antecedent factors shown to have a patterned relationship with the human response (e.g., cause, contributing factor). These factors must be modifiable by independent nursing interventions, and whenever possible, interventions should be aimed at these etiological factors. A review of client history often helps to identify related factors. Whenever possible, nursing interventions should be aimed at
these etiological factors in order to remove the underlying cause of the nursing diagnosis. Risk factors are antecedent factors that increase the susceptibility of an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community to an undesirable human response (e.g., environmental, psychological).

Observable cues/inferences cluster as manifestations of a problem-focused or health promotion diagnosis. This implies not only those things that the nurse can see, but also things that are heard (e.g., the patient/family tells us), touched, or smelled.

A nursing diagnosis does not need to contain all types of diagnostic indicators (i.e., defining characteristics, related factors, and/or risk factors). Prob-lem-focused nursing diagnoses contain defining characteristics and related factors. Health promotion diagnoses usually have defining characteristics only; related factors could be used if they would improve the clarity of the diagnosis. Only risk diagnoses have risk factors.

A nursing plan of care does not need to contain each type of nursing diagnosis. The example below illustrates the use of problem and risk diagnoses, as well as the dynamic process of determining nursing diagnoses.

The plan of care for an 82 -year-old female in the hospital includes the diagnoses, risk for falls (00155), acute pain (00132), and deficient fluid volume (00027). The nurse indicates to her colleague during an end of shift hand-off that her interview with the woman's husband suggests that he is overwhelmed by her increased care needs over the past year, and he is providing all her care by himself. The nurse states she will be adding risk for caregiver role strain (00062) to the plan of care.

A common format used by students when learning to document nursing diagnoses includes: $\_\_\_\_$ [nursing diagnosis] related to $\_\_\_\_$ [cause/ related factors] as evidenced by $\_\_\_\_$ [symptoms/defining characteristics]. For example, ineffective breastfeeding (00104) related to maternal anxiety, inadequate family support, and pacifier use as evidenced by infant crying at breast, infant unable to latch on to maternal breast correctly, and sustained infant weight loss. Many nurse educators support this method as a helpful method for students to learn to think critically, while it a also provides faculty members with a way to evaluate clinical reasoning. Further, some argue that all nursing diagnoses should be documented in the patient chart using this three-part format. However, it has always been the position of NANDA-I that it is appropriate to document the label only, provided that the related/risk factors and defining characteristics can be recognized in the assessment data, nursing notes, or plan of care sections within the patient record, in order to provide support for the nursing diagnosis.

Additionally, most electronic health records (EHRs) in use today will not include the "related to" and "as evidenced by" components. Therefore, it is important that the nursing assessment tool within the EHR system contains the diagnostic indicators necessary for diagnosis, to allow for documentation of the nursing diagnosis label only within the patient problem list. After all, simply documenting a diagnosis does not prove its accuracy. As with our colleagues in medicine, we must have our diagnostic indicators appear within the patient record to support our diagnoses. Without this information, it is impossible to verify diagnostic accuracy, which puts the quality of nursing care in question.

\subsection*{5.6 Planning/Implementing}

Once diagnoses are identified, prioritizing of selected nursing diagnoses must occur to determine care priorities. High-priority nursing diagnoses need to be identified (i.e., urgent need, diagnoses with high level of congruence with defining characteristics, related factors, or risk factors) so that care can be directed to resolve these problems or lessen the severity or risk of occurrence (in the case of risk diagnoses).

Nursing diagnoses are used to identify intended outcomes of care and plan nursing-specific interventions sequentially. A nursing outcome, according to the authors of the Nursing Outcome Classification (NOC), refers to "a measurable individual, family, or community state, behavior or perception that is measured along a continuum in response to nursing interventions". The NOC is one example of a standardized nursing language that can be used when planning care, to represent outcome measures related to a nursing diagnosis (Moorhead, Swanson, Johnson, \& Maas, 2018, p. 3). Nurses often, and incorrectly, move directly from nursing diagnosis to nursing intervention without consideration of desired outcomes. Instead, outcomes need to be identified before interventions are determined. The order of this process is similar to planning a road trip. Simply getting in a car and driving will get a person somewhere, but that may not be the place the person really wanted to go. It is better to first have a clear location (outcome) in mind, and then choose a route (intervention), to get to a desired location.

An intervention, according to the authors of the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), is defined as "any treatment, based upon clinical judgment and knowledge that a nurse performs to enhance patient/client outcomes" (Butcher, Bulechek, Docterman, \& Wagner, 2018, p.xii). The NIC is an example of a standardized nursing intervention language that nurses may
use across various care settings. Using nursing knowledge, nurses perform both independent and interdisciplinary interventions. These interdisciplinary interventions overlap with care provided by other health care professionals (e.g., physicians, respiratory and physical therapists).

Hypertension is a medical diagnosis, yet nurses perform both independent and interdisciplinary interventions for these clients who have various types of problems or risk states. Often nurses initiate standing protocols to manage medical diagnoses for patients, and may believe that they are providing independent nursing interventions because they do not require a direct order from a physician to begin the protocol. However, these standing protocols are, in fact, dependent medical orders that are performed and monitored by nurses; they are not independent nursing interventions. However, nurses do perform independent interventions for those clients diagnosed with nursing diagnoses, such as risk for unstable blood pressure (00267), which is a common nursing diagnosis in many settings. In reviewing the related (etiological factors) for this diagnosis, the nurse would determine an appropriate outcome for this patient, and then determine what nursing intervention(s) might be initiated to achieve this outcome, aimed at the related factors of the diagnosis.

\subsection*{5.7 Kamitsuru's Tripartite Model of Nursing Practice}

Kamitsuru's Tripartite Model of Nursing Practice provides nurses with a clear understanding of the types of interventions nurses perform, and the basis of knowledge that underlies those different types.

Nurses often work with a patient who has medical problems. However, from a legal point of view, physicians are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of these medical problems. In the same way, nurses are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of nursing problems. The important point is that nursing problems are different from medical problems. Moreover, we do not rename medical diagnoses or terms to create nursing diagnoses, nor do we need a nursing diagnosis for every nursing intervention or action.

To make these points clear, let's examine how nursing practice exists within health care, from a broader perspective, based on the Three Pillar Model of Nursing Practice (Kamitsuru, 2008), Fig. 5.3. This model depicts three major components of nursing practice, which are distinct but interrelated. In clinical practice, nurses are expected to perform various actions.

First, we have practices/interventions that are driven by medical diagnoses. Nursing actions may be related to related to medical treatments, patient surveillance and monitoring, as well as interdisciplinary collaboration. For

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_26_0fd2cb78757565eb0be7g-091.jpg?height=571&width=1095&top_left_y=192&top_left_x=201}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 5.3 Kamitsuru's Tripartite Model of Nursing Practice}
\end{figure}
instance, when a physician diagnoses an unconscious patient as having a cerebral infarction and orders intravenous (IV) medications, the nurse implements the IV order as directed and carefully monitors the patient's response to the medications. Nurses take these actions in response to medical diagnoses, and use medical standards of care as the basis for these nursing actions.

Secondly, practice may be driven by nursing diagnoses. Independent nursing interventions do not require physician approval or permission. For instance, for the above patient with a cerebral infarction, the nurse positions the patient in a careful manner to prevent aspiration, as well as pressure injury. Supportive care may also be provided to the patient's spouse, who is also taking care of an elderly person with dementia at home. Nurses take these actions based on nursing diagnoses, and use nursing standards of care as the basis for these nursing actions.

Finally, practice may be driven by organizational protocols. These can be actions related to basic care, such as changing linen, providing hygiene and daily care. These actions are not specifically related to either medical diagnoses or nursing diagnoses, but they are based on organizational standards of care.

All three actions combine to form the practice of nursing. Each has a different knowledge base, and different responsibilities. The three parts are equally important for nurses to understand, but only one of them relates to the unique disciplinary knowledge of nursing - and that is the area we know as nursing diagnosis. This model also shows why we do not need to rename medical diagnoses as nursing diagnoses. Medical diagnoses already exist in the medical domain. However, medical diagnoses do not always explain everything that nurses understand about patients, judgments made about their
human responses, or interventions implemented for patients. So, nursing diagnoses mare used to explain independent clinical judgments nurses make about their patients. Thus, nursing diagnoses provide the underpinning of independent nursing interventions.

\subsection*{5.8 Evaluating}

A nursing diagnosis "provides the basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcomes for which nursing has accountability" (Herdman \& Kamitsuru 2018, p. 133). The nursing process is often described as a stepwise process, but in reality a nurse will go back and forth between steps in the process. Nurses will move between assessment and nursing diagnosis, for example, as additional data are collected and clustered into meaningful patterns and the accuracy of nursing diagnoses is evaluated. Similarly, the effectiveness of interventions and achievement of identified outcomes is continuously evaluated as the client status is assessed. Evaluation should ultimately occur at each step in the nursing process, as well as once the plan of care has been implemented. Several questions to consider include the following: "What data might I have missed? Am I making an inappropriate judgment? How confident am I in this diagnosis? Do I need to consult with someone with more experience? Have I confirmed the diagnosis with the patient/family/group/ community? Are the expected outcomes appropriate for this client in this setting, given the regulations governing nursing practice in the country/state/ region, the reality of the patient's condition, the patient's values/beliefs, professional expertise, and resources available? Are the interventions based on research evidence or tradition (e.g., "what we always do")?

\subsection*{5.9 Principles of Nursing Diagnosis: Clinical Application}

This description of nursing diagnosis basics, although aimed primarily at novices, can benefit many nurses in that it highlights critical steps in using nursing diagnosis and provides examples of areas in which inaccurate diagnosing can occur. An area that needs continued emphasis, for example, includes the process of linking knowledge of underlying nursing concepts to assessment, and ultimately nursing diagnosis. The nurse's understanding of key concepts (or diagnostic foci) directs the assessment process and interpretation of assessment data. Relatedly, nurses diagnose problem, risk and strength responses. Any of these types of diagnoses can be the priority diagnosis (or diagnoses), and the nurse makes this clinical judgment.

In representing the knowledge of nursing science, the NANDA-I taxonomy provides the structure for a standardized language in which to communicate nursing diagnoses. Using the NANDA-I terminology (the diagnoses themselves), nurses can communicate with each other, as well as professionals from other health care disciplines, about "what" nurses uniquely know. The use of nursing diagnosis in our interactions with patients/family members can help them to understand the issues on which nurses will be focusing, and can engage them in their own care. The terminology provides a shared language for nurses to address health problems, risk states, and health promotion opportunities. NANDA-I's nursing diagnoses are used internationally, with translation into more than 20 languages. In an increasingly global and electronic world, NANDA-I also allows nurses involved in scholarship to communicate about phenomena of concern to nursing in manuscripts and at conferences, in a standardized way, thus advancing the science of nursing.

Nursing diagnoses are peer reviewed, and submitted for acceptance/revision to NANDA-I by nurses in practice, nurse educators, and nurse researchers around the world. Submissions of new diagnoses and/or revisions to existing diagnoses have continued to grow in number over the nearly 50 years of the NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology. Continued submissions (and revisions) to NANDA-I will further strengthen the scope, extent, and supporting evidence of the terminology.

\subsection*{5.10 Brief Chapter Summary}

This chapter describes types of nursing diagnoses (i.e., problem-focused, risk, health promotion) and steps in the nursing process. The nursing process begins with an understanding of underlying concepts of nursing science, and nursing theories. Assessing follows and involves collection and clustering of data into meaningful patterns. Diagnosing involves clinical judgment about a human response to a health condition or life process, or susceptibility to that response, by an individual, caregiver, family, group, or a community. The nursing diagnosis components were reviewed in this chapter, including the label, definition, and diagnostic indicators (i.e., related factors, risk factors, at risk populations, and associated conditions). Given that a patient assessment will typically generate a number of nursing diagnoses, prioritizing of nursing diagnoses is needed to direct care delivery. Critical next steps in planning/ implementing include identification of nursing outcomes and nursing interventions to eliminate the causative or risk factors of a diagnosis, or to minimize their impact on the individual's, caregiver's, family's, group's, or
community's well-being. Evaluating occurs throughout the nursing process, and at the conclusion of patient care.

\subsection*{6.1 Nursing Commonalities Around the Globe}

There are approximately 19 million nurses and midwives in the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2013). Visualize this large number of nurses providing nursing care across the world in various types of healthcare settings, speaking different languages, using a range of equipment and technologies, and following countless and varied institutional protocols. Although differences are evident, commonalities are numerous among this professional group and its members' collective provision of nursing care.

Nurses have similar professional values (e.g., caring, dignity of the patient, collaboration) and share foundational nursing knowledge. The individual (or recipient of care) is the central focus of nursing. Nurses deal with individuals' responses to health problems and life processes among individuals, caregivers, families, groups, and, communities.

Nurses use NANDA-I nursing diagnoses to communicate their clinical judgments about human responses/life processes, or susceptibilities for these responses, that their patients are experiencing. The nurse's clinical judgment "provides the basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcomes for which nursing has accountability" (Herdman \& Kamitsuru, 2018, p. 133).

\subsection*{6.2 Nursing Education and Practice}

Many schools of nursing have curricula that integrate nursing diagnosis, and linkages to outcomes and interventions. Critical in the curricula is the importance of assessment to guide identification and validation of nursing diagnoses. Also important is that members of the faculty and administrative staff value and have knowledge of nursing diagnosis terminology.

The NANDA-I Nursing Diagnoses: Definitions and Classification publication is a core textbook for many nursing education programs, and is published in over 20 languages (Table 1.2). Newer language translations and distribution in the last book cycle reflect broader interest in our work within, countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Indian subcontinent. A number of countries have shown recent interest in adopting NANDA-I via activities such as international workshops, developing a NANDA-I Network Group, attending

NANDA-I conferences, requesting online seminars, or other learning activities to build knowledge of the NANDA-I taxonomy and terminology.

Exposure to and application of the nursing process, and in-depth understanding of nursing diagnosis, in nursing education equips each aspiring nurse with knowledge and skills necessary for professional nursing practice. Integrating NANDA-I nursing diagnoses throughout the curriculum involves content threaded into lecture courses, skills courses, and simulation and clinical experiences. There are numerous ways to integrate standardized nursing languages (SNL), including NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, into the curriculum. Developing plans of care as clinical assignments are very common, and can be an effective learning opportunity after students have been exposed to diagnosing. Problematic approaches include teaching nursing diagnoses in a way that links them directly to medical diagnoses, using standardized care plans for specific nursing diagnoses without linking assessment data to diagnosis, and/ or without customization of interventions and outcomes for the patient. A medical diagnosis should be considered by the nurse as part of the assessment, but should never be used exclusively as the rationale for a nursing diagnosis. Similarly, a standardized care plan can be a starting template, but must be customized to the patient and the specific concerns or needs of each patient, as identified through nursing assessment.

Healthcare settings use nursing diagnoses or "patient problems" to identify and prioritize the areas of concern to nursing. Many healthcare organizations have moved from paper medical records to electronic health records (EHR) to document nursing care. NANDA-I contracts with major EHR vendors to license the NANDA-I terminology, and EHR vendors then customize the terminology for each unique healthcare institution's HER, and customized builds can link assessment data to diagnoses. NANDA-I also contracts directly with organizations (e.g., hospitals, home health, long-term care) for the use of the terminology, through its publishing partners. With the popularity of EHRs, it
is important to note that it is a violation of copyright law to use NANDA-I terminology in an EHR without permission from NANDA-I, in the form of a written contract from the publishing partner that manages digital rights in the language of the user.

The presence of SNLs in EHRs offers new ways to study diagnostic accuracy (correspondence between assessment data and the patient's current condition) and nursing documentation. Studies have shown a need to improve diagnostic reasoning and accuracy among students and nurses in practice (Johnson, Edwards, \& Giandinoto, 2017; Larijani \& Saatchi, 2019; Freire, Lopes, Keenan, \& Lopez, 2018). A wealth of clinical information can be mined when SNLs are contained within the EHR, and when diagnoses can be validated through the use of data within standardized nursing assessments.

\subsection*{6.3 Professional Associations and Nursing Classifications}

The NANDA-I professional association connects nurses (and others with interest in nursing diagnosis) with interest in the pursuit of diagnostic terminology development and refinement, as well as best practices for education, research, and use of the NANDA-I terminology. Members of the association include students, nurses in practice, administrators, educators, informaticists, and researchers. Members are connected through its website and social media channels, as well as having the opportunity to present their research and share experiences at NANDA-I conferences. The NANDA-I journal, International Journal of Nursing Knowledge, publishes research on worldwide efforts to identify nursing knowledge, develop and apply SNLs in practice, education, informatics and research.

NANDA-I has been linked to several nursing classifications, and, with permission, several have incorporated NANDA-I diagnoses within their development (assigned ${ }^{\star}$ ) over the years, for the purposes of practice, education, or research. These include:
- Belgium's Nursing Minimum Data Set (NMDS)
- Clinical Care Classification (CCC) System*
- European Nursing care Pathways (ENP)
- International Classification of Function (ICF)
- International Classification of Nursing Practice (ICNP)*
- Leistung Erfassung des Pflegeaufwandes (LEP)
- Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC), University of Iowa
- Nursing Outcome Classification (NOC), University of Iowa
- Omaha System (Omaha)*
- Perioperative Nursing Data Set (PNDS)*
- Sundheds-væsenets Klassifikations System (SKS), Danish Nursing Intervention Classification.

Most research in the area of SNLs has been conducted on NANDA-I diagnoses, followed by "NNN", which is the combined use of NANDA-I, the Nursing Outcomes and Nursing Interventions Classifications (NOC and NIC, respectively), and their linkages (Tasten et al, 2014; Herdman \& Kamitsuru, 2018; Moorhead, Swanson, Johnson, \& Maas, 2018; Butcher, Bulechek, Dochterman, \& Wagner, 2018).

Many of the NANDA-I terms are contained within SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms), an international clinical reference terminology. At the time of this writing, NANDA-I is collaborating with members of SNOMED to consider the possibilities of developing a reference set within SNOMED CT so that its users could access NANDA-I terms within their EHRs.

\subsection*{6.4 International Implementation}

There are many ways that colleges and universities, healthcare organizations, professional associations, and even government entities have worked together to educate and implement nursing diagnosis terminology. Widespread implementation of nursing diagnosis terminology has been advanced in some countries by mandates for use. Several countries in Latin America (e.g., Peru, Mexico, Brazil) have included the use of nursing process and nursing diagnosis in professional nursing regulations or governmental laws. The following exemplars, in alphabetical order of country, provide a global perspective on the status of implementation in some parts of the world of the NANDA-I terminology.

\subsection*{6.4.1 Brazil}

The Federal Nursing Council (COFEN) has regulated nursing since 1986, and requires that nursing care be performed according to the nursing process elements in every healthcare institution, and states that nurses have the right to do so (Brasil, 1986, 1987; COFEN, 2002, 2009, 2017). Prior to these regulations, nurses in Brazil promoted the scientific advancement of nursing. In the 1960s and 1970s, Dr. Wanda de Aguiar Horta, from the University of São Paulo (EEUSP), promoted scientific methods and the use of nursing diagnosis and the nursing process (Paula, Nara, \& Horta, 1967; Horta, Hara, \& Paula, 1971; Horta, 1972; Horta, 1977). In the late 1980s, two groups adopted

NANDA diagnoses, the EEUSP (led by Dr. Edna Arcuri) and Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) (led by Dr. Marga Coler) (Coler, Nóbrega, Garcia, \& Coler-Thayer, 2009; Cruz, 1991).

Knowledge of the NANDA taxonomy and terminology was further disseminated through publications and conferences. In 1990, publication of the manual, Nursing diagnosis: a conceptual and practical approach, contained a translation of the revised NANDA-I Taxonomy 1 (Farias, Nóbrega, Perez, \& Coler, 1990). The first National Symposium on Nursing Diagnoses was promoted in 1991 by Dante Pazzanese Cardiology Institute (IDPC) and the current Paulista Nursing School (EPE-Unifesp); the first International Symposium on Nursing Diagnoses followed, in 1995, promoted by EEUSP. The first official translation of the NANDA classification was completed in 1999. In 2002, EPE-Unifesp held the $6{ }^{\text {th }}$ National Symposium on Nursing Diagnoses occurred along with the first International Symposium on Nursing Classifications. The events helped nurses to understand the linkages between NANDA, NOC and NIC.

The nursing process is taught across all nursing programs. This stems in part from the National Curricular Guidelines of Undergraduate Nursing Courses, established in 2001, which affirmed that nurses can diagnose (Conselho Nacional de Educação, 2001). The Commission on the Organization of Nursing Practice (COMSISTE ABEn Nacional), established in 2006 by the Brazilian Nursing Association (ABEn), educates nurses on the nursing process, and promotes effective implementation of the nursing process and SNL in practice (ABEn, 2017a; ABEn 2017b). Graduate programs have contributed widely to the use of nursing diagnosis in Brazil, and during the period of 2006-2016, 85\% of 216 accessible theses and dissertations focused on nursing diagnoses and NANDA-I nursing diagnoses (Hirano, Lopes, \& Barros, 2019). Other educational initiatives include the distance learning Update Program on Nursing Diagnoses (PRONANDA) produced in Brazil since 2013 (NANDA International, Herdman, \& Carvalho, 2013). Implementation of SNL in EHRs has contributed to the expanded use of NNN. Since 2013, nearly 400 licensed sales have been made by Grupo A to a total of 32 health care settings.

Despite this favorable scenario, implementation and use of the nursing process and SNL remain inconsistent in the country. For example, in 416 sectors with 40 institutions in São Paulo State, $78.8 \%$ documented assessment, $78.8 \%$ documented diagnoses, but only $56.0 \%$ documented assessment, diagnosis, interventions and outcomes, whereas $5.8 \%$ documented no phase of the nursing process or nursing notes (Azevedo, Guedes, Araújo, Maia, \& Cruz,
2019). In 2020, the Nursing Process Research Network (REPPE) was created by researchers from several regions in the country, aimed at generating, synthesizing, and sharing knowledge on the nursing process and SNL (REPPE, n.d.). The continuous promotion of events by ABEn, COMSISTE's actions and bedside discussions using SNL, such as those promoted by IDPC, Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), and Hospital Universitário da USP, are valuable initiatives for the advancement of the nursing process and SNL implementation in practice in Brazil.

\subsection*{6.4.2 Japan}

In the 1990s, nursing diagnosis fascinated many Japanese nurses who sought independent practice based upon professional knowledge. Although there is no regulation mandating nursing diagnosis use, it is used or taught by nearly $60 \%$ of hospitals and $50 \%$ of nursing schools. Nursing diagnosis is not included in the standard nursing curriculum. Whether nursing diagnosis is taught in undergraduate programs depends on the expertise and perspective of the instructors at each nursing school. Since there are no guidelines for nursing diagnosis education, instructors are often confused about what or how to teach.

In the last 20 years, the introduction of EHR systems has spread throughout the country, and nursing diagnosis is viewed as an essential standardized language. Hospitals that use nursing diagnosis terminology incorporate its training into in-service education. Some hospitals invite outside instructors to provide such training periodically, while others utilize internal and external instructors to enhance staff members' diagnostic skills and knowledge. It is a challenge for many hospitals to develop and retain their own instructors.

Although present in EHRs, nursing leadership has not taken full advantage of nursing diagnosis data for healthcare improvement (e.g., staffing, patient outcomes). Continued efforts are needed in Japan to strengthen the knowledge and confidence of nurses in their diagnostic judgments. Nursing diagnosis is used most effectively in hospitals where nurse administrators value its use in the EHR, and are committed to staff development with a long-term perspective.

\subsection*{6.4.3 Mexico}

Since the early 1970's, educational activities focused on the nursing process were promoted by educational and service organizations and institutions, especially the National Association of Nursing Schools, the National Association of Universities and Higher Education Institute, and National Nurses Association. Collaborations resulted in guidance and unified criteria for
standardized care plans, and criteria for teaching and application of the nursing process to improve nursing performance (Moran, nd).

In 2007 the creation of the Permanent Nursing Commission (PNC) was reported in the official newspaper of the Federation (government), Diario Oficial de la Federación. The PNC is the nursing advisory body of the Federal Government, with the purpose of establishing policies for the practice and training of nurses. The PNC developed nine recommendations to strengthen the culture of quality in the nursing services of health facilities and standardization of nursing care. The most significant were related to the nursing process (NP) and implementation of the NP in medical units (Recommendation 1); standardization of nursing care through nursing care plans for main health problems using diagnostic labels (Recommendation 2); and proposed development of a catalog of nursing care plans (Recommendation 9) (Hernández, 2011).

The nursing process has been incorporated into nursing curricula. There remains, however, a gap between theory and practice, as well as a minimal implementation in healthcare settings. Professionals apply knowledge mediated by a series of values inherent to the profession, however there is a difference between how the academic area applies the nursing process, and how it is implemented in the clinical area. In hospital practice, there are few nursing professionals who apply NNN as a helpful tool for the development of professional practice. Nurses typically put more emphasis on the development of technical skills than on the methodological knowledge of necessary for planning care. The collection of data, or assessment, is conducted quickly, and often incompletely, which limits decision-making regarding human responses, with greater weight attributed to pathophysiological responses of patients, with the predominant biomedical model prevailing in the hospital setting.

Nursing in Mexico has made progress in terms of the nursing care modalities and the use of standardized language. More research is needed in Mexico to contribute to the development of nursing diagnosis terminology.

\subsection*{6.4.4 Peru}

Nursing in Peru has gone through a process of development and transition in both education and clinical practice. Since the adoption of the Peruvian University Law in 1983, only universities can offer a professional degree, and the curriculum for nursing schools has been strengthened. The nursing process was incorporated into nursing courses, which includes identification of problems and/or needs of the patient. In this context, three stages were taught: assessing, implementing and evaluating, which allowed the nurse to identify
patient needs, to develop individual, caregiver, group, family, or community care plans.

In the 1980s, further development of the nursing process led to use of five stages: assessing, diagnosing, planning, implementing, and evaluating. The role of universities was essential for education and outreach of this process. The NANDA-I diagnosis classification began to spread, and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, started the first collaborative work between a university and a hospital (State Hospital Arzobispo Loayza). Professors from the university began educating nurses at this hospital on the NANDA-I diagnosis classification. This was replicated at three additional state hospitals.

The support of the College of Nursing Professionals and approval of the Peruvian Nurse Law in 2002 further increased the use of nursing diagnosis terminology, as the Law required inclusion of the nursing process in the nursing documentation system. Teaching methodologies have varied among universities, hospitals, and regions. In some settings the NANDA-I classification has been implemented, and in others, this is still in process. Professional Certification by the College of Nursing Professionals began in 2010, and was implemented by the Professional Competencies Assessments, Evaluation Centers, which are accredited by the National System for the Evaluation, Accreditation, and Certification of University Quality. In addition, the use of NANDA-I nursing diagnosis was formalized by the Professional Competences' regulations in 2015 . This included the use of the NANDA-I classification in the evaluation instruments used in the process, such as the nursing progress notes, which shows the importance of the use of the SNL in the safe care of the patient. Moreover, policy entities, such as the Ministry of Health, approved Nursing Intervention Guides that strengthened the use of the NANDA-I classification in the clinical area of the State Hospitals nationwide, as well as "Nursing Progress Notes", which have been approved and published at the entities' web pages.

Significant integration of NANDA-I diagnoses has occurred at multiple state hospitals. Electronic health records are currently being implemented, based on the National Registry of Electronic Clinical Records implementation plan.

The acquisition of NANDA-I diagnosis knowledge by university professors, and their interest in promoting this knowledge in the education of nurses, is the primary force driving the implementation of NANDA-I diagnosis forward. The NANDA-I Network: Peru continues to strengthen the understanding and implementation of SNLs. This network meets with stakeholders to make nursing visible for the benefit of society and nursing professionals.

\subsection*{6.4.5 Republic of Ireland}

The Republic of Ireland serves as an interesting exemplar of how NNN is being integrated into educational and healthcare settings (Murphy, McMullin, Brennan, \& Meehan, 2017). Implementation of the Careful Nursing Philosophy and Professional Practice Model (Careful Nursing) has been underway since 2009. Central to nursing practice is the Practice Competence and Excellence dimension, which includes the concept, diagnoses-outcomes-interventions, as well as a care planning structure using NANDA-I. An essential first step in this care planning structure is the identification of the patient's NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. At this time, Careful Nursing is being implemented in ten hospitals and four nursing schools, primarily in the southwest and southern areas of the Republic of Ireland.

NANDA-I is implemented in the Republic of Ireland because nurses in hospital practice want to or are required to use it (initially because of Careful Nursing), but also because hospital Directors of Nursing have found that NANDA-I is usable "at the bedside". Nurses in practice recognize that NANDA-I nursing diagnoses give them the ability to name what they know, and diagnose nursing needs of people for whom they provide care. This encourages nurse educators to prioritize and thread knowledge of NANDA-I through all levels of the undergraduate curriculum. The shared perspectives of practicing nurses and nurse educators is truly helping to narrow the theorypractice gap.

\subsection*{6.4.6 Spain}

Implementation of SNL in Spain occurred more than 20 years ago. Nurses began to use SNL in practice, mainly with the incorporation of the EHR and, as a consequence, the Health Ministry created legislation on the necessity to use SNL, specifically NNN, for nursing documentation. There was collaboration between clinical nurses and university nursing faculty to decide how SNL would be included in the electronic systems. From the beginning of electronic system implementation in the Spanish Territory, the efforts have multiplied. The use of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses in nursing practice is not questioned. The Spanish Health Ministry includes NNN languages in updates made to any nursing protocol.

Nursing colleges, and many clinical nurses working in hospitals or primary healthcare, have been part of the change forces regarding SNL. The development of primary healthcare services was a major impetus for SNL to be taught at all levels, through continuing education for nursing professionals and at the colleges of nursing. The creation of the Spanish Association for Nomenclature,

Taxonomy and Nursing Diagnoses (AENTDE) in 1996 was crucial for thousands of Spanish nurses to learn and discuss with colleagues from NANDA-I, and other international associations, the significance of using SNL in general, and nursing diagnoses in particular.

The Spanish Health Ministry has been very involved in the implementation and use of SNL. One of the first projects, together with the Consejo Nacional de Enfermería (National Organization of Spanish Nurses) and AENTDE, was the calculation of the cost of nursing care using standardized nursing care plans that included NNN for different clinical processes, both at hospitals and in Primary Health Care (Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo, n.d.). By 2010, there were more than 100 Spanish hospitals using the same electronic system, called "GACELA", that incorporated NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. Some parts of the Spanish territory were using the system at all levels of clinical care.

Electronic systems have clearly facilitated the implementation of NANDA-I nursing diagnoses. In the EHR, nursing has the most complete SNL and it is also the most complex, including assessments, diagnoses, outcomes, outcome indicators, interventions, activities, etc., and all of these are interrelated. The electronic record is a tool that must facilitate the work of professionals who use it and, indeed it does this. The EHR facilitates planning and recording of care, while producing data to foster management.

The future is positive for continued use of SNL in general and NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology, specifically. Another important area to consider is the incorporation of the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) in the electronic systems of many of the European Countries, which will occur in Spain in the not too distant future. Information technology innovations will continue to improve nursing software and information management, along with the use of innovations such as business intelligence or data warehouses, which allow analysis of huge amounts of data and can enhance areas of nursing, such as management and leadership, research, evidence-based nursing interventions, and practice improvement.

\subsection*{6.4.7 United States}

The American Nurses Association (ANA) recommends that nurses document using the nursing process within the patient record, and recognizes 13 SNLs. NANDA-I is the most recognized and researched of the languages on the ANA's list (Tastan, Linch, Keenan, Stifter, McKinney, Fahey, Lopez, Yao \& Wilkie, 2014). The unwillingness of the ANA to take a stand in terms of which SNLs should be used in clinical practice has led to a lack of consensus
nationally, which has undermined the importance of diagnostic reasoning, and overall clinical reasoning related to the nursing process, within education and practice. Unfortunately, because there are no professional regulations or requirements guiding use of nursing diagnosis, or SNLs related to outcomes or interventions, it remains the decision of each individual nursing school as to the degree to which it includes NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology and that of other SNLs - in the curriculum. This leaves the USA at a distinct disadvantage due to its inability to harvest data from EHRs to better understand nurses' impact on patient care, what the actual cost of nursing care is, and which nursing diagnoses may prolong hospital stays, lead to increased readmissions, or result in preventable sequelae.

It is not known how many healthcare institutions have implemented the use of SNLs for electronic nursing documentation in the United States. In a rare study, usage of EHRs in the state of Minnesota (USA) was examined, with $92 \%$ of healthcare systems (e.g., hospitals, clinics, public health) in the state using EHRs. Of these organizations, only $30 \%$ used a SNL (Huard \& Monsen, 2017). However, it is well known that many organizations do indeed incorporate NANDA-I nursing diagnoses labels into documentation systems, without procuring a license. In many of these cases, nurses are unaware that they are documenting with NANDA-I labels, because they are not properly referenced, and many nurses, especially those with associate degree education, have not learned nursing diagnosis content in their curricula. This problem is certainly not unique to the USA, and is probably a reflection of the continued lack of economic support for nursing as a professional, independent discipline.

The EHR is part of the healthcare landscape in the USA. Incentives in the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 put adoption of EHRs on the fast track for healthcare organizations. Standards issued by the government (Department of Health and Human Services) require that EHRs contain an up-to-date problem list of current diagnoses that users can electronically enter and modify. However, there are no standards for languages that must be used in problems lists, and thus problem lists vary widely among healthcare institutions, and often the problem lists include only medical diagnoses. Again, this lack of consistency significantly limits the availability of well defined, high quality big data sets for nursing research.

The apparent lack of use of SNLs creates a gap between what knowledge nursing schools use to prepare nurses for practice, and what nurses actually see and use in healthcare settings. That said, many undergraduate schools of nursing do teach NANDA-I nursing diagnosis in the curriculum, but it is
often taught in an early course and not well integrated into advanced content as students move through their programs. Furthermore, it is often incorrectly linked to medical diagnosis, with little to no education provided on diagnostic reasoning, or how assessment should drive nursing diagnosis. Nursing faculty members often received little or confusing education themselves on diagnosing, and therefore are often unsure about how to teach nursing diagnosis. One very positive aspect is the new relationship between Boston College and NANDA-I, which cofounded the Marjory Gordon Program for Knowledge Development and Clinical Reasoning. This partnership will advance development of educational materials, tools, and learning strategies to support nursing educators as they teach diagnostic reasoning and nursing diagnosis terminology, as well as foster the development of nursing knowledge.

\subsection*{6.5 Summary}

It takes a global community to inform, teach, and implement NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology. Indeed, it is a global phenomenon! The NANDA-I taxonomy provides a way to classify areas of concern (diagnostic foci) to nurses and the patients for whom we provide care. The NANDA-I nursing diagnoses describe human responses to health problem/life processes and inform the identification of outcomes and interventions. What is clear is that NANDA-I nursing diagnoses support the clinical reasoning process and provide a discipline-specific language to describe the unique knowledge of the nursing discipline.

Innovative practices for implementation of nursing diagnosis are occurring in many places across the globe (e.g., Estonia, Slovenia, Italy, Spain, Brazil) too many to name! There are many professionals dedicated to these efforts, including clinical nurses, nurse educators, administrators, informaticists, and researchers.

The NANDA-I nursing terminology is the only SNL that is continually updated with current evidence, and assigned level of evidence criteria, to best reflect the full scope of nursing practice. Nursing diagnoses are submitted for acceptance (new diagnoses) or revision (existing diagnoses) to NANDA-I by practicing nurses, nurse educators, graduate students, and nurse researchers. It is clear that NANDA-I has a global reach to support the millions of nurses making clinical judgments (nursing diagnoses) related to patient health problems, risks, and strengths, and to drive relevant interventions and outcomes.

7 Clinical Reasoning: From Assessment to Diagnosis
}

\author{

\subsection*{7.1 Clinical Reasoning: Introduction}

Clinical reasoning has been defined in a variety of ways within health care disciplines. Koharchik et al (2015) indicate that it requires the application of ideas and experience to arrive at a valid conclusion; in nursing, it is used to describe the way a nurse "analyzes and understands a patient's situation and forms conclusions" (p. 58). Tanner (2006) sees it as the process by which nurses make clinical judgments by selecting from alternatives, weighing evidence, using intuition and pattern recognition. Similarly, Banning (2008) defined clinical reasoning as the application of knowledge and experience to a clinical situation, in a concept analysis of clinical reasoning, dating from 1964 to 2005 . The study identified the need for tools to measure clinical reasoning in nursing practice.

It is important to note that clinical reasoning is a process, informed and reformed by new data or evidence. It is not a step-by-step, linear process, but rather an evolving one. It occurs over time, often across multiple patient/family encounters. The process is also an iterative one. The more information we obtain, the more information we are able to synthesize, uncovering the problem(s) and discovering pattern formation. For the more novice nurses early in their careers, this process may take time. Nurses with more experience may move through the process more quickly, having developed knowledge from seeing many patients over time. Nevertheless, each patient situation is unique and requires nurses to fully engage in all of the components of the reasoning process to uncover pattern formation or problem identification.

\subsection*{7.2 Clinical Reasoning within the Nursing Process}

Many authors focus on the nursing process, without taking the time to ensure that we understand the concepts of nursing science; yet, the nursing process begins with - and requires - an understanding of these underlying concepts of nursing and the human experience. If we do not understand our disciplinary concepts (or ideas defined by our knowledge), we will struggle to identify how pattern formation of the whole is experienced by our patients, families, and communities.

A concept is as an image or an abstract idea. Central concepts of the discipline of nursing include environment, health, nursing, and person (Walker \& Avant, 2019). Other concepts emerge as we describe phenomena of concern to nursing, such as well-being, stress, or activity. It is critical that we know (and teach) these concepts so that nurses can recognize normal human responses and patterns inconsistent with usual responses, identify risks or threats to health, and promote health and wellness. Engaging in the nursing process (assessing, diagnosing, planning, intervening, and evaluating) is meaningless if we do not understand underlying nursing concepts and if we cannot identify them from the individual patterns manifested within the data we collect during assessment.

Without a solid grounding in concepts, the knowledge or phenomena of concern to nursing, it is difficult to articulate hypotheses or statements of probability about patients and their experiences. Without this knowledge, we lack the ability to engage in a more in-depth assessment and obtain new data that will confirm or eliminate a tentative problem or diagnosis. Although conceptual knowledge has not generally been included within the nursing process, knowing this information enhances our ability to understand the human experience to its fullest.

Example. What do we mean by pattern formation or data synthesis? We are talking about how our minds pull together information from a variety of data points to form a picture of what we are seeing, and then recognize a name. Let us first look at a nonclinical scenario.

Assume you are out for a walk, and you go past a group of men seated at a picnic bench at a park. You notice that they are doing something with little rectangular objects, and they are speaking in very loud voices - some are even shouting - as they slam these objects on the table between them. The men seem very intense, and it appears they are arguing about these objects, but you cannot understand what these objects are or what exactly the men are doing with them. As you slow down to watch them, you notice a small crowd has gathered. Some of these individuals occasionally nod their heads or comment in what seems to be an encouraging manner, some seem concerned, and others appear to be as confused by what they are watching as you are.

Linking concepts and data. What is happening here? What is it that you are observing? It may be hard for you to articulate what you are seeing if it is something with which you have no experience. When we do not understand a concept, it is hard to move forward with our thinking process. Suppose that we told you that what you were observing was men playing Mahjong, a type
of tile-based board game. The tiles are used like cards, only they are small, rectangular objects traditionally made of bone or bamboo. Although you may not know anything about Mahjong, you can understand the concept "game". With this understanding, you might begin to look at the scene unfolding before you in a different way. You might begin to see the four men as competitors, each hoping to win the game, which might explain their intensity. You might begin to consider their raised voices as a form of good-natured taunting of one another, rather than angry shouting. Once you understand the concept of "game", you can begin to paint a picture in your mind as to what is happening in this scene, and you can begin to interpret the data you are collecting (cues) in a way that makes sense within the context of a game. Without the "game" concept, though, you might continue the struggle to make sense of your observations.

Now let us look at the idea of nursing concepts (knowledge) using a clinical scenario. Lisa is on her first clinical placement as a nursing student, under the supervision of Prof. Leonard, a faculty member in an elderly independent/ assisted living facility. On one of her placement days, Lisa is assessing Mr. Smith, while assisted by her professor. Mr. Smith is 75 years old and has lived in the facility for 12 months. He tells Lisa that he feels that he is lacking energy all the time, he cannot concentrate, and most days he has not even brushed his teeth. He is very concerned that there is something wrong with his heart. Lisa begins by taking his vital signs, but as she is doing this, she asks Mr. Smith to tell her what has been happening in his life since he began living at the facility. He indicates that he had to move in after his wife died from a heart attack, because he could not take care of the house chores and run errands all by himself, and his only daughter lived abroad with her husband and 4 children. He denies any chest pain, heart palpitations, or shortness of breath. When Prof. Leonard asks him why he's worried about his heart, he says "well, this thought keeps repeating in my mind every day, that my wife wouldn't have died if I had insisted that she went to see a cardiologist earlier".

Lisa asks him how often his daughter gets to visit him. Mr. Smith indicates that she had to leave immediately after his wife's funeral, because she and her husband had a lot of work activities, and they had not been able to visit him since then, but they usually spoke on the phone once a week. He notes that he doesn't really have an interest in the living facility activities, and it was hard to leave his neighborhood because there was a couple who lived across the street and they were very good friends. They met at least three times a week for dinner, or they watched TV or played board games, and they even traveled together a couple of times. Now they only talk by phone. Although he is glad
he gets to talk with them, he says it isn't the same as enjoying dinner with his wife and them. He points out that his wife was the strong link to the relationship with the neighbors, because she was always proposing and planning different activities. He even has a voice message from her on his phone that he listens to every day, proposing that they all should go to a party together that weekend.

Lisa tells Mr. Smith that his vital signs are very good. Prof. Leonard suggests to Lisa that he may be suffering from a change in his grieving process, and suggests that they try a few adjustments to see if that can impact Mr. Smith's feelings of restfulness and being at peace with himself. First, he recommends that they speak with Mr. Smith, and then with the environmental services director to get him enrolled in a bereavement support group, and begin counseling with mental health staff at the nursing home, so that he can express his grieving process. He also tells her that Mr. Smith should be assessed for the development of clinical depression. Finally, he suggests talking with Mr. Smith about reconnecting with his neighborhood friends, in person, and to the director of resident life to find out how he might be able to visit his friends, or have them come to the facility to see his new apartment to slowly get Mr. Smith involved in his new community.

Lisa is amazed that Prof. Leonard almost immediately identified a potential problem with Mr. Smith. Prof. Leonard draws Lisa's attention to the nursing diagnosis, maladaptive grieving (00301), and she realizes that his assessment data are defining characteristics and related factors of this diagnosis. Lisa's professor talks with her about the grieving process, and the things that can impact it, such as inadequate social support (Mr. Smith's recent move; lack of connection with his daughter and friends). He quickly considered this nursing diagnosis because he understood the normal grieving process, and identified factors that contribute to a disturbance in this normal pattern. Further, he identified probable etiological (related) factors. Lisa, as a nursing student, did not yet have the conceptual knowledge from which to draw; for her, this diagnosis did not seem obvious.

This is the reason why studying concepts underlying diagnoses is so important. We cannot understand an individual's usual human response patterns without drawing on conceptual knowledge throughout the nursing process.

\subsection*{7.3 The Nursing Process}

Without a complete nursing assessment, there can be no patient-centered nursing diagnosis, nor can we identify evidence-based, patient-centered, independent nursing interventions. Assessment should not be conducted to fill in the blank spaces on a form or computer screen. If this form of rote assessment rings a bell for you, it is time to take a new look at the purpose of assessment!

Assessing. Nurses engage in assessment to come to know the person and his experiences, accurately identify patient concerns, and implement nursing interventions with the purpose of achieving optimal patient care outcomes. As a discipline, nursing has developed knowledge that comprises nursing science. Nursing diagnosis, which is a clinical judgment, is the outcome of a nursing assessment that describes health conditions/life processes, or a susceptibility for that response. That diagnosis then provides the basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcomes for which the nurse has accountability: the focus here is "human response".

Assessment of human responses within a nursing assessment framework is a way to identify nurse-focused phenomena of concern and address problems within the scope of professional nursing practice. Human beings are complex and dynamic, and will respond uniquely to the same situation. Human responses are influenced by many factors, including genetics, physiology, health conditions, and experiences with illness/injury. These responses are also influenced by the patient's age, culture, ethnicity, religion/spiritual beliefs, economics, gender, and family experiences.

A comprehensive nursing assessment framework provides for a person's unique response to illness, health, or wellness to be shared with others. Nursing diagnoses provide standardized terms to describe human responses, with clear definitions and assessment criteria that represent nursing knowledge.

Nurses view assessing as an opportunity to engage with a patient, in a process where data is shared, transformed into information, and organized into meaningful categories of nursing content, also known as nursing diagnoses. Assessing provides an important opportunity for nurses' knowledge and contributions to patient care to be realized.

Nurse-patient relationship. The relationship between the nurse and patient is core to optimal nursing practice (Roy \& Jones, 2007, Watson, Smith, 2019). Within this relationship, the nurse comes to know the individual as a whole person and to view illness as part of health (MacLeod, 2011; Smith, 2011, Jones, 2013). Dossey and Keegan (2013, p. 17) describe the relationship
between the nurse/patient/family/community as one of "self-awareness, patient experiences of health and illness, and developing and maintaining a caring relationship and effective communication".

Nursing knowledge, expertise, skills, and values contribute to establishing trust and connecting with a person in a meaningful way. Within the practice setting, the environment of care enables the nurse to come to know the person through relationship. Being with patients and families requires presence, awareness, careful listening, and observing. These responses help to actualize the professional role of the nurse in delivery of cost effective, high quality, safe, knowledge-driven patient care (Jones, 2013).

The engagement of the nurse and patient is a mutual care experience (Newman, 2008). It moves nursing beyond doing (focusing on tasks that help to manage care) to understanding the patient experience holistically, identifying mutual areas of concern, and providing information to assist the person to engage in changes and take actions that can be transforming (Newman, 2008; Jones, 2013).

Intentional authentic presence. Intentional presence requires a "genuine dialogue, commitment, full engagement and openness, free flowing attentiveness and transcendent oneness" (Smith, 2011). When nurses are present with a person, they are engaged in the moment and consciously aware of their environment.

The authentic presence of the nurse in a patient caring experience promotes engagement and enhances relationship (Newman, 2008; Newman, Smith, Pharris and Jones, 2008). The experience can be transformational for both the nurse and the patient. Presence is a matter of consciousness and is reflected in the holistic beings that are both nurse and patient (Chase, 2011).

Intentional presence allows the nurse to experience verbal and non-verbal expressions and responses to a situation, in the moment. Exploring patient experiences helps to uncover what is meaningful to the individual, fosters reflection, increases awareness about choices, actions and behaviors that enhance health, and provides insights that can lead to discovery, change, and personal transformation (Jones, 2013, 2006; Newman, 2008; Jones \& Flanagan, 2007; Doona, Chase \& Haggerty, 1999).

When the nurse is able to create a safe space, the patient may feel free to disclose his concerns and freely express his fears (Jones, 2013). As the nurse and patient engage in the process of assessing, the patient may experience new awareness and insights (Newman, 2008) and recognize new opportunities for making personal changes in his life, and engage in health promotion actions.

According to Willis et al., "meaning is a human's arrived-at understanding of life experiences and their significance that comes from processing those experiences" (2008, p. E34).

Knowing the person. "Knowing the patient encompasses the complex processes whereby the nurse acquires understanding of a specific patient as a unique individual, which enhances clinical decision-making" (Whittemore, 2000, p. 75). Benner (1984) initially describes nurses' skill in being mindful of the person and his environment, and experiencing an "intuitive" response to assess a situation. Often this is associated with a nurse's clinical expertise. The nurse may describe an experience as, "I don't know what it is, but I just know something is wrong". Some call this intuitive knowing, when the nurse is able to recognize a complex set of clues that draws attention to a potential problem or situation, without necessarily being able to name the response.

As nurses gain experience and observe responses in populations over time, they expand their knowledge and process information (cues) more rapidly, as they recognize responses as being usual or problematic. As nurses care for a patient over time, they can become increasingly sensitive to changes in the patient's response pattern. As the nurse engages in assessing, there is an accumulative knowledge about the patient's pattern of responses and she is able to quickly make judgments (Gordon, 1994). It is essential that nurses engage in obtaining adequate assessment data to validate clinical judgments, or nursing diagnoses, in all situations.

Nursing assessment and the nurse-patient relationship promote patient satisfaction and enhance nursing visibility in practice. Watson \& Smith (2004) discussed the importance of a caring relationship, describing it as the hallmark of the discipline. In a study conducted by Somerville (2009), patients described a feeling of being known by their nurse when they were "recognized as a unique human being, felt safe within the care environment, experienced a connection with the nurse they perceived as meaningful, and felt empowered by the nurse to actively participate in their care" (p.3). Data from this initial qualitative study informed the development of the Patients' Perceptions of Feeling Known by Their Nurse Scale (PPFKNS, Somerville, 2009). The PPFKNS is a valid and reliable, four component scale that can be used to evaluate patients perceptions of "being known" by the nurse.

Nursing Assessment: a holistic process. "There are multiple approaches that can be used by nurses to understand the person's response to illness and the behaviors they engage in to promote a healthy lifestyle" (Jones, 2013, p. 95). Nursing theories (Newman, 2008; Roy, 2007) offer unique approaches
to understanding the human experience, and can be used alone or integrated into an assessment framework, such as the Functional Health Pattern (FHP) Assessment (Gordon, 1994). Each theory offers a framework within which data representing the patient's experiences are studied. Organizing patient responses within the FHP framework may be a way to compliment knowledge generated by the theory with knowledge gained from nursing practice. The knowledge gained may help to expand nursing science.

Approaches to assessing and data collection. Process/dialogue and problem solving are two approaches that can help the nurse come to know the patient's experience. These approaches offer different ways of accessing and analyzing data, and the interventions and outcomes vary in structure and description. They are both designed to understand how life experiences affect living and impact health and well being.

Assessing as a dialogue process. Assessing, as a process, occurs within the context of a dialogue or discussion. This approach to assessing is inductive and focuses on "the nature of a relationship that is transformative for both nurse and patient" (Newman et al., 2008). Data collection is less systematic, and content evolves through purposeful discussions within the nurse-patient relationship. The nurse may begin the conversation with an open-ended question, such as: "Can you tell me what your day was like for you?"

As the nurse is present in the moment and carefully listening, the patient's story unfolds. When needed, the nurse may ask questions to seek additional information to uncover new information or seek clarification. Events and people who are part of the individual's experiences help give meaning to life events and responses. The interaction involves a mutual interaction between the nurse and the patient. Meaningful data discussed within the dialogue helps to inform an unfolding pattern of the whole (Flanagan, 2009; Newman, 2008). Margaret Newman's theoretical framework within Health as Expanding Consciousness (HEC) is an example of a process assessment. The goal of the process/dialogue approach is to "grasp meaning" and come to know the pattern of the whole. Reflection and discussion promotes increasing awareness, reflection, and opportunities for change (Newman, 2008).

Assessing as problem solving. Problem solving is a deductive reasoning process that involves a systematic approach to data collection. Though some might consider the process linear, others argue that as new data becomes available, clinical judgments are revised and diagnoses are re-evaluated (Gordon, 1994). The problem-solving assessment perspective views humans
as holistic, bio-psychosocial beings interacting (functioning) within the environment and shaped by age, developmental stage, health status and culture and ethnicity (Jones, 2007).

The problem solving approach to assessing incorporates both subjective and objective data to inform the assessment and subsequent problem identification. The naming of the problem (nursing diagnosis) and identification of the probable cause (related factors) direct interventions designed to eliminate or relieve the originating problem and reduce risk. The Functional Health Pattern Assessment is an example of a problem-solving approach to assessment.

Subjective and objective data. Nurses collect and document two types of data related to the patient experience: subjective and objective data. While physicians value objective over subjective data for medical diagnoses, nurses value both types of data for nursing diagnoses (Gordon, 2008). Nurses collect these subjective data through the assessment process or interview.

Subjective data is information obtained from patients' verbal reports about their perceptions, thoughts, and experiences related to their health, daily life, comfort, relationship, and so on. For instance, a patient may report, "I need to manage my health better", or "My partner never talks about anything important with me".

Family members/close friends can also provide this type of data, although patient data should be obtained from the person (family, community) whenever possible, because it is the patient's data. Sometimes, however, the patient is unable to provide subjective data, so we must rely on these other sources. For example, a patient with significant dementia who is no longer verbally competent may require family members to provide subjective information, based on their knowledge of the individual's behavior. An example might be an adult child of the patient telling the nurse, "She always likes to listen to soft music when she eats, it seems to calm her".

Objective data is information that nurses observe about the patient. These data are sometimes referred to as empirical or measurable evidence. Objective data is obtained through physical examinations and diagnostic test results. Here, "to observe" does not only mean the use of eyesight: it requires the use of all senses and forms of measurement. For example, nurses look at the patient's general appearance, listen to his lung sounds, they may smell foul wound drainage, and feel the skin temperature using touch. Additionally, nurses use various instruments and tools with the patient to collect numerical data (e.g., body weight, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, pain level). To collect reliable and accurate objective data, nurses must have appropriate
knowledge and skills to perform physical assessment and to use standardized tools or monitoring devices.

Problem solving and nursing assessment. To date, nursing lacks a standardized approach to assessment. There are multiple assessment forms created by nurses to collect data but, unlike the review of systems in medicine, nurses use a variety of strategies to obtain patient information. In some settings nurses use a head to toe approach, others use an assessment checklist, while some nurses develop focused assessment forms (e.g., assessment for pain or fall risk).

These tools provide data, but often the information is incomplete and focuses on the illness experience by discussing the patient's chief complaint or presenting health concern(s). These approaches also lack a holistic approach to understanding the patient responses to health and illness within the nurse patient relationship. Within a problem-solving approach to assessment, Gordon's eleven Functional Health Patterns (Gordon, 1994) offer a nursedriven, organized approach to understanding the person's response to illness and health promotion.

Functional Health Pattern Assessment Framework. Gordon (1994) notes that a structured assessment helps the nurse to focus, organize, and synthesize subjective and objective clinical data. The Functional Health Pattern (FHP) assessment provides nurses with a standardized, holistic approach to care that is useful for the collection of subjective and objective data across clinical settings, cultures, populations, ages, and health conditions. Data is collected within a nursing framework and used by the nurse within the nurse-patient care experience to develop patient problems (tentative hypotheses), test and validate clinical judgments/nursing diagnoses. The goal of assessment is to determine an individual's perception of optimal functional health, as determined by assessing the eleven FHPs (Gordon, 2008, 1994).

The FHP assessment describes client strengths and functions, lifestyle management, and overall health status for each pattern. $\triangleright$ Table 7.1 shows the FHP and some potential questions that could be explored at each pattern. Phenomena of concern identified by the nurse help to guide care and increase the visibility of nursing's contribution to patient outcomes.

During the assessment, data obtained within each pattern create a story that incorporates information about the patient's health, including her response to acute and chronic illnesses. When nurses engage the individual in a

FHP assessment, they use purposeful questioning and branching (or expanded questions) to obtain an unfolding picture of functional health. As data are collected and considered, the information obtained provides an individual's perceptions of function, along with objective (measurable) data about her health. When the assessment is completed, information from all eleven patterns is then synthesized by the nurse, and risks, problems and strengths are identified (Jones, 2013).

Therefore, it is essential to assess all eleven health patterns before making a clinical judgment about the information under analysis. $\downarrow$ Table 7.1 can be used to capture critical data about the person's usual responses, as well as changes within patterns. In addition, it is important to remember that all assessment data within each pattern are open to revision. When data change, a re-synthesis of data and a reevaluation of the original nursing diagnoses identified is required.

Types of assessment formats within FHP. There are several types of data collection formats within in the FHP assessment framework. These include partial, screening, and in-depth assessments. A partial assessment refers to data collected within several patterns at a given point in time. For example, the nurse may collect data about the nutritional metabolic pattern or activity/ exercise for a patient with obesity. Again, while assessment data about a pattern are collected, it is critical the no clinical judgment be finalized until data from all eleven patterns is obtained.

A screening assessment may be similar to a partial assessment, but could also contain limited information from all eleven functional patterns. A data collection form might require inclusion of vital signs, for example. The nurse obtains and inputs those data into the assessment form. The form requires that information is collected about the patient's various physiologic systems,
and the nurse completes all the blank spaces on the form that deal with this system (heart rhythm, presence of a murmur, pedal pulses, lung sounds, bowel sounds, etc.), along with basic psychosocial and spiritual data. Until a more complete database involving the patient's story is included in the assessment, information needed to confirm the nursing diagnosis may not be sufficient (Jones \& Lunney et al., 2011; Lunney, 2009).

A full assessment involves complete evaluation of all health patterns. The process usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour to complete. The nurse generates a series of initial questions, and then follow up questions, to explore patient perceptions of each pattern (Herdman \& Kamitsuru, 2018; Gordon, 2004, 1994; Jones \& Lepley, 1986). A complete assessment of all eleven health patterns can help the nurse determine if there are other human responses occurring that are of concern, indicate risks, or that suggest health promotion opportunities. A full assessment is critical to data synthesis, identification of a nursing diagnosis, and identification of the etiology or precipitating factors of these areas of concern that can guide interventions, and promote achievement of the desired outcome for the patient.

Instruments used to measure FHPs. A recent integrative literature review aimed to identify essential patient data used by nurses in research, education, and clinical practice, in order to update a standardized comprehensive nursing assessment screening tool. Taking into account the huge number of publications addressing different assessment tools, the search was narrowed to the tools based on the FHP, or on minimum data set (MDS) elements. This search strategy recalled 384 manuscripts in three databases, among which 14 were included in the final sample. Of these, 11 validated items or tools for nursing assessment were identified.

Eight studies that were selected focused on physiological and psychosocial functioning. Ranegger, Hackl and Ammenwerth (2014) identified that patient demographics, medical condition, problems (nursing assessment and diagnosis, risk assessment), nursing outcomes, nursing interventions, nursing intensity, and healthcare institutional data should be elements of the Austrian nursing MDS. Shimanouchi, Uchida, Kamei, Sasaki and Shinoda (2001) found that the refinement of the assessment form for home care, which included information on the family, caregiver, living situation, and nursing care significantly shortened documentation time and helped with the identification of client's needs.

Three tools used the FHP framework to assess patients with head and neck cancer and older adults, and to use in clinical and teaching settings. All tools had some modification of the FHPs, either with additions, removals, changing
names, or combining of two FHP together. Beyea \& Matzo (1989) and Fernández-Sola, Granero-Molina, Mollinedo-Mallea, Gonzales, AguileraManrique \& Ponce (2012) did not integrate physical assessment in the FHP assessment, so they added a physical examination section to their tools. In the tool developed by Rodrigues, Cunha, Aquino, Rocha, Mendes, Firmeza, et al. (2018) Activity/Exercise and Sleep/Rest were integrated into one pattern, called Activity/Rest, a Safety/protection section was added, and another FHP was renamed.

Standardized tools developed within Gordon's FHPs are available in the literature (Rodriquez, Cunha, et al., 2018, Zega, D'Agostino, 2014, Jones, Barrett, et al., 1997). In particular, the Functional Health Pattern Assessment Screening Tool (FHPAST) is a comprehensive, reliable, and valid tool aimed at screening patients' FHP (Jones \& Foster, 1999).

The Functional Health Pattern Assessment Screening Tool (FHPAST). Screening assessment tools are often used in response to challenges with time and patient availability (Jones, 2013). Each item is presented in declarative sentence, based on the FHP definitions and relevant literature. The original tool has been adapted over the years, based on additional research, which resulted in the current tool having 57 items which are representative of the 11 FHPs (Jones, Foster, Flanagan \& Duffy, 2012; Beyea \& Matzo,1989). Current revisions are underway.

The FHPAST is useful in clinical practice to map health problems or risks and inform patients' responses to illness, or changes in health status over time. Additionally, it provides clinicians and researchers with information on patients' readiness for health, describes responsiveness to nursing interventions, and provides data on patient outcomes (Jones, Foster, Flanagan \& Duffy, 2012).

Responses to the screening questions are completed by the patient, or by someone designated by the patient (e.g., family member or a nurse). In practice, the nurse can review data from the FHPAST prior to seeing the patient, isolate patient problems or risks, and seek additional information and conduct pattern exploration during a more complete assessment. The FHPAST can serve as a guide for nursing assessment, as it allows the nurse to respond to patient concerns quickly, and provides information about his changing health status, or helps to identify risks of strengths.

Translation and the FHPAST. Over the years, the FHPAST has been translated into many languages. To enable clinicians and researchers to use the FHPAST in other cultures, the translation, cultural adaptation, and validation in a sample representative of that culture is required. For example, Barros,

Michel, \& Nobrega (2003) validated the 58-item version of the FHPAST in Brazil. Although the tool that was translated into Portuguese had excellent reliability, the authors mentioned that further language adaptation was needed in order for the FHPAST to be sensitive to the Brazilian culture. A more recent tool is under review and has been revised for further validation of the FHPAST-revised Brazilian version (FHPAST-VBR).

8 Clinical Application: Data Analysis to Determine Appropriate Nursing Diagnosis
}

\subsection*{8.1 Clustering of Information/Seeing a Pattern}

In the previous chapter, we discussed objective and subjective data collection. Once the nurse has collected data and transformed it into information, the next step is to begin to answer the question: what are my patient's human responses? This requires the substantive knowledge of a variety of theories and models from nursing, as well as several related disciplines. And, as previously noted, it requires knowledge about the concepts that underlie the nursing diagnoses themselves.

In other words, assessment techniques are meaningless if we do not know how to use the data we collect! Figure X provides an example of how objective and subjective data can be converted to information through the application of nursing knowledge for a case study of Mrs. H, a 36 -year-old woman with an HbA 1 c of $9.0 \%$ and an exudative ulcer on the medial malleolar region. If the nurse who assessed Mrs. H did not know the normal blood glucose level, he would not have been able to interpret that patient's HbA1c as being abnormal. If he did not understand theories related to tissue integrity, pain, and blood glucose level management, then he might not identify other susceptibilities or problem responses exhibited by this woman.

\subsection*{8.2 Identifying Potential Nursing Diagnoses (Diagnostic Hypotheses)}

At this point in the decision-making, or problem-solving process, the nurse looks at the information that is coming together to form a pattern; it provides him with a way of seeing what human responses the patient may be experiencing. Initially, the nurse considers all potential diagnoses that may come to mind. In the expert nurse, this can happen in seconds - for novice or student nurses, it may take support from more expert nurses or faculty members to guide their thinking.

Seeing patterns in the data requires an understanding of the concept that supports each diagnosis. For example, you might find yourself providing care to Mr. K, who has been hospitalized for 14 days due to an infected ankle ulcer, which became septic. Mr. K used to live with his daughter and primary caregiver, Janine, his son-in-law, Don, and his two grandchildren (ages 3 and 6).

Janine and Don had agreed to separate two months before. While handling divorce arrangements, Janine started looking for a job and interviewing candidates to serve as caregivers to Mr. K, when his ankle wound infected and he had to be taken to the hospital with respiratory discomfort.

Mr. K is expected to be discharged the following week. During the visiting hours, Janine is clearly tired, and admits she has not been able to get much sleep because she has not been able to find a job yet and she does not want to place Mr. K in a nursing home, but she is afraid that she will not be able to afford a caregiver.

Throughout your conversation with Janine, you observe that she seems frustrated and nervous, and she frequently refers to not being sure if she has been doing the right thing for Mr. K and her children. She is sure that her lack of care during the divorce process caused his father to have the infection. She is clearly very concerned about her father, but also mentions that her younger daughter had almost been run over by a car the day before, because she dozed off while watching her play and nearly missed her running towards the traffic.

What does all of this tell you? Unless you have a good understanding of family dynamics, stress, coping, role strain and grief theories, it may not tell you very much at all! You may know that Mr. K has a severe infection. But would you know to also focus on the family, and look for a cause (related factors) or other data (defining characteristics) to determine an accurate diagnosis for Janine?

Although you might be assigned to Mr. K, if you aren't attentive to what is happening in the family, are you truly attending to Mr. K's needs? Such a situation can lead to the nurse simply focusing on the patient of record, rather than considering the family and its impact on patient outcomes. Or, if the nurse did realize the need to address what is happening with Janine, but did not have good baseline knowledge of the previously noted theories, she might simply "pick a diagnosis" from a list to describe his response. Conceptual knowledge of each nursing diagnosis allows the nurse to assign accurate meanings to the data collected from the patient, and prepares her to perform the in-depth assessment.

When you have this type of conceptual knowledge, you will begin to look at the data you collect in a different way. You will turn that data into information, and begin to observe how that information starts to group together to form patterns, or to "paint a picture" of what might be happening with your patient. Take another look at $\boldsymbol{-}$ Fig. 8.1. With conceptual nursing knowledge of blood glucose level, tissue integrity, pain theories and pain management,

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_26_0fd2cb78757565eb0be7g-130.jpg?height=951&width=1038&top_left_y=214&top_left_x=195}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 8.1 The case of Mrs. H: converting data to information}
\end{figure}
you might begin to see the information as possible tentative nursing diagnoses, such as:
- Risk for unstable blood glucose level (00179)
- Impaired tissue integrity (00044)
- Acute pain (00132)

It is not enough, however, to merely "select/choose/pick" a diagnosis label. Unfortunately, this step is often where nurses stop - they develop a list of diagnoses, and either launch directly into action (determining interventions) or they simply "pick" one of the nursing diagnoses that sounds most appropriate for a patient's medical condition, based on what they think the nursing diagnosis label represents, and then move on to selecting interventions for those diagnoses. Others may determine that they wish to obtain a certain outcome, and simply aim interventions at that outcome. These are not appropriate methods for diagnosing, and can lead to poor patient outcomes.

Determining a nursing diagnosis requires synthesizing all of the information available to determine what the real problem might be, based on objective and subjective data (defining characteristics), and what you think may be causing the response (related factors), in order to plan the best interventions and achieve the desired outcome. Unless we know the problem and its cause (etiology), the interventions selected may be completely inappropriate for this particular patient. For diagnoses to be accurate, they must be validated - and that requires additional, in-depth assessment based upon data unique to each patient to confirm or to refute, or "rule out", the possibility of a diagnosis. Only when we use nursing knowledge, and reflect on the patient's manifestation of his response to the health/illness experience, can a nursing diagnosis be generated: this is the essence of diagnosing the response of an individual, caregiver, group, or community.

\subsection*{8.3 Refining the Diagnosis}

As you review information from your assessment it is important to determine if the responses (probabilities) are normal responses, abnormal (or unusual responses), represent a risk (susceptibility) or a strength. Those items that are not considered normal, or were seen as a susceptibility, should be considered in relation to a problem-focused or risk diagnosis. Areas in which the patient indicates a desire to improve something (for example, to enhance nutrition) should be considered as a potential health promotion diagnosis.

If some data are interpreted as abnormal, further in-depth assessment is crucial to accurately diagnose the patient. It is important to remember that if one simply collects data to complete a required form, without considering the importance of the data, this can lead to critical data being overlooked. Take another look at $\triangleright$ Fig. 8.1 which related to our first case in this chapter: Mrs. H. The nurse could have stopped his assessment here, and simply moved on to the diagnoses of risk for unstable blood glucose level, impaired tissue integrity, acute pain. He could have administered analgesics, applied a dressing, provided education about how to administer insulin correctly, how to apply dressings, and how to take the analgesics at home, for example. However, while all those things might be appropriate, he would have neglected to identify some major issues which are probably significant and which, if not addressed, will lead to continued issues with Mrs. H's status.

Mrs. H's nurse, however, understood the need for an in-depth assessment and was therefore able to identify her recent remarriage, potential areas of concern in her family processes, relationships, and personal identity ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 8.2). He

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_26_0fd2cb78757565eb0be7g-132.jpg?height=1821&width=1091&top_left_y=192&top_left_x=164}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 8.2 The case of Mrs. H: in-depth assessment}
\end{figure}
learned that Mrs. H had problems consistent with a stressful new life situation (recent remarriage, moving to her husband's house, family conflicts, change in exercise pattern, forgetting to take her insulin, arguing at work). However, he also identified that Mrs. H had an important strength in the support she received from her mother, and her verbalized desire to improve the way she was responding to this situation: these are all very important things to build into any plan of care! So, with this additional in-depth assessment, the nurse could now revise his potential diagnoses:
- Risk for unstable blood glucose level (00179)
- Impaired tissue integrity (00044)
- Acute pain (00132)
- Relocation stress syndrome (00114)
- Disturbed personal identity (00121)
- Dysfunctional family processes (00063)
- Ineffective relationship (00223)
- Interrupted family processes (00060)
- Impaired memory (00131)
- Readiness for enhanced resilience (00212)

\subsection*{8.4 Confirming/Refuting Potential Nursing Diagnoses}

Whenever new data is collected, and processed into information, it is time to reconsider our diagnostic hypotheses. During this period, there are three primary things to consider:
- Did the in-depth assessment provide new data that would rule out or eliminate one or more of your potential diagnoses?
- Did the in-depth assessment point toward new diagnoses that you had not previously considered?
- How can you differentiate between similar diagnoses?

It is essential that other nurses continue to validate the diagnosis, and to understand how you arrived at your diagnosis. It is for this reason that it is important to use standardized terms, such as the NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, which provide not only a label (e.g., dysfunctional family processes, Code 00063), but also a definition and assessment criteria (defining characteristics and related factors, or risk factors) so that other nursing professionals can continue to validate - or perhaps refute - the diagnosis as new data become available for the patient.

The nurse might create a term, such as ineffective family communication, to address the issues he identified when listening to Mrs. H talk about her communication with her new husband, and how her children and he relate to each other. But what does this diagnosis mean? How is it defined, and how would other nurses be able to recognize the diagnosis when they completed their assessments? Terms that are simply constructed by nurses at the bedside, without validated definitions and, most importantly, assessment criteria, have no consistent meaning and cannot be clinically validated or confirmed. When a NANDA-I nursing diagnosis does not exist that fits a pattern you identify in a patient, it is safer to describe the condition in detail rather than to "make up" a term that will have different meanings to different nurses. If you asked ten nurses to define the "created" diagnosis of ineffective family communication, and to identify defining characteristics and related factors, it is quite possible you would have ten different definitions, and a laundry list of potential diagnostic indicators. This is neither helpful nor safe when we are considering the health and well-being of the patients for whom we provide care.

\subsection*{8.5 Eliminating Possible Diagnoses}

One of the goals of in-depth assessment is to eliminate, or "rule out", one or more of the potential diagnoses you were considering. You do this by synthesizing the information you have obtained, and comparing it to what you know about the diagnoses. It is critical that the assessment data support each diagnosis. Diagnoses that are not well supported through the assessment criteria provided by NANDA-I (defining characteristics, related/risk factors) and/or that are not supported by etiological factors (causes or contributors to the diagnoses) are not appropriate for a patient. It is important to remember that nurses must be able to independently address related (or risk) factors. In other words, medical diagnoses or physician-ordered treatments are not related (or risk) factors, although they may be associated conditions. If the nurse cannot independently resolve or diminish the effect of an etiological factor, then it is not a related (or risk) factor.

As we look at $\boldsymbol{-}$ Fig. 8.2 and consider the potential diagnoses that Mrs. H's nurse identified, we can begin to eliminate some of these as valid diagnoses. Sometimes it is helpful to do a side-to-side comparison of the diagnoses, focusing on those defining characteristics and related factors that were identified throughout the assessment and patient history. An example of a comparison of diagnoses within one domain is provided in ( $\triangleright$ Table 8.1).

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Table 8.1 The case of Mrs. H: comparing diagnoses in the same domain}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Diagnosis & Dysfunctional family processes & Ineffective relationship & Interrupted family processes \\
\hline Domain & 7. Role relationship & 7. Role relationship & 7. Role relationship \\
\hline Class & 2. Family relationships & 3. Role performance & 2. Family relationships \\
\hline Definition & Family functioning which fails to support the well-being of its members. & A pattern of mutual partnership that is insufficient to provide for each other's needs. & Break in the continuity of family functioning which fails to support the wellbeing of its members \\
\hline Defining characteristics & - Contradictory communication pattern & - Inadequate balance in collaboration & - Power alliance change \\
\hline & - Escalating conflict & between partners & - Ritual change \\
\hline & - Difficulty adapting to change & - Dissatisfaction with complementary & - Changes in relationship pattern \\
\hline & - Verbal abuse of children & relationship between partners & - Changes in participation for decision- \\
\hline & - Reports tension & - Unsatisfying communication with partner & \\
\hline & & & \\
\hline & & & \\
\hline Related/Risk factors & - Inadequate coping strategies & - Inadequate communication skills & - Difficulty dealing with shift in family roles \\
\hline & - Inadequate problem-solving skills & - Excessive stress & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For example, Mrs. H's nurse quickly eliminates from consideration the diagnoses, relocation stress syndrome and impaired memory. Although Mrs. H does indicate she fells tense all the time, the nurse considers that this is more related to her personal identity, family processes, and relationship, than to a disturbance following the move from one environment to another, or a persistent inability to remember something.

\subsection*{8.6 Potential New Diagnoses}

It is very possible, such as in the case of Mrs. H ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 8.2) that new data will lead to new information, and in turn, to new diagnoses. The same questions that you used to eliminate potential diagnoses should be used as you consider these diagnoses.

\subsection*{8.7 Differentiating Similar Diagnoses}

It is helpful to narrow down your potential diagnoses by considering those that are very similar, but that have a distinctive feature which makes one more relevant to the patient than the other. Let's take another look at our patient, Mrs. H. After the in-depth assessment, the nurse had 11 potential diagnoses; two diagnoses were eliminated, leaving 9 potential diagnoses. One way to start the process of differentiation is to look at where the diagnoses are located within the NANDA-I taxonomy. This gives you a clue about how the diagnoses are grouped together into the broad area of nursing knowledge (domain) and the subcategories, or group of diagnoses with similar attributes (class).

After eliminating two diagnoses, her nurse is considering: three diagnoses in the role relationship domain (dysfunctional family processes, ineffective relationship and interrupted family processes), two diagnoses in the coping/stress tolerance domain (ineffective coping and readiness for enhanced resilience); one in the nutrition domain (risk for unstable blood glucose level), one in the self-perception domain (disturbed personal identity), and one in the safety/ protection domain (impaired tissue integrity), and one in the comfort domain (acute pain). The nurse realizes that dysfunctional family processes, ineffective relationship, interrupted family processes, and disturbed personal identity cluster into disturbed family identity syndrome (00283).

When reviewing patient information in light of similar nursing diagnoses, consider the following questions:
- Do the diagnoses share a similar focus, or is it different?
- If the diagnoses share a similar focus, is one more focused/specific than the other?
- Does one diagnosis potentially lead to another that I have identified? That is, could it be the causative factor of that other diagnosis?

As the nurse considers what he knows about Mrs. H, he can look at the responses he identified as potential diagnoses in light of these questions. Mrs. H clearly has a diabetes-related injury (impaired tissue integrity), it appears that her susceptibility for a variation in serum levels of glucose from the normal range (risk for unstable blood glucose level) is actually a consequence of her excessive stress due to disturbed family identity syndrome. Therefore, although the nurse is concerned about her pain and will need to treat her injury, he believes he can best address these issues for the long-term by addressing her disturbed family identity syndrome, which he believes is the underlying causes of her current health status.

After talking with Mrs. H, it appears that using the health promotion diagnosis, readiness for enhanced resilience, will best support her in setting goals around her blood glucose level management and family identity, while reinforcing her ability to regain control over her life and improving her resilience.

The nurse recognizes that she has verbalized a desire to improve her resilience, and feels that working with her on this issue from a health promotion perspective (readiness for enhanced resilience) could be more positive for her. This, coupled with the previously mentioned belief that goal setting could be used within this diagnosis to address risk for unstable blood glucose level, makes this diagnosis more appropriate for Mrs. H. He feels it is imperative to acknowledge her family identity, and to work with her on this response.

Finally, it is important to manage the acute pain that Mrs. H is experiencing. Because one of the goals is to get her more active to improve blood glucose levels, and to assist with overall wellbeing, it is important to increase her comfort so that her pain does not prohibit her from increasing her level of activity.

\subsection*{8.8 Diagnosing/Prioritizing}

After completing your assessment, identifying response patterns, generating, refining and finalizing the nursing diagnosis(es) along with an etiology, nursing interventions can be planned mutually with your patient. After reviewing everything he learned about his patient, Mrs. H, the nurse may have determined six key diagnoses:
- Risk for unstable blood glucose level (00179)
- Impaired tissue integrity (00044)
- Acute pain (00132)
- Disturbed family identity syndrome (00283)
- Readiness for enhanced resilience (00212)

Remember that the nursing process, which includes continuous re-evaluation of the diagnosis, is an ongoing process. This means that as more data becomes available, or as the patient's condition changes, the diagnoses may also change - or the prioritization may change. Think back for a moment to the initial screening assessment the nurse performed on Mrs. H. Do you see that, without further follow up, he would have missed the very important diagnosis of disturbed family identity syndrome, along with the health promotion opportunity for Mrs. E (readiness for enhanced resilience), and he might have designed a plan to address issues that would not have resolved her underlying issues?

Can you see why the idea of just "picking" a nursing diagnosis to go along with the medical diagnosis simply isn't the way to go? The in-depth, ongoing assessment provided so much more information about Mrs. H, that can be used to determine not only the appropriate diagnoses, but realistic outcomes and interventions that will best meet her individual needs.

\subsection*{8.9 Summary}

Assessment is a critical role of professional nurses, and requires disciplinary knowledge of nursing theories, concepts, and foci of concern to the discipline upon on which nursing diagnoses are developed. Collecting data only for the sake of completing some mandatory form or computer screen is a waste of time, and it certainly does not support individualized care for our patients. Establishing an effective nurse-patient relationship enables the nurse to come to know the person and his/her experiences with health and illness. Having an organized approach to a nursing assessment, such as Gordon's Functional Health Pattern assessment, provides the nurse with an assessment framework that can guide data collection to appropriately diagnose, and to identify causative factors which will be responsive to nursing interventions and evidence-driven outcomes. Developing, refining, and prioritizing nursing diagnoses based upon data analysis and synthesis, is the hallmark of professional nursing.

Assessing, followed by synthesizing of data, is essential for diagnosing. Selecting nursing diagnoses without assessment can result in inaccurate diagnoses, inappropriate outcomes, and ineffective and/or unnecessary interventions for diagnoses that are not relevant to the patient - and may lead to completely missing the most important clinical judgment about your patient!

9 Introduction to the NANDA International Taxonomy of Nursing Diagnoses
}

\author{
T. Heather Herdman, Shigemi Kamitsuru
}

\subsection*{9.1 Introduction to Taxonomy}

NANDA International, Inc. provides a standardized terminology of nursing diagnoses, and it presents its diagnoses in a classifications scheme, more specifically a taxonomy. It is important to understand a little bit about a taxonomy, and how taxonomy differs from terminology. So, let us take a moment to talk about what taxonomy actually represents.

A terminology is the body of terms used with a particular technical application in a subject of study, profession, etc. (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).

With regard to nursing, the NANDA-I nursing diagnosis terminology includes the defined terms (labels) that are used to describe clinical judgments made by professional nurses: the diagnoses themselves. A definition of the NANDA-I taxonomy might be "a systematic ordering of phenomena/clinical judgments that define the knowledge of the nursing discipline". More simply put, the NANDA -I taxonomy of nursing diagnoses is a classification schema to help us organize the concepts of concern (nursing judgments or nursing diagnoses) for nursing practice. A classification is the arrangement of related phenomena in taxonomic groups according to their observed similarities; a category into which something is put (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).

A taxonomy is the branch of science concerned with classification, especially of organisms; systematics (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020). A taxonomy can be compared to a filing cabinet - in a drawer (domain) you may file all information you have related to your bills/debts. Within that drawer, you may have individual file folders (classes) for different types of bills/debt: household, automobile, health care, child care, animal care, etc. Within each file folder (class), you would then have individual bills representing each type of debt (nursing diagnoses). The current biological taxonomy originated with Carl Linnaeus in 1735. He originally identified three kingdoms (animal, plant, and mineral), which were then divided into classes, orders, families, genera, and species (Quammen 2007). You probably learned about the revised biological taxonomy in a basic science class in your high school or university setting.

Terminology, on the other hand, is the language that is used to describe a specific thing; it is the language used in a particular discipline to describe its knowledge. Therefore, the nursing diagnoses form a discipline-specific language, so when we want to talk about the diagnoses themselves, we are talking about the terminology of nursing knowledge. When we want to talk about the way that we structure or categorize the NANDA-I diagnoses, then we are talking about the taxonomy.

Classification systems in health care denote disciplinary knowledge and demonstrate how a specific group of professionals perceive what are the significant areas of knowledge of the discipline. Therefore, a classification system in health care has multiple functions, including to
- provide a view of the knowledge and practice area of a specific profession.
- organize phenomena in a way that refers to changes in health, processes, and mechanisms that are of concern to the professional.
- show the logical connection between factors that can be controlled or manipulated by professionals in the discipline (von Krogh 2011).

Let us think about taxonomy as it relates to something we all deal with in our daily lives. When you need to buy food, you go to the grocery store. Suppose that there is a new store in your neighborhood, Classified Groceries, Inc., so you decide to go there to do your shopping. When you enter the store, you notice that the layout seems very different from your regular store, but the person greeting you at the door hands you a diagram to help you learn your way around ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 9.1).

You can see that this store has organized the grocery items into eight main categories or grocery store aisles: proteins, grain products, vegetables, fruits, processed foods, snack foods, deli foods, and beverages. These categories/aisles could also be called "domains" - they are broad levels of classification that divide phenomena into main groups. In this case, the phenomena represent "groceries".

You may also have noticed that the diagram does not just show the eight aisles; each aisle has a few key phrases identified that further help us to understand what types of foods would be found in each aisle. For example, in the aisle (domain) entitled "Beverages", we see six subcategories: "Coffee", "Tea", "Soda", "Water", "Beer/hard cider", and "Wine/sake". Another way of saying this would be that these subcategories are "Classes" of products that are found under the "Domain" of beverages.

One of the rules people try to follow when they develop a taxonomy is that the classes should be mutually exclusive - in other words, one type of grocery

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_26_0fd2cb78757565eb0be7g-142.jpg?height=1801&width=1093&top_left_y=192&top_left_x=164}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Fig. 9.1 Domains and classes of Classified Groceries, Inc.}
\end{figure}
product should not be found in multiple classes. This is not always possible, but this should still be the goal, because it makes it much clearer for people who want to use the structure. If you find cheddar cheese in the protein aisle, but find cheddar cheese spread in the snack foods aisle, it makes it hard for people to understand the classification system that is being used.

Looking back at our store diagram, there is additional information to be added ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 9.2). Each of the grocery aisles is further explained, providing a more detailed level of information about the groceries that are found in the various aisles. As an example, Fig. 9.2 shows the detailed information provided on the "Beverages" aisle. You will note the six "classes" along with additional detail for each of those classes. These represent various types (or concepts) of beverage products, all of which share similar properties that cluster them together into one group.

Given the information with which we have been provided, we could easily manage our shopping list. If we wanted to find some herbal soda, we would quickly be able to find the aisle marked "Beverages", the shelf marked "Sodas", and we could confirm that herbal sodas would be found there. Likewise, if we wanted some loose leaf green tea, we would again look at the aisle marked "Beverages", find the shelf marked "Tea", and then we would find "Green loose leaf teas".

The purpose of this grocery taxonomy is to help the shopper quickly determine what section of the store contains the grocery supplies that he/she wants to buy. Without this information, the shopper would have to walk up and down each aisle and try to make sense of what products were in which aisle; depending on the size of the store, this could be a very frustrating and confusing experience! Thus, the diagram being provided by the store personnel provides a "concept map", or a guide for shoppers to quickly understand how the groceries have been classified into locations within the store, with the goal of improving the shopping experience.

By now, you are probably getting a good idea of the difficulty of developing a taxonomy that reflects the concepts it is trying to classify in a clear, concise, and consistent manner. Thinking about our grocery store example, can you imagine different ways that items in the store could be grouped together?

This example of a grocery taxonomy may not meet the goal of avoiding overlap between concepts and classes in a way that is logical for all shoppers. For example, tomato juice is found in the domain Vegetables (vegetable juices), but not in the domain Beverages. Although one group of individuals might find this categorization logical and clear, others might suggest that all beverages should be together. What is important is that the distinction

between the domains is well-defined, i.e., all vegetables and vegetable products are found within the vegetable domain, whereas the beverage domain contains beverages that are not vegetable-based. The problem with this distinction might be that we could then argue that wine and hard cider should be in the fruit aisle, and beer and sake should be in the grain aisle!

Taxonomies are works in progress - they continue to grow, evolve, and even dramatically change as more knowledge is developed about the area of study. There is often significant debate about what structure is best for categorizing phenomena of concern to different disciplines. There are many ways of categorizing things, and truly, there is no "absolutely right" way. The goal is to find a logical, consistent way to categorize similar things while avoiding overlap between the concepts and the classes. For users of taxonomies, the goal is to understand how it classifies similar concepts into its domains and classes to quickly identify specific concepts as needed.

\subsection*{9.2 Organizing Nursing Knowledge}

Professions organize their formal knowledge into consistent, logical, conceptualized dimensions so that it reflects the professional domain and makes it relevant for clinical practice. For professionals in health care, the knowledge of diagnosis is a significant part of professional knowledge and is essential for clinical practice. Knowledge of nursing diagnoses must therefore be organized in a way that legitimizes professional nursing practice and consolidates the nursing profession's jurisdiction (Abbott 1988).

Within the NANDA-I nursing diagnostic taxonomy, we use a hierarchical graphic to show our domains and classes ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 9.3). The diagnoses themselves are not depicted in this graphic, although they could be. The primary reason we do not include the diagnoses is that there are 267 of them, and that would make the graphic very large - and very hard to read!

In nursing, it is most important that the diagnoses are classified in a way that makes sense clinically, so that when a nurse is trying to identify a diagnosis that he/she may not see very often in practice, he/she can logically use the taxonomy to find the appropriate information on possible related diagnoses. Although the NANDA-I Taxonomy II ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 9.3) is not intended to function as a nursing assessment framework, it does provide structure for classifying nursing diagnoses into domains and classes, each of which is clearly defined.

To provide an example of what it would look like if we included the nursing diagnoses in the graphic representation of the taxonomy, Fig. 9.4 shows

only one domain with its classes and nursing diagnoses. As you can see, this is a lot of information to depict in graphic form.

Nursing knowledge includes individual, family, group, and community responses, risks, and strengths. According to von Krogh (2011), the NANDAI taxonomy is meant to function in the following ways; it should
- provide a model, or cognitive map, of the knowledge of the nursing discipline.
- communicate that knowledge, and those perspectives and theories.
- provide structure and order for that knowledge.
- serve as a support tool for clinical reasoning.
- provide a way to organize nursing diagnoses within an electronic health record.

\subsection*{9.3 Using NANDA-I Taxonomy}

Although the taxonomy provides a way of categorizing nursing phenomena, it can also serve other functions. It can help faculty to develop a nursing curriculum, for example, and it can help a nurse identify a diagnosis, perhaps one that he/she may not use frequently, but that he/she needs for a specific patient. Let us look at both situations.

\subsection*{9.3.1 Structuring Nursing Curricula}

Although the NANDA-I nursing taxonomy is not intended to be a nursing assessment framework, it can support the organization of undergraduate education. For example, curricula can be developed around the domains and classes, allowing courses to be taught that are based on the core concepts of nursing practice, and which are categorized in each of the NANDA-I domains.

A course might be built around the Role relationship domain ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 9.4) with units based on each of the classes. In Unit 1, the focus could be on caregiving roles, and the concept of parenting would be explored in depth. What is it? How does it impact individual and family health? What are some of the common parenting problems that our patients encounter? In what types of patients might we be most likely to identify these conditions? What are the primary etiologies? What are the consequences if these conditions go undiagnosed and/or untreated? How can we prevent, treat, and/or improve these conditions? How can we manage the symptoms?

Building a nursing curriculum around these key concepts of nursing knowledge enables students to truly understand and build expertise in the knowledge of nursing science, while also learning about and understanding related medical diagnoses and conditions which they will encounter in everyday practice.

Designing nursing courses in this way enables students to learn a lot about the disciplinary knowledge of nursing. Attachment, family processes, relationship, role conflict, role performance, and social interaction are some of the key concepts of Domain 7, Role relationship ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 9.4) - they are the "neutral states" that we must understand before we can identify potential or actual problems with these responses.

Understanding role performance, for example, as a core concept of nursing practice, requires a strong understanding of anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology (including related medical diagnoses), and responses from other domains that might coincide with problems in balanced nutrition. Once you truly understand the concept of balanced nutrition (the "normal" or neutral state), identifying the abnormal state is much easier because you know what you should be seeing if role performance were effective, and if you don't see those data, you start to suspect that there might be a problem (or a risk may exist for a problem to develop). So, developing nursing courses around these core concepts enables nursing faculty to focus on the knowledge of the nursing discipline and then to incorporate related medical diagnoses and/or interdisciplinary concerns in a way that allows nurses to focus first on nursing phenomena and then to bring their specific knowledge to an interdisciplinary view of the patient to improve
patient care. This then moves into content on realistic patient outcomes and evidence-based interventions that nurses will utilize (dependent and independent nursing interventions) to provide the best possible care for the patient to achieve outcomes for which nurses have accountability.

\subsection*{9.3.2 Identifying Nursing Diagnoses Outside Area of Expertise}

Nurses gain expertise in those nursing diagnoses that they most commonly see in their clinical practice. If your area of interest is reproductive health nursing practice, then your expertise may include such key concepts as sexual function, childbearing process, breastfeeding, and parenting, just to name a few! But you will deal with patients who, despite being primarily in your care because of a complication of pregnancy, will also have other issues that require your attention. The NANDA-I taxonomy can help you to identify potential diagnoses for these patients and support your clinical reasoning skills by clarifying what assessment data/diagnostic indicators are necessary for quickly, but accurately, diagnosing your patients.

Perhaps, as you are admitting a 36 -year old patient, Miss K, with a 34 week pregnancy for the treatment of severe pre-eclampsia, you notice that she is restless and tense. Your patient tells you that she did not receive prenatal care, due to her former partner's domestic violence and stalking; she has been staying at a shelter with her 3 -year-old daughter for the last three months. Her parents died from a large mudslide when she was 12, and she grew up in an orphanage. Despite having no relatives or close friends to rely upon for help, Miss K has overcome many difficulties. Her body mass index (BMI) is 38.6. She has chronic hypertension, but has not taken her antihypertensive medication for one year, because she has not been able to afford the prescription. Her current blood pressure is $168 / 110$. She is anxious about the possible emergency delivery.

You have not cared for many patients with a complex background such as you are now encountering with Miss K. You want to reflect her risk and/or problems, but you are not sure which nursing diagnosis is the most accurate for this patient in this situation. By looking at the taxonomy, you can quickly form a "cognitive map" that can help you to find more information on diagnoses of relevance to this patient ( $\triangleright$ Fig. 9.5).

You are concerned about Miss K's response related to her resilience, and a quick review of the taxonomy leads you to Domain 9 (coping/stress tolerance), Class 2 (coping responses). You then see that there are three diagnoses specifically related to resilience, and you can review the definitions and diagnostic indicators to clarify the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.

Using the taxonomy in this way supports clinical reasoning and helps you to navigate a large volume of information/knowledge (267 diagnoses!) in an effective and efficient manner. A review of the risk factors or the related factors and defining characteristics of these three diagnoses can: (1) provide you with additional data that you need to obtain in order to make an informed decision and/or (2) enable you to compare your assessment with those diagnostic indicators to accurately diagnose your patient.

Think about a recent patient - did you struggle to diagnose his/her human response? Did you find it difficult to know how to identify potential diagnoses? Using the taxonomy can support you in identifying possible diagnoses because of the way the diagnoses are grouped together in classes and domains that represent specific areas of knowledge. Do not forget, however, that simply looking at the diagnosis label and "picking a diagnosis" is not safe care! You need to review the definition and diagnostic indicators (defining characteristics, related factors, or risk factors) for each of the potential diagnoses you identify, which will help you to identify what additional data you should collect or if you have enough data to accurately diagnose the patient's human response.

Let us review the case study of Mr. S to understand how you might use the taxonomy to help you to identify potential diagnoses.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\section*{Case Study: Mr. S}

Let us suppose that your patient, Mr. S, an 87-year-old widower, presents with complaints of severe, shooting pain in his right hip area. He has been living in an assisted living facility for two years, since his wife died, and the staff members there have noticed that he is very agitated and shows signs of severe pain whenever they try to help him walk. They have brought him in to rule out any possible fracture or need for a hip replacement. They note that he had his other hip replaced three years ago, due to osteoporosis. Apparently, the surgery was very successful.

Mr. S has no noticeable edema or bruising to his right hip area, but clearly complains of pain when you palpate the area. He has good lower extremity bilateral peripheral pulses and a lower extremity capillary refill time of 4 seconds. His medical history includes a cerebrovascular attack (stroke) at age 80. According to his medical records, he had initial paralysis on the right side and lost all speech function. He received alteplase IV r-tPA, a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), and recovered full mobility and speech. He was in an inpatient rehabilitation center for 26 days, received speech, physical and occupational therapy, and cared for himself independently after he was discharged home. He has moderate coronary artery disease, but otherwise no significant medical history. According to the staff member accompanying him, Mr. S has been active until a few weeks ago when he started to complain of pain. He enjoyed ballroom dancing, exercised at the facility on a regular basis, and was frequently seen walking around the complex speaking to people, or taking walks outdoors on the grounds of the complex when the weather was nice. She also indicates he has become less social recently, and has not attended different activities that he normally enjoys. She indicates the staff members have attributed this to his level of discomfort.

What you notice most about Mr. S, however, is that he seems withdrawn, he barely speaks, and rarely makes eye contact. He struggles to answer your questions, and the staff member often jumps in to provide answers rather than allowing him to answer for himself. Although his speech does not appear to be impaired, he seems to be struggling to find answers to even basic questions, such as his age or the year that his wife died.

After completing your assessment and reviewing his history, you believe that Mr. S may be dealing with an issue related to cognition, but this is an area of nursing in which you have little experience; you need some review of potential diagnoses. Since you are considering a cognition issue, you look at the NANDA-I taxonomy to identify the logical location of these diagnoses. You identify that Domain 5, Perception/cognition, deals with the human information processing system including attention, orientation, sensation, perception, cognition, and communication. Because you are considering issues related to cognition, you think this domain will contain diagnoses of relevance to Mr. S.

You then quickly identify Class 4, Cognition. A review of this class leads to the identification of three potential diagnoses: acute confusion, chronic confusion, and impaired memory.

Questions you should ask yourself include: What other human responses should I rule out or consider? What other signs/symptoms, or etiologies, should I look for to confirm this diagnosis?

Once you review the definitions and diagnostic indicators (related factors, defining characteristics, and risk factors), you diagnose Mr. S with chronic confusion (00129).

Some final questions should include: Am I missing anything? Am I diagnosing without sufficient evidence? If you believe you are correct in your diagnosis, your questions move on to: What outcomes can I realistically expect to achieve with Mr. S? What are the evidence-based nursing interventions that I should consider? How will I evaluate whether or not they were effective?

\subsection*{9.4 The NANDA-I Nursing Diagnosis Taxonomy II: A Short History}

In 1987, NANDA-I published Taxonomy I, which was structured to reflect nursing theoretical models from North America. In 2002, Taxonomy II was adopted, which was adapted from the Functional Health Patterns assessment framework of Dr. Marjory Gordon. This assessment framework is probably the most used nursing assessment framework around the world.
- Table 9.1 demonstrates the domains, classes, and nursing diagnoses and how they are currently located within the NANDA-I Taxonomy II.

10 Specifications and Definitions Within the NANDA International Taxonomy of Nursing Diagnoses

\subsection*{10.1 Structure of Taxonomy II}

Taxonomy is defined as the "system for naming and organizing things ... into groups that share similar qualities" (Cambridge Dictionary Online, 2017). Within the taxonomy, the domains are "an area of interest or an area over which one has control"; and the classes are "a group ... with similar structure" (Cambridge Dictionary Online, 2017).

We can adapt the definition for a nursing diagnosis taxonomy; specifically, we are concerned with the orderly classification of diagnostic foci of concern to nursing, according to their presumed natural relationships. Taxonomy II has three levels: domains, classes, and nursing diagnoses. $\downarrow$ Fig. 9.3 depicts the organization of domains and classes in Taxonomy II; $\triangleright$ Table 9.1 shows Taxonomy II with its 13 domains, 47 classes, and 267 current diagnoses.

The Taxonomy II code structure is a 32-bit integer (or if the user's database uses another notation, the code structure is a five-digit code). This structure provides for the stability, or growth and development, of the classification structure by avoiding the need to change codes when new diagnoses, refinements, and revisions are added. New codes are assigned to newly approved diagnoses.

Taxonomy II has a code structure that is compliant with recommendations from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) concerning health care terminology codes. The NLM recommends that codes do not contain information about the classified concept, as did the Taxonomy I code structure, which included information about the location and the level of the diagnosis.

The NANDA-I terminology is a recognized nursing language that meets the criteria established by the Committee for Nursing Practice Information Infrastructure (CNPII) of the American Nurses Association (ANA) (Lundberg et al., 2008). The benefit of a recognized nursing language is the indication that the classification system is accepted as supporting nursing practice by providing clinically useful terminology. The terminology is also registered with Health Level Seven International (HL7), a health care informatics standard, as a terminology to be used in identifying nursing diagnoses in electronic messages among clinical information systems (www.HL7.org).

\subsection*{10.2 NANDA-I Taxonomy II: A Multiaxial System}

The NANDA-I diagnoses are concepts constructed by means of a multiaxial system. An axis, for the purpose of the NANDA-I Taxonomy II, is operationally defined as a dimension of the human response that is considered in the diagnostic process. There are seven axes. The NANDA-I Model of a Nursing Diagnosis displays the seven axes and their relationship to each other.
- Axis 1: the focus of the diagnosis
- Axis 2: subject of the diagnosis (individual, family, group, caregiver, community, etc.)
- Axis 3: judgment (impaired, ineffective, etc.)
- Axis 4: location (oral, peripheral, cerebral, etc.)
- Axis 5: age (neonate, infant, child, adult, etc.)
- Axis 6: time (chronic, acute, intermittent)
- Axis 7: the status of the diagnosis.

The axes are represented in the labels of the nursing diagnoses through their values. In some cases they are named explicitly, such as with the diagnoses ineffective community coping and dysfunctional family processes, in which the subject of the diagnosis is named using the two values "community" and "family" taken from Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis). "Ineffective" and "dysfunctional" are two of the values contained in Axis 3 (judgment).

In some cases, the axis is implicit, as is the case with the diagnosis ineffective sexuality pattern, in which the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2 ) is always the patient. In some instances, an axis may not be pertinent to a diagnosis, and therefore is not part of the nursing diagnostic label. For example, the time axis may not be relevant to every diagnosis. In the case of diagnoses without explicit identification of the subject of the diagnosis, it may be helpful to remember that NANDA-I defines a patient as "an individual, a family, a group, or a community".

Axis 1 (the focus of the diagnosis) and Axis 3 (judgment) are essential components of a nursing diagnosis. In some cases, however, the focus of the diagnosis contains the judgment (e.g., fear); in these cases, the judgment is not explicitly separated from the focus of the diagnosis in the diagnostic label. Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis) is also essential, although, as described earlier, it may be implied and therefore not included in the label. The Diagnosis Development Committee requires these axes for submission; the other axes may be used where relevant for clarity.

A recent basic statistical analysis of diagnostic labels demonstrated that the 2018-2020 NANDA-I nursing diagnoses (ND) used Axis 1 (focus) in
association with different terms from the other axes, except in situations in which the ND label was a single word (e.g., anxiety, fear, obesity). Axis 3 (judgment) was the second most used axis, contributing to the construction of $82 \%$ of the ND. The remaining axes were used to a lesser extent, in $18 \%$ of the ND (Miguel, Romeiro, Martins, Casaleiro, Caldeira, \& Herdman, 2019).

Although there were some additions in the 2021-2023 release of the NANDA-I terminology, there remain few ND which address the elderly ( $n=2$ ), child and adolescent ( $n=9$ ), and neonatal ( $n=4$ ) populations within the ND label. Therefore, it seems the adequacy of ND to such populations, whose specificities make them unique when comparing them to the general population, may remain limited. The absence of a clinical picture consistent with those clients' reality - including differentiated defining characteristics, related and/or risk factors - and the complexity of decisions nurses undertake in caring for them, leads us to think that ND labels are far from being thoroughly developed (Miguel, Romeiro, Martins, Casaleiro, Caldeira, \& Herdman, 2019).

The adjustments of ND labels to particular contexts, environments, and populations - implicitly including the rights of clinical reasoning advocated by Levett-Jones et al. (2010) - could raise the quality of nursing care. In addition, it would provide the necessary evidence base for the NANDA-I terminology, corroborating the ND hierarchy within taxonomy II, or lead to an appeal for more adequate and clear domains and classes (Miguel, Romeiro, Martins, Casaleiro, Caldeira, \& Herdman, 2019).

NANDA-I supports developments in the specificity of ND labels, specifically regarding its multiaxial aspects, to increase the specificity and accuracy of the diagnostic process, which is known to be the core of clinical reasoning and practice.

\subsection*{10.3 Definitions of the Axes}

\subsection*{10.3.1 Axis 1: The Focus of the Diagnosis}

The focus of the diagnosis is the principal element or the fundamental and essential part, the root, of the diagnostic concept. It describes the "human response" that is the core of the diagnosis.

The focus of the diagnosis may consist of one or more nouns. When more than one noun is used (e.g., mood regulation), each one contributes a unique meaning to the focus of the diagnosis, as if the two were a single noun; the meaning of the combined term, however, is different from when the nouns are stated separately. Frequently, a noun (conflict) may be used with an adjective (decisional) to denote the focus of the diagnosis decisional conflict.

In some cases, the focus of the diagnosis and the diagnostic concept are one and the same, as is seen with the diagnosis of hyperthermia (00007). This occurs when the nursing diagnosis is stated at its most clinically useful level and the separation of the focus of the diagnosis adds no meaningful level of abstraction. It can be very difficult to determine exactly what should be considered the focus of the diagnosis. For example, using the diagnoses of bowel incontinence (00014) and stress urinary incontinence (00017), the question becomes: Is the focus of the diagnosis incontinence alone, or are there two foci - bowel incontinence and urinary incontinence? In this instance, incontinence is the focus and the location terms (Axis 4) of bowel and urinary provide more clarification about the focus. However, incontinence in and of itself is a judgment term that can stand alone, and so it becomes the focus of the diagnosis regardless of location.

In some cases, however, removing the location (Axis 4) from the diagnostic focus would prevent it from providing meaning to nursing practice. For example, if we look at the focus of the diagnosis risk for female genital mutilation, is the focus of the diagnosis genital mutilation or simply mutilation? Or if you look at the diagnosis impaired skin integrity, is the focus integrity or skin integrity? Decisions about what constitutes the essence of the focus of the diagnosis, then, are made on the basis of what helps to identify the nursing practice implication and whether or not the term indicates a human response. Mutilation could refer to an act or instance of destroying, removing, or severely damaging a limb - so it is important to identify female genital mutilation as the diagnostic focus. Similarly, integrity can mean the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles - again, these are characteristics but not human responses, and are completely unrelated to the diagnosis of impaired skin integrity; skin integrity, however, refers to the health of the skin, and is a human response. In some cases, the focus may seem similar, but is in fact quite distinct: violence and self-directed violence are two different human responses, and therefore must be identified separately in terms of diagnostic foci within Taxonomy II. The diagnostic foci of the NANDA-I nursing diagnoses are shown in $\triangleright$ Table 10.1.

\subsection*{10.3.2 Axis 2: Subject of the Diagnosis}

The subject of the diagnosis is defined as the person(s) for whom a nursing diagnosis is determined. The terms in Axis 2 are individual, caregiver, family, group, and community, representing the NANDA-I definition of "patient":
- Individual: A single human being distinct from others, a person.

- Caregiver: A family member or helper who regularly looks after a child or a sick, elderly, or disabled person.
- Family: Two or more people having continuous or sustained relationships, perceiving reciprocal obligations, sensing common meaning, and sharing certain obligations toward others; related by blood and/or choice.
- Group: A number of people with shared characteristics.
- Community: A group of people living in the same locale under the same governance. Examples include neighborhoods and cities.

When the subject of the diagnosis is not explicitly stated, it becomes the individual by default. However, it is perfectly appropriate to consider such diagnoses for the other subjects of the diagnosis as well. The diagnosis fear (00148) could be applied to an individual who has a learned response to threat and is in an unfamiliar setting, separated from her support system, which is evidenced by her experiencing feelings of dread, panic, and terror, and suffers from fatigue, change in physiological response, and anorexia. It could also be appropriate for a community that has experienced consistent violence (e.g., ongoing war, gang violence, etc.), and whose members have insufficient control over their environment and insufficient resources to combat the issues within the community, and whose residents are experiencing distressing symptoms such as apprehensiveness, decrease in productivity, avoidance behaviors, increase in alertness, and focus narrowed to the source of fear.

\subsection*{10.3.3 Axis 3: Judgment}

A judgment is a descriptor or modifier that limits or specifies the meaning of the focus of the diagnosis. The focus of the diagnosis, together with the nurse's judgment about it, forms the diagnosis. All the definitions used are found in the Oxford Lexico (Oxford University Press, 2019), unless otherwise specified. The values in Axis 3 are found in $\triangleright$ Table 10.2.

\subsection*{10.3.4 Axis 4: Location}

Location describes the parts/regions of the body and/or their related functions - all tissues, organs, anatomical sites, or structures. All the definitions used are found in the Oxford Lexico (Oxford University Press, 2019), unless otherwise stated. The terms in Axis 4 are shown in $\triangleright$ Table 10.3.

\subsection*{10.3.5 Axis 5: Age}

Age refers to the age group of the person who is the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2). The terms in Axis 5 are noted below, with all definitions, except that

\subsection*{10.3.6 Axis 6: Time}

Time describes the duration of the focus of the diagnosis (Axis 1). The terms in Axis 6 are:
- Acute: lasting < 3 months
- Chronic: lasting $\geq 3$ months
- Intermittent: stopping or starting again at intervals, periodic, cyclic
- Continuous: uninterrupted, going on without stop

\subsection*{10.3.7 Axis 7: Status of the Diagnosis}

The status of the diagnosis refers to the actuality or potentiality of the problem/syndrome or to the categorization of the diagnosis as a health promotion diagnosis. The terms in Axis 7 are:
- (Problem-focused): undesirable human response to a health condition/life process that exists in the current moment (includes syndrome diagnoses) Note: In problem-focused diagnoses this status is assumed in the label itself, there are not standardized terms used for every problem-focused diagnosis
- Readiness for: motivation and desire to increase well-being and to actualize human health potential that exists in the current moment (Pender et al 2006)
- Risk for: susceptibility for developing, in the future, an undesirable human response to health conditions/life processes.

The terms in Axis 7 (status) are not currently expressed, explicitly, in any of the NANDA-I ND labels (Miguel, Romeiro, Martins, Casaleiro, Caldeira, \& Herdman, T.H., 2019). However, the axis is implicit in every diagnosis as this relates to the type of diagnosis that is represented by the label. The DDC plans to move forward a discussion during the next cycle as to whether or not Axis 7 should remain within our multiaxial system.

\subsection*{10.4 Developing and Submitting a Nursing Diagnosis}

A nursing diagnosis is constructed by combining the terms from Axis 1 (the focus of the diagnosis), Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis), and Axis 3 (judgment), and adding terms from the other axes for relevant clarity. Researchers or interested professional nurses would begin with the focus of the diagnosis (Axis 1) and add the appropriate judgment term (Axis 3).

Remember that these two axes are sometimes combined into a single diagnostic concept, as can be seen with the nursing diagnosis fear (00148). Next, they would specify the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2 ). If the subject is an "individual", they need not make it explicit. Finally, as previously stated, NANDA-I supports developments in ND labels with regard to their multiaxial aspects, to increase the specificity and accuracy of the diagnostic process, which is known to be the core of clinical reasoning and practice. Thus, submitters are encouraged to consider whether the distinction possible by use of additional axes could lead to a more precise diagnosis, which could then aid diagnostic reasoning. For example, a review of the diagnoses, Neonatal hypothermia (00280) and Hypothermia (00006) demonstrates a significant difference in defining characteristics and related factors based on the incorporation of the axis 5 term (neonate).

NANDA-I does not support the random construction of diagnostic concepts that would occur by simply matching terms from one axis to another to create a diagnosis label to represent judgments based on a patient assessment. Clinical problems/areas of nursing foci that are identified and which do not have a NANDA-I label should be carefully described in documentation to ensure accuracy of other nurses'/health care professionals' interpretation of the clinical judgment.

Creating a diagnosis to be used in clinical practice and/or documentation by matching terms from different axes, without development of the definition and other component parts of a diagnosis (defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors, associated conditions, and at-risk populations, as appropriate) in an evidence-based manner, negates the purpose of a standardized language as a method to truly represent, inform, and direct clinical judgment and practice.

This is a serious concern with regard to patient safety, because the lack of the knowledge inherent within the component diagnostic parts makes it impossible to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Nursing terms arbitrarily created at the point of care could result in misinterpretation of the clinical problem/area of focus, and subsequently lead to inappropriate outcome setting and intervention choice. It also makes it impossible to accurately research incidence of
nursing diagnoses or to conduct outcome or intervention studies related to diagnoses since, without clear component parts of a diagnosis (definitions, defining characteristics, related factors, or risk factors), it is impossible to know if the concept being studied truly represents the same phenomena.

Therefore, when discussing construction of diagnostic concepts in this chapter, the intent is to inform clinicians as to how diagnostic concepts are developed and to provide clarity for individuals who are developing diagnoses, for submission into the NANDA-I Taxonomy; it should not be misinterpreted to suggest that NANDA-I supports the creation of diagnosis labels by clinicians at the point of patient care.

\subsection*{10.5 Further Development: Using Axes}

NANDA International will be focusing on revision of diagnoses that are currently included in the terminology, but which were "grandfathered" in after the level of evidence criteria was adopted in 2002. There are over 50 such diagnoses, which will be removed from the terminology during the next edition should this revision not occur. Therefore, we strongly discourage the development of new diagnoses at this time, with the focus instead on bringing diagnoses to a minimum level of evidence of 2.1., and raising the level of evidence of other diagnoses.

The other focus for NANDA-I will be to strengthen the clinical usefulness of diagnostic indicators (defining characteristics and related/risk factors). Our desire is to be able to identify, through clinical research and meta-analysis/ meta-synthesis, those defining characteristics that are required for a diagnosis to be made ("critical defining characteristics") and to remove those that are not clinically useful. This will strengthen our ability to provide decision support for nurses at the bedside.

If individuals are moving forward with developing new diagnoses, or are clinically validating diagnoses in specific patient populations, we encourage them to review the new guidelines prior to submission. Finally, research is needed to provide evidence-based support for interventions that are most effective when addressing specific related factors of our ND. Unfortunately, much of the literature to date on intervention is aimed at symptom control (addressing defining characteristics) which, although important, does not enable us to fully resolve the diagnosis.

\section*{11 Glossary of Terms}

\section*{T. Heather Herdman, Shigemi Kamitsuru, Camila Takáo Lopes}

\subsection*{11.1 Nursing Diagnosis}

A nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment concerning a human response to health conditions/life processes, or a susceptibility to that response, that is recognized in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community. A nursing diagnosis provides the basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcomes for which the nurse has accountability (approved at the Ninth NANDA Conference; amended in 2009, 2013, and 2019).

\subsection*{11.1.1 Problem-Focused Nursing Diagnosis}

A clinical judgment concerning an undesirable human response to health conditions/life processes that is recognized in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community.

To diagnose a human response a problem-focused diagnosis, the following must be present: defining characteristics that cluster in patterns of related cues or inferences, and related factors.

\subsection*{11.1.2 Health Promotion Nursing Diagnosis}

A clinical judgment concerning motivation and desire to increase well-being and to actualize health potential that is recognized in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community.

These responses are expressed by a readiness to enhance specific health behaviors, and can be used in any health state. In individuals who are unable to express their own readiness to enhance health behaviors, the nurse may determine a condition for health promotion exists and act on the client's behalf. Health promotion responses may exist in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community.

To diagnose a human response as a health promotion diagnosis, the following must be present: defining characteristics that cluster in patterns of related cues or inferences which reflect a desire to enhance a current behavior or response, or that represent such a possibility in patients who cannot express their own readiness.

\subsection*{11.1.3 Risk Nursing Diagnosis}

A clinical judgment concerning the susceptibility for developing an undesirable human response to health conditions/life processes that is recognized in an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community.

To diagnose a risk diagnosis, the following must be present: risk factors that contribute to increased susceptibility.

\subsection*{11.1.4 Syndrome}

A clinical judgment concerning a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses that occur together, and are best addressed together and through similar interventions.

To diagnose a syndrome diagnosis, the following must be present: defining characteristics, which must be two or more nursing diagnoses, and related factors. Other defining characteristics that are not nursing diagnoses may be used, so long as similar interventions may be used to address them.

\subsection*{11.2 Diagnostic Axes}

\subsection*{11.2.1 Axis}

An axis is operationally defined as a dimension of the human response that is considered in the diagnostic process. There are seven axes that parallel the International Standards Reference Model for a Nursing Diagnosis.
- Axis 1: the focus of the diagnosis
- Axis 2: subject of the diagnosis (individual, family, group, caregiver, community)
- Axis 3: judgment (impaired, ineffective, etc.)
- Axis 4: location (bladder, auditory, cerebral, etc.)
- Axis 5: age (neonate, infant, child, adult, etc.)
- Axis 6: time (chronic, acute, intermittent)
- Axis 7: status of the diagnosis (problem-focused, risk, health promotion).

The axes are represented in the labels of the nursing diagnoses through their terms. In some cases, they are named explicitly, such as with the diagnoses ineffective community coping and compromised family coping, in which the subject of the diagnosis is named using the two terms "community" and "family" taken from Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis). "Ineffective" and "compromised" are two of the terms contained in Axis 3 (judgment).

In some cases, the axis is implicit, as is the case with the diagnosis decreased activity tolerance, in which the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2 ) is always the patient. In some instances, an axis may not be pertinent to a particular diagnosis and therefore is not part of the nursing diagnostic label. For example, the time axis may not be relevant to every diagnosis. In the case of diagnoses without explicit identification of the subject of the diagnosis, it may
be helpful to remember that NANDA-I defines patient as "an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community".

Axis 1 (the focus of the diagnosis) and Axis 3 (judgment) are essential components of a nursing diagnosis. In some cases, however, the focus of the diagnosis contains the judgment (e.g., nausea); in these cases, the judgment is not explicitly separated out in the diagnostic label. Axis 2 (subject of the diagnosis) is also essential, although, as described above, it may be implied and therefore not included in the label. The DDC requires these axes for submission; the other axes may be used where relevant for clarity.

\subsection*{11.2.2 Definitions of the Axes \\ Axis 1: Focus of the Diagnosis}

The focus of the diagnosis is the principal element or the fundamental and essential part, the root, of the diagnostic concept. It describes the "human response" that is the core of the diagnosis.

The focus of the diagnosis may consist of one or more nouns. When more than one noun is used (e.g., mood regulation), each one contributes a unique meaning to the focus of the diagnosis, as if the two were a single noun; the meaning of the combined term, however, is different from when the nouns are stated separately. Frequently, an adjective (spiritual) may be used with a noun (distress) to denote the focus of the diagnosis spiritual distress (see - Table 10.1).

\section*{Axis 2: Subject of the Diagnosis}

The person(s) for whom a nursing diagnosis is determined. The terms in Axis 2 that represent the NANDA-I definition of "patient" are the following:
- Individual: a single human being distinct from others, a person
- Caregiver: a family member or helper who regularly looks after a child or a sick, elderly, or disabled person
- Family: two or more people having continuous or sustained relationships, perceiving reciprocal obligations, sensing common meaning, and sharing certain obligations toward others; related by blood and/or choice
- Group: a number of people with shared characteristics
- Community: a group of people living in the same locale under the same governance; examples include neighborhoods and cities.

\section*{Axis 3: Judgment}

A descriptor or modifier that limits or specifies the meaning of the focus of the diagnosis. The focus of the diagnosis together with the nurse's judgment about it forms the diagnosis. The terms in Axis 3 are found in $\triangleright$ Table 10.2.

\section*{Axis 4: Location}

Describes the parts/regions of the body and/or their related functions - all tissues, organs, anatomical sites, or structures. For the locations in Axis 4, see
- Table 10.3.

\section*{Axis 5: Age}

Refers to the age group of the person who is the subject of the diagnosis (Axis 2). The terms in Axis 5 are noted below, with all definitions except that of older adult being drawn from the World Health Organization (2013):
- Fetus: unborn human more than 8 weeks after conception, until birth
- Neonate: person < 28 days of age
- Infant: child < 1 year of age
- Child: person $\leq 19$ years of age unless national law defines a person to be an adult at an earlier age
- Adolescent: person 10 to 19 years of age, inclusive
- Adult: person > 19 years of age unless national law defines a person as being an adult at an earlier age
- Older adult: person 65-84 years of age
- Aged adult: person $\geq$ years of age.

\section*{Axis 6: Time}

Describes the duration of the diagnostic concept (Axis 1). The terms in Axis 6 are as follows:
- Acute: lasting < 3 months
- Chronic: lasting > 3 months
- Intermittent: stopping or starting again at intervals, periodic, cyclic
- Continuous: uninterrupted, going on without stop

\section*{Axis 7: Status of the Diagnosis}

Refers to the actuality or potentiality of the problem/syndrome or health promotion opportunity to the categorization of the diagnosis as a health promotion diagnosis. The terms in Axis 7 are problem-focused, health promotion, risk.

\subsection*{11.3 Components of a Nursing Diagnosis}

\subsection*{11.3.1 Diagnosis Label}

Provides a name for a diagnosis that reflects, at a minimum, the focus of the diagnosis (from Axis 1) and the nursing judgment (from Axis 3). It is a concise term or phrase that represents a pattern of related cues. It may include modifiers.

\subsection*{11.3.2 Definition}

Provides a clear, precise description; delineates its meaning and helps differentiate it from similar diagnoses.

\subsection*{11.3.3 Defining Characteristics}

Observable cues/inferences that cluster as manifestations of a problemfocused, health promotion diagnosis or syndrome. This implies not only those things that the nurse can see, but also things that are seen, heard (e.g., the patient/family tells us), touched, or smelled.

\subsection*{11.3.4 Risk Factors}

Antecedent factors that increase the susceptibility of an individual, caregiver, family, group, or community to an undesirable human response. These factors must be modifiable by independent nursing interventions, and whenever possible, interventions should be aimed at these factors.

\subsection*{11.3.5 Related Factors}

Antecedent factors shown to have a patterned relationship with the human response. Such factors may be described as associated with, related to, or contributing to that response. These factors must be modifiable by independent nursing interventions, and whenever possible, interventions should be aimed at these etiological factors. Problem-focused nursing diagnoses and syndromes must have related factors; health promotion diagnoses may have related factors, if they help clarify the diagnosis.

\subsection*{11.3.6 At-Risk Populations}

Groups of people who share sociodemographic characteristics, health/family history, stages of growth/development, exposure to certain events/experiences that cause each member to be susceptible to a particular human response. These characteristics are not modifiable by independent nursing interventions.

\subsection*{11.3.7 Associated Conditions}

Medical diagnoses, diagnostic/surgical procedures, medical/surgical devices, or pharmaceutical preparations; these conditions are modifiable by independent nursing interventions.

\subsection*{11.4 Definitions for Terms Associated with Nursing Diagnoses}

\subsection*{11.4.1 Independent Nursing Interventions}

Interventions that can be initiated by the professional nurse that go beyond basic monitoring, referral to other professionals, compliance with organizational protocol, and/or that do not require orders from other health professionals. They are sanctioned by professional nurse practice acts or regulations.

\subsection*{11.4.2 Nursing-Sensitive Outcomes}

Measurable individual, caregiver, group, family, or community state, behaviors or perceptions in response to nursing interventions.

\subsection*{11.4.3 Nursing Plan of Care}

Includes nursing diagnoses, the outcomes, and individualized nursing interventions, based on a complete nursing assessment and understanding of the goals and desires of the individual, caregiver, group, family, or community receiving care.

\subsection*{11.5 Definitions for Classification of Nursing Diagnoses}

\subsection*{11.5.1 Classification}

The arrangement of related phenomena in taxonomic groups according to their observed similarities; a category into which something is put (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).

\subsection*{11.5.2 Level of Abstraction}

Describes the concreteness/abstractness of a concept:
- Very abstract concepts are theoretical, may not be directly measurable, are defined by concrete concepts, are inclusive of concrete concepts, are disassociated from any specific instance, are independent of time and space, have more general descriptors, and may not be clinically useful for planning treatment.
- Concrete concepts are observable and measurable, limited by time and space, constitute a specific category, are more exclusive, name a real thing or class of things, are restricted by nature, and may be clinically useful for planning treatment.

\subsection*{11.5.3 Terminology}

The body of terms used with a particular technical application in a subject of study, profession, etc. (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).

\subsection*{11.5.4 Taxonomy}

The branch of science concerned with classification, especially of organisms; systematics (English Oxford Living Dictionary Online 2020).

\footnotetext{
The Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool (FNAST) is recommended for assessment of withdrawal symptoms and for making decisions related to the plan of care. An FNAST score of 8 or greater, in combination with a history of in-utero substance exposure, is often used to make the diagnosis of Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. This instrument was developed and is used predominantly in the U.S. and other western countries, so it may not be appropriate to recommend for the international community. This diagnosis will retire from the NANDA-I Taxonomy in the 2024-2026 edition unless additional work is completed to bring it up to a level of evidence 2.1 or higher.
