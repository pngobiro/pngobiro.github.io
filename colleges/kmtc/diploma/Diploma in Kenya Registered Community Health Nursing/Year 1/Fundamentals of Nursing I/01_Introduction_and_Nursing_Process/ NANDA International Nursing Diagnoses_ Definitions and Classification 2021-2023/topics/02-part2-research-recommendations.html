                        <h3 id="research-priorities">3.1 Research Priorities</h3>
                        <p>As noted previously, one of the major priorities for the upcoming cycle is the revision or retirement of the 41 diagnoses that were not revised for this 12th edition. Secondly, we encourage clinical validation studies of diagnoses, with large sample sizes and preferably across sites and patient population. Many studies are conducted with patient populations who have a particular medical diagnosis (associated condition), for example the study by Ferreira et al. (2020) on sexual dysfunction (00059) in patients with breast cancer. In other cases, validation studies occur in at-risk populations, such as impaired walking (00088) in the elderly (Marques-Vieria et al., 2018). While these studies are helpful for those working in specialty areas, they do not provide the breadth of understanding of a diagnosis that could occur if an approach looked at all patients admitted to hospital, or receiving in-home care, or being seen in an ambulatory clinic, for example. It is likely that there are core clinical indicators that cross all patients, in addition to those that may only occur within specific patient populations.</p>
                        <p>Further research is critical that provides information on which assessment indicators are most predictive of a patient developing a condition which is represented by a nursing diagnosis. This will allow us to narrow the list of clinical indicators, or separate the lists into critical defining characteristics (DCs), or those that must be present to make a diagnosis, and supportive DCs. Likewise, there has been little focus on related risk factors for nursing diagnoses in research studies, yet it is the related factors that should primarily drive intervention. Thus, we strongly support studies which provide nurses with information on which related factors are most critical for diagnoses, so that intervention studies can be undertaken to remove or minimize the effects of the causes of diagnoses, or risk factors for a diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Since at-risk populations and associated conditions are supportive information for diagnostic reasoning, but not core elements of a diagnosis, research focusing solely on these elements is not encouraged.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="refinement-diagnoses-to-develop">3.2 Refinement and Diagnoses to be Developed</h3>
                        <p>The evolution of our scientific language is an ongoing process; there is no end point at which the terminology will be complete. Rather, there will be continuous revisions and additions to the terminology, along with retirements from it, as knowledge evolves. Some of these evolutions are more editorial in nature, such as developing a specific schema for definitions and phrases of diagnostic indicator terms. Others are more complex and require extensive discussions and research to better position the NANDA-I terminology to be the strongest, most evidence-based, standardized nursing diagnosis language. The following issues represent some of the critical issues to which we hope to draw researchers' immediate attention.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Symptoms or nursing diagnoses?</h4>
                        <p>The NANDA-I nursing diagnoses are concepts constructed by means of a multi-axial system; however, some of the current diagnosis labels do not meet the specification of this model. Some labels are constructed with just one term from axis 1 (the focus of diagnosis), and are often considered symptoms: for example, constipation (00011), insomnia (00095), wandering (00154), hopelessness (00124), fear (00148), and hyperthermia (00007). Although some others are constructed with two terms, one from axis 1 and another from axis 6 (time), they also can be symptoms: for example, acute confusion (00128), chronic sorrow (00137), and acute pain (00132). None of these diagnosis labels have explicit terms from axis 3 (judgment), which are supposed to be included in the focus of diagnosis. What exactly do nurses assess, and what is their judgment about these symptoms? Is it the presence, severity, or self-management of the symptom, for example?</p>
                        <p>There is another issue with these diagnosis labels. Currently, anxiety (00146) and fatigue (00093) are classified as diagnoses within the NANDA-I nursing diagnosis classification. However, these terms are also found as defining characteristics of many other nursing diagnoses. It is difficult to comprehend that they can be both nursing diagnoses and defining characteristics. This is confusing for many users, so we often hear: "Am I supposed to diagnose anxiety itself, or should I consider anxiety as a defining characteristic of other nursing diagnoses?" "I think my patient's problems are fatigue and ineffective coping (00069). Should I document both diagnoses, or just ineffective coping, since it includes fatigue within its defining characteristics?"</p>
                        <p>We recommend a review of these issues to determine whether symptoms should belong within the current NANDA-I nursing diagnosis classification. We may need to create a secondary classification of symptoms, or we may need to remove them from the classification altogether because these symptoms do not fit within the multiaxial structure. Recently, the concepts of "symptom control" and "symptom self-management" are receiving a great deal of attention in the nursing literature. We may need to reconceptualize symptom diagnoses within the NANDA-I classification to reflect the most recent evidence. For example, rather than simply naming the symptom of nausea (00134), a clinically useful diagnosis label may be "ineffective nausea control" and/or "ineffective nausea self-management". Likewise, rather than the symptom diagnosis of chronic pain (00133), "ineffective chronic pain control" and/or "ineffective chronic pain self-management" may be more clinically useful. However, it is important that these diagnosis labels represent the patient's human responses, and not indicate a nursing care issue.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Appropriate level of diagnosis granularity.</h4>
                        <p>Another frequent topic of discussion is what level of granularity should be used for nursing diagnoses in the terminology. Should the diagnoses be broad (abstract), specific (concrete), or both? For example, there are two problem-focused diagnoses that address issues with body weight: overweight (00233) and obesity (00232). These are specifically diagnosed based on body mass index (BMI). However, there is no broader diagnosis that would address the continuum of body weight management, such as ineffective weight control or ineffective weight self-management. Another example is three diagnoses focusing issues on eating (feeding) dynamics: ineffective adolescent eating dynamics (00269), ineffective child eating dynamics (00270), and ineffective infant feeding dynamics (00271). These are three specific diagnoses based on the age/developmental stage of the subject. However, there is no broader diagnosis that would address the problem of eating dynamics across all age groups, such as ineffective eating dynamics.</p>
                        <p>The current NANDA-I classification includes nursing diagnoses with various level of granularity. For example, the diagnosis, impaired tissue integrity (00044) is broader than impaired skin integrity (00046) and impaired oral mucous membrane integrity (00045). Some nurses would argue that impaired tissue integrity is all that is required, because problems related to skin and mucous membranes could all be treated using this diagnosis; other nurses prefer the more specific diagnoses. In general, however, more granular, or more specific diagnoses may better direct precise patient care.</p>
                        <p>Having both broad and specific nursing diagnoses will help us to develop a taxonomy which is more organized and hierarchical. Moreover, our classification of nursing diagnoses, with various level of granularity, may support nurses' clinical reasoning by guiding the categorization of clinical data from the abstract to more concrete. For example, when assessing a patient who is complaining of incontinence, you may first consider a broad, or more general diagnosis such as, impaired urinary elimination (00085). Then, upon further assessment and/or reflection, you may be able to narrow down the focus to a more specific diagnosis, urge urinary incontinence (00238).</p>
                        <p>We are not opposed to developing granular diagnoses, because these can direct specific nursing care. However, there is a great need to determine what level of granularity would be considered sufficient. Is there a level of granularity that might be considered too specific? For example, do we really want to have a diagnosis, impaired left thumb mobility?</p>
                        
                        <h4>What is needed to improve translation?</h4>
                        <p>The issue of granularity is also important in translation, in the understanding of the focus of the diagnosis in different languages, and in the applicability of diagnoses in clinical practice internationally. An example of this might be the diagnosis, risk for falls (00155). A person can fall down the stairs, fall out of bed, or fall down while walking across the room. However, in the original English language, there is just one term - fall - that is used to express any unintended drop from higher surfaces to lower ones, or from a standing position to a lower position on the same surface. In some languages, these are different concepts, and the terms used are therefore different. As a result, nurses take different precautions for each type of fall, and report on these incidents separately. It might even be considered dangerous to combine two different nursing problems into a single nursing diagnosis. It may be necessary to consider that some languages would be better served to have different nursing diagnoses to address those phenomena which cannot accurately be translated as one term from the original English language.</p>
                        <p>In this edition, the diagnosis label, activity intolerance (00092) has been revised to decreased activity tolerance (00298). This revision was based on the discussion regarding axes, especially axis 1 (the focus of the diagnosis) and axis 3 (judgment). It has been previously explained that the focus of activity intolerance is activity tolerance, and the diagnosis label contained the judgment "in-". The English, the prefix "in-" generally means "not" or "impossible". However, simply negating the human response of "activity tolerance" does not make sense as a diagnosis label, and it has proven to be difficult to translate this term in some languages. Therefore, the definition was carefully examined, and the judgment term reflected in that definition was determined to be "decreased". This modification will facilitate accurate translation as well as the consistent use of diagnosis labels internationally. Similarly, there are some other diagnosis labels to be considered: for example, imbalanced nutrition: less than body requirements (00002) and sexual dysfunction (00059) also cause difficulties with translation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Does the focus of the diagnosis capture the appropriate human response?</h4>
                        <p>The focus of a diagnosis (axis 1) describes the human response that is the core of the diagnosis. However, a careful examination of axis 1 of diagnosis labels in the NANDA-I classification revealed questionable labels: deficient knowledge (00126) and readiness for enhanced knowledge (00161). The focus of these diagnoses is obviously "knowledge". However, does knowledge reflect a human response?</p>
                        <p>The National Library of Medicine's MeSH database defines knowledge as "the body of truths or facts accumulated in the course of time, the cumulated sum of information, its volume and nature, in any civilization, period, or country". The term, knowledge, therefore, does not contain a human response to internal or external stimulus. In some languages, a literal translation of readiness for enhanced knowledge did not make sense, so a local term which means "acquisition" has been added after the term "knowledge". It is possible that, in the original English, the focus of the diagnosis could also be changed to knowledge acquisition, knowledge attainment, or knowledge acquirement.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, the judgment term should probably be revised from "deficit" to, for example, "impaired" or "insufficient". Thus, we might have a diagnosis label, insufficient knowledge attainment, or impaired knowledge acquisition. Although this term might seem awkward in everyday vernacular in English, and in other languages as well, it is important to remember that we need labels that truly reflect human responses, and that adhere to a multiaxial structure. In practice, nurses may talk about a patient's misunderstanding or lack of knowledge of a patient when speaking with one another or with other health professionals, but the term in the patient record may be different (for example, deficient knowledge, 00126). This is true in medicine, as well, when we talk with patients about their "heart attack", but chart the term, acute myocardial infarction.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Is NANDA-I taxonomy user-friendly?</h4>
                        <p>Six new nursing diagnoses appear in this edition of the classification that incorporate a term, "self-management" in the focus of the diagnosis (axis 1). We spent a considerable time discussing where - in which domain - each of these diagnoses should be classified. The problem is that the human response of these diagnoses is not only self-management, but it is combined with specific terms that describe the target of self-management: health, lymphedema, and dry eye. Everyone will agree that health self-management is definitely a human response in Domain 1 (health promotion). However, where would you look to find lymphedema self-management or dry eye self-management? Nurses previously have addressed patients' responses related to lymphedema with the diagnosis, ineffective peripheral tissue perfusion (00204), which is found within Domain 4 (activity/ rest). Another diagnosis focusing on dry eye, risk for dry eye (00219) has been slotted in Domain 11 (safety/protection) since 2012.</p>
                        <p>Although definitions of all of these new self-management diagnoses are similar to the definition of Domain 1-Class 2 (health management), we ultimately decided to classify each diagnosis based on user-friendliness. For example, would a nurse think to look in two different domains for a diagnosis to be used with patients having lymphedema? As a result, you will find the lymphedema self-management diagnosis in Domain 4, and the dry eye self-management diagnosis in Domain 11. The domain and class of these diagnoses may change in the future, depending on the advancement of the taxonomic structure, as well as possible changes in our perspectives. However, our goal was to ensure that diagnoses were classified within the taxonomic structure in a way that was clinically consistent.</p>
                        <p>In terms of clinical usability of the NANDA-I taxonomy, we will continue to examine its structure. Some nurses have struggled to locate diagnoses related to respiration, which are classified in three domains: Domain 3 (elimination and exchange), Domain 4 (activity/rest) and Domain 11 (safety/protection). Other nurses have had difficulty locating emotional response diagnoses, which are classified in three domains: Domain 6 (self-perception), Domain 9 (coping/stress tolerance), and Domain 12 (comfort). There are strong reasons for locating these diagnoses in different domains, when you review the definition of the diagnoses. However, it is critical that the taxonomy provides a structure that makes sense to those who are using it. Even if a perfect taxonomy is not possible, we should strive for it.</p>
                        <p>We are always faced with new challenges, new knowledge, and new ways of thinking about the human responses that nurses diagnose. We look forward to receiving your feedback and research findings on these and other issues for the further improvement of the NANDA-I terminology.</p>

                        <h3 id="introduction-4">4.1 Introduction</h3>
                        <p>This chapter aims to present the new criteria for the evidence levels of validity of the NANDA International (NANDA-I) diagnoses, and how they should be used in the process of submitting new diagnoses. The text was organized starting with presentation and a brief discussion of the concepts of clinical evidence and validity theory, then describing and exemplifying the levels of evidence for nursing diagnoses.</p>
                        <p>The level of evidence (LOE) used in this edition does not reflect these new changes. Work is underway to convert all LOEs for current diagnoses, and this will be available in the 14th edition. However, we do require all submitters of new diagnoses to refer to these updated LOE criteria.</p>
                        <p>This section will be primarily of interest to researchers, graduate students, and others who are contemplating development of a new nursing diagnosis, or revision to improve the level of evidence of an existing diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>"Evidence" is a term that is difficult to define and has generated numerous debates in the health area (Pearson et al., 2005; Miller & Fredericks, 2003). In of interventions, presenting a central role for evidence-based practice which seeks to define the best option between different treatments. This notion has been expanded and organizations that are dedicated to the development of contexts (Pearson et al., 2007); or evidence of the accuracy of a particular diagnostic test (Pearson et al., 2005).</p>
                        <p>Evidence is a continuous phenomenon and is organized in hierarchies according to its robustness. This means that regardless of the type of evidence, it can be weaker or stronger. Very strong evidence would be a fact - or a set of facts - that, beyond any suspicion, confirms a statement. When it is said that evidence is very weak, it is because it is acknowledged that new facts may arise that contradict the fact that we have today. Several scholars and organizations have endeavored to create criteria to define hierarchies of evidence in health to assist professionals in making decisions in their practices, including the topic of interventions, among others (Merlin et al., 2009).</p>
                        <p>NANDA-I is the only association concerned with the criteria for the degrees of evidence of diagnostic validity, in this case, nursing diagnoses. In no other area that uses diagnostic language standardization do criteria exist for the degrees of evidence of their validity. As you will see later, the hierarchy of evidence for the validity of NANDA-I diagnoses is guided by criteria relating to the types of studies that generated them. But before that, it is necessary to relate "clinical evidence" and "theory of validity", since we are dealing with degrees of evidence of validity of nursing diagnoses.</p>

                        <h3 id="relationship-evidence-validity">4.2 Relationship Between Clinical Evidence and Validity Theory</h3>
                        <p>The theory of validity has its origin in the development of instruments for assessing cognitive performance and skills, particularly aimed at the selection of candidates for public office or European and North American universities in the mid-19th century (Gregory, 2010). The first definitions of validity try to represent it as the characteristic of an instrument, meaning that it measures what it proposes to measure. If we transpose this definition to a nursing diagnosis, we would identify that a valid nursing diagnosis would be one whose defining characteristics measure the diagnosis that it is supposed to represent. For example, the acute pain (00132) diagnosis would not be valid in itself; what would be valid would be the set of defining characteristics that supposedly "measure" acute pain, regardless of the clinical context, population, environment, or the subject evaluated.</p>
                        <p>You might believe that such a definition seems obvious and relatively simple. And indeed it is! However, the simplicity of this initial definition has raised some doubts over time. How does one prove the measurement capacity of an instrument? If an instrument was proven to measure a phenomenon in a specific population, could it be used to measure the same phenomenon in another population if it is clinically distinct from the first? If the evaluation itself is developed to draw a conclusion based on the presence/absence of a phenomenon, is the instrument itself, or the interpretation that is obtained from it, considered to be valid?</p>
                        <p>To better understand, let's rewrite these same questions in context for nursing diagnoses: how do we prove that the defining characteristics represent a nursing diagnosis, if most human responses are not subject to direct observation (that is, there is no gold standard for most nursing diagnoses)? If a set of defining characteristics were proven to represent a nursing diagnosis in a specific population (for example, hopelessness, 00124, among adolescents), would they represent the same diagnosis in another population that is clinically distinct from the first (such as, hopelessness among adult cancer patients)? If the assessment itself is developed to conclude with a finding of the presence/absence of a nursing diagnosis, is the set of defining characteristics or the interpretation that is obtained from them (the diagnosis itself) considered to be valid?</p>
                        <p>These questions led to reformulations of the concept of validity, as well as of the methods that have been developed to identify such a concept, which are commonly called validation. After decades of discussions and developments, the concept of validity among scholars in the fields of psychology and education has evolved, and led to the understanding of validity as the degree to which accumulated evidence and theory support the specific interpretation of test scores (understood as an instrument of evaluation of a psychological attribute) for a given use of this test (American Educational Research Association; American Psychological Association; National Council on Measurement in Education, 2014).</p>
                        <p>Transporting this definition to the context of nursing diagnoses, we can assume that the validity of a diagnosis is the degree to which evidence and theory support that it (the diagnosis) is the appropriate interpretation, for a given clinical use, of a given set of manifestations (understood as the defining characteristics of the diagnosis). From this definition it can be extrapolated that the validity of a diagnosis: a) can be presented at several levels (degrees); b) depends on the available evidence; c) depends on the underlying theory; d) is a property of the diagnosis and not of its components (the diagnosis is valid, not its characteristics); and, e) depends on the intended clinical use. The process of generating evidence of the validity of a nursing diagnosis is continuous, cumulative, and involves several interrelated steps. These range from the statement of a label, a term or expression to designate a more or less clear idea of a human response pertinent to nursing, to the collection of empirical data that "the observations selected to represent or indicate a concept in fact do so. Assessment of the validity of an operationalization is an ongoing process that requires empirical investigation" (Waltz et al., 2017, p .54).</p>

                        <h3 id="evidence-levels-validity">4.3 Evidence Levels of Validity for NANDA-I Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>As we have seen, the validity of a diagnosis is directly related to the evidence of such validity. Evidence of validity of a diagnosis can have different levels, depending on the methodology used to generate them and the clinical context in which the diagnosis will be used; that is, the validity of a diagnosis depends on a continuous investigation process that allows for expansion of its use for different populations as clinical evidence accumulates. In the NANDA-I terminology, the level of evidence of a diagnosis has been related to the strength of the evidence that supports its development or validation (Herdman & Kamitsuru, 2018). It is, therefore, evidence of validity. In this review, the evidence level of validity of a diagnosis refers to the degree to which accumulated evidence and theory support the interpretation of the human response, represented by the diagnostic label, is the correct interpretation of the set of attributes (defining characteristics, related factors, risk factors, associated conditions, and at-risk populations) for established clinical purposes (i.e., for the context and/or population from which the respective evidence was extracted). Thus, NANDA-I revised its structure of evidence levels of validity of its diagnoses in order to better reflect the state of science related to evi-dence-based practice, associating them with the types of studies capable of producing results compatible with the interpretations and their expected uses.</p>
                        <p>This new classification of the evidence level of validity for nursing diagnoses in NANDA-I is organized into two major levels: Level 1 represents the initial stages of development that precede the inclusion of the diagnosis in the terminology, and Level 2 refers to the various stages of clinical development of the diagnosis, according to the strength of the best available evidence, including those produced by expert opinion studies or with populations susceptible to it. Each level consists of sub-levels structured according to the study methods. A diagnosis will have higher levels of evidence the more robust the evidence is, according to the type of research that produced it, from studies of operationalization of concepts, culminating in high quality systematic reviews.</p>
                        <p>Evidence levels of diagnostic validity are used by the NANDA-I Diagnostic Development Committee (DDC) to make decisions about including new diagnoses in the terminology. Level 1 is assigned to diagnoses that are presented to the DDC to be included in the terminology. This first level deals with the presentation of the initial diagnosis structure to the DDC until the presentation of a theoretical review that proves the structural and conceptual consistency of the diagnostic proposal. After reaching a level of evidence of 1.3., the proposal is recommended for the development of theoretical and clinical studies, starting with conceptual validation, then moving on to content validation by experts and by qualitative analysis of the population supposedly exposed to the diagnosis. Level 2 includes gradually more robust methods of validation, strongly based on epidemiological approaches that aim to establish the accuracy of clinical indicators, the capacity for diagnostic screening, the potential for prognosis, the ability to differentiate between groups of diagnoses with similar concepts, relationships of causality (including causal interrelationships that can determine diagnostic syndromes), systematic reviews that make it possible to establish relationships between diagnostic components in multiple populations or multiple studies in similar populations, and studies of etiological factors based on case-control and/or cohort approaches. The interpretation of the evidence levels of the diagnoses will always be relative and gradual, that is, higher sub-levels in the classification indicate diagnoses with more robust evidence than diagnoses in lower sub-levels. A summary of the evidence levels of nursing diagnoses can be seen in Table 4.1.</p>

                        <h4>4.3.1 Level 1. Proposal Received by the DDC for Development</h4>
                        <p>If the reader identifies a human response that is not found within NANDA-I's terminology, the first step will be to develop a diagnostic proposal comprising a label, a definition, possible components (defining characteristics/related or risk factors/associated conditions/at-risk population), and the relationship of the alleged diagnosis with possible nursing interventions and outcomes. The diagnostic development processes in this first level include direct monitoring by the DDC and execution by the submitter. Level 1 is divided into three sublevels. The diagnostic proposal can present a structure resulting from the three levels to the DDC, sequentially, or it can consider two or even three sub-levels concurrently.</p>
                        <h5>Level 1.1. Label only.</h5>
                        <p>The first task will be to develop a title (label) using the multiaxial system that represents a human response which could be identified as a nursing diagnosis. The level of evidence criterion is defined by a diagnostic label that is considered clear and is supported by a previously conducted literature review, and presented in a report format. The DDC will consult with the submitter, and provide guidance related to diagnostic development through guidelines, written consultation, and workshops. At this stage, the label is categorized as "Received for Development", and identified as such on the NANDA-I website.</p>
                        <h5>Level 1.2. Label and definition.</h5>
                        <p>This level of evidence criterion is defined by the presentation of the diagnostic label and a clear and distinct definition from other NANDA-I diagnoses and definitions. The definition should differ from the defining characteristics, and the label and its components should not be included in the definition. A diagnosis must be consistent with the current NANDA-I definition of nursing diagnoses; that is, its proposal must represent a human response for which the nurse can implement independent nursing interventions. The label and definition must be based on a literature review, which must be presented and evaluated by the DDC. At this stage, the label and its definition are categorized as "Received for Development", and identified as such on the NANDA-I website.</p>
                        <h5>Level 1.3. Diagnostic components, and relationship with outcomes and interventions.</h5>
                        <p>A proposal at this level should include the label, definition, and other components of the diagnosis (defining characteristics, related/risk factors, and, when applicable, associated conditions, at risk populations), presented with the references obtained from a literature review. Although proposals at this level are not yet part of the terminology, they should support the discussion of the concept, the assessment of its clinical usefulness and applicability, and its validation through robust research methods. In addition, the proponent will be required to present the relationship of the diagnosis under development with interventions and outcomes as represented in other standardized terminologies (e.g., the Nursing Outcomes and Nursing Interventions Classifications). At this stage, the diagnostic proposal is categorized as "Received for clinical development and validation", and identified as such on the NANDA-I website and in a separate section of the book with the current terminology. It is worth mentioning that the submitter will be able to present a proposal beginning at level 1.3., without having to go sequentially through levels 1.1. and 1.2.</p>
                        
                        <h4>4.3.2 Level 2. Inclusion in Terminology and Clinical Testing</h4>
                        <p>A new diagnosis is included in the NANDA-I terminology when evidence of second-level validity is generated. This level is subdivided into three sublevels: 2.1. Conceptual validity; 2.2. Content validity; and 2.3. Clinical validity. To include a new diagnosis in the classification, the submitter must identify or develop theoretical studies that allow the construction of evidence of validity of at least the first sub-level, that is, conceptual validity. However, maintaining the diagnosis in the classification will depend on the continuity of studies that allow for the identification of evidence of validity of the third sub-level, that is, clinical validity. Note that each of these sub-levels has other subdivisions that will be characterized and exemplified below.</p>
                        <h5>Level 2.1. Conceptual validity.</h5>
                        <p>Conceptual validity refers to the development of a conceptual framework and/or substantive theory that should support the interpretations obtained from the constituent elements of the nursing diagnosis. In the first sub-level, the elements initially developed are subjected to a concept analysis to demonstrate the existence of a body of knowledge underlying the diagnosis. Conceptual analysis provides support for the label and definition, includes a discussion and supports the defining characteristics and related factors (problem-focused diagnoses), risk factors (risk diagnoses), or defining characteristics (health promotion diagnoses). The components known as associated conditions and at-risk populations may be included in this discussion, if applicable. This level should allow the construction of a substantive theory that, in addition to identifying the components of the diagnosis, leads to an understanding of the clinical and/or psychosocial relationships that underlie the diagnosis. This sub-level has three subdivisions, which are explained below.</p>
                        <h6>Level 2.1.1. Conceptual validity of the elements.</h6>
                        <p>In this first level are diagnoses whose level of evidence criterion refers to the development of a concept analysis. This analysis can be developed for three purposes:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To explain the scope of the diagnosis, including identifying the appropriate domain and class, and the subject of the diagnosis (individual, caregiver, group, family, community). These studies could include those which develop the analysis within a group of patients who all experience the same clinical condition (associated condition), such as an analysis of impaired coping in patients with breast cancer, for example.</li>
                            <li>To clarify the definition of the diagnosis (and its components), the clinical indicators that will constitute the defining characteristics, and the etiological factors that will compose the set of related/risk factors, and any relevant associated conditions/at-risk populations.</li>
                            <li>To differentiate the diagnosis from others existing in the taxonomy, identifying components that establish its clinical limits in relation to the others, characterizing it as a specific phenomenon. In the case of a syndrome diagnosis, the conceptual analysis should describe the relationships between the components of the diagnostic syndrome, differentiating it from clinical situations that represent only the individual diagnostic components.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The study by Cabaço et al. (2018) is an example of a concept analysis based on the evolutionary method, in which the authors present the structural elements for the development of three nursing diagnoses related to spiritual coping. Its analysis was developed from a literature review of qualitative studies and allowed the development of potential diagnoses, spiritual coping, risk for impaired spiritual coping, and readiness for enhanced spiritual coping.</p>
                        <h6>Level 2.1.2. Theoretical-causal validity.</h6>
                        <p>In this second level, the submitter should identify or develop, as a criterion for the level of evidence, a broad theoretical study with the objective of establishing hypotheses for the clinical and causal relationships that justify the components (defining characteristics, related/risk factors, and when indicated, associated conditions/at-risk populations) that make up the diagnosis. The preferred approach for this purpose is the development of middle-range theories, which represent theories composed of a limited number of concepts and which are aimed at describing, explaining, or predicting clinical practice situations (Lopes, Silva & Herdman, 2017). An example of the application of this approach is the study by Lemos et al. (2020) which presents a middle-range theory based on an integrative literature review for the nursing diagnosis, dysfunctional ventilatory weaning response (00034), including the main concepts, pictorial diagrams, propositions, and causal relationships for use in clinical practice. In this study, the authors identified 13 clinical antecedent and 21 consequent results related to this nursing diagnosis that occurs when ventilatory weaning fails.</p>
                        <h6>Level 2.1.3. Terminological validity.</h6>
                        <p>Terminological validity refers to the adequacy of interpretations obtained from health records of terms that are supposed to represent components of a nursing diagnosis. The level of evidence includes diagnoses submitted to validation processes based on secondary data, for the identification of diagnostic components and/or the diagnostic prevalence. Terminological validity of the diagnosis is verified from the documentation of components (defining characteristics, related/risk factors) in health records. These studies must be based on large samples of health records that allow sufficient data to be obtained to identify the diagnostic components. An important requirement with these studies is verification of the adequacy, precision, and accuracy of the records used. An example of this type of study can be found in the article by Ferreira et al. (2016), who cross-mapped 832 terms found in 256 health records with 52 NANDA-I diagnosis labels in an intensive care unit. It is important to note that terminological validity depends on the description of tools used to verify the quality of the information obtained. Simply having recorded terms in the health record does not guarantee that the interpretations obtained from them are valid.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Level 2.2. Diagnostic content validity.</h5>
                        <p>The criteria in any one of the previous levels (2.1.1., 2.1.2., 2.1.3.) must be fulfilled so that the submitter's proposal raises the evidence of validity of the diagnosis to a level of evidence of 2.2. The criterion for this level of evidence is a content analysis study by a group of experts with knowledge about the focus of the diagnosis. Content validity refers to how representative diagnostic components, identified at the previous level, are of the clinical content domain of the diagnosis. This level of evidence has four subdivisions, organized according to the sample size of experts and their respective level of expertise. Content validation is more strongly related to level of expertise than to the sample size of experts. In addition, it is important to consider the inclusion of both experts with clinical experience and researchers on the subject of diagnosis, in order to consider clinical experience and broader theoretical reflections on the diagnosis. A diagnosis is classified in the terminology based on the most advanced level achieved, according to evaluation led by the DDC and Research Directors. An example of a diagnostic content validation study is the article by Zeleníková, Žiaková, Čáp, & Jarošová (2014), who validated the nursing diagnosis, acute pain (00132), with Czech and Slovakian nurses, using the Fehring model. A total of 17 defining characteristics were validated.</p>
                        <h6>Level 2.2.1. Initial validity of diagnostic content.</h6>
                        <p>Diagnoses whose validation process was developed with a small number of experts, with a predominantly beginner/advanced beginner profile, are found in this level. Group evaluation techniques are used at this level, such as the Delphi technique. The analysis follows a more qualitative approach and tends to confirm the structure built at sub-level 2.1. In addition, validation processes with these characteristics allow for verification of how comprehensive the diagnostic structure is for beginners, in order to glimpse its clarity and possible usefulness in clinical practice. Diagnoses at this level have moderate potential for content validity. A description of the use of the Delphi technique for content validation processes in nursing diagnoses can be found in the article by Grant & Kinney (1992). An example of this type of study can be found in the study by Melo et al. (2011), who used the Delphi technique with 25 experts in three rounds. In this study, the experts identified eight factors that represented a higher risk for the development of the diagnosis, decreased cardiac output (00270).</p>
                        <h6>Level 2.2.2. Potential validity of diagnostic content.</h6>
                        <p>The validation process at this level is developed with a large sample of experts who have a beginner/advanced beginner expertise profile. The research will generally include descriptive and inferential statistical analysis, with the possibility of verifying the adequacy of the diagnosis for use by nurses with little clinical experience. When evaluating diagnoses using this type of studies, the expert sample size must be sufficient to allow for the generalization of opinions. Often these opinions will be obtained from questionnaires, and their statistical analysis will include content validity indexes, proportions tests, and agreement coefficients, among other statistical measures. The previously mentioned study by Paloma-Castro et al. (2014) is an example, although their sample probably included experts with different levels of expertise. The data available in the article did not allow for the identification of the experts' level of expertise who participated in the study.</p>
                        <h6>Level 2.2.3. Advanced validity of diagnostic content.</h6>
                        <p>This level requires analyses by participants with a high level of expertise. Most studies base their analysis of expertise on academic criteria, and often a critical analysis of the level of expertise is absent, making it difficult to identify these studies. The validation process is developed with a small number of individuals with predominantly proficient/expert levels of expertise. Diagnoses in this sub-level undergo a qualitative assessment by a group with greater knowledge and experience. The evaluation of these experts should be sufficient to confirm the relevance, adequacy, and clarity of the elements that make up the diagnosis.</p>
                        <h6>Level 2.2.4. Consolidated validity of diagnostic content.</h6>
                        <p>The characteristic that differentiates this level from the previous one is the large sample of experts with predominantly proficient/expert levels of expertise. In addition to the difficulty of obtaining a sample of adequate size and quality, data analysis includes content validity indexes, tests of proportions, coefficients of agreement, and analysis of the internal consistency of the experts' assessments. The process can become more complex if the methods used include revisions of the structure, based on suggestions made by the experts. This is the most important subdivision of diagnostic content validation, and also the most difficult. Suggestions for strengthening this process include: obtain a larger sample than may be deemed initially necessary, use objective instruments, use electronic means of contact and data collection, seek experts in different countries, and organize a research schedule that takes into account a longer data collection period.</p>

                        <h5>Level 2.3. Clinical validity.</h5>
                        <p>This is the highest and most desirable level for a diagnosis to remain in the classification. A content validation study must be completed prior to a clinical validity study. Prior to clinical validation, it should be established that the diagnosis has undergone content validation: is it classified as level 2.2.? This level has the largest number of subdivisions, and these are tied to the use of the diagnosis in clinical practice. The levels of evidence correspond to the type of clinical inference to be obtained from its clinical components, which may include the period beginning with the establishment of a clinical construct through to the development of causal processes. For better organization, this sublevel is divided into three blocks according to the purposes of the clinical validation process.</p>
                        <p>The first block includes the first two subdivisions (2.3.1. and 2.3.2.) and refers to descriptive studies that attempt to obtain initial profiles of the diagnostic components in populations that have supposedly experienced the phenomena; thus, this block represents evidence of clinical validity whose purpose is to identify in which populations a diagnosis may be applicable in practice. The second block includes the subsequent five sub-levels (2.3.3., 2.3.4., 2.3.5., 2.3.6. and 2.3.7.) and refers to validation processes that focus on the utility of defining characteristics for different clinical purposes, including diagnostic inference itself, screening capacity, prognosis establishment, differentiation capacity, and generalization across multiple populations. The third block includes the last three subdivisions (2.3.8. to 2.3.10.) and refers to validation processes that seek to identify related/risk factors, at-risk populations, and associated conditions. The studies developed to reach the levels of evidence in this last block have the purpose of producing evidence regarding the factors that contribute to the occurrence of the nursing diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>The sublevels were organized considering that defining characteristics represent the main elements for the determination of a nursing diagnosis, and its validity for a specific purpose. Related factors, in turn, are causal elements that can only be identified if there is a certain degree of accuracy in the diagnostic inference process, which is based on defining characteristics. Thus, processes of clinical validation involving related factors (and other causal components) can only be properly designed and conducted for diagnoses with confirmed lower-level validity.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Level 2.3.1. Qualitative validity.</h6>
                        <p>Qualitative validity refers to the degree to which diagnostic interpretation is supported by clinical elements captured from individual subjective experiences. In this level, the level of evidence criterion relies on the development of qualitative studies to delimit the phenomenon based on the perception of those individuals believed to be experiencing it. These diagnoses must have been evaluated by a small group of subjects who possibly present with the diagnosis, in order to obtain information about the perception, beliefs, attitudes, and nuances of these individuals that can influence/characterize the phenomenon. Typically, intentional or convenience samples are used, and qualitative approaches are used for analysis. The study by Pinto et al. (2017) is an example of qualitative validation, in which the authors used interpretive content analysis to derive diagnoses related to patient comfort in palliative care. The authors derived 17 different diagnoses from the reported experiences of 15 patients from clinical-surgical units in a hospital in Portugal.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Level 2.3.2. Demographic validity.</h6>
                        <p>This is the last subdivision of the first block, and represents the degree to which demographic characteristics of a population can influence the interpretations obtained from the diagnostic components. This is a type of validity that has a strong relationship with causal components (related/risk factors, associated conditions, and at-risk populations). The evidence level criteria consist of validation studies based on cross-sectional studies to identify elements associated with nursing diagnoses (defining characteristics/related/risk factors). These studies must be developed with large samples of subjects believed to be presenting with the diagnosis, whose selection of subjects can occur consecutively (as patients are admitted, for example) or by a random sampling process. The diagnostic inference process is based on a small group of nurse diagnosticians with proven experience with the diagnosis, and/or who have received specific training to identify it.</p>
                        <p>Data analysis must include verification of the association between sociodemographic variables, defining characteristics, and factors related to the diagnostic inference performed. In addition, some multivariate analysis techniques, such as logistic regressions, can be used to establish sets of defining characteristics, hierarchical models of related/risk factors, or models of joint association of human responses (for diagnoses that represent syndromes). For example, the study by Oliveira et al. (2016) analyzed the association between related factors and the presence of sedentary lifestyle (00168), adjusted for gender among Brazilian adolescents, to verify possible differences in the gender-influenced causality. The study included a total of 564 adolescents and identified four defining characteristics and six related factors strongly associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Some related factors showed differences by gender, being more strongly associated with men. In this case, the interpretations obtained from the defining characteristics identified among adolescents must be analyzed considering possible etiological differences by gender.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Level 2.3.3. Clinical construct validity.</h6>
                        <p>Unlike previous levels that focused on general exploratory approaches, this level is focused on specific components (defining characteristics) and represents the main category of evidence levels. Clinical construct validity is the degree to which a set of defining characteristics allows the correct interpretation (inference) of the nursing diagnosis from a defined clinical context. At this level, evidence level criteria include studies on the ability of defining characteristics to correctly classify subjects regarding the presence/absence of the diagnosis. Evidence of clinical construct validity should measure the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of each defining characteristic. It can also verify the importance of a group of defining characteristics and the influence of their clinical spectrum to modify the diagnostic inference.</p>
                        <p>The selection of patients included in these studies occurs in a naturalistic (consecutive) way, with a sufficient number of subjects to allow for the calculation of diagnostic accuracy. In general, diagnostic inference can be obtained by a panel of nurse diagnosticians, or through latent variable models for direct calculation of diagnostic accuracy. The study by Mangueira & Lopes (2016) is an example of this type of validation in which the authors evaluated 110 alcoholic patients and measured the diagnostic accuracy of 115 defining characteristics and, using four different latent class models, identified 24 characteristics with statistically significant measures of sensitivity or specificity for dysfunctional family processes (00063).</p>
                        <p>Clinical construct validity seeks defining characteristics that allow for a more accurate diagnostic inference, representing the nursing diagnosis in its most complete form. The subsequent levels of clinical validity (2.3.4., 2.3.5., and 2.3.6.) differ from clinical construct validity in that they represent more specific uses and interpretations. These studies include those that aim to establish</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>specific defining characteristics for screening and rapid decision making,</li>
                            <li>defining characteristics which enable differentiation from similar diagnoses,</li>
                            <li>and defining characteristics representing clinical deterioration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The first two levels are applicable to few nursing diagnoses, while the last can be applicable to all diagnoses, and rely on the development of longitudinal studies.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Level 2.3.4. Selective validity (clinical screening).</h6>
                        <p>Selective validity refers to the degree to which a minimum set of characteristics can be used in a heuristic manner for a minimally acceptable interpretation of the presence of a nursing diagnosis. This enables rapid decision making in clinical settings such as urgent and emergency situations. The level of evidence criteria include studies that establish conditioned probabilities among small groups of defining characteristics, allowing for a rapid interpretation for use in risk classification protocols or clinical screening scenarios.</p>
                        <p>It must be taken into account that a clinical construct validation must have been conducted so that, based on these data, a minimum set of defining characteristics can be identified for use in diagnostic screening and rapid clinical decision making. Data analysis techniques for this type of validation, include the use of algorithms for the construction of classification trees. However, this technique requires large samples that allow for the calculation of conditioned probabilities for a pre-established minimum number of defining characteristics that should compose a decision-making model. For these studies, panels of nurse diagnosticians may be used for diagnostic inference, and the entire validation process of the classification tree must be reported.</p>
                        <p>The study by Chaves et al. (2018) is an example of the process used to establish this type of validity. The authors developed a classification tree for quick decision making for identifying ineffective airway clearance (00031) among children with acute respiratory infection. Its classification tree was based on comparing the results of three different algorithms in a sample of 249 children with acute respiratory infection. The best performing tree included the defining characteristics, ineffective cough and adventitious breath sounds, which were found to be suitable for screening children with ineffective airway clearance receiving care in the emergency department.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Level 2.3.5. Discriminant validity.</h6>
                        <p>Discriminant validity aims to determine the set of defining characteristics that allow for the differentiation between diagnoses that share similar signs and symptoms. This type of validity is defined as the degree to which a set of defining characteristics makes it possible to establish an interpretive boundary between diagnoses with similar clinical components. Thus, to consider investigating discriminant validity for two nursing diagnoses, both must have clinical construct validity: the level 2.3.3. criteria must be met. The level of evidence criteria may include studies with a different number of phases, ranging from a simultaneous concept analysis to an analysis with a population susceptible to the diagnoses to be differentiated. The samples must be large enough to calculate estimates, and the analysis is based on techniques such as multiple correspondence analysis or fuzzy sets (fuzzy logic).</p>
                        <p>An example of this type of validity can be found in the study by Pascoal et al. (2016a), who developed a discriminant validation study for the diagnoses, ineffective airway clearance (IAC, 00031), ineffective breathing pattern (IBP, 00032) and impaired gas exchange (IGE, 00030) among children with acute respiratory infection. The authors identified 27 defining characteristics that presented discriminating capacity among the three diagnoses.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Level 2.3.6. Prognostic validity.</h6>
                        <p>Prognostic validity refers to the degree to which a specific set of defining characteristics supports the interpretation of a patient's clinical deterioration, related to a nursing diagnosis in a specific context. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of lower survival/recovery rates of subjects with those defining characteristics. This criterion includes complex longitudinal studies whose objective is to identify a set of defining characteristics that allows for a prognostic assessment: to establish clinical signs that are markers of deterioration in the patient's clinical status. In order to achieve this type of validity, the diagnosis must have clinical construct validity (the 2.3.3. criteria must have been fulfilled).</p>
                        <p>This validation process is based on diagnostic cohort studies, in which the occurrence of defining characteristics must be evaluated and recorded at various points during follow-up. The length of patient follow-up will depend on each diagnosis, especially if its clinical trajectory tends to be acute or chronic, which can take anywhere from days to years of follow-up to establish reliable prognostic markers. Samples are typically obtained consecutively and/or by referral of subjects believed to be experiencing the diagnosis. The analysis of this type of study includes specific statistical techniques, such as measures of relative risk, incidence coefficients, and survival rates. Additionally, statistical models based on multivariate methods are used, such as generalized estimation equations and Cox proportional hazards models.</p>
                        <p>An example of prognostic validity can be found in the study by Pascoal et al. (2016b), who prospectively analyzed defining characteristics of ineffective breathing pattern (00032) among children hospitalized with acute respiratory infection, to identify markers of clinical deterioration associated with the nursing diagnosis. The authors followed 136 children for a period of ten consecutive days and, after an analysis based on the Cox model extended to time dependent covariables, identified four defining characteristics that can be interpreted as indicative of a poor prognosis for IBP.</p>

                        <h6>Level 2.3.7. Generalizable validity of defining characteristics.</h6>
                        <p>This level includes systematic reviews of defining characteristics, and aims to identify clinical signs and symptoms that allow for a generalized interpretation of the nursing diagnosis across populations. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of clinical construct validation studies of the same diagnosis in different populations, using similar methods and describing measures of diagnostic accuracy of the defining characteristics. Thus, the samples are composed of well-designed studies that meet the 2.3.3. clinical construct validity criteria. To confirm generalizable validity, the study should apply meta-analysis techniques to establish summary measures of sensitivity and specificity.</p>
                        <p>An example of this type of evidence is the article by Sousa, Lopes, & Silva (2015), who completed a systematic review with meta-analysis to identify defining characteristics of ineffective airway clearance (00031) that presented better diagnostic accuracy in different clinical conditions. The study included a final sample of seven studies, five conducted with children and two with adults. The analysis was initially conducted for all seven studies, and later only for studies developed for children. The authors concluded that eight characteristics were valid for a generalizable interpretation for IAC.</p>

                        <h6>Level 2.3.8. Diagnosis-specific causal validity.</h6>
                        <p>Specific causal validity refers to the degree to which clinical evidence establishes interpretations of the causal relationships between multiple factors in one diagnosis. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of these factors in case-control studies or using other methods that attest to their relationship with the diagnosis. This level of clinical validity refers to studies that are developed to identify multiple risk/related factors for one diagnosis. The methods commonly used include well-designed case-control studies with sufficient samples sizes to determine the magnitude of the effect of potential causal factors, as well as identification of hierarchical structures and sufficient cause for multiple related / risk factors / associated conditions / at-risk populations.</p>
                        <p>The diagnostic inference for establishing subjects who will compose the case (with the nursing diagnosis) and control (without the nursing diagnosis) groups must be based on diagnostic accuracy measures established by clinical construct validity studies: level 2.3.3. criteria must be met.</p>
                        <p>This type of validity was used in the study by Medeiros et al. (2018), who completed a case-control study to identify pressure ulcer risk factors in adults in intensive care. The study was conducted with 180 patients ( 90 in each group). By using logistic regression analysis, the authors identified six risk factors for pressure ulcer (00249, revised to risk for pressure injury in this edition).</p>

                        <h6>Level 2.3.9. Causal validity of exposure variable.</h6>
                        <p>The causal validity of exposure variable refers to the interpretation of a causal relationship between an etiological factor and a group of diagnoses. The level of evidence criterion is based on results obtained from cohort studies, or other methods that allow for demonstration of how such a factor can modify the interpretations (inferences) about a set of diagnoses. Such studies can also be useful for the establishment of causal chains, in which multiple diagnoses are clinically associated and have feedback loops, characterizing a syndrome diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Samples should be sufficient to determine the magnitude of the risk associated with exposure to the factor, and to identify hierarchical structures that have multifactorial etiologies and/or causal chains. Finally, diagnoses believed to be caused by the same risk/related factor must be evaluated based on evidence of validity of the clinical construct; each diagnosis to be analyzed must have met the level 2.3.3. criteria for validity. The study by Reis & Jesus (2015) is an example of an exposure cohort to assess risk for falls (00155) among 271 institutionalized elderly.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Level 2.3.10. Generalized validity of related/risk factors.</h6>
                        <p>This type of validity refers to the degree to which the same set of etiological factors allows for the generation of a causal interpretation for different populations across multiple contexts. This level of evidence criterion is based on the identification of studies validating the etiological factors of the diagnosis in different populations, using similar methods, and describing measures of the effect size of these factors on the diagnosis. Thus, this level is similar to the generalizable validity of defining characteristics, but includes systematic reviews of related/ risk factors. These samples will include well-designed studies that meet the level 2.3.8. criteria, and meta-analysis techniques are used to establish summary measures of the effect size of related/risk factors on the nursing diagnosis. No examples for this type of validity were found, possibly because the number of studies on related/risk factors is still very small. However, it is important to emphasize that the definition of interventions will depend on the causal factor of the diagnosis. Studies on evidence of validity are encouraged.</p>
                        
                        <h4>4.3.3 Final Considerations</h4>
                        <p>These levels of evidence represent a hierarchy which depicts the degree to which observations identified as describing a diagnosis actually do describe it. The revision of the levels of evidence for the NANDA-I diagnoses should support clinicians in knowing the stage of development of the diagnoses, and their potential to represent the phenomena of the profession. In addition, this revision can help scholars to define their research, expanding the possibilities of practical application of their findings. Validation processes may accelerate the gradual development of accepted and proposed diagnoses, offering greater consistency to the terminology, in addition to improving the clinical decision making process.</p>
                        <p>In the next cycle of the terminology, work will be undertaken by the Directors of Research to reassign LOE for our diagnoses, using these new criteria.</p>
