                        <h3 id="overview-changes">1.1 Overview on Changes and Revisions in the NANDA-I 2021-2023 Edition</h3>
                        <p>Part 1 presents an overview of major changes to this edition: new and revised diagnoses, retired diagnoses, continued revision to standardize diagnostic indicator terms, new level of evidence criteria for diagnosis submission, a proposed refinement to the terminology, and introductory recommendations on nursing diagnoses that require development.</p>
                        <p>It is our hope that the organization of this 12th edition will make it efficient and effective to use. We welcome your feedback. If you have suggestions, please send them by email to: admin@nanda.org.</p>
                        <p>Changes have been made in this edition based on feedback from users, to address both the needs of students, clinicians, and researchers, as well as to provide additional support to educators. New information has been added to assessment. Many diagnoses were revised by international collaborators of the Diagnosis Development Committee Task Force, in order to strengthen their level of evidence. The diagnostic indicators of each diagnosis were revised to decrease ambiguity and improve clarity. Editors referred to the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh) whenever possible, to provide standardized definitions, which are available to translators to ensure consistency across languages. Revised level of evidence criteria are presented to ensure that all future diagnoses submitted for inclusion in the classification are at an appropriate level of evidence to represent the current strength of nursing knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Users who are familiar with previous editions of this text may note that the diagnostic focus is no longer highlighted in the diagnosis label. Instead, the diagnostic focus will be found below the label for each diagnosis in the classification. This was done to facilitate ease of identification of diagnostic foci across languages.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="new-diagnoses">1.2 New Nursing Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>A significant body of work representing new and revised nursing diagnoses was submitted to the NANDA-I Diagnosis Development Committee. The editors would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those submitters who successfully met the level of evidence criteria with their submissions and/or revisions. Forty-six new diagnoses were approved by the Diagnosis Development Committee and were presented to the NANDA-I Board of Directors (Table 1.1), and are now included here for members and users of the terminology. The submitters of each diagnosis are presented following the table.</p>
                        <p>Submitters of nursing diagnoses. Included here are those contributors who submitted new diagnoses or completed reviews of diagnoses including both label and definition change, or significant content change. Individuals who worked as a group are listed together; in cases where more than one individual or group submitted content, they are listed separately.</p>

                        <p>Changes were made to 17 nursing diagnosis labels to ensure that the diagnostic label was consistent with current literature, and reflected a human response. The diagnostic label changes are shown in Table 1.3. Because major changes also occurred to definitions and diagnostic indicators, the original diagnoses were retired from the classification, new diagnoses replaced the originals, and new codes were assigned.</p>

                        <p>In the previous edition of the NANDA-I classification, 92 diagnoses were slotted for removal from this edition, unless additional work was completed to bring them to an adequate level of evidence, or to identify appropriate diagnostic indicators. Among those, 52 were successfully revised and submitted to NANDA-I as part of the DDC Task Force, or by individuals who independently provided revisions. However, we did not receive any revisions on 40 diagnoses. Because of delays between the release in English and translated releases in other countries, we have postponed the removal of these remaining diagnoses, in order to give researchers more time to address their revisions. If additional work is not completed, they will be removed from the 2024-2026 edition. It should be noted that the revision of these diagnoses is considered a priority for NANDA-I in the next cycle of the DDC.</p>
                        <p>Twenty-three of the 52 diagnoses that were reviewed by context experts were removed from the classification, based on evidence presented to support removal. The diagnoses that have been removed from the classification are listed in Table 1.4.</p>

                        <p>The rationale for retirement of these diagnoses clustered into a few categories: (1) new research is available suggesting previous terms are outdated or have been replaced in the nursing literature, (2) lack of related factors modifiable by independent nursing interventions, (3) diagnosis does not meet the definition of a problem-focused diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Ineffective health maintenance, impaired home maintenance, ineffective health management, readiness for enhanced health management, ineffective family health management, risk for metabolic imbalance syndrome, bowel incontinence and functional urinary incontinence were removed because content experts, in the course of literature review, found more appropriate terms to describe the diagnostic focus. Additionally, clarity to definitions and related factors were provided from these literature reviews. It was indicated that NANDA-I needed to retire old terms, which could be confusing to clinicians, and adopt those with support from current research literature. Refer to - Table 1.3.</p>
                        <p>Overflow urinary incontinence was removed because it is a defining characteristic of urinary retention, which should be the actual focus of nursing interventions.</p>
                        <p>The absence of related factors modifiable by independent nursing interventions in the literature led to the removal of reflex urinary incontinence and decreased intracranial adaptive capacity.</p>
                        <p>Ineffective infant feeding pattern was removed because the phrase "feeding pattern", when translated from English to other languages, might be misleading and inadequately interpreted as the act of being fed, as opposed to the ability of an infant to suck or to coordinate the suck-swallow response. This diagnosis is now represented by the label, ineffective infant suck-swallow response (00295).</p>
                        <p>Activity intolerance and risk for activity intolerance were removed to enable the creation of diagnostic labels that incorporate a judgment term. These diagnoses were replaced by decreased activity tolerance (00298) and risk for decreased activity tolerance (00299).</p>
                        <p>No related factors were found by reviewers for latex allergy reaction that were modifiable by independent nursing interventions. However, nurses do assess for, and can independently intervene on, risk for latex allergy reaction (00217), which remains in the classification.</p>
                        <p>Grieving is a normal human response and therefore does not meet the definition of a problem-focused nursing diagnosis. This does not suggest that nurses do not support patients who are grieving. Nurses should assess for risk for maladaptive grieving (00302) and maladaptive grieving (00301). Additionally, patients may indicate a desire to enhance their grief experience (readiness for enhanced grieving, 00285)</p>
                        <p>Risk for falls and risk for pressure ulcer were removed because literature reviews performed by content experts provided evidence that there are sufficiently different risk factors for falls and pressure injury among adults, children and/or neonates. Therefore, these diagnoses were replaced by more granular, specific terms. In addition, the diagnostic focus pressure ulcer was updated to pressure injury, according to the most updated specialized literature.</p>
                        <p>Risk for venous thromboembolism was removed because no sufficiently distinct risk factors for venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboembolism were found that are modifiable by independent nursing interventions. The new diagnosis, risk for thrombosis (00291), includes risk factors for both types of thromboses.</p>
                        <p>Risk for suicide was removed because the new diagnostic focus, suicidal behavior, represents more accurately the phenomenon of concern to nurses. Suicide - the act of killing oneself - would be an undesirable outcome following suicidal behaviors. This diagnosis was replaced by risk for suicidal behavior (00298).</p>
                        <p>Risk for delayed development was retired because its definition was more accurately represented by the addition of the age axis, child, to the label. Therefore, this diagnosis was replaced by risk for delayed child development (00305).</p>

                        <h3 id="indicator-term-standardization">1.6 NANDA-I Nursing Diagnoses: Indicator Term Standardization</h3>
                        <p>Our work to decrease variation in terms used for defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors continued during this twelfth edition of the classification. It involved literature searches, discussion, and consultation with clinical experts in different nursing specialties around the world. Although development of technology made it easier to find similar terms/phrases or those which had difficulties for translation, for example, this was not a simple task and took dozens of hours to complete. Despite this, we know it will not be perfect, and that work will continue into the next edition.</p>
                        <p>Readers will notice that many diagnoses have minor edits to terms (e.g., alteration in metabolism in the 11th edition will be altered metabolism in the current edition). Work was also completed on all associated conditions and at risk populations, as it was noted in the previous edition that this work would occur during this cycle. This work focused on clarity of terms, and standardizing the way in which terms were stated. These changes are not considered to be content edits, but rather they are editorial changes. Those diagnoses with terms that had editorial changes only do not appear in Table 1.2.</p>
                        <p>The benefits of this revision work are many, but the following three are perhaps the most notable:</p>
                        
                        <h4>1.6.1 Improving Translation</h4>
                        <p>There have been multiple questions and comments from translators regarding previous terms, which reminded us of the need for this work. For example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are many similar terms/phrases and the way I would translate these terms is exactly the same in my language. Can I use the same term/phrase, or must I translate these terms differently, even if we would not do so in daily practice? To date, we have not required submitters of nursing diagnoses to search the terminology for terms/phrases that already exist to standardize their terms. As a result, the number of diagnostic indicator terms/phrases in the terminology have increased substantially over the years.</li>
                            <li>It is important for translators to ensure conceptual clarity when translating the term/phrase. If there is a conceptual difference in two terms in the original English (e.g., helplessness and hopelessness), then they cannot use the same term to represent these two separate concepts. However, translators' struggles often result from a lack of standardization of the original English terms/phrases. Here is one of the examples in the 11th edition: the term, anorexia, was used in eight diagnoses, poor appetite appeared in three diagnoses, decrease in appetite in two diagnoses, and loss of appetite in one diagnosis! It would be difficult, if not impossible to translate these terms in some languages in a way that clearly differentiates the terms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Decreasing the variation in these terms/phrases should facilitate the translation process, as one term/phrase will now be used throughout the terminology for similar diagnostic indicators. In this edition, we initiated the incorporation of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms whenever possible. The MeSH make up the USA National Library of Medicine's controlled vocabulary thesaurus, used for indexing articles for the MEDLINE®/PubMED® database. The MeSH terms are defined and serve as a thesaurus that facilitates searching. Although the MeSH terms are not viewable in this text, our translators were provided access to the MeSH terms, whenever they were adopted, along with their definitions. These MeSH terms and their definitions should assist translators in creating more precise translation. For the example we discussed above, related to appetite, we have adopted the MeSH term, anorexia, which is defined as "the lack or loss of appetite accompanied by an aversion to food and the inability to eat". This means that this one term replaces the previous four terms.</p>
                        <p>We have also done our best to condense terms and standardize them, whenever possible.</p>
                        
                        <h4>1.6.2 Improving Terminological Consistency</h4>
                        <p>We have received other questions that were difficult to answer. For instance: When you say "inadequate" in English, does that mean a lack of quality, or is it the quantity that is lacking? The answer is often, "Both!" Although the duality of this word is well accepted in English, the lack of clarity does not support the clinician in any language, and it makes it very difficult to translate into languages in which a different word would be used depending on the intended meaning. Unfortunately, other similar words, such as insufficient, inadequate, and deficient, have been also used in the terminology. In this edition, we decided to use the term, inadequate, consistently to point a lack of quality and/or lack of quantity, whereas the term, insufficient, is used solely to indicate lack of quantity. Moreover, the word, deficient, is used to mean lacking some elements or characteristics. For example, the phrases, insufficient access to resources and deficient immunity, in the eleventh edition, are revised to inadequate access to resources and inadequate immunity, respectively, in this edition.</p>
                        <p>Another question identified the need for clear differentiation between commonly used terms: What are the differences, if any, between disease and illness? These terms are not completely exclusive, and the English definitions can be confusing. However, some rules need to be set for consistent use of these terms in the terminology. The MeSH term, disease, is defined as "a definite pathologic process with a characteristic set of signs and symptoms". That is, disease is used for a specific medical condition with a clear name and symptoms, which needs to be treated, such as cardiovascular disease or inflammatory bowel disease. Meanwhile, illness is used for the patient's subjective experience of symptoms and unhealthy conditions, which needs to be managed, such as chronic illness or physical illness.</p>
                        
                        <h4>1.6.3 Facilitating Diagnostic Indicator Coding</h4>
                        <p>We often hear voices from nurses and students confused by the long list of diagnostic indicators. I really do not know if this diagnosis is right for my patient. Do I have to find all defining characteristics and related factors of the diagnosis with my patient? At the current developmental stage of nursing diagnoses, the diagnostic criteria are not as clear as in most medical diagnoses. Identification of nursing diagnostic criteria based on research is an urgent task for the nursing community. Without diagnostic criteria, it is difficult for us to make an accurate nursing diagnosis. Additionally, there is no guarantee that nurses around the world use the same nursing diagnosis for a similar human response.</p>
                        <p>This work facilitates the coding of the diagnostic indicators, which should facilitate their use for populating assessment databases within electronic health records (EHR). All terms are now coded for use in EHR systems, which is something we have been frequently asked to do by many organizations and vendors alike. In near future, it is possible to find out which defining characteristics most often occur within the assessment data when a nursing diagnosis is documented, which could lead to the identification of critical diagnostic criteria. Additionally, identification of the most common related (causative) factors found for each diagnosis will also facilitate appropriate nursing interventions. This all facilitates the development of decision-support tools regarding accuracy in diagnosis, as well as linking diagnosis to assessment, and linking related/risk factors to appropriate treatment plans.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><em>By T. Heather Herdman</em></p>
                        <p>As we noted earlier, NANDA International, Inc. initially began as a North American organization and, therefore, the earliest nursing diagnoses were primarily developed by nurses from the United States and Canada. However, over the past 20 to 30 years, there has been an increasing involvement by nurses from around the world, and membership in NANDA International, Inc. now includes nurses from nearly 40 countries, with nearly two-thirds of its members coming from countries outside North America. Work is occurring across all continents using NANDA-I nursing diagnoses in curricula, clinical practice, research, and informatics applications. Development and refinement of diagnoses is ongoing across multiple countries, and the majority of research related to the NANDA-I nursing diagnoses is occurring outside North America.</p>
                        <p>As a reflection of this increased international activity, contribution, and utilization, the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association changed its scope to an international organization in 2002, changing its name to NANDA International, Inc. So, please, we ask that you do not refer to the organization's name as the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - this is not reflective of its international scope, and it is not the legal name of the organization. We retained "NANDA" within our name because of its status in the nursing profession, so think of it more as a trademark or brand name than as an acronym, since it no longer "stands for" the original name of the association.</p>
                        <p>As NANDA-I experiences increased worldwide adoption, issues related to differences in the scope of nursing practice, diversity of nurse practice models, divergent laws and regulations, nurse competency, and educational differences must be addressed. In 2009, NANDA-I held an International Think Tank Meeting, which included 86 individuals representing 16 countries. During that meeting, significant discussions occurred as to how best to handle these and other issues. Nurses in some countries are not able to utilize nursing diagnoses of a more physiologic nature because they are in conflict with their current scope of nursing practice. Nurses in other nations are facing regulations aimed to ensure that everything done within nursing practice can be demonstrated to be evidence-based, and therefore face difficulties with some of the older nursing diagnoses and/or those linked interventions that are not supported by a strong level of research literature. Discussions were therefore held with international leaders in nursing diagnosis use and research, looking for direction that would meet the needs of the worldwide community.</p>
                        <p>These discussions resulted in a unanimous decision to maintain the taxonomy as an intact body of knowledge in all languages, in order to enable nurses around the world to view, discuss, and consider diagnostic concepts being used by nurses within and outside of their countries, and to engage in discussions, research, and debate regarding the appropriateness of all of the diagnoses. A critical statement agreed upon in that Summit is noted here prior to introducing the nursing diagnoses themselves:</p>
                        <blockquote class="callout note">
                            <p>Not every nursing diagnosis within the NANDA-I taxonomy is appropriate for every nurse in practice - nor has it ever been. Some of the diagnoses are specialty-specific, and would not necessarily be used by all nurses in clinical practice . . . There are diagnoses within the taxonomy that may be outside the scope or standards of nursing practice governing a particular geographic area in which a nurse practices.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Those diagnoses and/or related/risk factors would, in these instances, not be appropriate for practice, and should not be used if they lie outside the scope or standards of nursing practice for a particular geographic region. However, it is appropriate for these diagnoses to remain visible in the classification, because the classification represents clinical judgments made by nurses around the world, not just those made in one region or country. Every nurse should be aware of, and work within, the standards and scope of practice and any laws or regulations within which he/she is licensed to practice. However, it is also important for all nurses to be aware of the areas of nursing practice that exist globally, as this informs discussion and may over time support the broadening of nursing practice across other countries. Conversely, these individuals may be able to provide evidence that would support the removal of diagnoses from the current classification, which, if they were not shown in their translations, would be unlikely to occur.</p>
                        <p>That said, it is important that you are not avoiding the use of a diagnosis because, in the opinion of one local expert or published textbook, it is not appropriate. I have met nurse authors who indicate that operating room nurses "cannot diagnose because they don't assess", or that intensive care unit nurses "have to practice under strict physician protocol that doesn't include nursing diagnosis". Neither of these statements is factual, but rather represents the personal opinions of those nurses. It is, therefore, important to truly educate oneself on regulation, law, and professional standards of practice in one's own country and area of practice, rather than relying on the word of one person, or group of people, who may be inaccurately defining or describing nursing diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, nurses must identify those diagnoses that are appropriate for their area of practice, that fit within their scope of practice or legal regulations, and for which they have competency. Nurse educators, clinical experts, and nurse administrators are critical to ensuring that nurses are aware of diagnoses that are truly outside the scope of nursing practice in a certain geographic region. Multiple textbooks in many languages are available that include the entire NANDA-I terminology, so for the NANDA-I text to remove diagnoses from country to country would no doubt lead to a great level of confusion worldwide. Publication of the classification in no way requires that a nurse utilize every diagnosis within it, nor does it justify practicing outside the scope of an individual's nursing license or regulations to practice.</p>
