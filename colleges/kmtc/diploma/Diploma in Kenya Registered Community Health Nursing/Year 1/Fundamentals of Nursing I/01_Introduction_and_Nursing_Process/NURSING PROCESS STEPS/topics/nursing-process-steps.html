                        <h3>Systematic</h3>
                        <p>NP is a systematic method that directs the nurse and the client as together determines the need for nursing care, plan, and implement the care, and evaluate the results.</p>
                        <p>The systematic process provides a framework that enables the nurse and client to do the following;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Collect systematically clients data</li>
                            <li>Clearly identify clients strengths and problems</li>
                            <li>Develop holistic plan of individualized care that specified the desired client goals and related outcomes and the nursing intervention most likely to assist the client to meet those expected outcomes</li>
                            <li>Execute the plan of care</li>
                            <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of the plan of care in terms of client goal and achievement</li>
                            <li>Each step of the nursing care is directed in a sequential order/manner</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Dynamic</h3>
                        <p>This means it keeps on changing or involves continuous change. It is an ongoing process focused on the changing responses of the client that are identified throughout the nurse-client relationship. It focuses on changing needs of the client.</p>

                        <h3>Interpersonal</h3>
                        <p>It is interpersonal because of its interactive nature between the client and the nurses, the family and the other health professionals.</p>

                        <h3>Flexible</h3>
                        <p>This means it can be adapted to nursing practice and in any setting or area of specialization dealing with individual, groups or communities. It can also be used sequentially and concurrently. The nurse can more than one step at a time.</p>

                        <h3>Theoretically based</h3>
                        <p>This is because the process is devised from a broad based knowledge including the science and humanities and can be applied to any other theoretical models at nursing.</p>

                        <h3>Goal oriented</h3>
                        <p>This because it offers a means for nurses and clients to work together to identify specific goals related to;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>wellness</li>
                            <li>promotion</li>
                            <li>disease and illness prevention</li>
                            <li>Health restoration</li>
                            <li>Coping with altered functioning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These are most important to client and to match them with appropriate nursing actions. The nursing actions are recorded in the plan of care where each nurse can quickly determine the client's priorities and begins nursing with a clear sense of how to proceed. The client benefits from continuity of care and each nurse can move the client close to good achievement.</p>

                        <h3>Universally applicable</h3>
                        <p>Once nurses understand nursing process, they find it easy to manage the well and sick clients, young or old. Efforts made by nurses to master nursing process results in their possession of a valuable tool that can be used with ease in any nursing situations.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Data collection - from a variety of sources</li>
                            <li>Data verification and validation - using a systematic and ongoing process</li>
                            <li>Data categorizing - data organization and interpretation</li>

                        <p>There is a systematic collection of data on the patients health status. The data is analyzed to determine the patients health needs. The data collected is to be used in formulating the nursing diagnosis. This phase is described as the organized systematic process of collecting data from a variety of sources to evaluate the health status of a client. It is the solid foundation for providing quality care to patients. The assessment phase may be affected by the nurses beliefs, knowledge and skills. Accurate and complete assessment is necessary to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of the nursing diagnosis.</p>

                        <h3>Types of data</h3>
                        <p>There are 4 types of data collected from a patient:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Subjective data</li>
                            <li>Objective data</li>
                            <li>Historical data</li>
                            <li>Current data</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Subjective data</h4>

                        </ul>
                        <p>It helps interpret the patients history more accurately by providing a basis of comparison. It incorporates using the senses of touch, smell, hearing and sight. It also incorporates observable and measurable data that are obtained through both standard assessment techniques performed during the physical examination and the results of laboratory testing.</p>

                        <h4>Historical data</h4>

                            <li><strong>Primary source:</strong> Data from the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary source:</strong> From the relatives, friends, Health care team e.g nurses, Doctors, Medical history of the patient, Examinations done, Investigations carried out.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Methods of data collection</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>History taking/interviewing</li>
                            <li>Physical examination</li>
                            <li>Observations</li>
                            <li>Investigations e.g. lab and radiological</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h4>1. History taking(interviewing the patient)</h4>
                        <p>The nurse uses interviewing skills to help the patient describe the problem. It is a purposeful conversation. The primary tool is the nurse/patient relationship. Good interviewing requires knowledge of what information you need to obtain and skill in eliciting and responding to the patient's/clients under study.</p>
                        <p>It provides the following information:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Biographical data</li>
                            <li>The chief complain</li>
                            <li>History of present illness</li>
                            <li>Past medical history</li>
                            <li>Psychosocial history</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Chief complain refers to one or more concerns for which the patient is seeking care or advice. History of present illness gives the scope of patient's concerns and amplifies the chief complain. It gives a chronologic account of how each of the symptoms developed. Past history explores childhood illnesses, adult illnesses, surgeries accidents, obstetrics, history of any transfusion, gynae events, health maintenance issues e.g. immunizations etc. In review of body systems ask the patient about common symptoms in each body system. Details needed within each area depends on various factors (age, risks, purpose of visit etc). Review of body systems is combined with physical examination.</p>

                        <h4>Guidelines to good history taking</h4>
                        <ol type="i">

                            <li>Use good communication or interviewing skills e.g use open ended questions e.g. "Mr. Jumna could you tell me about the headache that has made you come to the hospital today?"</li>
                            <li>Use of interpersonal relationship e.g. develop rapport with the client e.g by greeting the patient, ensure she/he is comfortable, don’t sound too "medical" to the patient etc</li>
                            <li>Be objective i.e. do not try to interpret information during interview, record the issues as they are told, collect data without drawing conclusions or making judgement</li>
                            <li>Collect manageable details that are meaningful e.g. whether a cough is dry, productive/expectorating etc</li>
                            <li>Sequence information</li>
                            <li>Document clearly and in a timely manner</li>
                            <li>Maintain the right space between you (the Nurse) and the patient. The space maintained provides a cue on the nature of the relationship between two people. The space also depends on the sociocultural roles and customs.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Intimate space is up to 2 inches to allow for a maximum interpersonal sensory stimulation</li>
                                    <li>Personal space is 4-8 ft and used in close relations. -is a touching distance</li>
                                    <li>Social consultative space, 9-12 ft is less personal and less dependant. Speech must be louder</li>
                                    <li>Public space, 12 ft or more is used in giving speech and other public forums</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>Ask one question at a time</li>
                                    <li>Use understandable language</li>
                                    <li>Clarify with the patient</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Skills of good interviewing</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be aware of your and the patients non verbal communication</li>
                            <li><strong>Facilitation</strong> - use of posture, actions or words to encourage the patient to continue e.g. Leaning forward. Also involves use of supplementary statements to encourage the patient to keep verbalizing e.g. "is that right?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Reflection</strong> - simple repetition of the patient's words encourages them to give more details</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarification</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Summarization</strong> of what the patient has said</li>
                            <li><strong>Empathetic responses</strong> but avoid premature reassurances</li>
                            <li><strong>Validation</strong> - legitimizing patient's experiences e.g. "I can understand the diagnosis was scary for you and it may be the reason why you feel anxious". It makes the patient feel safe.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Challenges when conducting interview</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A crying patient</li>
                            <li>Communication barriers</li>
                            <li>Patients who like talking endlessly - Focus on the main area of concern for the patient</li>

                            <li>Patients with anger/hostility - Apologize if you are the cause of the anger, don’t join in the anger, don’t get angry too etc</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>2. Physical examination</h4>
                        <p>For it to be meaningful, the nurse needs to know the normal from the abnormal. Helps get information to substantiate subjective data. It further defines client's response to the disease process. It uses the techniques of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Is head to toe examination.</p>
                        <p>Have a general impression of the patient e.g. appearance, sleep patterns, recent weight changes etc.</p>

                        <h4>3. Observation</h4>
                        <p>It is to gather data using the five senses i.e.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Noticing the stimuli</li>
                            <li>Selecting, organizing and interpreting the data</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Errors in observing:</strong> Unable to notice certain signs as may be unexpected in a certain client or situation or they do not conform to preconceptions about a client's illness. Faulty organization and misinterpretation of data.</p>
                        <p><strong>The need for observation:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish a nurse-client relationship</li>
                            <li>Gather data about the client's general health status, interpreting physiologic, psychological, cognitive, socio-cultural, developmental and spiritual dimensions</li>
                            <li>Identify client's strengths</li>
                            <li>Identify actual and potential health problems</li>
                            <li>Establish a base for the nursing process</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Involves use of sense to obtain information about a client, significant others and the environment. Requires broad knowledge base and conscious use of bases. An observation made could be positive or negative e.g. crying following the death of a loved one is positive. Observation findings usually require more investigations.</p>
                        
                        <h4>4. Laboratory findings</h4>
                        <p>They make part of the objective data. Some findings are diagnostic and others identify the cause of the disease. The nurse requires knowledge on diagnostics evaluations, their indications, preparations, and interpretation of the results.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Validating data</h3>
                        <p>Validation is the act of double checking or verifying data to confirm that is accurate, complete and factual as nursing diagnosis and interventions are based on this information. So the nurse has to;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensures that the assessment information is complete</li>
                            <li>Ensures that objective and related subjective data agree</li>
                            <li>Obtain additional information that may have been overlooked</li>
                            <li>Differentiate between cues and inferences. Cues are subjective or objective data directly observed by the nurse i.e. what pt says or what nurse can see, hear, feel, smell, taste or measures. Inferences are discrepancies the nurse interprets or conclude makes based on the cues. E.g. a nurse observes the cues, red incision, hot and swollen; the inference is infected incision</li>
                            <li>Avoid jumping to conclusions and focusing in the wrong direction to identify problems</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Example of validating assessment data:</strong> Comparing subjective and objective data to verify the pt's statements with observation taken i.e. patient's perception of 'feeling hot' need to be compared with measurement of body temperature. To be sure that data consist of cues not inferences i.e. observation- dry skin and reduced tissue elasticity, inference dehydration.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Documenting data</h3>
                        <p>The nurse records pt data to compare the assessment phase. All data collected about the pt's health status is recorded accurately. To increase accuracy, the nurse records subjective data in the pt's own words as restating in other words what someone says increases the chance of changing the original meaning.</p>

                        <h3>Advantages of nursing diagnosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Facilitate communication among nurses and other health team members, identifies a client's health status, strengths, and health problems.</li>
                            <li>Strengthen the nursing process and provide direction for planning independent nursing interventions.</li>
                            <li>Help the nurse to focus on independent nursing actions.</li>
                            <li>Help identify the focus of a nursing activity and thus facilitate peer review and quality assurance programs.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Peer review is the appraisal of nurse's practice, education, or research by coworkers of equal status.</li>
                                    <li>Quality assurance is the evaluation of nursing services provided and the results achieved against an established standard.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Facilitate nursing intervention when a client moves from one hospital unit to another or from hospital to home.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>This guides the planning of the nursing interventions that the client requires after discharge.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Facilitate comprehensive health care by identifying, validating, and responding to specific health problems.</li>

                        <p>This stage entails identification of patient's problems. There are two types of problems:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Nursing diagnosis</strong> - actual or potential health problem that can be managed by independent nursing interventions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Collaborative problems</strong> - These are health problems that require both physician prescribed and nursing prescribed interventions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A problem is any health care condition that require a diagnosis, therapeutic and educational action. According to NANDA I [North American Nursing Diagnosis Association International] Nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment about individual family or community on actual or potential health problems.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Types of nursing diagnosis</h3>
                        <p>There are five (5) types of nursing diagnosis but the most common are two (2):- actual and potential</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Actual nursing diagnosis</strong> - Represents a problem that has been validated i.e. it is present.</li>
                            <li><strong>Potential/risk nursing diagnosis</strong> - Represents a problem that an individual/family/community is more vulnerable to develop than the others in the same situation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Other diagnoses include:-</p>

                        <h4>a. Data processing</h4>
                        <p>Is the first aspect of analyzing, the act of interpreting collected data or data collected during assessment compared against standards e.g BP whether normal. It involves classifying the items, interpreting and validating data. When interpreting data, the nurse uses the theoretical knowledge and experience to make correct meanings.</p>
                        <p>E.g. linking a headache with reddening eyes, fever with a sore throat, elevated WBCs count with elevated temperature etc. It involves the following steps;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Organize data</li>
                            <li>Compare against standards (identify significant cues)</li>
                            <li>Cluster data (generate tentative hypotheses)</li>
                            <li>Identify gaps and inconsistencies</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Organizing the data</h5>
                        <p>The data collected is organized into a usable framework for the nurse and others who may need access to them. Theoretical framework and conceptual models often guide the format of the assessment tool, facilitating the organization of the data. The nurse chooses one or more nursing models and develop skill by using them consistently.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Comparing data against standards</h5>
                        <p>The nurse compares the client's data to a wide range of standards or measures. E.g.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal health patterns</li>
                            <li>Normal vital signs</li>
                            <li>Laboratory values</li>
                            <li>Basic food groups</li>
                            <li>Growth</li>
                            <li>development</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The nurse compares the client data against standards and norms in order to identify significant and relevant cues. A cue is a piece of information or data that influences decisions and are required through the use of the five senses (taste, touch, smell, hearing, and sight). Types of cues;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cues that point to change in a client's health status or pattern which may be positive or negative e.g. Client states; " I have recently experienced shortness of breath while climbing stairs" or "I have not smoked for three months".</li>
                            <li>Cues that vary from norms of the client population where by client's pattern may fit within cultural norms but vary from norms of general society. e.g. eating very small meals, having a poor appetite.</li>
                            <li>Cues that indicate a development delay i.e. changes in health patterns occur as the person grows and develops. e.g. at 9 months an infant is usually able to sit without support.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Clustering data</h5>
                        <p>It is determining the relatedness of facts and finding patterns in the facts. Data are examined to determine whether any patterns are present even if represent isolated incidents or are significant. It is influenced by the nurse's background of scientific knowledge, past experiences, and concept of nursing. The nurse combines data from different assessment areas to form patterns or subjective and objective data into appropriate categories. The nurse makes inferences (i.e. the nurse's judgment or interpretation of cues) throughout the diagnostic process. The nurse interprets the possible meaning of the cues and labels the cue cluster with tentative diagnostic hypotheses.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Identifying gaps</h5>
                        <p>Are the missing information needed to determine a data pattern. E.g. during the assessment phase, the nurse needs data about a client's definition of health to interpret his statement "I am sick all the time" . Data may be completely missing or incomplete.</p>
                        
                        <h4>b. Formulating of nursing diagnosis</h4>
                        <p>Formulation of nursing diagnosis. Cluster of cues and make inferences from the data. Cues are objective or subjective data. Inference are nurses conclusions. It is clear statement about a clients actual or potential health problem. Diagnosis may be written in either two parts or three parts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Two parts:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Problem(P)- statement of the clients response</li>
                            <li>Etiology(E)- Factors contributing to probable causes of the response.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The 2 parts are joined by the word "related to" or "associated with" rather than "due to". E.g.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ineffective breathing pattern (problem) related to pain (etiology).</li>
                            <li>Self esteem disturbance (problem) related to altered body image (loss of arm) (etiology).</li>
                            <li>Anticipatory grieving (problem) related to anticipated loss (etiology) secondary to husbands illness (etiology).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Three parts:</strong></p>
                        <p>Statement includes the problem the etiology and observed sign and symptoms (PES). (Related to and manifested by). Or evidence by. E.g.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-esteem disturbance (problem) related to altered body image (loss of arm) (etiology) manifested by crying and hostility (signs and symptoms).</li>
                            <li>Anticipatory grieving(problem) related to husbands terminal illness(etiology) manifested by Anorexia and withdrawn behaviour(signs and symptoms).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>The problem</h5>
                        <p>The problem is the first part of the statement which identifies the patient problem noted in the assessment phase. The problem can be determined by considering the list of accepted diagnosis. Examples of modifiers include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Alteration</strong> - a change from usual functioning level e.g. altered nutrition means there a change from the usual optimum eating or nutritional capacity</li>
                            <li><strong>"Risk for"</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>"potential for"</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>"Impairment"</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>"Deficit"</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>"Dysfunctional"</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>"Ineffective"</strong> etc</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h5>Etiology</h5>
                        <p>The second part of the diagnostic statement which points out the source of the problem or the contributing factor to the problem. It helps identify the specific nursing intervention to correct/rectify the problem.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Evidence/manifestations/signs and symptoms</h5>
                        <p>They do substantiate the nursing diagnosis and they come as the last part of a 3 order/part nursing diagnosis. NB:- Actual nursing diagnosis should come before potential one. Nursing unlike medicine doesn't yet have a complete taxonomy of diagnosis labels. The official organization that has assumed the responsibility for developing the taxonomy for nursing diagnosis and formulating nursing diagnosis is North America Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA). The compiled and categorized nursing diagnosis by NANDA are updated at least every 2 years.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Pain related to inflammation of the lung tissue as evidenced by patient reporting pain.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pain</strong> - problem</li>
                            <li><strong>Inflammation of the lung tissue</strong> - etiology</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient reporting pain</strong> - defining characteristics</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Potential nursing diagnosis has only two components:- problem and etiology.</p>

                        <h3>Guidelines for writing a nursing diagnosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The medical diagnosis should not be included in the diagnostic statement e.g. it is wrong to say "Altered nutrition less than body requirement related to gastro-enteritis".</li>
                            <li>The two parts of the diagnosis SHOULD NOT mean the same thing e.g. "Altered comfort related to pain OR inability to feed self related to feeding problem". Correct - "self care deficit or feeding deficit related to weakness in the hands".</li>
                            <li>Etiological factors SHOULD NOT Be expressed in terms that cannot be changed e.g. "dysfunctional grieving related to death of spouse" OR "Alteration in comfort, pain related to surgical incision".</li>
                            <li>Avoid value judgment: avoid use of words such as poor, good, unhealthy, inadequate etc implies value judgment.</li>
                            <li>A patients behaviour should not be judged by the nurse's personal behaviour and standards e.g. it will be wrong to say "Disturbance in self image related to poor relationship with parents" instead say " Disturbance in self image related to prolonged separation from parents".</li>
                            <li>Avoid reversing the clauses: it may result in unclear communication about the problem and etiology leading to difficulties in writing appropriate outcome and nursing orders. E.g it will be wrong to say "Decreased calorie intake related to alteration in nutrition". Correct- "alteration in nutrition less than body requirement related to decreased calorie intake".</li>
                            <li>Write in legally acceptable terms. E.g it will be wrong to say "risk for injury related to lack of side rails" OR "ineffective airway related to frequent suctioning". Correct- risk for injury related to dizziness or motor weakness.</li>
                            <li>Use "related to" rather than "due to" or "caused by". This suggests that it is a contributing factor. "Related to" identifies a relationship between the problem and the etiology. Related to does not imply cause-effect relationship. "Due to" implies cause -effect relationship.</li>
                            <li>Write the diagnosis in terms of response rather than need. The problem should reflect response to illness. Therapeutic or functional needs e.g "needs frequent turning", "needs mouth care", "needs nutritious diet", they describe nursing interventions and not responses.</li>
                            <li>The actual nursing diagnosis should come before the potential nursing diagnosis in the nursing care plan.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Differences between nursing & medical diagnosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nursing diagnosis is a nursing judgment and refers to a condition that nurses are permitted to treat and/or manage. It describes a patient's physical, sociocultural, psychological and spiritual responses to an illness or a health problem.</li>
                            <li>A medical diagnosis is made by a physician and refers to a condition that he/her can treat. It is a disease processes with specific pathophysiological responses that are fairly uniform from one patient to another.</li>
                            <li>A patient's medical diagnosis remains the same for as long as the disease process is present.</li>
                            <li>Nursing diagnoses change as the patient's responses change.</li>
                            <li>They (N.D.) relate to the nurse's independent functions in the areas of healthcare that are unique to nursing and separate distinct from medical management.</li>
                            <li>Nurses have responsibilities related to both medical and nursing diagnosis.</li>

                            <li><strong>High priority:</strong> life threatening condition e.g. bleeding.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medium priority:</strong> less life threatening conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Low priority:</strong> require minimal intervention.</li>
                        </ul>
