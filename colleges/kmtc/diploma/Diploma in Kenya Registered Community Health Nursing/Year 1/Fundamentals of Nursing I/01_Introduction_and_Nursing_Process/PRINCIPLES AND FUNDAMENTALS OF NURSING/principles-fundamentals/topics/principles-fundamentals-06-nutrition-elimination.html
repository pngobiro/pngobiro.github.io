                            <li>This may involve preparation, serving and feeding depending on the hospital policy</li>
                            <li>Nutrition is a vital component in management of many conditions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Diet is categorized into two categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Normal diet</li>

                            <li>It is the most frequently ordered diet</li>
                            <li>The patient should be able to choose food of their choice</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Reasons for Giving Therapeutic Diet</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rising or reducing body weight</li>
                            <li>Regulate amount of certain nutrients in some disease</li>
                            <li>Aiding in digestion, malabsorption and maldigestion</li>
                            <li>Eliminating food that the body can not tolerate e.g. allergic conditions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Therapeutic diet can be modified in the following ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>According to Texture: Liquid; Normal diet; Soft</li>
                            <li>According to Constituent of Nutrients: High protein; Carbohydrates; Low Calcium</li>
                            <li>According to Energy Content - Low calories</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>1. MODIFICATION ACCORDING TO TEXTURE</h4>
                        <h5>a) Liquid Diet</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are foods that are liquid at room temperature.</li>
                            <li>Mostly used in post - operative patients</li>
                            <li>Also indicated in patients with difficulty in chewing</li>
                            <li>Easily absorbed</li>
                            <li>Do not stimulate peristalsis, hence can be used in patients with diarrhea</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>They include:</p>
                        <p><strong>i) Clear Liquid</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contains inadequate calories.</li>
                            <li>Patient receiving this diet should be given nutritional supplements. They shouldn't be given this diet for more than three days</li>
                            <li>Examples: Fruit juices, Beverages, Water, Dextrose</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>ii) Full Liquid</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contains most nutrients though may be inadequate in fibre e.g. milk, commercially made liquid diet</li>
                            <li>It is indicated for transition after surgery to soft diet</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>b) Soft Diet</h5>
                        <p>Is divided into two major categories, both of which are nutritionally adequate and mostly used for transition from liquid to normal diet</p>
                        <p><strong>i) Digestive Soft Diet</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Food is easily digested and easily absorbed.</li>
                            <li>Contains less fat, less fibre and no seasoning.</li>
                            <li>Should contain protein but in less amounts</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>ii) Mechanically Soft Diet</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Little or no chewing is required.</li>
                            <li>Used in patients with difficulty in chewing</li>
                            <li>Foods are chopped or blended before being given to patients</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>a) Carbohydrate Controlled Diet</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The amount of carbohydrates is reduced e.g. diabetes mellitus</li>
                            <li>A specific amount is recommended in such patients depending on blood glucose</li>
                            <li>Some carbohydrates may be restricted e.g. In lactose intolerance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>b) Fat Controlled Diet</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A low fat diet contains very little or no fats - Carbohydrates are given in such cases to provide energy</li>
                            <li>A diet can also be modified in types of foods and patients are discouraged from taking saturated fats, which are common in animal fats as they increase risk of cardiovascular disease</li>
                            <li>A high fat diet (ketogenic diet) contains high levels of fats is indicated for patients with seizures. It is unfit for patients with malabsorption and pancreatic disease. In such cases, a low fat diet is used</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>c) Protein Modified Diet</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High protein diet used in patients who require tissue repair or those in active growth (children, neonates, adolescence), patients with burns and those who have undergone major surgery</li>
                            <li>Low protein diet (restricted protein diet) mostly prescribed in patients with liver and some kidney disorders</li>
                            <li>A specific type of protein may also be restricted in some conditions e.g. gluten in cases of celiac disease</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>d) Electrolyte Modified Diet</h4>
                        <h5>i) Sodium Restricted Diet</h5>
                        <p>Indicated in patients with cardiovascular disease and renal disease</p>
                        <p><strong>Mild Restrictions</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient should take 3000-4000 mls/day</li>
                            <li>Salt can be added when cooking in little amount. No salt addition on the table</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Moderate Restrictions</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient should take 1000-2000 mls/day</li>
                            <li>No salt should be added while cooking nor on the table</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Strict Restrictions</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient shouldn't take more than 50 mls . No salt addition to food and any salty foods are eliminated from the diet</li>
                            <li>Used in severe hypertension</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>ii) Calcium Modified Diet</h5>
                        <ul><li>It is increased in osteoporosis and reduced in urinary tract stones e.g. renal stones</li></ul>
                        <h5>iii) Phosphorus Modified Diet</h5>
                        <ul><li>It is reduced in patients with renal failure</li></ul>
                        <h5>iv) Potassium Modified Diet</h5>
                        <ul><li>Increased in patients taking diuretics and reduced in patients with kidney failure</li></ul>
                        <h4>e) Fibre Modified Diet</h4>
                        <p>Can be high fibre diet (high fibre content) or low fibre diet (low fibre content). Soluble fibre decreases amounts of cholesterol in blood and reduce transit time while insoluble fibre increases bulk in stool while increasing peristalsis</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low fibre diet is less stimulating to the GIT. Indicated in severe diarrhea and post - operatively</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Indicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastritis.</li>
                            <li>It is high in calories but limits foods that stimulate gastro - intestinal tract to produce more acid</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Points to Consider before Feeding Patients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make patients comfortable</li>
                            <li>Give a bedpan or urinal before meals to prevent interruption</li>
                            <li>Cover any wounds, blood or urine bags</li>
                            <li>Remove all unnecessary items</li>
                            <li>Avoid unpleasant drugs or painful injections during meals</li>
                            <li>Analgesics should be given 30 minutes before meals to ensure patient is pain free</li>
                            <li>Position patients appropriately in Fowler's position unless the condition doesn't allow</li>

                        <p>They are retained in the bowel for a prolonged period for different reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Oil Retention Enemas:</strong> Lubricate the intestinal mucosa making defecation easier.</li>
                            <li><strong>Carminative Enemas:</strong> Help expel flatus from the rectum and provide relief from gaseous distention. Include milk and molasses, magnesium sulphate and glycerin</li>
                            <li><strong>Medicated Enemas:</strong> Used to administer medication absorbed by rectal mucosa e.g. dexamethasone in ulcerative colitis</li>
                            <li><strong>Anti-Helminthic Enemas</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>They are occasionally administered to expel flatus</li>
                            <li>In and adult, 100-200 mls of the solution is instilled into the rectum and sigmoid colon and then the solution container is lowered so that the solution flows back into the container</li>
                            <li>The process is repeated 5-6 times</li>
                            <li>The alternating flow of solution stimulates peristalsis and helps in expelling flatus</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Complications of Enemas</h4>

                        <h3>CATHETERIZATION</h3>
                        <p>A catheter is a tube made of vicryl or latex and is inserted into the urinary bladder to drain urine. Catheterization is the process of inserting a catheter through the urethra into the urinary bladder for drainage of urine or instillation of drugs.</p>
                        <h4>TYPES OF CATHETERS</h4>
                        <h5>1. According to Site</h5>
                        <p><strong>a) Urinary Catheter</strong> - Inserted through the urethral meatus into the bladder</p>
                        <p><strong>b) Supra - pubic Catheter</strong> - Inserted through an incision made at the supra pubic area into the bladder. It is used when there is obstruction of urethra or after urethral operation</p>
                        <p><strong>c) Uridom/Uricondom</strong> - It is used in male patients to cover the penis. It is an external male catheter used in patients with urinary incontinence</p>

                        <h5>2. According to Duration</h5>
                        <p><strong>a) Straight or In and Out Catheter</strong> - Inserted to drain urine and removed immediately and discard</p>
                        <p><strong>b) In-dwelling/Retention</strong> - The catheter remains in place for sometime and is anchored by an inflated balloon inside the bladder. The most commonly used of Foley's catheter which contains two cavities, one for urinary out flow and the other for inflating the balloon. Others may have three or more cavities e.g. those used for bladder irrigation</p>
