                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        <p><strong>IPC</strong> is the utilization of procedures and techniques in the surveillance investigation and compilation of statistical data in order to minimize the spread of infection.</p>
                        <p>It is also defined as the collective process of efforts made by the health care providers and clients to minimize the risk of infection or prevent the transmission of infectious agents.</p>
                        <p>Infection control practices are aimed at controlling or eliminating the sources of infection. Nurses are responsible for protecting themselves and clients by using infection control practices</p>
                        <p><strong>Pathogens:</strong> Micro - organisms that cause diseases in humans</p>
                        <p><strong>Pathogenicity:</strong> The ability of a micro - organism to produce disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>Virulence :</strong> The degree of pathogenicity of an infectious micro - organism.</p>
                        <p><strong>Colonization:</strong> The multiplication of micro organism on or within a host that does not result in cellular injury</p>
                        <p><strong>Infection:</strong> Invasion and multiplication of micro organisms in body tissue that results in cellular injury. These micro - organisms are called infectious agents.</p>
                        <p><strong>Communicable Agents:</strong> Infectious agents that are capable of being transmitted to a client by direct or indirect contact, through a vehicle (vector) or airborne route.</p>
                        <p><strong>Communicable Diseases:</strong> Diseases produces by these agents</p>
                        <p><strong>Flora:</strong> Micro - organisms on the human body. They are of two types - Resident Flora: Micro organisms that are always present, usually without altering patient's health, they can't be removed with only hand washing with soap, but friction does; Transient flora: They are episodic, attaching to the skin for a brief period of time but do not continually live there, acquired through direct contact with organism or environmental surfaces, easily removed on hand washing</p>

                        <h3>The Disease Transmission Cycle</h3>
                        <p>All micro-organisms can cause infection or disease. But this happens when there is an interaction between the agent, host and environment which can occur when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The normal flora are introduced into an area of the body in which they are not normally found</li>
                            <li>Pathogens are introduced into the body</li>
                            <li>Micro-organisms are introduced into the body of a person who is immuno-compromised and thus susceptible to infections</li>
                            <li><strong>Agent:</strong> An entity that is capable of causing disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biological Agents:</strong> Living organisms that invade the host e.g. bacteria, virus, fungi, protozoa and rickettsia</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemical Agents:</strong> Substances that interact with the body e.g. pesticides, food additives, medications and industrial chemicals</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical Agents:</strong> Factors in the environment that are capable of causing disease e.g. heat, noise and radiation</li>
                            <li><strong>Host:</strong> Simple or complex organism that can be affected by an agent</li>
                            <li><strong>Susceptible Host:</strong> A person who lacks resistance to an agent and is thus vulnerable to disease</li>
                            <li><strong>Compromised Host:</strong> A person whose normal defense mechanisms have been impaired and is therefore susceptible to infection</li>
                            <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Includes any other thing other than the host and agent. Environmental factors affecting the chain of infection include food, water, plants, animals, housing conditions, noise etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Reservoirs:</strong> Natural habitat of a micro organism where it grows and multiplies</p>
                        <p><strong>Portal of exit:</strong> Route of exit from a reservoir or source</p>
                        <p><strong>Mode of transmission:</strong> Channels through which micro - organisms are transferred to susceptible individual</p>
                        <p><strong>Vector:</strong> Invertebrates that transmit pathogens e.g. mosquitoes, snails, tsetse flies</p>
                        <p><strong>Portal of entry:</strong> Point at which micro organisms enter the host</p>

                        <h4>MODES OF TRANSMISSION</h4>
                        <h5>Direct Modes of Transmission</h5>
                        <p><strong>Contact Transmission:</strong> The most important and frequent mode of transmission. It involves direct physical transfer of an agent from an infected to a host through direct contact with a contaminated object or contact with contaminated secretions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Airborne Transmission:</strong> Occurs when a susceptible host contacts droplet nuclei or dust particles that are suspended in the air</p>
                        
                        <h5>Indirect modes of Transmission</h5>
                        <p><strong>Vehicle Transmission:</strong> Occurs when an agent is transferred to a susceptible host by inanimate objects such as water and food.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vector - Borne Transmission:</strong> Occurs when an agent is transferred to a susceptible host by animate means such as mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, lice.</p>

                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The WHO's guidelines demand that you should treat all patients as potentially infectious.</p>
                        <p>In the health care setting infection can be transmitted:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When the health care worker's skin is pierced or cut by contaminated needles or other sharp instruments</li>
                            <li>When the health care worker's broken skin (cuts, scratches, rashes, chapped skin, fungal infections) comes into contact with the patient's blood or other body fluids</li>
                            <li>When the patient's blood or other body fluids are splashed on the healthcare worker's mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>According to WHO guidelines, a health care provider should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Observe and maintain good personal hygiene and wear appropriate attire.</li>
                            <li>Be vaccinated against vaccine preventable conditions, especially if you are working in high risk areas.</li>
                            <li>If you work in vulnerable areas, for example areas where you handle cooked food, you should be periodically screened for certain diseases, such as typhoid.</li>
                            <li>If you are suffering from infectious conditions and you are working with susceptible patients, for example, in an operating room, special care baby unit, or the ICU burns unit, you should be redeployed until you are cleared of the infection</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Adherence to appropriate infection prevention practices breaks the cycle of spreading infections at the mode of transmission stage. This will:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prevent post procedure infections</li>
                            <li>Result in high quality, safe services</li>
                            <li>Prevent infections in service providers and supportive staff</li>
                            <li>Protect the community from infections that originate in health care facilities</li>
                            <li>Prevent the spread of micro-organisms that are resistant to antibiotics</li>
                            <li>Lower the cost of health care services</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Standard Safety Precautions</h3>
                        <p>They are a set of clinical practice recommendations designed to help minimize the risk of exposure to infectious materials, such as blood and other body fluids by both patients and staff. They help break the disease transmission cycle at the mode of transmission step.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are also referred to as principles of medical asepsis</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A standard procedure is a procedure that should be followed routinely at all times. It should apply to every patient regardless of their presumed infection status. This is because you will not be able to tell who is infected with viruses such as HIV or hepatitis</p>

                            <li>The three elements that are essential for effective hand washing are: Soap; Running water and Friction</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Types of hand washing</h4>
                        <p><strong>a) Routine hand washing using plain soap and running water</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Removes transient micro-organisms and soil, blood or other organic material from the hands.</li>
                            <li>This method is appropriate in most situations and the hands should be washed as frequently as possible</li>
                            <li>Removes 80-90% of micro - organisms</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>b) Hand washing with antiseptic and running water</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In this method, transient micro-organisms and soil are removed.</li>
                            <li>It kills or inhibits the growth of resident microorganisms. Moreover, it may reduce the risk of infections in high risk situations, such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"When there is heavy microbial contamination</li>
                                    <li>"Before performing invasive procedures such as vein punctures and other aseptic procedures</li>
                                    <li>"Before contact with patients who have immune defects, for example, patients with burns, leukemia etc.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Scrubbing with antiseptic before beginning surgical procedures will help prevent the growth of micro-organisms for a period of time.</li>
                            <li>It will also reduce the risk of infections to the patient if the gloves are damaged.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Applicable before surgical or sterile procedure</p>

                                            <li>High level disinfectants kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and some bacterial endospores.</li>
                                            <li>Some high level disinfectants can be used to sterilize equipment and if given sufficient time to act, they are able to destroy bacterial endospores that cause diseases such as tetanus and gas gangrene. Bacterial endospores are difficult to kill because of their protective casing or coating.</li>
                                            <li>They are also used for processing instruments and other items.</li>

                        <p>While products containing chlorhexidine are ideal for surgical hand scrub and skin preparation in general, they may not be the best antiseptics to use in the genital area, vagina and cervix because of the small potential for irritating these areas. Iodophors are a better choice for use in these areas. If iodophor is not available, a product containing chlorhoxidine is the best alternative.</p>

                            <li>Wipe the skin in a circular motion, beginning in the center of the site then moving outwards.</li>
                            <li>Use sterile cotton balls or cotton wool sponges held on sponge forceps.</li>
                            <li>Any of the following antiseptics may be used as listed in the preferred order:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"An iodophor (Betadine); then wait for two minutes and wipe off the excess with sterile dry cotton or gauze</li>
                                    <li>"4% Chlorhexidine (HIbiclens) wipe off excess with sterile, dry cotton or gauze</li>
                                    <li>1-3 % iodine, followed by 60-90% alcohol (ethyl or isopropyl) then allow to air dry</li>
                                    <li>Chlorhexidine with cetrimide (Savlon) wipe off the excess with sterile, dry cotton or gauze</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Apply an appropriate antiseptic (iodophor) to the vagina and cervix before passing instruments into the uterus such as IUD insertion, uterine evacuation.</li>
                            <li>Alcohol based antiseptics should not be used on the vagina, cervix or other mucous membranes because they are damaging to these tissues.</li>

                        <h3>Management of Injuries from needles and other sharps</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wash needle sticks and cuts with soap and water.</li>
                            <li>Flush the nose, mouth or skin with water if splashed with blood or body fluid.</li>
                            <li>Irrigate the eyes with water or saline if splashed with body fluid.</li>
                            <li>Report to the immediate supervisor</li>
                            <li>Ensure initiation of the first dose of Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible. It should be initiated preferably within 2 hours and up to 72 hours post exposure</li>
                            <li>Evaluation of exposure will entail determination of the type of body substance and route and severity of exposure. This will include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Baseline HIV and HBV status of the source of exposure</li>
                                    <li>Baseline HIV and HBV status of the affected health care worker</li>
                                    <li>Determination of the PEP regimen</li>
                                </ul>

                            </li>
                            <li>This will then be followed by management and follow - up of the health worker, which will entail:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Counseling and provision of PEP drugs</li>
                                    <li>Monitor and manage PEP toxicity 2 weeks after starting the regimen</li>
                                    <li>HIV testing at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Generally the prophylaxis will include:</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Instruments can be classified into the following categories:</p>
                        <p><strong>Low Risk Instruments</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They come into contact with intact skin. Cleaning and drying them is adequate e.g. thermometer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Intermediate Risk</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They don't penetrate the intact skin but come into contact with mucous membrane</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>High Risk</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They penetrate intact skin or sterile tissues. Require cleaning and sterilization or high level disinfection where sterilization is not applicable</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Instrument processing entails three steps which are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Decontamination</li>
                            <li>Cleansing</li>
                            <li>Sterilization or high level disinfection.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>DECONTAMINATION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the process of elimination of pathogens except the spore from inanimate things.</li>
                            <li>Is the first step in processing instruments and other items for re-use.</li>
                            <li>Decontamination kills viruses and many microorganisms, making the instruments and other items safe to handle by the staff who clean them.</li>
                            <li>Decontamination also makes instruments and other items easier to clean by preventing blood, other body fluids and tissue from drying on them.</li>
                            <li>Decontamination is done by soaking instruments and other items immediately after use, in a 0.5% chlorine solution for 10 minutes immediately after use.</li>
                            <li>This is prepared in a ratio of 1:6 (one part of jik to 6 parts of water)</li>
                            <li>A container of this solution should be kept in every operating room and procedure room so that used items can be placed directly into the bucket.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>CLEANSING</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the removal of soil organic material from instruments and equipment used in providing patient care</li>
                            <li>Is the second step in processing of equipment</li>
                            <li>It involves the use of water, mechanical agent and sometimes detergent</li>
                            <li>Reusable objects are cleansed prior to sterilization</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Steps for Proper Cleansing</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rinse object under cold water since warm water causes proteins in organic material to coagulate and stick</li>
                            <li>Apply detergent and scrub under running water with soft - bristled brush</li>
                            <li>Rinse the object in water</li>
                            <li>Dry prior to sterilization</li>
                            <li>Note: Nurse should wear gloves, masks and goggles during cleansing</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>STERILIZATION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the process that eliminates all microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, including bacterial endospores.</li>
                            <li>It is recommended for instruments and other items that come into contact with the bloodstream or tissues under the skin.</li>
                            <li>Can be performed using steam under pressure (autoclaving or moist heat), dry heat or chemicals.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>1. Steam Sterilization (Autoclaving)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is a method of sterilization that requires moist heat under pressure. Steam is produced by water and heat. The heat maintains the required temperature under pressure.</li>
                            <li>Heat can be provided by electricity, gas stove, or kerosene burner.</li>
                            <li>Moist heat under pressure allows efficient destruction of micro-organisms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Steps of steam sterilization:</h5>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Decontaminate, clean and dry all instruments and other items to be sterilized.</li>
                            <li>Open or unlock all joined instruments and other items, for example, hemostats.</li>
                            <li>Disassemble scissors with sliding or multiple parts to allow steam to reach all surfaces of the item. Do not arrange the instruments and other items tightly together, because steam will not reach all surfaces.</li>
                            <li>Wrap instruments and other items in two layers of paper, cotton or muslin fabric before steam sterilization.</li>
                            <li>If you are using a drum, make sure the holes are</li>
                            <li>Arrange all packs, drums or unwrapped items in the chamber of the autoclave in a way that allows steam to circulate freely.</li>
                            <li>Always follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to operate the autoclave but sterilize wrapped items for 30 minutes and unwrapped items for 20 minutes at 121°C and 15.36 Pascal pressure.</li>
                            <li>If the autoclave is automatic, the heat will shut off and the pressure will begin to fall once the sterilization cycle is complete.</li>
                            <li>If the autoclave is not automatic, turn off the heat or remove the autoclave from the heat source after 30 minutes if items are wrapped, or after 20 minutes if items are unwrapped..</li>
                            <li>Wait until the pressure gauge reads "zero" to open the autoclave</li>
                            <li>Open the lid or door to allow the remaining steam to escape. Leave instrument packs or items in the autoclave until they dry completely.</li>
                            <li>Remove the packs, drums or unwrapped items from the autoclave using sterile pick ups.</li>
                            <li>Place packs or drums on a surface padded with paper or fabric until they are cool to prevent condensation.</li>
                            <li>Wait until the packs, drums or items reach room temperature before storing.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>Storage of Autoclaved / Sterile items</h5>
                        <p><strong>Wrapped Items</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Shelf life:</strong> The length of time a wrapped sterile item is considered sterile. It depends on whether or not a contaminating event occurs.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shelf life is affected by a number of factors which include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Type of packaging material used</li>
                                    <li>Cleanliness of the store</li>
                                    <li>Humidity in the store</li>
                                    <li>Temperature of the storage area</li>
                                    <li>Storing the packs on open or closed shelves</li>
                                    <li>Usage of dust proof covers</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Storage time and handling of sterile packs should be kept to a minimum, since the likelihood of handling and contamination increases over time. Place sterile packs in closed cabinets in areas that are not heavily trafficked, have moderate temperature and are dry.</p>
                        <p><strong>Unwrapped Items</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Should be used immediately after removal from the autoclave.</li>
                            <li>They can also be kept in a covered, sterile container for up to one week.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>2. Dry Heat Sterilization or Hot-Air Oven (Electric Oven)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the method of sterilization that requires heat for a specific period of time.</li>
                            <li>This method is used for sterilizing glass or metal objects because high temperatures are necessary.</li>
                            <li>Also used to sterilize instruments with cutting edges</li>
                            <li>Need to ensure that the designated temperature is reached
                                <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>3. Chemical Sterilization</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the method of sterilization used for instruments and other items that are heat sensitive or when heat sterilization is unavailable.</li>
                            <li>Instruments and other items can be sterilized by soaking them in a chemical solutions such as glutaraldehyde (cidex) or formalin, followed by rinsing in sterile water.</li>
                            <li>Glutaraldehyde is irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Wear gloves and limit your exposure time. Keep the area well ventilated when using it. Always follow manufacturer's instructions before use.</li>
                            <li>7% Glutaraldehyde : 8-10 hours, while 8% Formalin: 24 hours</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>4. Ethylene Oxide</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is a chemical substance used for heat destroyed instruments</li>
                            <li>Should be used with precaution because it is gaseous, toxic and explosive</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>5. High Level Disinfection</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the process that eliminates all microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites), but does not reliably kill all bacterial endospores which cause tetanus and gas gangrene.</li>
                            <li>Is suitable for instruments and other items that will come into contact with broken skin or intact mucous membranes.</li>
                            <li>HLD can be performed by boiling (20minutes), use of chemicals (20minutes in 3% formalin/ 2% glutaraldehyde) or steaming.</li>

                            <li>It is the process of sorting of hospital waste into different categories based on the nature of waste.</li>
                            <li>Segregation at the point of origin, aided by suitable and consistent packaging, is vital in enabling different forms of waste to be handled, transported and disposed of in a manner which is safe and in keeping with the nature of the waste.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During waste segregation, waste is categorized into four categories based on their nature:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Non Infectious Waste:</strong> Includes food remains, waste paper and packaging material. Disposed in a BLACK color coded bin</li>
                            <li><strong>Infectious Waste:</strong> Includes routine clinical waste e.g. gloves, gauzes and bandages. Disposed in YELLOW color coded bins</li>
                            <li><strong>Highly Infectious:</strong> This includes body tissues/ parts e.g. teeth, placenta. Disposed in RED color coded bins</li>
                            <li><strong>Sharps:</strong> Included needles and surgical blades. Disposed in a SHARPS BOX. The container should be at arms length</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>It is a technique that aims at preventing cross infection of communicable diseases through fecal - oral route e.g. Typhoid, Dysentery, Hepatitis A</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Principles of Barrier Nursing</h4>
                        <p>The patient should be nursed in private room as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain the procedure to the patient to enhance co-operation</li>
                            <li>Equip the room with all the patient's requirements</li>
                            <li>Place or keep protective devices near the room</li>
                            <li>Put a barrier notice and ensure the room has a sink and water</li>
                            <li>Always use protective devices when attending to the patient</li>
                            <li>Number of people entering the room should be limited</li>
                            <li>Items in the room shouldn't be used by another patient</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Reverse Barrier Nursing</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nursing technique by which an immuno compromised client is protected from infection</li>
                            <li>Aims at protecting susceptible patient from infections</li>
                            <li>Protects the client from acquiring nasocomial infections</li>
                            <li>Indicated is excessive burns, acute renal failure, leukemia</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Principles of Reverse Barrier Nursing</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient should be isolated</li>
                            <li>Air entering the room should be filtered</li>
                            <li>Number of people entering the room should be limited</li>
                            <li>All equipment to be used by the patient should decontaminated and not shared</li>
                            <li>Temperature should be monitored</li>
                            <li>Fresh flowers and fruits should be kept in the room since they help contain toxoplasmosis</li>

                        <p>Since most important parts of the environment of a hospitalized patient is bed, bed making is important to nurses</p>
                        <p>A clean bed that is wrinkle - free and remains intact when a patient moves around does a great deal for the patient's physical and psychological comfort</p>
                        <h3>Aims of Bed Making</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make the ward neat</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>PRINCIPLES OF ASEPSIS IN BED MAKING</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Micro - organisms move through space in air currents, therefore:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"Handle linen carefully</li>
                                    <li>"Avoid throwing it on the floor to prevent spread of any micro - organisms present either on the floor or linen</li>
                                    <li>"Avoid shaking or tossing it into the laundry hamper/ linen carrier</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Micro - organisms are transferred from one surface to another on contact, therefore:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"Hold soiled linen and clean linen way from your uniform to prevent contamination of either</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>Proper hand washing before you begin and after bed making</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>BODY MECHANICS IN BED MAKING</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When bending, bend your knees, not your back in order to keep the center of gravity above and close to the base of support and help prevent fatigue</li>
                            <li>Face your entire body in the direction that you are moving to avoid twisting in order to prevent strain or injury</li>
                            <li>Organize your work. Conserve your steps by making a few trips around the bed as possible</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Special Appliances used in Bed Making</h3>
                        <p>Special beds are used on many occasions for the comfort of the patient, protection of bed linen, prevention of pressure sores, facilitation of easier putting of patients in bed and care of patients with certain conditions</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Extra appliances may be added to the requirements for a simple bed in the preparation of special beds</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These appliances include:</p>
                        <h4>Mackintosh</h4>
                        <p>Water proof material used to protect the bottom sheets, pillows and mattress from getting wet</p>
                        <h4>Bed Cradle</h4>
                        <p>Appliance used to keep the weight of the linen off the patient e.g. in patient with burns to protect linen from touching the area with wound</p>
                        <h4>Bed Blocks</h4>
                        <p>Made of wood and used to raise the bed on one side e.g. to supply blood to vital organs like the brain</p>
                        <h4>Bed Rest/Back Rest</h4>
                        <p>Help the patient sit in upright position. May be attached to or separate from the bed and can be adjusted to different degrees</p>
                        <h4>Fracture Boards</h4>
                        <p>They are boards (wooden) placed under the mattress to provide a firm rigid foundation to the bed and prevent the mattress from sagging. Aid in immobilization on affected part of the body.</p>
                        <h4>Sand Bags</h4>
                        <p>Small bags made of impermeable material filled with sand. They are used to support patients legs to prevent foot drop. May also be used to immobilize a fractured limb</p>
                        <h4>Air - Rings</h4>
                        <p>Rubber ring placed beneath the patient's buttocks to keep them from direct contact with the bed. Relieve pressure hence prevent pressure sores.</p>
                        <h4>Bed Tables</h4>
                        <p>Specially made tables which can be drawn up in front of the patient and may be used during meals or for leaning slightly forward incase the patient has difficulty in breathing</p>
                        <h4>Hot Water Bottles</h4>
                        <p>Bottles of rubber used to give warmth to the patient. They may also be used to relieve pain</p>
                        <h4>Foot Boards</h4>
                        <p>Used to secure and support the patients foot</p>
                        <h4>Water Beds</h4>
                        <p>They are just like mattress though have a place to fill with hot water</p>
                        <h4>Air Beds</h4>
                        <p>These are mattresses that are filled with air</p>
                        <h4>Ripple Mattresses</h4>
                        <p>Have segments and uses electricity to put air pressure. Used to relieve pressure</p>
