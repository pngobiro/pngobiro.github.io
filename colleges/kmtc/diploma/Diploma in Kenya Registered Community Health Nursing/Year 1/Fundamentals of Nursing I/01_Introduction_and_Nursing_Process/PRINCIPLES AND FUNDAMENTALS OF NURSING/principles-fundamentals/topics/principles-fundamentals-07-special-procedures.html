                        <h3>CLASSIFICATION OF WOUNDS</h3>
                        <p>Wounds are classified based on various factors:</p>
                        <h4>a) According to Intension</h4>
                        <ul><li><strong>Intentional Wounds:</strong> Occur out of will e.g. surgical wounds</li></ul>
                        <h4>b) According to Mechanism of Injury</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Incised:</strong> Caused by a sharp object and have sharp edges e.g. surgical wounds</li>
                            <li><strong>Lacerated:</strong> Have rugged/uneven edges. They are caused by things like barbed wire</li>
                            <li><strong>Abrasion:</strong> Results from rubbing of the skin against a surface</li>
                            <li><strong>Contused:</strong> Result from a blunt force and are characterized by excessive damage to soft tissue</li>
                            <li><strong>Puncture:</strong> Wounds that are deep into a tissue but with a small opening on a surface e.g. a bullet wound</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>c) According to Degree of Contamination</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clean Wound:</strong> Made using aseptic technique. It is usually sutured</li>
                            <li><strong>Contaminated Wound:</strong> Occurred accidentally or surgically but there was a break of asepsis or spillage from GIT. Require cleaning with antiseptic before suturing</li>
                            <li><strong>Infected Wound:</strong> Contaminated by disease causing micro - organisms</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>DRESSING</h3>
                        <p>This is the covering applied on a wound. They are made of three layers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Contact Layer:</strong> Directly applied to the wound</li>
                            <li><strong>Middle Layer:</strong> Absorbs secretion of the wound</li>
                            <li><strong>Outer Layer:</strong> Holds/ secures the inner layers properly</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Types of Dressing</h4>
                        <h5>a) Dry-dry Dressing</h5>
                        <p>Placed to protect the wound from contamination. Placed when dry and removed when dry unless the wound is oozing</p>
                        <h5>b) Wet-dry Dressing</h5>
                        <p>Dressing are soaked with normal saline solution and placed on the wound. They are left to dry then they are removed. Tissue debris or necrotic tissue and drainage that sticks are removed with the dressing</p>
                        <h5>c) Wet - wet Dressing</h5>
                        <p>Dressings are soaked in solution and remain wet until they are removed. They provide moisture and warmth conducive for wound healing. Thick secretions can also be made loose and removed</p>
                        <h4>Advantages of Dressings</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Used to remove necrotic/ dead tissues</li>
                            <li>Prevent invasion by micro - organisms</li>
                            <li>Absorbs drainage</li>
                            <li>Control bleeding</li>
                            <li>Used to apply medication</li>
                            <li>Promote healing by providing warmth and moisture</li>
                            <li>Provide comfort</li>
                            <li>Protect wound from injury and trauma</li>
                            <li>Splint or immobilize the wound</li>
                            <li>Lesser scar tissue formation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide warmth and moisture which is a conducive environment for micro - organisms multiplication</li>
                            <li>They hinder wound from direct observation</li>
                            <li>Hinder activities like bathing, mobility and comfort of the patient</li>
                            <li>Some patients are hypersensitive to some dressing materials e.g. adhesive tape</li>
                            <li>They are expensive</li>

                        <p><strong>Absorbable Sutures:</strong> They are absorbed and will break down harmlessly in the body over time without intervention</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-Absorbable Sutures:</strong> Can't be absorbed and must be manually removed if they are not left indefinitely. They should be removed on the 7th - 8th day apart from the tension sutures which are removed on the 10th day post - operatively. Sutures in the neck region should be removed on the 5th day to prevent formation of ugly marks</p>

                        <h5>a) Major Surgery</h5>
                        <p>It is an operation that has any of the following characteristics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alteration of extensive body parts</li>

                        <h4>2. According to Agency</h4>
                        <h5>a) Emergent Surgery</h5>
                        <p>Operations that must be done immediately to save life.</p>
                        <ul><li>Delay can lead to loss of life or body function e.g. intestinal obstruction, cord prolapse</li></ul>
                        <h5>b) Urgent Surgery</h5>
                        <p>Essential operations that can be delayed for 1-2 days without causing harm to the patient</p>
                        <h5>c) Elective Surgery</h5>
                        <p>They are pre-planned by the doctor and the patient and are performed on patient's choice. Their delay can't cause harm to the patient. They can be optional where the operation is not essential e.g. cosmetic surgery</p>

                        <p>The awareness component of consciousness is mediated by the cortical activity within the cerebral hemispheres.</p>
