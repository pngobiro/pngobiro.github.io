                        <h3>Legal Aspects of Drugs</h3>
                        <p>There are two categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Statutory legislations relating to acts of parliament:</strong> These are general policies for administration of drugs in all hospitals</li>

                        <h4>1. The Pharmacy and Poisons Act: Chapter 244 of the Laws of Kenya, 1989</h4>
                        <p>This act makes better provision of:</p>
                        <ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This is an Act of Parliament to make provision with respect to the control of the possession of, and trafficking in, narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and cultivation of certain plants, to provide for forfeiture of property derived from, or used in, illicit traffic narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and for connected purposes.</li>

                            <li>The stock should be checked regularly</li>
                            <li>The drug keys should be on the person who is in charge of the ward or the deputy</li>
                            <li>Ampoules containing different drugs should be stored separately</li>
                            <li>Drugs should not be transferred from one bottle to another</li>

                        <h3>Drug Standards</h3>
                        <p>They are the yardsticks by which drug preparations are judged. Medicines vary in their purity, strength, bioavailability, efficacy and safety or toxicity.</p>
                        <h4>Purity</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Standards of purity, rarely require that the substance in question be 100% drug chemical. They do, however, specify the type and concentration of extraneous substances allowed to be present in the drug product.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A pure drug contains only a specific chemical agent with no contaminating ingredients. Drugs are not 100% pure because of the impurities from raw materials used for manufacturing them.</p>
                        <p>Other ingredients are added to the chemical to manipulate the absorption process. These additives include solvents, fillers, disintegrators, buffers, waxes, dyes, inks and plastics .</p>
                        <p>Contaminants from the environment of the production plant may find their way into a batch of drugs.</p>

                        <h3>Classification of Drugs</h3>
                        <p>Drugs may be classified in many ways.</p>
                        <p>Drugs with similar characteristics are often grouped together in families</p>
                        <p>One substance may belong to more than one family depending on the classification used for instance, aspirin, which is an analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory drug.</p>
                        <p>A drug may be designated by:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Chemical derivation, e.g. heavy metals, xanthines, steroids, phenothiazines, barbiturates</li>
                            <li>Mechanism of action, e.g. central nervous system depressant, anti-cholinergic, anti-inflammatory, antacid.</li>
                            <li>System they act on, e.g. cardiac, respiratory</li>
                            <li>Physiologic action, e.g. diuretic</li>
                            <li>Therapeutic effect, e.g. anticonvulsant, analgesic</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Drug Effects</h3>
                        <h4>1. Desired Therapeutic Effects</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The desired therapeutic effects should indicate the mechanism of action of the drug.</li>
                            <li>For example, an analgesic is for pain relief, accomplished by central nervous system depression inhibition of inflammation.</li>
                            <li>You must therefore understand how medication affects body function in order to make sound judgments about which medication to use</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>2. Side Effects</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are physiological effects exerted by the chemical that are not related to the desired therapeutic effect.</li>
                            <li>Note: All drugs have side effects. The number and range of side effects may indicate the relative toxicity of a given medication.</li>
                            <li>Adverse reactions include any undesirable effect apparent in the recipient. They may be opposite to the desired effect, allergic or extraneous.</li>
                            <li>Idiosyncratic are unusual effects seen in some patients due to individual differences. They refers to the tendency within the individual to react unfavorably to certain substances.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>3. Toxic Effects</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are excessive drug effects. They tend to be exaggerations of therapeutic or side effects. For example, toxicity from a central nervous system depressant used for sedation may induce a coma.</li>
                            <li>The margin of safety between therapeutic and toxic doses varies greatly.</li>
                            <li>Note: Any substance that is physiologically potent enough to produce therapeutic effects is potentially harmful to the body at certain circumstances.</li>
                            <li>Toxic symptoms could appear in clients receiving appropriate dosages. This is because drug response, metabolism and excretion vary from person to person</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>4. Contraindications</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are reasons that make it inadvisable to prescribe a particular drug</li>
                            <li>They are conditions or symptoms that alert you to the potential dangers of the drug.</li>
                            <li>You MUST always decline to administer any drug that you believe will cause harm to the client. In such cases, let the physician administer the drug personally.</li>
                            <li>In such a situation, there are legal implications and this is the reason for the decision not to administer the drug.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Dosage Range</h3>
                        <p>The usual dosage must be included for each method of administration. Dosages require adjustment according to certain factors:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Body mass:</strong> Drug dosages are mostly calculated as per kilo of body weight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nutritional status</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Pathologic condition</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Patients' ability to metabolize and excrete the drug</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Age:</strong> The extremes of age that is, children and adults over 60 years require smaller doses than the normal adult dose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Route:</strong> The route by which the drug may be given varies and the drug dosage may also vary according to the route of administration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assimilation:</strong> The assimilation of drugs given orally is fairly slow, thus the oral dose is large, whereas any drug injected into the blood stream acts immediately and dosage is proportionately smaller.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> When you notice any unusual dosages, you should verify and clarify with the doctor and refuse to carry out an order that, in your judgment, will result in harm to the patient.</p>
                        <h3>Elimination</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The efficiency of elimination affects the efficacy and potential for toxicity of a given medication.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Many drugs are deactivated by microsomal enzymes in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.</p>
                        <p>Always adhere to procedures that promote accurate identification of drugs before administering them to patients.</p>

                            <li><strong>Parenteral Route (Injection):</strong> The desired effect is systemic, drug is given by routes other than the digestive tract. This can be done in several ways including intra - dermally (dermis), subcutaneously (subcutaneous layer), intramuscularly (muscle), intravenously (vein), intra - arterial (artery), intra - osseous (bone marrow), intra - cerebral (brain parenchyma), intra - cerebroventricular (cerebral ventricular</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>The medication should be in should be in liquid form or powder form and mixed with liquid</li>
                            <li>If in tablet form, obtain physician's order before crushing. Never crush coated drugs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Rectal Route:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Medications include suppositories or enema.</li>
                            <li>Suppositories should be kept well and lubricated before insertion to reduce discomfort</li>
                            <li>Suitable for unconscious patients and children and for nauseous or vomiting patients</li>
                            <li>Easy to terminate exposure</li>
                            <li>Absorption may be variable</li>
                            <li>Good for drugs affecting the bowel such as laxatives</li>
                            <li>Irritating drugs contraindicated</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>PARENTERAL ROUTE</h3>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>More effective since they by pass metabolism</li>
                            <li>Suitable for drugs that can be digested by digestive enzymes, not absorbed by digestive system or those that are too irritant (anti - cancer)</li>
                            <li>Dosage is more accurate</li>
                            <li>The therapeutic effect is fast: 15-30 seconds for IV, 3-5 minutes for IM and subcutaneous</li>
                            <li>100% bioavailability</li>
                            <li>One injection can be formulated to last days or even months, e.g., Depo-Provera, a birth control shot that works for three months</li>
                            <li>IV can deliver continuous medication, e.g., morphine for patients in continuous pain, or saline drip for people needing fluids</li>
                            <li>Suitable for all patients even the unconscious, uncooperative and critically ill</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Painful</li>
                            <li>Increased risk of infection</li>
                            <li>Require skills to administer hence patients are not able to self-administer</li>
                            <li>Onset of action is quick, facilitating a greater risk of addiction and overdose when injecting drugs of abuse</li>
                            <li>Belonephobia, the fear of needles and injection.</li>
                            <li>If needles are shared, there is risk of HIV and other infectious diseases</li>
                            <li>It is the most dangerous route of administration because it bypasses most of the body's natural defenses, exposing the user to health problems such as hepatitis, abscesses, infections, and undissolved particles or additives/contaminants</li>
                            <li>If not done properly, potentially fatal air boluses (bubbles) can occur.</li>
                            <li>Need for strict asepsis</li>

                        <p>Intravenous (IV) fluids are those solutions instilled within the patient's vein. They may include solutions of water and chemicals normally found within the body, dissolved medications or blood, blood extracts and blood substitutes.</p>
                        <h4>INDICATIONS FOR INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To restore fluid balance quickly when a patient experiences a significant fluid loss</li>
                            <li>To prevent fluid imbalance for a patient who is currently or potentially likely to experience a loss of body fluid</li>
                            <li>To maintain fluid balance when the patient temporarily is unable to eat and drink</li>
                            <li>To replace specific electrolytes or other chemicals such as water soluble vitamins</li>
                            <li>To provide some measure of nutrition</li>
                            <li>To administer medications</li>
                            <li>To replace blood cells or specific components of blood</li>

                        <h3>CATEGORIES OF INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS</h3>
                        <p>There are two categories of intravenous fluids: crystalloid or colloid solutions.</p>
                        <h4>1. CRYSTALLOID SOLUTIONS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are a mixture of water and salt or sugar. The solutions are capable of passing through a semi - permeable membrane.</li>
                            <li>They can be further sub-divided into isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic solutions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An <strong>isotonic solution</strong> contains an equal amount of dissolved crystals as normally found in plasma e.g. 0.9 % saline (normal saline), 5% dextrose and Ringer's solution or lactated Ringer's.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>hypotonic solution</strong> contains fewer dissolved crystals than are normally found in plasma. It presents as a dilute solution in comparison to the fluid within and around cells e.g. 0.45% sodium chloride (Half Strength Darrow's) and 5% dextrose in 0.45 saline.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>hypertonic solution</strong> has a higher amount of dissolved crystals than present in plasma. Note: They are considered plasma expanders as they draw water into the intravascular compartment from the more dilute areas of water within the cells and interstitial spaces e.g. 10% and 50% dextrose</p>
                        <h4>2. COLLOIDS</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are high molecular - weight solutions, which draw fluid into the intravascular compartment via oncotic pressure (pressure exerted by plasma proteins not capable of passing through membranes on capillary wall).</li>
                            <li>They are plasma expanders, as they are composed of macromolecules, and are retained in the intravascular space</li>
                            <li>Examples: Albumin, Hetastarch, Pentastarch, Plasma and Dextran</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Buffer solutions are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis.</li>
                            <li>Lactated Ringer's solution also has some buffering effect.</li>
                            <li>A solution more specifically used for buffering purpose is intravenous sodium bicarbonate.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>VENIPUNCTURE</h3>
                        <p>It is the piercing of vein in order to gain access to blood stream</p>
                        <h4>Sites of Venipuncture</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Antecubital fossa</li>
                            <li>Hand (dorsal aspect especially the metacarpal veins)</li>
                            <li>Saphenous and femoral veins</li>
                            <li>Median brachial vein</li>
                            <li>Skull veins</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Factors to consider when selecting a vein</h4>
                        <p>Superficial veins are easily located and are more accessible for puncture. Veins in the arm and hands are preferred to veins in the foot or leg. Use veins in the arm or hand on the patient's non-dominant site. Avoid using an area of a vein that will compromise joint movement.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Avoid thin walled and scarred veins. They are difficult to enter. A normal vein is smooth, pliable and resilient.</li>
                            <li>Use larger veins for infusing hypertonic solutions, those containing irritant medications, those administered rapidly and those that are thick or sticky.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>INTRAVENOUS ACCESS</h3>
                        <h4>Hypodermic Needles</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The simplest form of intravenous access is by passing a hollow needle through the skin directly into the vein.</li>
                            <li>This needle can be connected directly to a syringe (used either to withdraw blood or deliver its contents into the bloodstream) or may be connected to a length of tubing for infusion</li>
                            <li>The most convenient site is often the arm, especially the veins on the back of the hand, or the median cubital vein at the elbow, but any identifiable vein can be used</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is necessary to use a tourniquet which restricts the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge.</p>
                        <p>Once the needle is in place, it is common to draw back slightly on the syringe to aspirate blood, thus verifying that the needle is really in a vein.</p>
                        <p>The tourniquet should be removed before injecting to prevent extravasation of the medication.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Peripheral Cannula</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the most common intravenous access method.</li>
                            <li>Peripheral IV line consists of a short catheter (a few centimeters long) inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein (any vein not inside the chest or abdomen).</li>
                            <li>This is usually in the form of a cannula-over-needle device, in which a flexible plastic cannula comes mounted on a metal trocar.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once the tip of the needle and cannula are located in the vein the trocar is withdrawn and discarded and the cannula advanced inside the vein to the appropriate position and secured. Blood may be drawn at the time of insertion.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any accessible vein can be used although arm and hand veins are used most commonly, with leg and foot veins used to a much lesser extent. In infants the scalp veins are sometimes used.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The caliber of cannula is commonly indicated in gauge, with 14 being a very large cannula (used in resuscitation settings) and 24-26 the smallest.</p>
                        <p>The most common sizes are 16-gauge (midsize line used for blood donation and transfusion), 18- and 20-gauge (all-purpose line for infusions and blood draws), and 22-gauge (all-purpose pediatric line).</p>
                        <p>12- and 14-gauge peripheral lines are capable of delivering large volumes of fluid extremely fast accounting for their popularity in emergency medicine. These lines are frequently called "large bores" or "trauma lines".</p>
                        <p>To make the procedure more tolerable for children medical staff may apply a topical local anesthesia for about 45 minutes beforehand.</p>
                        <p>The part of the catheter that remains outside the skin is called the connecting hub; it can be connected to a syringe or an intravenous infusion line, or capped with a heplock, a needleless connection filled with a small amount of heparin solution to prevent clotting, between treatments.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ported cannula have an injection port on the top that is often used to administer medicine.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>BLOOD TRANSFUSION</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is the process of receiving blood products into one's circulation intravenously.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Transfusions are used in a variety of medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blood can transfused either whole blood or only components of the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, clotting factors, and platelets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Purposes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To restore blood volume e.g. after excessive hemorrhage</li>
                            <li>To restore Hb level and RBCs in severe anemia</li>
                            <li>To restore leukocytes (WBCs)</li>
                            <li>To replace platelets and clotting factors (fresh frozen plasma)</li>
                            <li>To provide nutrition and reduce toxicity in case of poisoning</li>
