                            <li>They help establish baseline values of the cardiorespiratory integrity. Baseline values establish the norms against which subsequent measurements can be compared</li>
                            <li>To make a diagnosis and determine treatment options. Variations from the normal findings may indicate potential problems with the client's health status.</li>
                            <li>Monitor patients progress by comparing with previous findings</li>
                            <li>Monitor for side - effects of drugs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The frequency of vital signs measurement is determined by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient's condition</li>

                            <li>Temperature assessment involves measuring the balance between heat production and heat loss by the body</li>
                            <li>Temperature measurement is by Thermometers</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Basal Body Temperature</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is the lowest temperature attained by the body during rest (usually during sleep).</li>
                            <li>It is generally measured immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken, although the temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body temperature.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Core Temperature</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Also called core body temperature, is the operating temperature of an organism, specifically in deep structures of the body such as the liver, in comparison to temperatures of peripheral tissues.</li>
                            <li>Core temperature is normally maintained within a narrow range so that essential enzymatic reactions can occur.</li>
                            <li>Rectal temperature examination is used to estimate core temperature (oral temperature is affected by hot or cold drinks and mouthbreathing).</li>
                            <li>Rectal temperature is expected to be approximately one Fahrenheit degree higher than an oral temperature taken on the same person at</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Units Of Measurement</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Temperature is measured in Degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit</li>
                            <li>The Celsius thermometers use the Celsius (°C) as the measurement unit while the Fahrenheit thermometers use Fahrenheit (°F) as the temperature measurement unit.</li>
                            <li>Some thermometers have the measuring scales for both Celsius and Fahrenheit. These thermometers give the reading in Celsius as well as Fahrenheit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Mechanism of Different Types of Thermometers</h4>
                        <h5>1. Mercury and Alcohol Thermometers</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mercury thermometers have mercury filled in a glass tube and has a glass bulb at the bottom.</li>
                            <li>As the temperature increases, the mercury rises in the glass tube.</li>
                            <li>The glass tube is calibrated in Celsius, Fahrenheit or both. The rise in mercury determines the temperature according to the calibration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Alcohol thermometers have ethanol or toluene instead of mercury in the glass tube. All the other mechanism of the thermometer are same as that of the mercury thermometer.</p>
                        <h5>2. Digital Thermometers</h5>
                        <p>Digital thermometers use thermocouples or thermistors to sense the change in temperature and display the temperature on a digital display.</p>
                        <p>Infrared thermometers use the infrared sensors to determine the temperature and have a digital display.</p>

                        <h4>Pyrexia</h4>
                        <p>Commonly known as fever, characterized by an elevation of body temperature above the normal range of 36.5-37.5°C due to an increase in the temperature regulatory set-point</p>
                        <h5>Types of Pyrexia According to Temperature Variation</h5>
                        <p><strong>Continuous/Constant:</strong> Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than 1°C in 24 hours, e.g. in lobar pneumonia, typhoid, urinary tract infection or brucellosis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Intermittent:</strong> The temperature elevation is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal, e.g. in malaria, or septicemia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Remittent:</strong> Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1°C in 24 hours, e.g., infective endocarditis</p>
                        <h5>Types of Pyrexia According to Termination</h5>
                        <p><strong>Fall by Lysis:</strong> The elevated temperature gradually falls (3-5 days). It is accompanied by the patient's improvement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fall by Crisis:</strong> The elevated temperature falls to normal within 24 hours or less (sharp fall) usually accompanied by patient's improvement</p>
                        <p><strong>Pseudo - crisis:</strong> The fall is usually accompanied by improvement of patient's condition and then the temperature rises again after a short period.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hyperpyrexia:</strong> Is fever with an extreme elevation of body temperature greater than or equal to 41.5°C. Such a high temperature is considered a medical emergency as it may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to significant side effects.</p>

                        <h3>PULSE</h3>
                        <p>Pulse assessment is the measurement of pressure pulsation created when the heart contracts and ejects blood into the aorta creating a wave of expansion and recoil in the arteries.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It can be felt by palpation on a point where an artery crosses a bone close to the surface</li>
                            <li>Pulse assessment provides clinical data regarding the heart's pumping action and the adequacy of peripheral artery blood flow</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Pulse Points</h4>

                            <li><strong>Temporal:</strong> Over temporal bone, superior and lateral to the eye. It is accessible and used routinely in infants and when the radial is inaccessible</li>
                            <li><strong>Carotid:</strong> Bilateral, under the lower jaw in neck along medial edge of sternocleidomastoid muscle. It is accessible and used routinely in infants and during shock or cardiac arrest when other peripheral pulses are too weak to palpate. It is also used to access cranial circulation</li>
                            <li><strong>Apical:</strong> Left mid - clavicular line of fourth to fifth intercostal space. Used to auscultate heart sounds and assess apical radial deficit. Also used to obtain pulse in neonates</li>
                            <li><strong>Brachial:</strong> Inner aspect between groove of biceps and triceps muscles at antecubital fossa. Used in cardiac arrest in infants. It is also used to assess lower arm circulation and to auscultate blood pressure</li>
                            <li><strong>Radial:</strong> Inner aspect of fore arm on thumb side of wrist. It is accessible and is routinely used to assess peripheral pulse in adults</li>
                            <li><strong>Ulnar:</strong> Outer aspect of fore arm on finger side of wrist. Used to assess circulation to ulnar side of hand and to perform the Allen's test (used to test blood supply to the hand, specifically, the patency of the radial and ulnar arteries. It is performed prior to radial arterial blood sampling or cannulation).</li>
                            <li><strong>Femoral:</strong> In the groin below inguinal ligament (mid point between symphysis pubis and anterosuperior iliac spine). Used to assess circulation to legs and during cardiac arrest</li>
                            <li><strong>Popliteal:</strong> Behind knee at the center of popliteal fossa. Used to assess circulation to the legs and to auscultate leg pressure</li>
                            <li><strong>Posterior Tibial:</strong> Inner aspect of the ankle between the Achilles tendon and tibia (below medial malleolus). Used to assess circulation to the feet</li>
                            <li><strong>Dorsalis Pedis:</strong> Over instep, midpoint between the extension tendons of great and second toe. Used to assess circulation to the feet</li>

                        <h4>Characteristics of Normal and Abnormal Breathing Sounds</h4>
                        <p><strong>Eupnoea:</strong> Easy respirations with normal rate of breaths per minute that are age specific</p>
                        <p><strong>Bradypnea:</strong> Respiratory rate of 10 or fewer breaths/minute as per age</p>
                        <p><strong>Tachypnea:</strong> Respiratory rates greater than normal range that are age specific</p>
                        <p><strong>Apnea:</strong> It is the suspension of external breathing. During apnea there is no movement of the muscles of respiration and the volume of the lungs initially remains unchanged. Depending on the patency of the airways there may or may not be a flow of gas between the lungs and the environment; gas exchange within the lungs and cellular respiration is not affected.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hyperventilation:</strong> Characterized by deep, rapid respirations. May lead to alkalosis from loss of carbon monoxide. Associated with exercises</p>
                        <p><strong>Hypoventilation:</strong> Characterized by shallow ventilations. May lead to retention of carbon monoxide resulting to respiratory acidosis</p>
                        <p><strong>Kussmaul's breathing:</strong> Increased depth and rate of respiration associated with diabetic ketoacidosis as a compensatory mechanism to eliminate excess CO2</p>
                        <p><strong>Cheyne - Stroke breathing:</strong> An abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing after 10 seconds. It is associated with head injury</p>
                        <p><strong>Costal (Thoracic) Breathing:</strong> Occurs when the external intercostal muscles and the accessory muscles are used to move the chest upward and outward</p>
                        <p><strong>Diaphragmatic (abdominal) Breathing:</strong> Occurs when the diaphragm contracts and relaxes as observed by movement of the abdomen</p>
                        <p><strong>Dyspnea:</strong> Difficulty in breathing evidenced by labored or forced respirations through the use of accessory muscles in the chest and neck to breath. This clients are acutely aware of their respirations and complain of shortness of breath</p>

                            <li>A sensor is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, part of the body that is relatively translucent and has good arterial pulsed blood flow, usually fingertip, toe, earlobe, or in the case of an infant, across a foot.</li>
                            <li>A pulse oximeter shines light of two different wavelengths, red and infrared through the patient to a photo detector.</li>
                            <li>The ratio of red to infrared light that that passes through the measurement site and is received by the oximeter's detector depends on the percentage of the oxygenated versus the deoxygenated hemoglobin through which light passes</li>

                            <li>Increased hospital bill</li>
                            <li>Not satisfied with the services being offered</li>
                            <li>If this happens, the patient should sign a declaration form. This releases the doctors and other staff from responsibility incase something bad happens</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Psychiatric patients should NEVER be allowed to leave hospital against medical advise since they don't have insight.</p>
