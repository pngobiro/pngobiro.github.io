\section*{Professional Roles of a Nurse}

Care giver - Addresses clients holistic health care needs to promote health and healing process. The role include feeding, bathing and administering medications

Advocate - Pleads the cause of the patients' rights by protecting the client's human and legal rights and providing assistance in asserting those rights if the need arises. Advocacy empowers the clients to be partners in the therapeutic process rather than passive recipients of care

Teacher - This is an intrinsic part of nursing, where the nurse views each interaction with a client as a learning opportunity (both client and nurse can learn). Teaching can be formal, informal, intentional or incidental. Here the nurse provides information, seeks to empower clients for self care, encourages compliance with prescribed medications and promotes healthy lifestyle

Change Agent: The nurse is proactive (takes initiative to make things happen) rather than reactive (responding to things after they happen). Change should be planned carefully and implemented in a deliberate way to facilitate the client's progress

Team Member: A vital role. The nurse works in collaboration with other healthcare providers. He/she should use effective interpersonal skills and promotes continuity of care.

Counselor - Assists clients with problem identification and resolution. He/she facilitates client action and does NOT tell the patient what to do but assists them in decision making

Case Manager - Tracks the client's progress through the health care system. Coordinate care to ensure continuity

Rehabilitation - Ensures clients return to a maximal state of functioning. When a person experiences alteration in health, the nurse's role is to promote client adaptation and coping.

\section*{Nurse - Client Relationship}

This is a one - to - one interactive process between client and nurse directed at improving the client's health status or assisting in problem solving. The primary goal is the client's achievement of therapeutic outcomes.

Characteristics of the therapeutic relationships Warmth - This is exhibiting positive behavior towards the client. Expressed by respect, genuine interest and caring
${ }^{-}$Hope - This is anticipating the future by helping clients look realistically at their potential. Hope should not be confused with false reassurance. "Hope is the energy source that allows individuals to plan, act and achieve" (Forbes).

Rapport - Is a bond or connection between two people that is based on mutual trust. To establish this, the nurse has to implement behavior that promote trust. The nurse's actions should show that the client is considered important

Trust - It must be present for help to be given and received. The major activities that facilitate development of trust are consistency, respect and honesty.

Empathy - A key element that refers to understanding the other person's perception of the situation. By perceiving the client's understanding of their own needs, the nurse is able to assist clients in determining what will work best.

Acceptance - This is accepting and working with clients even those who sometimes exhibit some undesirable behavior. It means caring for individual whose value system may differ greatly from that of the nurse and not expressing shock or surprise at the patient's behavior.

Compassion - is caring about what happens to the other person. Kindness and genuine concern are expressed through compassionate acts

Active Listening - Listening that focuses on the feelings of the individual who is speaking. The listener is cognizant of three elements of communication: verbal, Para verbal (the way in which a person speaks, including voice tone, pitch and inflection) and nonverbal communication.

Self - Awareness - Being aware of ones feelings. Allows the nurse to remain objective i.e. separate enough to distinguish one's own feelings and needs from those of the patient

Humor - Helps break the ice, decreases fear and establishes trust. Note that it is defined to a great deal by one's cultural background hence the need to be very sensitive to the client's interpretation and use of humor. Is a powerful coping tool as it helps individuals relieve stress and express anger in a socially acceptable way.

Nonjudgmental Approach - Acting without biases, preconception, or stereotypes. The nurse does not judge the client or tell them what to do, they accept them as they are.

Flexibility - The nurse should be ready for unexpected - knowing that every day is filled with unplanned events and situations. Staying calm during a crisis is a characteristic of a flexible nurse.

Risk - Taking - Is a behavior that leads to innovative problem solving. To be risk takers, the nurses need to try something new, step out of the ordinary and not to be bound by tradition or fear.

\section*{Personal Grooming}

Note: Every patient has a mental picture of how their nurse should be. The nurses appearance provides security and hope to a patient.
- The uniform should neither be too tight or too loose to hinder free movement during an emergency
- The dress or skirt should be below the knee to give to give allowance when bending
-Should not be made of light (see-through) material
-Should be kept clean to prevent cross - infection and well pressed

\section*{HISTORY OF NURSING}

In most ancient civilizations, women were responsible nurturing, nourishing and providing care to children and ill family members. Nursing was a community service that preserved and protected the family.

In many cultures, illness was believed to be directly related to religious believes, mythical magic and evil spirits that took control of the body. Medicine men, healers exorcised these evil spirits from the sick using incarnations.
- Under the influence of Christianity, educated and wealthy women dedicated themselves to caring for the sick.

During renaissance (AD1400-1550), interests in philosophy, science and art emerged.
Universities were constructed throughout Europe, but even though medicine moved into the university setting, no formal nursing schools were founded. This era has been described as the darkest age in nursing because there was little to no organization, education or social standing left in nursing
- War in the $19{ }^{\text {th }}$ century ushered in an age of modern warfare characterized by an escalation in the rates of crippling injuries, loss of limbs and mortality. This lead to an increased demand for trained military nurses

\section*{Crimean War (1854-1856)}
${ }^{-}$It is important in the nursing history because of the role played Florence Nightingale (18201910)

In 1854 as the Crimean war began, she prepared and led a group of 38 nurses to British military hospital in Turkey to care for the injured soldiers. She found the hospital so crowded with patients on the floor with bloody uniforms.

She therefore established hospital sanitary conditions where units were cleaned and clothing washed regularly.
- The soldiers received nursing care both day and night
Nightingale reforms reduced mortality rate of soldiers from $42.7 \%$ to $2.2 \%$ in 6 months.

\section*{World War I}
${ }^{-}$In the 1920s, hospitals and nursing schools began to expand. However, more and more male hospital administrations and physicians were governed with female student population
-This paternalism slowed nursing progress towards professionalism for decades
- By mid 1990, more women were going to college even though only limited numbers of nursing programs were available in the university

World War II (1939-1945)
${ }^{-}$It had enormous effect on nursing. Qualified nurses were in demand. Training of nurses became associated with classroom and organized curriculum.
- After the war, a small number of nurse officers entered undergraduate and graduate nursing programs
${ }^{-}$In late 1940s, nursing as a profession sought to meet the need of society and to organize the profession to meet those needs

\section*{National History of Nursing}

In older days, herbal doctors were able to treat ailments such as colds, headache, abdominal and back aches. The patients were taken care of by their families during the treatment period.
- They were also able to perform minor surgeries such as circumcision where wounds were dressed and special appliances believed to have healing power

\section*{The communities practiced isolation of infected patients such as chicken pox and leprosy}

\section*{Pregnant mothers were taken care of by traditional midwives}

Western medicine in Kenya was introduced with the arrival of missionaries in 1895. Doctors and nurses were brought from Britain and Europe. They trained dressers and assistants on the job. Later they began to conduct basic training in missionary hospital.

1908 - Kikuyu hospital was established
1929 - training of hospital assistants was commenced at MTC depot in Nairobi. They were taught how to diagnose and treat conditions as well as nursing procedures. These were only men. Women were only instructed in the nature of hospitals and midwifery
1948 - A need for more organized nursing training was felt
1949 - A nurses, midwives and visitors council was formed by an ordinance

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING TRENDS IN NURSING}

Rise in patient's acuity - This leads to higher level skills, knowledge and specialization of nurses

Shift to community based care - Patients receive care for chronic conditions at home and community clinics provide PHC for many clients

Care on outpatient basis - This has called for more nurses to care for those patients

Technology - Advanced technology requires nurses to learn how to operate sophisticated equipment to manage conditions in hospital and to make accurate diagnosis and treat and also to teach family members and fellow nurses how to use such equipment

Changes in Nursing Education - Emphasis on learning more than clinical services and availability of career ladder programs

Autonomy - Nurses are now more assertive and independent. They are able to make diagnoses and intervene as needed

- As a nurse one is liable to the national laws as well as professional ethics related to nursing practice
The following are put into consideration:
- Documentation: This is very important in health care. There is need to document everything, concisely, legibly, and accurately. Incase of a court order, documentation is of great help.

Student Nurses: They must be supervised adequately. A student can put the wellbeing and standard of care of patients at risk.

Confidentiality and Privacy: It is against the patients' rights to disclose any information about them without their consent. A nurse has a legal obligation to maintain patients’ confidentiality

Assault and Battery: Any sort of assault, verbal, physical, mental are all considered serious . There are times in which nurses may initiate procedures that in turn may be seen as offensive to the patient. It is essential to remain professional and maintain honor and dignity at all times

Patients’ Advocate: The nurse has a legal obligation to act as patients' advocate incase of an emergency. The nurse is to act as the liaison between the patient and other health care providers like the physician.

Administering Medication: Nurses are responsible for administering the correct doses and medications to patients. Incase of wrong dosages or drug, s/she may face legal malpractice suits. It's the nurse's responsibility to get history about any drug allergies and monitor any reactions or side effects, then report

Nurse Practice Act: Each state has nurse practice act. The guidelines and laws outlined in the act pertain to nurses who are licensed in that particular state or country. Each nurse has a limitation on what s/he is allowed and trained to do:
- S/he must follow the chain of command especially in the care of patients
- If s/he doesn't have the authority or knowledge to prescribe, analyze laboratory report or advise patient on treatment, s/he may not legally do so
- Any wrong information or practice is punishable by law and the patients may file a suit against him or her and the health agency or hospital he/ she works for

\section*{Offences}
- These can result to disciplinary measure if they occur. They include:
1. Negligence

This is failure to provide the expected care to a patient or client in the field you were trained in. This can occur when an act is done in a manner so rash, or omitted to be done as to endanger human life.

\section*{2. Impropriety:}

As a nurse the profession binds you to conduct yourself professionally while on duty or off duty. If you fight in a bar or anywhere or conduct yourself unprofessionally you will have discredited or shamed the nursing profession and will, therefore, be liable to be charged with impropriety.

\section*{3. Misconduct:}

This is behaving in unacceptable manner. It includes stealing drugs or hospital property, forgery or fraud, coming on duty while drunk, fighting while on duty or use of abusive language.

\section*{4. Malpractice:}

Consists of wrongful act on the part of the medical personnel that results to an injury or harm on the patient, intentionally or negligently. Remember you are a trained nurse. Can be provision of substandard care to patients and performance of procedures that are out of your scope of practice.

\section*{PATIENT'S BILL OF RIGHTS}
- The Constitution of Kenya, 2010 guarantees a right to health services.
- Under Article 43, it provided that every person has the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to health care services,, including reproductive health care; and that a person shall not be denied emergency medical treatment

Secondly, Kenya having ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, it is obligated under Article 16 of the same to provide every individual the right to enjoy the best attainable state of physical and mental health, and to ensure that people receive attention when they are sick.

The right to life (Art. 26), equality and freedom from discrimination (Art. 27),human dignity (Art.28), and freedom and security of the person (Art.29) are also rights of patients protected under the constitution
1. Duty of Care

The hospital authority is liable in contract for the negligent conduct of its employees, whilst the medical personnel may be also liable in their individual capacities.

\section*{2. Informed Consent}
${ }^{-}$A patient is said to have given his or her informed consent where he/she: knows, appreciates and understands the nature or extent of the harm or risk involved, and agrees to the harm or to assume the risk, and does so in full or comprehensively (agrees to the entire procedure, including the consequences).
- Failure to obtain the informed consent, a medical personnel risks being liable for a suit in assault, or invasion of privacy.

In case of minors, it is important to fully inform them according to their level of understanding, or to seek consent from those who are in-charge of them (parents or guardians).
- Regarding the mentally ill, under the Mental Health Act (Cap 248) provision is made for reception of voluntary and involuntary patients into mental hospitals. For the involuntary, it is on application by the spouse, or relative, or any other person in writing.
${ }^{-}$In emergency cases, treatment may be provided without consent, if the emergency is real, the patient is unable to communicate, and , it is not against his will, and the treatment is in his best interest (the defense of necessity).
3. The patient has the right to keep personal property unless this would infringe upon the rights of others or would be medically contraindicated

\section*{4. Confidentiality}
- Unjustified disclosure of personal details/ information about patients may lead to an action for breach of confidentiality or where the patient's reputation is damaged, a defamatory suit.
-There are exceptions to the rule, namely: where a court so orders; the law allows it; moral or legal obligation; consent; defense in a disciplinary action.
- For instance, Section 26 of the Sexual Offences Act, 2006, permits for disclosure of HIV/AIDS status of an accused person who has been charged with deliberate transmission of the HIV. Note: Refusal to obey a court order may amount to contempt of court.

\section*{NURSES' BILL OF RIGHTS}
- Nurses have many rights. They are entitled to human rights, and the rights of a worker.
- As a worker you have the right to:
- A safe environment
- Adequate working tools and supplies
- Risk allowance
- Professional autonomy
- Opportunities for further education, promotion and career development.

\section*{SCOPE OF NURSING}
- Nurse provide care for three types of clients:
- Individuals
- Families
- Communities

\section*{The four fundamental responsibilities of a nurse are:}
- Health promotion
- Disease Prevention
- Restoring Health
- Care of the dying (Alleviating Suffering)

\section*{1. Promoting Health and Wellness (Health Promotion)}
-Wellness is a state of well-being. It means engaging in attitudes and behavior that enhance the quality of life and maximize personal potential
${ }^{-}$Health promotion is behavior motivated by desire to increase well - being and actualize human potential.
${ }^{-}$It is achieved through:
- Information dissemination
- Health risk appraisal and wellness assessment
- Lifestyle and behavior change
- Environmental control programs
- Topics covered include: Infant - parent attachment; breast feeding; immunizations; safety promotion and injury control; nutrition, dental check - ups, rest and exercise;
- sexuality; peer group influences; self - concept and body image; drug management, foot health; adequate sleep (especially the elderly)
2. Preventing Illness (Disease Prevention)
- The goal here is to prevent illness to maintain optimal health by preventing disease.
- Nursing activities here include:
- Immunizations
- Prenatal and infant care
- Prevention of STIs

Objective of disease prevention include:
- To reduce the risk of illness
- Promote healthy habits
- Maintain individuals optimal functioning
- Levels of prevention are:
- Primary Prevention - education, immunization, nutrition
- Secondary Prevention - Screening and treating of diseases in early stages to limit disability
- Tertiary Prevention - Defect or disability is permanent and irreversible. Interventions are directed at preventing complications and deterioration.

\section*{3. Restoring Health (Curative and Rehabilitative)}
- This focuses on the ill client and extends from early detection of disease through helping the client during recovery period.
${ }^{-}$Includes providing direct care to ill patients e.g. administering medications, baths and specific procedures and treatment, diagnostic and assessment procedures e.g. blood pressure, lab testes; consulting with other health care providers about clients’ problems; teaching client about recovery activities e.g. exercise, rehabilitating clients to their optimal functional level, following physical or mental illness, injury or chemical addiction
4. Care of the dying (Alleviating Suffering)
${ }^{-}$It entails helping clients as much as possible to ensure they are comfortable until death and supporting persons to cope with the death at homes, hospitals and extended care facilities e.g. hospice

\section*{NURSING CARE MODALITIES}

This is the manner in which nursing care is organized and provided. It depends on the philosophy of the organization, nurse staffing and client population.
- These modalities include:
- Case method/Total Patient Care
- Functional Nursing/ Task Allocation
- Team Nursing
- Primary Nursing
- Progressive/ Client Care Nursing

\section*{Case Method/Total Patient Care}

One professional nurse assumes total responsibility of providing complete care for one or more patients (1-6) while she is on duty. This method is used frequently in intensive care units and in teaching nursing students. It was the first type of nursing care delivery system.
- The patient/patients receive holistic and unfragmented care during the nurse's shift
The activities include treatment, medication administration and nursing care planning for the patient/patients

\section*{Advantages}
- Consistency in carrying out the nursing care plan
-Patient needs are quickly met as high number of nurse's hours are spent on the patient
- Relationship based on trust is developed between the nurse and the patient's family
${ }^{-}$Educational needs of the client can be closely monitored
- Workload in the unit can be equally divided among staff
Nurses' accountability is ensured

\section*{Disadvantages}
${ }^{-}$It can be very costly
- Many clients may not require the intensity of care inherent with this type of service
- The method must be modified if non professional health workers are to be used effectively
- Need of more nurses

\section*{Functional Nursing}
${ }^{-}$It is a task-oriented method wherein a particular nursing function is assigned to each staff member.
- The medication nurse, treatment nurse and bedside nurse are all products of this system.
- For efficiency, nursing was essentially divided into tasks, a model that proved very beneficial when staffing was poor.
- The key idea was for nurses to be assigned to tasks, not to patients.

\section*{Advantages}
${ }^{-}$A very efficient way to deliver care.
- Could accomplish a lot of tasks in a small amount of time
-Staff members do only what they are capable of doing
${ }^{-}$Least costly as fewer nurses are required
${ }^{-}$It is easy to organize

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Care of patients become fragmented and depersonalized
- Patients do not have one identifiable nurse
- Very narrow scope of practice for nurses
- Leads to patient and nurse dissatisfaction
- Nurses are accountable for the tasks rather than the client
-There is risk for diminishing continuity of care
-Monotony hence boredom

\section*{Team Nursing}
- The nursing staff in a ward is divided into teams, each team taking responsibility for the total care of a subgroup of the patients.
${ }^{-}$It was developed in the 1950's in order to somewhat ameliorate the fragmentation that was inherent in the functional model. The goal of team nursing is for a team to work democratically.
${ }^{-}$It has the team leader who is accountable for all the care of the patients.
The team member possessing the skill needed by the individual patient is assigned to that patient.

\section*{Advantages}
- Each member's capabilities are maximized so job satisfaction should be high
Patients have one nurse (the Team Leader) with immediate access to other health care providers
-Work load is shared and balanced
- Each team member has a chance to learn from others
${ }^{-}$Division of work enables members to gain leadership skills
- Interests in clients' well being care shared by several people, reliability of decisions is increased

\section*{Disadvantages}
${ }^{-}$Requires a team spirit and commitment to succeed
${ }^{-}$RN may be the Team Leader one day and a team member the next, thus continuity of patient care may suffer
${ }^{-}$Care is still fragmented with only 8 or 12 hour accountability
${ }^{-}$All personnel must be client - centered, which may not be the case
-There is less individual responsibility and independence regarding nursing actions

\section*{Primary Nursing}

This is a patient-centered nursing system.
One nurse (the primary nurse) assumes individual responsibility for a particular patient/patients.
Theoretically this responsibility extends over the entire period the patient requires nursing (from admission/start of treatment to discharge/end of treatment) although in practice there has to be delegation to other nurses (the associate nurses) during periods of absence from the ward.

\section*{Advantages}
- There is continuity of care
${ }^{-}$There is increased accountability, responsibility and independence
Good and trusting relationship is developed between the nurse, patient and relatives
${ }^{-}$Increased satisfaction for patients and nurses
-More professional system: The nurse plans and communicates with all healthcare members.
Nurses are seen as more knowledgeable and responsible.
- Nurses more satisfied because they continue to learn as part of the in-depth care they are required to deliver to their patient

\section*{Disadvantages}

Only confines a nurse's talents to a limited number of patients, so other patients cannot benefit if $\mathrm{s} /$ he is competitive
- Can be intimidating for nurses who are less skilled and knowledgeable
${ }^{-}$The nurse may be isolated from colleagues
${ }^{-}$If the nurse is not competent, the patient will be disadvantaged
-There is little avenue for group planning and sharing ideas concerning patient's care

\section*{Progressive Client Care Nursing}
- Patient care is provided in accordance to the unit e.g. ICU for critically ill, post intensive care unit, regular care unit
- The client is evaluated and managed based on the intensity of care needed
Advantages
- Efficient use of personnel and equipment
- The clients are in the best place to receive the care they require
- Clients move towards independence and is fostered where indicated

\section*{Disadvantages}
- There may be discomfort to patients who are moved too often
- Continuity of care is not adequate even though possible
- Long - term nurse client relationships are difficult to manage

FUNDAMENTALS OF NURSING

\section*{INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL (IPC)}

\section*{OBJECTIVES}

By the end of this section, the student should be able to:
State an overview of infectious diseases
Describe the disease transmission cycle and those at risk of infection
-List some standard precautions
- List common antiseptics, disinfectants and aseptic techniques
- Describe the use and disposal of needles and other sharps
${ }^{-}$Describe the processing of instruments and other items
- Describe decontamination and sterilization
- Describe the storage of sterile equipment
${ }^{-}$Describe housekeeping and waste disposal

\section*{Definitions}

IPC is the utilization of procedures and techniques in the surveillance investigation and compilation of statistical data in order to minimize the spread of infection.

It is also defined as the collective process of efforts made by the health care providers and clients to minimize the risk of infection or prevent the transmission of infectious agents.

Infection control practices are aimed at controlling or eliminating the sources of infection.
Nurses are responsible for protecting themselves and clients by using infection control practices
Pathogens: Micro - organisms that cause diseases in humans
Pathogenicity: The ability of a micro - organism to produce disease.
Virulence : The degree of pathogenicity of an infectious micro - organism.
Colonization: The multiplication of micro organism on or within a host that does not result in cellular injury

Infection: Invasion and multiplication of micro organisms in body tissue that results in cellular injury. These micro - organisms are called infectious agents.
Communicable Agents: Infectious agents that are capable of being transmitted to a client by direct or indirect contact, through a vehicle (vector) or airborne route.
Communicable Diseases: Diseases produces by these agents

Flora: Micro - organisms on the human body. They are of two types - Resident Flora: Micro organisms that are always present, usually without altering patient's health, they can't be removed with only hand washing with soap, but friction does; Transient flora: They are episodic, attaching to the skin for a brief period of time but do not continually live there, acquired through direct contact with organism or environmental surfaces, easily removed on hand washing

\section*{The Disease Transmission Cycle}

All micro-organisms can cause infection or disease. But this happens when there is an interaction between the agent, host and environment which can occur when:
${ }^{-}$The normal flora are introduced into an area of the body in which they are not normally found
- Pathogens are introduced into the body
- Micro-organisms are introduced into the body of a person who is immuno-compromised and thus susceptible to infections
${ }^{-}$Agent: An entity that is capable of causing disease.
- Biological Agents: Living organisms that invade the host e.g. bacteria, virus, fungi, protozoa and rickettsia
- Chemical Agents: Substances that interact with the body e.g. pesticides, food additives, medications and industrial chemicals
- Physical Agents: Factors in the environment that are capable of causing disease e.g. heat, noise and radiation
${ }^{-}$Host: Simple or complex organism that can be affected by an agent
- Susceptible Host: A person who lacks resistance to an agent and is thus vulnerable to disease
- Compromised Host: A person whose normal defense mechanisms have been impaired and is therefore susceptible to infection
Environment: Includes any other thing other than the host and agent. Environmental factors affecting the chain of infection include food, water, plants, animals, housing conditions, noise etc.

Reservoirs: Natural habitat of a micro organism where it grows and multiplies Portal of exit: Route of exit from a reservoir or source
Mode of transmission: Channels through which micro - organisms are transferred to susceptible individual
Vector: Invertebrates that transmit pathogens e.g. mosquitoes, snails, tsetse flies
Portal of entry: Point at which micro organisms enter the host

\section*{MODES OF TRANSMISSION \\ Direct Modes of Transmission}

Contact Transmission: The most important and frequent mode of transmission. It involves direct physical transfer of an agent from an infected to a host through direct contact with a contaminated object or contact with contaminated secretions.
- Airborne Transmission: Occurs when a susceptible host contacts droplet nuclei or dust particles that are suspended in the air

\section*{Indirect modes of Transmission}
-Vehicle Transmission: Occurs when an agent is transferred to a susceptible host by inanimate objects such as water and food.
- Vector - Borne Transmission: Occurs when an agent is transferred to a susceptible host by animate means such as mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, lice.

Note: The WHO's guidelines demand that you should treat all patients as potentially infectious.
In the health care setting infection can be transmitted:
- When the health care worker's skin is pierced or cut by contaminated needles or other sharp instruments
-When the health care worker's broken skin (cuts, scratches, rashes, chapped skin, fungal infections) comes into contact with the patient's blood or other body fluids
- When the patient's blood or other body fluids are splashed on the healthcare worker's mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth)

According to WHO guidelines, a health care provider should:
Observe and maintain good personal hygiene and wear appropriate attire.
${ }^{-}$Be vaccinated against vaccine preventable conditions, especially if you are working in high risk areas.
If you work in vulnerable areas, for example areas where you handle cooked food, you should be periodically screened for certain diseases, such as typhoid.
${ }^{-}$If you are suffering from infectious conditions and you are working with susceptible patients, for example, in an operating room, special care baby unit, or the ICU burns unit, you should be redenloved until vou are cleared of the infection

Adherence to appropriate infection prevention practices breaks the cycle of spreading infections at the mode of transmission stage. This will:
- Prevent post procedure infections
${ }^{-}$Result in high quality, safe services
- Prevent infections in service providers and supportive staff
- Protect the community from infections that originate in health care facilities
${ }^{-}$Prevent the spread of micro-organisms that are resistant to antibiotics
${ }^{-}$Lower the cost of health care services

\section*{Standard Safety Precautions}

They are a set of clinical practice recommendations designed to help minimize the risk of exposure to infectious materials, such as blood and other body fluids by both patients and staff. They help break the disease transmission cycle at the mode of transmission step.
- They are also referred to as principles of medical asepsis
A standard procedure is a procedure that should be followed routinely at all times. It should apply to every patient regardless of their presumed infection status. This is because you will not be able to tell who is infected with viruses such as HIV or hepatitis
- These precautions are:
- Hand washing
- Gloving
- Proper decontamination and sterilization
- Proper use of personal protective equipment or devices
- Proper handling and disposal of waste
- Labeling of all biohazards
- Environmental hygiene

\section*{HAND WASHING}
-Washing your hands before and after contact with each patient is the single most effective method of preventing/decreasing transfer of micro-organisms between you and the patients within a health facility
- Other appropriate times to was hands include:
"Immediately after arriving at work
"After touching accidentally any instrument or object that might be contaminated with blood or other body fluids
- After touching mucous membranes, e.g. eyes, nose, mouth
- Before any surgical procedure
- Before and after un-gloving since hands can be contaminated if gloves contain invisible holes or tears
- Before and after using the toilet or latrine
- Before and after eating
- Before leaving work at the end of the day
- The three elements that are essential for effective hand washing are: Soap; Running water and Friction

\section*{Types of hand washing}
a) Routine hand washing using plain soap and running water
- Removes transient micro-organisms and soil, blood or other organic material from the hands.
- This method is appropriate in most situations and the hands should be washed as frequently as possible
- Removes 80-90\% of micro - organisms

\section*{b) Hand washing with antiseptic and running water}
${ }^{-}$In this method, transient micro-organisms and soil are removed.
${ }^{-}$It kills or inhibits the growth of resident microorganisms. Moreover, it may reduce the risk of infections in high risk situations, such as:
"When there is heavy microbial contamination
"Before performing invasive procedures such as vein punctures and other aseptic procedures
"Before contact with patients who have immune defects, for example, patients with burns, leukemia etc.

\section*{c) Alcohol hand rub}
${ }^{-}$Alcohol hand rub kills or inhibits the growth of most transient and resident micro-organisms but does not remove all micro-organisms or soil.
${ }^{-}$It can be used when hand washing with soap and running water is not possible as long as hands are not visibly soiled with dirt, blood or other organic material.
d) Surgical hand scrub
-Scrubbing with antiseptic before beginning surgical procedures will help prevent the growth of micro-organisms for a period of time.
${ }^{-}$It will also reduce the risk of infections to the patient if the gloves are damaged.

Applicable before surgical or sterile procedure

\section*{Procedure of Routine Hand Washing}
- Remove wrist watch and or any ornaments on your hands
-Shorten the sleeves
- Put on the water tap
-Wet the hands below the elbow with water
${ }^{-}$Lather the hands with soap and rub as below for 15-30 seconds:
"Place your right palm on the back of the left hand and rub together and vice versa
${ }^{{ }^{-}}$Rub palm to palm with fingers interlaced
- Rub the back of fingers then rub the thumb by grasping and rotating in the palm of the opposite hand
- Rub under the nails
- Rinse under running water
- Close the water using your elbow or disposable towel
${ }^{-}$Air dry
Note:
- Use of towels for drying is discouraged especially if they are reusable or shared because they get contaminated
" Avoid splashing water

\section*{PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT}
-These are physical barriers used to prevent transmission of infection to the patient or from the patient to the persons attending them.

They include:
"Gloves
"Gowns/Aprons
"Surgical masks
"Protective eye wear.

\section*{Gowns and Aprons}
- These should be made of waterproof material and worn full size to give maximum protection.
- They should be used when splashing of blood or other body fluids or when any other potentially infectious materials are anticipated, for example during:
Surgical operations
"While conducting deliveries
${ }^{-}$During intubations and suctioning procedures
${ }^{\text {E }}$ Any other procedure/activities where splashing is anticipated

\section*{Gloves}
- Provide a barrier against potentially infectious micro-organisms in blood, other body fluids, and medical waste, thus lowering the risk of transmitting infections to both health care workers and patients.
- They also protect against hazardous chemical waste.
- You should wear gloves whenever you may come into contact with patient's blood and other body fluids, for example, while:
"Providing clinical services
-Derformino housekepnino activities
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Handling or cleaning used instruments and other items
- Use a new pair of gloves for each patient! Disposable gloves are used once and then thrown away
- Disposable gloves are preferable to renewable gloves because it is difficult to properly process gloves. Disposable gloves should never be processed or reused.

Types of gloves
Sterile Surgical Gloves or High Level Disinfected Surgical Gloves
These should be worn during all procedures in which your main aim is to avoid introduction of pathogens into the patient, for example during:
"Surgical procedures
"Insertion of implants
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Pelvic examination of women in labor
${ }^{-}$Disposable surgical gloves are recommended for use.

\section*{Single use examination gloves}

Single use means discard gloves after use.
-These should be worn for all procedures in which you will be in contact with intact mucous membranes.
- Also where the primary purpose of wearing gloves is to reduce the risk of you being exposed to blood or other body fluids for example:
"When drawing blood
"When working in the laboratory

\section*{Masks and Eye Shields}
- These provide some protection against airborne pathogens and shield against splashes.
- They should be worn during dental surgery, when conducting deliveries and endoscopies or in any other situations where splashing or spattering is anticipated.

\section*{Headgear and Boots}
- Caps are worn full length to cover the head.
${ }^{-}$Boots and shoe covers should be waterproof and should be cleaned frequently. These should be used in operative procedures.

\section*{Appropriate and Adequate Instruments Processing}

\section*{ANTISEPTICS AND DISINFECTANTS}
- An antiseptic is a chemical agent used on the skin and mucous membrane to remove or kill micro-organisms without causing damage or irritation to the skin and mucous membranes.
- May also prevent the growth and development of micro-organisms.

They are not meant to be used on inanimate objects, such as instruments and surfaces.
Can be used for surgical hand scrub, skin preparation as well as cervical and vaginal preparation before a clinical procedure.

Disinfectants are chemical agents used to kill micro-organisms on inanimate objects, such as instruments and surfaces.
They are not meant to be used on the skin or mucous membranes
- There are two types of disinfectants:
1. High Level Disinfectants
${ }^{-}$High level disinfectants kill bacteria, viruses, fungi and some bacterial endospores.
Some high level disinfectants can be used to sterilize equipment and if given sufficient time to act, they are able to destroy bacterial endospores that cause diseases such as tetanus and gas gangrene. Bacterial endospores are difficult to kill because of their protective casing or coating.
They are also used for processing instruments and other items.

\section*{2. Low Level Disinfectants}
${ }^{-}$Low level disinfectants kill most bacteria and some viruses and fungi but do not kill tuberculosis causing micro-organisms and bacterial endospores.
${ }^{-}$They are used for cleaning surfaces such as floors and countertops.
-They should not be used for processing instruments and other items.

\section*{Common Chemical used as Antiseptics and Disinfectants}
1. ALCOHOL (60-90\% ETHYL OR ISOPROPYL)
- Commonly called methylated spirit
- Effective against a broad range of microorganisms.
Advantages
- Kills micro-organisms most rapidly.
- Most effective in reducing micro-organisms.
- Effectiveness is only moderately reduced by blood or other organic material.
${ }^{-}$It is less expensive.

\section*{Disadvantages}
${ }^{-}$Has a drying effect on skin.
${ }^{-}$Cannot be used on mucous membranes.

\section*{Note}
- Cannot be used when skin is dirty, wash the area before applying.
- Must dry skin completely to be effective.
- The $60-70 \%$ strength is most effective because alcohol must be diluted for optimal killing of micro organisms,
Contra - indicated low birth weight babies as it evaporates with heat and can cause hypothermia

\section*{2. CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE WITH CETRIMIDE}
- Commonly called Savlon
- Effective against a broad range of microorganisms, but has a minimal effect on tuberculosis and fungi.

\section*{Advantages}
- Has a good persistent effect; remains effective for at least 6 hours after being applied.
${ }^{-}$Effectiveness is not reduced by blood or other organic material.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- On rare occasions products containing chlorhexidine have been reported to cause irritation, especially when used in the genital area.
${ }^{-}$Effectiveness can be reduced by hard water, hand creams and natural soaps.
Note:
- Recommended antiseptic for surgical hand scrub and skin preparation.
- However preparations without cetrimide are preferred
- Can be used in the following dilution
a) 100 mls of savlon into $70 \%$ of alcohol (1 litre) used in pre - operation preparation of skin or emergency disinfection of clean instruments (2min)
b) 10 mls savlon in 1 litre of water used for wound disinfection of wounds and clean instruments where they are immersed for 30 minutes; rinsing hands and storage of thermometer

\section*{3. CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE}
- Commonly called Hibitane/Hibiclens/Hibiscrub
${ }^{-}$Almost similar features to savlon. Ideal for surgical scrub and skin preparations though preferred to savlon
Note:
While products containing chlorhexidine are ideal for surgical hand scrub and skin preparation in general, they may not be the best antiseptics to use in the genital area, vagina and cervix because of the small potential for irritating these areas. Iodophors are a better choice for use in these areas. If iodophor is not available, a product containing chlorhoxidine is the best alternative.

\section*{4. IODOPHORS (SOLUTIONS SUCH AS POVIDONE IODINE E. G. BETADINE)}
- These contain Iodine in a complex form, making them relatively non irritating and non toxic.
${ }^{-}$Effective against a broad range of microorganisms.
Advantages
${ }^{-}$Less irritating to the skin than iodine.
- Can be used on mucous membranes.

\section*{Disadvantages}
${ }^{-}$Effectiveness is moderately reduced by blood or other organic material.

\section*{Note:}
- Recommended antiseptic for surgical hand scrub and client preparation.
- Best antiseptic for use in the genitalia area, vagina and cervix.
${ }^{-}$Effective 1-2 minutes after application. For optimal effectiveness, wait several minutes after application.
- Most preparations should be used at full strength.
- Distinctly different from iodine. Iodophors are sudsy (resemble lather); pure iodine is not.

\section*{5. IODINE, INCLUDING TINCTURE OF IODINE (IODINE AND ALCOHOL)}
${ }^{-}$Effective against a broad range of microorganisms.
Advantages
${ }^{-}$Fast acting
Disadvantages
${ }^{-}$Can cause skin irritation.
${ }^{-}$Effectiveness is markedly reduced by blood or other organic material.

\section*{Note:}
- Too irritating for routine use in surgical hand scrub or for use on mucous membranes.
${ }^{-}$Because of the potential to cause skin irritation, when used for preparation, iodine must be allowed to dry and then remove from the skin with alcohol.

\section*{6. HEXACHLOROPHENE (PHISOHEX)}
${ }^{-}$Poor effectiveness against most micro-organisms.

\section*{Advantages}
- Has a good, persistent effect with repeated use which remains effective for at least six hours after being applied.

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Potentially toxic to the nervous system.
- Occasional use is not effective in reducing the number of micro-organisms on the hands.

If use of hexachlorophene is discontinued after long-term use, rebound increase of growth bacteria will occur (bacterial whose growth was being inhibited by its use will grow and multiply causing large scale contamination).

\section*{Note:}
- Contraindicated for routine use on irritated or broken skin or mucous membranes.
Not recommended for use in surgical hand scrub or skin preparation due to its limited capacity to kill micro-organisms.

\section*{7. PARA-CHLORO-META-XYLENOL (PCMX, CHLOROXYLENOL, e.g. DETTOL)}
${ }^{-}$Fairly effective against most micro-organisms.

\section*{Advantages}
- Has a persistent effect over several hours.
- Activity is only minimally reduced by blood or other organic material.

\section*{Disadvantages}
${ }^{-}$Less effective than chlorlexidine and iodophors.
- Not recommended for routine use

\section*{8. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (H202)}
${ }^{-}$Diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions
- Used in pre- operative preparation of skin and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections
- When undiluted, it is used for disinfecting and cleaning of ulcerations, cuts and infected wound

\section*{9. GENTAVIOLET (GV)}
${ }^{-}$It is an antiseptic, a dye used in oral and vaginal thrush
${ }^{-}$It is also used for diagnostic procedures due to its color

\section*{10. SODIUM PERBORATE MONOHYDRATE NaBO3.H20 (MILTON)}
${ }^{-}$Use for sterilizing utensils for baby feeding in NBU

\section*{11. FORMALDEHYDE}
${ }^{-}$Used to treat items that are bulky
- Also used for fumigation and as a preservative

\section*{Common High Level Disinfectants}

\section*{1. CHLORINE}
- Effective against a broad range of microorganisms including tubercle bacilli. Does not kill all bacterial endospores.
Advantages
- Fast acting.
${ }^{-}$Least expensive disinfectant

\section*{Disadvantages}
${ }^{-}$Can be corrosive to metals when in prolonged contact (more than 20 minutes).
- Can be irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract.

\section*{Note:}

Available in liquid (sodium hypochlorite - jik), powder (calcium hypochlorite) and tablet (sodium dichloride socyanurate - precept) form.
Can be used for decontamination (by soaking for ten minutes) or HLD (by soaking for 20 minutes). Can be used for instruments and other items (but not for laparascopic equipment).
- Can also be used for disinfection of surfaces.
- Leaves a residue, so instruments and other items must be rinsed thoroughly with boiled water after HLD.
- A new solution should be prepared daily (or sooner, if it becomes heavily contaminated) since potency is lost over time and after exposure to

\section*{2. GLUTARALDEHYDE (CIDEX)}
${ }^{-}$Effective against a broad range of microorganisms including tubercle bacilli. Does not kill all bacterial endospores.
Advantages
${ }^{-}$Fast acting.
- Least expensive disinfectant.

\section*{Disadvantages}

Can be corrosive to metals when in prolonged contact (more than 20 minutes).
Can be irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract.

\section*{Note}
- Used most commonly to process medical equipment such as laparoscopes which cannot be heat sterilized.

Can be used for HLD (by soaking for 20 minutes) and sterilization (by soaking for ten hours) of instruments and other items.
${ }^{-}$Leaves a residue, instruments and other items must be rinsed thoroughly with boiled water after HLD and with sterile water after sterilization.
${ }^{-}$A new solution should be prepared every 14 days (or sooner, if it becomes cloudy).
- Preparations vary, follow the manufacturer's instructions.

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF USING DISINFECTANTS AND ANTISEPTICS}

Choose chemicals that are effective on the suspected or known micro - organism
Choose chemicals that are stable and safe under conditions of use
- Use freshly prepared detergents as much as possible
- Follow manufacturer's directions
-Store chemical agents in compatible clean containers which should always remain covered

\section*{NURSING PRECAUTIONS WHILE USING CHEMICALS}
- Equipment should be well prepared for sterilization
- Fully immerse the equipment into the solution
- Leave the instruments in situ for the recommended time
- The instruments should be removed by use of forceps and cleaned in water or normal saline

\section*{Aseptic Technique}

Asepsis can be defined as "free from sepsis or germ free".
A technique is a method or skill used for a particular task or technical proficiency. Other definitions of technique are: art, artistry, craft, proficiency, skill, touch.
Weller, (1996) defines aseptic technique as: "A method of carrying out sterile procedures so that there is the minimum of risk of introducing infection."

\section*{Preparing the Skin}

Clean the site with soap and water.
- Wipe the skin in a circular motion, beginning in the center of the site then moving outwards.
- Use sterile cotton balls or cotton wool sponges held on sponge forceps.
${ }^{-}$Any of the following antiseptics may be used as listed in the preferred order:
"An iodophor (Betadine); then wait for two minutes and wipe off the excess with sterile dry cotton or gauze
"4\% Chlorhexidine (HIbiclens) wipe off excess with sterile, dry cotton or gauze
- 1-3 \% iodine, followed by 60-90\% alcohol (ethyl or isopropyl) then allow to air dry
- Chlorhexidine with cetrimide (Savlon) wipe off the excess with sterile, dry cotton or gauze

\section*{Preparing the Vagina and Cervix}
- Apply an appropriate antiseptic (iodophor) to the vagina and cervix before passing instruments into the uterus such as IUD insertion, uterine evacuation.
Alcohol based antiseptics should not be used on the vagina, cervix or other mucous membranes because they are damaging to these tissues.

\section*{Maintaining a Sterile Field}

This can be done by:
- Placing sterile towels and/or surgical drapes around the surgical/procedures site.
Placing only sterile items within the sterile field
Opening, dispensing or transferring sterile items without contaminating them
Considering items located below the level of the draped client to be unsterile
Not allowing sterile personnel to reach across unsterile areas and touch unsterile items
- Not allowing unsterile personnel to reach across the sterile field or to touch sterile items

\section*{Maintaining a Safe Environment in the Surgical/Procedure Area}
${ }^{-}$Limit the entry of unauthorized individuals to surgical/procedure areas
Close doors and curtains during all procedures
${ }^{-}$Require that personnel in the surgical area wear clean clothes, a mask, a cap and sturdy footwear
- Enclose surgical procedure area to minimize dust and eliminate insects
- Air-condition the room if feasible
- Disinfect and clean examination/operating tables, instrument trolleys, light handles and any other surfaces that may have been contaminated

\section*{USE AND DISPOSAL OF SHARPS}

Sharps such as needles, scalpels and so on, are to be handled with extreme caution to avoid injuries during use, disposal or reprocessing.
${ }^{-}$Used needles should not be recapped by hand. If necessary use the single hand "scoop" method. With one hand, hold the syringe and use the needle to "scoop up" the cap.
- Used needles should not be bent or broken after use.

\section*{Rules to Observe when using and disposing Sharps}

Dispose of "sharps disposal containers" when they are three quarters full to reduce the chance of injury when disposing of sharps
- Dispose of used sharps immediately after use in designated puncture resistant containers labeled with a biohazard symbol and placed in the area where the items were used, for transport to the incinerator/pit for disposal
-The sharps containers should be located at an arms length
- These containers should not be located in areas open to the public
- Discard used syringes and needles as a unit in the designated puncture resistant container
- Hold reusable syringes, needles or sharps in a puncture resistant leak proof container labeled with a biohazard sign for transport to the reprocessing area
Do not pick up a handful of sharp instruments simultaneously
- Exercise caution when rotating instruments in use
- Position sharp end of instruments away from yourself and others
Do not break, recap or manipulate by hand used needles
- Wear heavy duty/strong utility gloves during decontamination, cleaning and disinfecting instruments

Contact the supervisor immediately if you are injured by sharps

\section*{Management of Injuries from needles and other sharps}
- Wash needle sticks and cuts with soap and water.
- Flush the nose, mouth or skin with water if splashed with blood or body fluid.
${ }^{-}$Irrigate the eyes with water or saline if splashed with body fluid.
- Report to the immediate supervisor
- Ensure initiation of the first dose of Post

Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) as soon as possible. It should be initiated preferably within 2 hours and up to 72 hours post exposure
- Evaluation of exposure wile entail determination of the type of body substance and route and severity of exposure. This will include:
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Baseline HIV and HBV status of the source of exposure
- Baseline HIV and HBV status of the affected health care worker
- Determination of the PEP regimen
- The available antiretroviral regimens are:
- Universal regimen (Combivir) - Zidovudine (ZDV) + Lamivudine (3TC) or TDF + Lamivudine
- Basic Regimen (Combivir)- ZDV + 3TC
- Expanded Regimen (Kaletra) - Basic + Lopinavir/ Ritonavir or Basic + EFV
- This will then be followed by management and follow - up of the health worker, which will entail:
- Counseling and provision of PEP drugs
- Monitor and manage PEP toxicity 2 weeks after starting the regimen
${ }^{-}$HIV testing at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months

Note: Generally the prophylaxis will include:
${ }^{-}$For Hepatitis B: Hepatitis immune globulin and Hepatitis B vaccine can reduce the risk of infection after exposure to blood and other body fluids containing the Hepatitis B virus
${ }^{-}$For HIV: Antiretroviral drugs are used either alone or in combination.
-For Hepatitis C: There is no post exposure prophylaxis available for Hepatitis C

\section*{Nasocomial Infections}
- They are also called hospital - acquired infections
- They are infections acquired in the hospital or other health care facility that were not present or incubating during the time the patient was admitted
Include those infections that become symptomatic after the patient has been discharged as well as among medical personnel
Most of these infections are transmitted by medical personnel who fail to practice proper hand washing procedures or change of gloves between client contact

\section*{Processing Instruments and Items}

Instruments can be classified into the following categories:
Low Risk Instruments
${ }^{-}$They come into contact with intact skin. Cleaning and drying them is adequate e.g. thermometer

\section*{Intermediate Risk}
- They don't penetrate the intact skin but come into contact with mucous membrane

\section*{High Risk}
${ }^{-}$They penetrate intact skin or sterile tissues. Require cleaning and sterilization or high level disinfection where sterilization is not applicable

Instrument processing entails three steps which are:

Decontamination
Cleansing
-Sterilization or high level disinfection.

\section*{DECONTAMINATION}
- Is the process of elimination of pathogens except the spore from inanimate things.
${ }^{-}$Is the first step in processing instruments and other items for re-use.
Decontamination kills viruses and many microorganisms, making the instruments and other items safe to handle by the staff who clean them.
Decontamination also makes instruments and other items easier to clean by preventing blood, other body fluids and tissue from drying on them.
- Decontamination is done by soaking instruments and other items immediately after use, in a $0.5 \%$ chlorine solution for 10 minutes immediately after use.
- This is prepared in a ratio of 1:6 (one part of jik to 6 parts of water)
A container of this solution should be kept in every operating room and procedure room so that used items can be placed directly into the bucket.

\section*{CLEANSING}
${ }^{-}$Is the removal of soil organic material from instruments and equipment used in providing patient care
${ }^{-}$Is the second step in processing of equipment
${ }^{-}$It involves the use of water, mechanical agent and sometimes detergent
- Reusable objects are cleansed prior to sterilization

\section*{Steps for Proper Cleansing}
${ }^{-}$Rinse object under cold water since warm water causes proteins in organic material to coagulate and stick
${ }^{-}$Apply detergent and scrub under running water with soft - bristled brush
${ }^{-}$Rinse the object in water
-Dry prior to sterilization
- Note: Nurse should wear gloves, masks and goggles during cleansing

\section*{STERILIZATION}
- This is the process that eliminates all microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, including bacterial endospores.
${ }^{-}$It is recommended for instruments and other items that come into contact with the bloodstream or tissues under the skin.
- Can be performed using steam under pressure (autoclaving or moist heat), dry heat or chemicals.

\section*{1. Steam Sterilization (Autoclaving)}
${ }^{-}$It is a method of sterilization that requires moist heat under pressure. Steam is produced by water and heat. The heat maintains the required temperature under pressure.
${ }^{-}$Heat can be provided by electricity, gas stove, or kerosene burner.
- Moist heat under pressure allows efficient destruction of micro-organisms.

Steps of steam sterilization:
a) Decontaminate, clean and dry all instruments and other items to be sterilized.
b) Open or unlock all joined instruments and other items, for example, hemostats.
c) Disassemble scissors with sliding or multiple parts to allow steam to reach all surfaces of the item. Do not arrange the instruments and other items tightly together, because steam will not reach all surfaces.
d) Wrap instruments and other items in two layers of paper, cotton or muslin fabric before steam sterilization.
e) If you are using a drum, make sure the holes are
f) Arrange all packs, drums or unwrapped items in the chamber of the autoclave in a way that allows steam to circulate freely.
g) Always follow the manufacturer's instructions on how to operate the autoclave but sterilize wrapped items for 30 minutes and unwrapped items for 20 minutes at $121^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 15.36 Pascal pressure.
h) If the autoclave is automatic, the heat will shut off and the pressure will begin to fall once the sterilization cycle is complete.
i) If the autoclave is not automatic, turn off the heat or remove the autoclave from the heat source after 30 minutes if items are wrapped, or after 20 minutes if items are unwrapped..
- Wait until the pressure gauge reads "zero" to open the autoclave
Open the lid or door to allow the remaining steam to escape. Leave instrument packs or items in the autoclave until they dry completely.
- Remove the packs, drums or unwrapped items from the autoclave using sterile pick ups.
Place packs or drums on a surface padded with paper or fabric until they are cool to prevent condensation.
Wait until the packs, drums or items reach room temperature before storing.

\section*{Storage of Autoclaved / Sterile items Wrapped Items}

Shelf life: The length of time a wrapped sterile item is considered sterile. It depends on whether or not a contaminating event occurs.
${ }^{-}$Shelf life is affected by a number of factors which include:
- Type of packaging material used
- Cleanliness of the store
- Humidity in the store
- Temperature of the storage area
- Storing the packs on open or closed shelves
- Usage of dust proof covers

Storage time and handling of sterile packs should be kept to a minimum, since the likelihood of handling and contamination increases over time. Place sterile packs in closed cabinets in areas that are not heavily trafficked, have moderate temperature and are dry.

\section*{Unwrapped Items}
- Should be used immediately after removal from the autoclave.
- They can also be kept in a covered, sterile container for up to one week.

\section*{2. Dry Heat Sterilization or Hot-Air Oven (Electric Oven)}
${ }^{-}$This is the method of sterilization that requires heat for a specific period of time.
${ }^{-}$This method is used for sterilizing glass or metal objects because high temperatures are necessary.
${ }^{-}$Also used to sterilize instruments with cutting edges
- Need to ensure that the designated temperature is reached
${ }^{-170^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-1 \text { hour }}$
${ }^{-1} 160^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-2$ hours
${ }^{-1} 150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-2 \frac{1}{2}$ hours
${ }^{-} 140^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-3$ hours

\section*{3. Chemical Sterilization}
${ }^{-}$This is the method of sterilization used for instruments and other items that are heat sensitive or when heat sterilization is unavailable.
${ }^{-}$Instruments and other items can be sterilized by soaking them in a chemical solutions such as glutaraldehyde (cidex) or formalin, followed by rinsing in sterile water.
Glutaraldehyde is irritating to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract. Wear gloves and limit your exposure time. Keep the area well ventilated when using it. Always follow manufacturer's instructions before use.
7\% Glutaraldehyde : 8-10 hours, while 8\% Formalin: 24 hours

\section*{4. Ethylene Oxide}
${ }^{-}$It is a chemical substance used for heat destroyed instruments
-Should be used with precaution because it is gaseous, toxic and explosive

\section*{5. High Level Disinfection}
- This is the process that eliminates all microorganisms (including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites), but does not reliably kill all bacterial endospores which cause tetanus and gas gangrene.
${ }^{-}$Is suitable for instruments and other items that will come into contact with broken skin or intact mucous membranes.
${ }^{-}$HLD can be performed by boiling (20minutes), use of chemicals (20minutes in 3\% formalin/ 2\% glutaraldehyde) or steaming.

\section*{Proper Waste Disposal}

Hospital waste can be categorized into the following groups
Clinical Waste: Any material that has been in contact with patients either internally or externally
Pathological Waste: Human body tissues e.g. placenta, tooth
Pharmaceutical Waste: Expired drugs, containers
Food remains. Cooked or uncooked
General Waste: Include waste papers
Sharps: Surgical blades and needles
- Radiation Waste• X - rav charts

\section*{WASTE SEGREGATION}
${ }^{-}$It is the process of sorting of hospital waste into different categories based on the nature of waste.
-Segregation at the point of origin, aided by suitable and consistent packaging, is vital in enabling different forms of waste to be handled, transported and disposed of in a manner which is safe and in keeping with the nature of the waste.

During waste segregation, waste is categorized into four categories based on their nature:
- Non Infectious Waste: Includes food remains, waste paper and packaging material. Disposed in a BLACK color coded bin
Infectious Waste: Includes routine clinical waste e.g. gloves, gauzes and bandages. Disposed in YELLOW color coded bins
- Highly Infectious: This includes body tissues/ parts e.g. teeth, placenta. Disposed in RED color coded bins
Sharps: Included needles and surgical blades. Disposed in a SHARPS BOX. The container should be at arms length

-The patient should be nursed in private room as follows:
${ }^{-}$Explain the procedure to the patient to enhance co-operation
${ }^{-}$Equip the room with all the patient's requirements
- Place or keep protective devices near the room
- Put a barrier notice and ensure the room has a sink and water
${ }^{-}$Always use protective devices when attending to the patient
- Number of people entering the room should be limited
Items in the room shouldn't be used by another patient

\section*{Reverse Barrier Nursing}
-Nursing technique by which an immuno compromised client is protected from infection
- Aims at protecting susceptible patient from infections
${ }^{-}$Protects the client from acquiring nasocomial infections
${ }^{-}$Indicated is excessive burns, acute renal failure, leukemia

\section*{Principles of Reverse Barrier Nursing}
- Patient should be isolated
${ }^{-}$Air entering the room should be filtered
- Number of people entering the room should be limited
${ }^{-}$All equipment to be used by the patient should decontaminated and not shared
-Temperature should be monitored
- Fresh flowers and fruits should be kept in the room since they help contain toxoplasmosis

BED MAKING

Since most important parts of the environment of a hospitalized patient is bed, bed making is important to nurses

A clean bed that is wrinkle - free and remains intact when a patient moves around does a great deal for the patient's physical and psychological comfort

Aims of Bed Making
- Make the ward neat
${ }^{-}$Provide comfort to the patient
-Save time and energy
- Observe for and prevent pressure sores
- Adapt the patient’s needs

PRINCIPLES OF ASEPSIS IN BED MAKING
${ }^{-}$Micro - organisms move through space in air currents, therefore:
"Handle linen carefully
"Avoid throwing it on the floor to prevent spread of any micro - organisms present either on the floor or linen
"Avoid shaking or tossing it into the laundry hamper/ linen carrier
- Micro - organisms are transferred from one surface to another on contact, therefore:
"Hold soiled linen and clean linen way from your uniform to prevent contamination of either
- Proper hand washing before you begin and after bed making

\section*{BODY MECHANICS IN BED MAKING}
-When bending, bend your knees, not your back in order to keep the center of gravity above and close to the base of support and help prevent fatigue
- Face your entire body in the direction that you are moving to avoid twisting in order to prevent strain or injury

Organize your work. Conserve your steps by making a few trips around the bed as possible

\section*{Special Appliances used in Bed Making}

Special beds are used on many occasions for the comfort of the patient, protection of bed linen, prevention of pressure sores, facilitation of easier putting of patients in bed and care of patients with certain conditions
- Extra appliances may be added to the requirements for a simple bed in the preparation of special beds

These appliances include:

\section*{Mackintosh}

Water proof material used to protect the bottom sheets, pillows and mattress from getting wet Bed Cradle
Appliance used to keep the weight of the linen off the patient e.g. in patient with burns to protect linen from touching the area with wound

\section*{Bed Blocks}

Made of wood and used to raise the bed on one side e.g. to supply blood to vital organs like the brain

\section*{Bed Rest/Back Rest}

Help the patient sit in upright position. May be attached to or separate from the bed and can be adjusted to different degrees

\section*{Fracture Boards}

They are boards (wooden) placed under the mattress to provide a firm rigid foundation to the bed and prevent the mattress from sagging. Aid in immobilization on affected part of the body.

\section*{Sand Bags}

Small bags made of impermeable material filled with sand. They are used to support patients legs to prevent foot drop. May also be used to immobilize a fractured limb

\section*{Air - Rings}

Rubber ring placed beneath the patient's buttocks to keep them from direct contact with the bed. Relieve pressure hence prevent pressure sores.

\section*{Bed Tables}

Specially made tables which can be drawn up in front of the patient and may be used during meals or for leaning slightly forward incase the patient has difficulty in breathing

\section*{Hot Water Bottles}

Bottles of rubber used to give warmth to the patient. They may also be used to relieve pain

\section*{Foot Boards}

Used to secure and support the patients foot Water Beds
They are just like mattress though have a place to fill with hot water

\section*{Air Beds}

These are mattresses that are filled with air Ripple Mattresses
Have segments and uses electricity to put air pressure. Used to relieve pressure

\section*{ASSIGNMENT}

\section*{2. Unoccupied}
${ }^{-}$This is a bed not occupied by patients
a) Closed: Made when preparing the unit and there is no patient assigned to it
b) Open: Made for a client who is not in the bed at that particular time. The top covers are folded $1 / 3$ from top to bottom to facilitate easy getting in.

\section*{SPECIAL BEDS}

LIFTING AND MOVING PATIENTS

The basic recommended guidelines for you to follow are:
- Know the patient's diagnosis, capabilities, weaknesses and any movement they are not allowed to undertake.
- Put on braces and other devices a patient may use before getting them out of bed.
-Plan exactly what will be done while transferring a patient so that appropriate techniques will be utilized. This is because without planning you or the patient may acquire an injury.

Explain to the patient what will be done. Then use the patients ability to assist as much as possible to reduce the workload on you, the nurse.
- Remove obstacles that may make transferring more difficult prior to transferal.
- Elevate the patient's bed as necessary so that work is being done at a safe and comfortable level.

Lock the wheels of the bed, wheelchair or stretcher to prevent them from sliding as the

\section*{GRIPS AND HOLDS FOR LIFTING}

\section*{PRESSURE SORES}

Also known as pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers or bedsores, are localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue usually over a bony prominence, as a result of pressure, or pressure in combination with shear and/or friction.
- With prolonged pressure, blood supply to the tissues capillary network is disrupted cause impeded blood flow to the surrounding tissues. This leads to local tissue ischemia, hypoxia, edema, inflammation and cell death (necrosis)
- Most commonly this will be the sacrum, coccyx, heels or the hips, but other sites such as the shoulders, ears, elbows, toes, knees, ankles or the back of the cranium can be affected

\section*{CAUSATIVE FACTORS}
1. Pressure
- Patient's own weight pressing on a surface
- One body part pressing on another
- Tightly applied bandages
- Heavy objects
- Unpadded bed pans

\section*{2. Friction}
-Caused by creases, patched linen, rough blankets, lifting and turning patients
-Shear is also a cause; shear pulls on blood vessels that feed the skin
3. Factors which influence skin tolerance to pressure and shear
- Protein-calorie malnutrition,
-Microclimate (skin wetness caused by sweating or incontinence)
- Diseases that reduce blood flow to the skin, such as arteriosclerosis
${ }^{-}$Diseases that reduce the feeling in the skin, such as paralysis or neuropathy

\section*{PATIENTS AT RISK}
-Those with incontinence
- Paralyzed
- Obese
- Emaciated
- Unconscious
- Critically ill
-Those suffering from impaired peripheral circulation and sensory function

\section*{PREVENTION OF PRESSURE SORES}
${ }^{-}$Inspect all areas at least twice a day
-Position and turn patients as often as possible, at least 2 hourly
${ }^{-}$Ensure bedpans are not chipped and should be well padded
- Keep skin clean, dry and change soiled linen
- Use of special appliances e.g. airings
-Massage skin to improve/promote circulation
- Ensure patient is well hydrated and nourished (eating a balanced diet with adequate protein)

\section*{PRESSURE AREA CARE}

This is done to prevent bedsores by relieving pressure, stimulating blood circulation and keeping skin dry

Clear the area, put dirty linen to the sluice
Remove trolley and decontaminate
Clean each equipment accordingly

VITAL SIGNS
- These are basic components of assessing the physiological and psychological conditions of a client.
- They are vital because they are governed by the vital organs in body (cardiorespiratory).
They include:
- Temperature (T)
- Pulse (P)
- Respiratory Rate (R)
- Blood Pressure (BP)
- Pulse Oximetry (SpO2)

\section*{Importance of taking vital signs}
- They help establish baseline values of the cardiorespiratory integrity. Baseline values establish the norms against which subsequent measurements can be compared
- To make a diagnosis and determine treatment options. Variations from the normal findings may indicate potential problems with the client's health status.
> - Monitor patients progress by comparing with previous findings
> - Monitor for side - effects of drugs

The frequency of vital signs measurement is determined by:
- The patient's condition
-The procedure being performed
- Physician’s orders
${ }^{-}$Established standards of care for the particular clinical setting or service

\section*{Note:}
-Whenever a change is suspected in the patient's condition, the nurse should measure the patient's vitals regardless of the setting
- The sequence of vital signs measurement in nurse's notes is usually T-P-R and BP

\section*{FACTORS AFFECTING VITAL SIGNS}
1. Age
- The normal values and variations in vital sign measurements are usually based on age.

\section*{2. Gender}
- Women usually experience greater temperature fluctuations compared to men because of hormonal changes.
- Males generally have a higher blood pressure than females of the same age.

\section*{3. Race}
-Some ethnic groups are more susceptible than others to hemodynamic alterations

\section*{4. Medications}
-Some medications can directly or indirectly alter pulse, respirations or blood pressure.
- Digitalis preparation decrease pulse rate while narcotic analgesics can depress the rate and depth of respirations and lower blood pressure

\section*{5. Lifestyle}
- Factors like cigarette smoking cause chronic changes in the lungs manifested by impaired ventilation
-Stimulants like caffeinated beverages and tobacco elevate the heart rate

\section*{6. Pain}
- With acute pain, sympathetic stimulation increase heart rate which increases cardiac output and vasoconstriction, causing an increased peripheral vascular resistance
- These changes result in increased pulse and respiratory rates, respiratory depth and blood pressure

Chronic pain causes parasympathetic stimulation which decreases pulse rate
7. Anxiety and Stress
- Cause sympathetic stimulation which results in an increased pulse, temperature, respiration rates and blood pressure
8. Exercise
${ }^{-}$It increases temperature, and if short term, pulse, respirations and blood pressure
- Routine exercise increases metabolism and heat production and strengthens cardiac muscles.

\section*{9. Diurnal Variations (Circadian Rhythm)}
${ }^{-}$Temperatures are lowest between 0400-0600h and highest between $2000-2400 \mathrm{~h}$.
- The pulse decreases during sleep.
- The blood pressure measurements are lowest early in the morning and highest late in the afternoon or early evening

\section*{10. Postural Changes}

\section*{TEMPERATURE}
- Temperature assessment involves measuring the balance between heat production and heat loss by the body
- Temperature measurement is by Thermometers

\section*{Basal Body Temperature}
${ }^{-}$It is the lowest temperature attained by the body during rest (usually during sleep).
It is generally measured immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken, although the temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body temperature.

\section*{Core Temperature}
${ }^{-}$Also called core body temperature, is the operating temperature of an organism, specifically in deep structures of the body such as the liver, in comparison to temperatures of peripheral tissues.
- Core temperature is normally maintained within a narrow range so that essential enzymatic reactions can occur.
- Rectal temperature examination is used to estimate core temperature (oral temperature is affected by hot or cold drinks and mouthbreathing).
- Rectal temperature is expected to be approximately one Fahrenheit degree higher than an oral temperature taken on the same person at

\section*{Units Of Measurement}
- Temperature is measured in Degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit
- The Celsius thermometers use the Celsius ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) as the measurement unit while the Fahrenheit thermometers use Fahrenheit ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ ) as the temperature measurement unit.
-Some thermometers have the measuring scales for both Celsius and Fahrenheit. These thermometers give the reading in Celsius as well as Fahrenheit.

\section*{Mechanism of Different Types of Thermometers 1. Mercury and Alcohol Thermometers}

Mercury thermometers have mercury filled in a glass tube and has a glass bulb at the bottom.
${ }^{-}$As the temperature increases, the mercury rises in the glass tube.
-The glass tube is calibrated in Celsius, Fahrenheit or both. The rise in mercury determines the temperature according to the calibration.

Alcohol thermometers have ethanol or toluene instead of mercury in the glass tube. All the other mechanism of the thermometer are same as that of the mercury thermometer.

\section*{2. Digital Thermometers}

Digital thermometers use thermocouples or thermistors to sense the change in temperature and display the temperature on a digital display.

Infrared thermometers use the infrared sensors to determine the temperature and have a digital display.

\section*{Normal Temperature Readings}
- The temperature reading vary depending on the age of the client and which part of the body is being measured.
- Temperature can be taken from the following parts of the body:
"Axillary
-Groin
"Rectal
"Oral
-Ear/Tympanic
-The typical daytime temperatures among healthy adult is 36.5-37.5 degrees Celsius

\section*{Normal Age - Related Temperature Variations}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Age & Part of the Body & Celsius & Fahrenheit \\
\hline Newborn & Axillary & 35.5-37.7 & 96.0-99.7 \\
\hline 1 Year & Oral & 37.7 & 99.7 \\
\hline 3 Year & Oral & 37.2 & 99.0 \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Centigrade and Fahrenheit Conversion Formulas}
- Centigrade to Fahrenheit: Multiply the centigrade reading by $9 / 5$ and add 32 . [oF = (oC*9/5)+32\}]
${ }^{-}$Fahrenheit to Centigrade: Deduct 32 from the Fahrenheit reading and multiply by $5 / 9$. [oC= (oF32) *5/9]

\section*{Pyrexia}

Commonly known as fever, characterized by an elevation of body temperature above the normal range of $36.5-37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ due to an increase in the temperature regulatory set-point

\section*{Types of Pyrexia According to Temperature Variation}

Continuous/Constant: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and does not fluctuate more than $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in 24 hours, e.g. in lobar pneumonia, typhoid, urinary tract infection or brucellosis.

Intermittent: The temperature elevation is present only for a certain period, later cycling back to normal, e.g. in malaria, or septicemia.
Remittent: Temperature remains above normal throughout the day and fluctuates more than 1 ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in 24 hours, e.g., infective endocarditis

\section*{Types of Pyrexia According to Termination}

Fall by Lysis: The elevated temperature gradually falls ( $3-5$ days). It is accompanied by the patient's improvement.
Fall by Crisis: The elevated temperature falls to normal within 24 hours or less (sharp fall) usually accompanied by patient's improvement

Pseudo - crisis: The fall is usually accompanied by improvement of patient's condition and then the temperature rises again after a short period.

Hyperpyrexia: Is fever with an extreme elevation of body temperature greater than or equal to $41.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Such a high temperature is considered a medical emergency as it may indicate a serious underlying condition or lead to significant side effects.

Note: The whole procedure should take <20min

Stop tepid sponging if:
- The patient shivers excessively
- Becomes restless
- Other vital signs become abnormal

\section*{PULSE}
- Pulse assessment is the measurement of pressure pulsation created when the heart contracts and ejects blood into the aorta creating a wave of expansion and recoil in the arteries.

It can be felt by palpation on a point where an artery crosses a bone close to the surface
- Pulse assessment provides clinical data regarding the heart's pumping action and the adequacy of peripheral artery blood flow

\section*{Pulse Characteristics}

\section*{a) Quality}
${ }^{-}$It is the 'feel' of pulse, the rhythm and forcefulness

\section*{b) Rate}
${ }^{-}$Is an indirect measurement of cardiac output obtained by counting the number of apical waves over a pulse point.
- Bradycardia: Is the heart rate less than the normal (60 beats/minute in an adult)
${ }^{-}$Tachycardia: Is a heart rate more than normal (100 beats/minute in an adult)
c) Rhythm

It is the regularity of the heart beat. It describes how evenly the heart is beating
Regular: The beats are evenly spaced
Irregular: The beats are not evenly spaced
Dysrhythmia (arrhythmia): Is an irregular
rhythm caused by an early, late or missed beat.
-Intermittent: Pulse whose rhythm is changes
from being regular to irregular and vice versa.
d) Volume
${ }^{-}$It is the measurement of strength or amplitude of force exerted by the ejected blood against the artery wall with each contraction
Normal: Full, easily palpable
Weak: Thready and usually rapid
Strong: Bounding

\section*{RESPIRATIONS}
${ }^{-}$Is the measurement of breathing pattern/ rate
- Assessment of respirations provides clinical data on the pH of arterial blood.
Sites for Respiratory Assessment
- Normal breathing is slightly observable, effortless, quiet, automatic and regular.
${ }^{-}$It can be observed by observing chest wall expansion and bilateral symmetrical movement of the thorax
It can also be assessed by placing the back of your hand next to the client's nose and mouth to feel expired air

\section*{Characteristics of Normal and Abnormal Breathing Sounds}

\section*{Eupnoea:}
- Easy respirations with normal rate of breaths per minute that are age specific

\section*{Bradypnea:}
- Respiratory rate of 10 or fewer breaths/minute as per age

\section*{Tachypnea:}
- Respiratory rates greater than normal range that are age specific

Apnea:
It is the suspension of external breathing. During apnea there is no movement of the muscles of respiration and the volume of the lungs initially remains unchanged. Depending on the patency of the airways there may or may not be a flow of gas between the lungs and the environment; gas exchange within the lungs and cellular respiration is not affected.

\section*{Hyperventilation:}

Characterized by deep, rapid respirations. May lead to alkalosis from loss of carbon monoxide. Associated with exercises

\section*{Hypoventilation:}

Characterized by shallow ventilations. May lead to retention of carbon monoxide resulting to respiratory acidosis

\section*{Kussmaul's breathing:}
- Increased depth and rate of respiration associated with diabetic ketoacidosis as a compensatory mechanism to eliminate excess CO2

\section*{Cheyne - Stroke breathing:}
${ }^{-}$An abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual decrease that results in a temporary stop in breathing after 10 seconds. It is associated with head injury

\section*{Costal (Thoracic) Breathing:}

Occurs when the external intercostal muscles and the accessory muscles are used to move the chest upward and outward

\section*{Diaphragmatic (abdominal) Breathing:}
- Occurs when the diaphragm contracts and relaxes as observed by movement of the abdomen

\section*{Dyspnea}

Difficulty in breathing evidenced by labored or forced respirations through the use of accessory muscles in the chest and neck to breath.
${ }^{-}$This clients are acutely aware of their respirations and complain of shortness of breath

\section*{Normal Age - Related Variations in Resting Respiration}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Age & Norma - Range & Average Rate/ Minute \\
\hline Newborn & 30-50 & 40 \\

\section*{PULSE OXIMETRY}
-This is the measurement of arterial oxygen circulation using non - invasive light
-The amount of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen is an important indicator for patients, especially in intensive care and emergency situations.

\section*{Measurement}
${ }^{-}$A sensor is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, part of the body that is relatively translucent and has good arterial pulsed blood flow, usually fingertip, toe, earlobe, or in the case of an infant, across a foot.
${ }^{-}$A pulse oximeter shines light of two different wavelengths, red and infrared through the patient to a photo detector.
- The ratio of red to infrared light that that passes through the measurement site and is received by the oximeter's detector depends on the percentage of the oxygenated versus the deoxygenated hemoglobin through which light passes
- The changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths is measured, allowing determination of the absorbance due to the pulsing arterial blood alone, excluding venous blood, skin, bone, muscle, fat, and (in most cases) nail polish
- The percentage of oxygen saturation thus calculated is referred to as the percentage SpO2

Evaluation Of Spo2 Measurements
${ }^{-}$An SpO2 of greater than 95\% is considered normal
${ }^{-}$An SpO2 of $92 \%$ or less (at sea level) suggests hypoxemia
"In a patient with acute respiratory illness and difficulty in breathing e.g. asthmatic attack, an SpO2 of 92\% or less may indicate need of O2
${ }^{\text {" }}$ In a patient with stable chronic disease, an SpO2 of $92 \%$ or less should prompt referral for further investigations of the need of long - term O2 therapy

\section*{BLOOD PRESSURE}
${ }^{-}$Is the measurement of pressure exerted by blood on the walls of its vessels
- Measured directly or indirectly

Direct Measurement: An invasive procedure in which an invasive catheter with an electric sensor is inserted into an artery and an artery transmitted pressure on an electronic display unit is read
Indirect Measurement: Requires use of sphygmomanometer and stethoscope for auscultation and palpation as needed

\section*{Sites}
- The most common site for indirect blood pressure measurement is the client's arm over the brachial artery
-When the client's position does not allow palpation and auscultation of the brachial artery, blood pressure can be assessed in the forearm or leg region
- The popliteal artery is the site of choice in cases where pressure measurement in the upper extremities is inaccessible or contraindicated.

\section*{Contraindications for brachial artery blood pressure measurement}

When a patient has the following:
-Venous access devices, such as intravenous infusion or arteriovenous fistula for renal dialysis
-Surgery involving the breast, axilla, shoulder, arm or hand
${ }^{-}$Injury or disease to the shoulder, arm or hand such as trauma, burns or application of a cast or bandage

Measurement of blood pressure is by a Sphygmomanometer which consists of mercury or Aneroid Manometer and a cuff that contains an inflatable rubber connected to two pieces of rubber tubing.

There are electronic sphygmomanometers which can be used by patients for self - measurement. A stethoscope in not needed because the device electronically inflates and deflates the cuff while simultaneously reading and displaying the systolic and diastolic pressures

\section*{Unit of measurement of BP is millimeters of Mercury (mmHg)}
${ }^{-}$It is recorded as systolic pressure over diastolic pressure (Systolic/Diastolic)

\section*{Note:}

Systolic Pressure: The pressure exerted on the bloodstream by the heart when it contracts, forcing blood from the ventricles of the heart into the pulmonary artery and the aorta.

Diastolic Pressure: The pressure in the bloodstream when the heart relaxes and dilates, filling with blood.,

\section*{Auscultation}
${ }^{-}$Done using a stethoscope which aids in hearing the sounds created by blood flowing through the artery
${ }^{-}$Inflation of the cuff by a pressure higher than the normal causes the artery to collapse, ceasing blood flow and so sound is absent on auscultation
${ }^{-}$As pressure is released, blood begins to flow through the artery and creates the first sound which is the systolic pressure and the last sound to be heard is the diastolic pressure
${ }^{-}$These sounds are called Korotkoff’s sounds

\section*{Stethoscopes}

\section*{Parts of a Stethoscope}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_26_2d87726915aefb74e05ag-0441.jpg?height=1522&width=2181&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=211)

\section*{Ear Tubes}
- They attach the earpieces to the main body of the stethoscope.
- They are typically constructed of metal and consist of hollow tubes that are ideally suited to transmitting low-frequency sound.

\section*{Acoustic Tubes}
${ }^{-}$Connect the ear tubes to the chest piece and is a flexible tube made of a rubberized material.
-They can be filled with different materials to best transmit sound from the patient to the health-care provider.

\section*{Chest piece}
${ }^{-}$It is constructed of metal and is typically doublesided to work for differently sized patients and different areas of the body.
${ }^{-}$It has deep cups that capture sounds from the target area and may be ringed with a "chill ring" to keep the patient from being uncomfortable when touched by the cold metal chest piece.

Characteristics of Blood Pressure

\section*{Hypotension:}
-Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or 20 -30 mmHg below the client's normal systolic pressure.
${ }^{-}$Orthostatic Hypotension (Postural Hypotension) is the sudden drop of 25 mmHg in systolic pressure and 10 mmHg in diastolic pressure when a client moves from lying to sitting or sitting to standing

\section*{Hypertension:}
-Persistent systolic pressure greater than 135 to 140 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of greater than 90 mmHg

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF SAFE DRUG USE}

Content
-Pharmacology
- Laws relating to the control of drugs
-Local regulations
- Drug standards
- Administration of medications [routes of administration, recording and reporting (inhalation - nebulization, steam treatment)]

\section*{Objectives:}

By the end of this section you should be able to:
- Explain the therapeutic doses and calculation of drugs in common use
${ }^{-}$Describe drug interaction, drug assimilation, drug resistance, contraindications and side effects

\section*{Pharmacology}

It is the science of drugs, which includes their preparation, use and effects'.
Broader definition of pharmacology is 'the study of the effects of chemical substances on living tissues ${ }^{6}$
In nursing practice at times you diagnose and treat minor illnesses and are involved in the prescribing of medications.
When administering drugs you must detect early signs and symptoms of toxicity, adverse reactions and drug interactions as well as therapeutic responses.

\section*{Legal Aspects of Drugs}

There are two categories:
-Statutory legislations relating to acts of parliament: These are general policies for administration of drugs in all hospitals
${ }^{-}$Institution policies: Hospital policies for drug administration

\section*{1. The Pharmacy and Poisons Act: Chapter 244 of the Laws of Kenya, 1989}

This act makes better provision of:
- Control of professional pharmacies
- Trade in drugs and poisons
- Defines many terminologies in pharmacy which include:
a) Drug: Any Medicine preparation or therapeutic substance
b) Poison: Any drug included in the poison list
c)Advertisement: Any announcement made orally or by means of producing or transmitting light or sound
d) Authorized practitioner/seller of poison: A person lawfully carrying out business or pharmacy in accordance with provision of Act 244. Must be a registered pharmacist where certificate of registration is displayed
e) Dispensing: Supplying medicine or poison in accordance with prescription

\section*{Legal Requirements of a Prescription}
-Prescription should be in written form
-Should have the name and address of the person taking the drug
${ }^{-}$Should be signed and dated by the person who wrote it
-Should be complete, specifying the medicine and dosage to be supplied
${ }^{-}$If prepared by a dentist, should have words for dental treatment e.g. "for dental use only"
Should have the name and address of the person to whom the drug will be delivered
2. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act, 1994 [Dangerous Drugs Act (DDA)]
${ }^{-}$This is an Act of Parliament to make provision with respect to the control of the possession of, and trafficking in, narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and cultivation of certain plants, to provide for forfeiture of property derived from, or used in, illicit traffic narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and for connected purposes.
${ }^{-}$Psychotropic medication include:
"Narcotics
"Antidepressants
"Stimulants

It classifies the drugs based on their potential for abuse and dependence:

\section*{Schedule I}
- They have the highest potential for abuse
-There is no acceptable medical use. They are not kept in health facilities e.g. Bhang, Cocaine, Heroine

\section*{Schedule II}
- They have a high potential for abuse
${ }^{-}$Have severe dependence e.g. Morphine, Pethidine

\section*{Schedule III}
- They have a lower potential for abuse than II
- Have moderate dependence e.g. sedatives, stimulants

\section*{Schedule IV}
- They have a low potential for abuse
- Have limited dependence e.g. ant - anxiety agents, non - narcotic analgesics

\section*{Schedule V}
-They have a limited potential for abuse
-They are not kept under double lock and key e.g. codeine

\section*{Guidelines on supplying, storing and administering controlled drugs:}
- Prescriptions must be signed by a registered medical practitioner
-Stock must be ordered in special controlled drug books signed by the nursing officer in charge/ charge nurse or the deputy
${ }^{-}$Drugs must be delivered in a sealed container and a receipt signed by the ward in charge

Controlled drugs must be stored in a double lock and key (locked container or cupboard within a locked cupboard)
- These cupboards should not be used for any other purposes (for example, storing valuables) Details of doses given to each patient must be recorded in cardex, together with the signature of the nurse giving the dose and the person checking it
Any drug wasted must be recorded and signed for

Controlled drug books must be kept for two years following the last entry date
All dangerous drugs are automatically contained in Schedule 1
At the end of every shift, they should be counted and recorded. This should be done by incoming nurse
Only a registered licensed nurse or pharmacist should be allowed to add new stock to the inventory

\section*{Procedure for Administering Controlled Drugs}

\section*{Requirements}

They are similar to other drugs but have additions like the controlled drugs register, keys for DDA cupboard and 2 nurses

\section*{Steps}
- Arrange equipment on a trolley
- Wash hands together with the assistant
- Both nurses read the prescription as they confirm doctor's signature, date, time, dosage and route of administration

Open the cupboard, DDA cupboard/container and remove the DDA register
- Remove all stock of drugs and count, counterchecking with the stock book
- Get the dose to be given and place on a tray and enter remaining stock in the register
- Enter the patient's details in the register but don't sign
- Lock the DDA cupboard
- Prepare the drug accordingly
- Call the patient and countercheck patient's details including the dose and time
- Administer the drug and leave the patient comfortable
- Thank the patient
- Walk back to the DDA cupboard, record time and dose given and sign
- The witness ( $2^{\text {nd }}$ nurse) counter signs
- Record the patient's notes and cardex then return the DDA register and lock the cupboard

\section*{ANTIBIOTICS}

Good stock recording of antibiotics is done because:
-They are expensive
- When misused they cause resistance

The following guidelines should therefore be adhered to:
${ }^{-}$After administration of antibiotics, the nurse should enter the details of the patient in the antibiotics book
- Enter all antibiotics used during a session should be recorded in the antibiotics book
-The antibiotics book should be balanced
${ }^{-}$All borrowed and received antibiotics should be

\section*{Local Regulations}

Local regulations are devised by individual hospitals and are meant to protect their staff, particularly the student nurse during training:
${ }^{-}$Any dangerous drugs should be checked by a registered/enrolled nurse
- Only a small quantity should be kept in the ward
- The stock should be checked regularly
-The drug keys should be on the person who is in charge of the ward or the deputy

Ampoules containing different drugs should be stored separately
Drugs should not be transferred from one bottle to another
Out of date drugs and those brought in by patients should be returned immediately to the dispensary
- Drug bottles must be labeled by a pharmacist

\section*{Drug Standards}

They are the yardsticks by which drug preparations are judged.
Medicines vary in their purity, strength, bioavailability, efficacy and safety or toxicity.

\section*{Purity}
- Standards of purity, rarely require that the substance in question be $100 \%$ drug chemical. They do, however, specify the type and concentration of extraneous substances allowed to be present in the drug product.

A pure drug contains only a specific chemical agent with no contaminating ingredients. Drugs are not 100\% pure because of the impurities from raw materials used for manufacturing them.

Other ingredients are added to the chemical to manipulate the absorption process. These additives include solvents, fillers, disintegrators, buffers, waxes, dyes, inks and plastics .

Contaminants from the environment of the production plant may find their way into a batch of drugs.

\section*{Potency}
${ }^{-}$This is the strength of a drug, measured by assay techniques.
-Chemical analysis is used to determine the ingredients present in a preparation and their relative amounts.

\section*{Efficacy}
${ }^{-}$Efficacy is the effectiveness of a drug in treatment.

\section*{Safety or Toxicity}
${ }^{-}$This is measured by the incidence and severity of reported adverse reactions following the use of a

\section*{Bioavailability}
${ }^{-}$It is the degree to which a drug can be absorbed and transported by the body to its site of action. This may be influenced by particle size, crystalline structure, solubility and polarity of the drug compound.
${ }^{-}$It is commonly measured by blood or tissue concentration of the drug at a specified time following administration of a dose.

\section*{Drug Names/Nomenclature}

Drugs are named in four different ways:
1. Chemical Name
${ }^{-}$This is the precise description of a drug. It indicates its atomic and molecular structure.
- These names are commonly used by the chemist and/or the research pharmacist.
-The names are unsuitable for general use since they are long.

Example: Acetylsalicylic acid (C6H4OHCOOC1H5) for Aspirin
2. Generic name
${ }^{-}$Some call it approved name. It is a simpler, shorter name for each drug substance.
- The name is often proposed by the company that first develops the drug.
${ }^{-}$It is often derived from the chemical name

Examples:
"Acetylsalicylic acid commonly known as aspirin
" 7 chloro-z methyl-amino-sphenyl-3h-1, benco diazepine, 4oxide commonly known as chlordiazepoxide
- 2-chloro-10(3-dimiethlyamino-n-n-propyl) pherothiazine hydrochloride commonly known as chlorpromazine
- 4 hydroxyacetanilide P-acetamido phenol commonly known as paracetamol
3. Trade /Brand/Propriotory Name
- Trademarks, trade names, brand names and proprietary names are interchangeable terms used to identify drugs manufactured by various drug companies.
A specific generic drug may have various trade names.
- The symbol after the trade name indicates that the trade name is registered and its use is restricted to the manufacturer who owns it.
- Trade names may be selected to:
- Denote the drug's chemical structure
- Identify the company responsible for manufacturing the drug
- Represent some property of the drug

Examples:
- Chlorpromazine, referred to as Largactil
- Paracetamol, referred to as Calpol, Cetal, PMC, Panadol, Panleve, Panok, and so on

No other firms or company can employ the same trade name. A trade name is usually selected to be short, catchy and easy to pronounce.

\section*{4.Official Name}

It is the name by which the drug is identified in official publications and international organizations like British Pharmacopeia

\section*{Classification of Drugs}

Drugs may be classified in many ways.

Drugs with similar characteristics are often grouped together in families

One substance may belong to more than one family depending on the classification used for instance, aspirin, which is an analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory drug.
A drug may be designated by:

A drug may be designated by:
a) Chemical derivation, e.g. heavy metals, xanthines, steroids, phenothiazines, barbiturates
b) Mechanism of action, e.g. central nervous system depressant, anti-cholinergic, antiinflammatory, antacid.
c) System they act on, e.g. cardiac, respiratory
d) Physiologic action, e.g. diuretic
e) Therapeutic effect, e.g. anticonvulsant, analgesic

\section*{Drug Effects}

\section*{1. Desired Therapeutic Effects}
- The desired therapeutic effects should indicate the mechanism of action of the drug.
${ }^{-}$For example, an analgesic is for pain relief, accomplished by central nervous system depression inhibition of inflammation.
- You must therefore understand how medication affects body function in order to make sound judgments about which medication to use

\section*{2. Side Effects}
- They are physiological effects exerted by the chemical that are not related to the desired therapeutic effect.
${ }^{-}$Note: All drugs have side effects. The number and range of side effects may indicate the relative toxicity of a given medication.
- Adverse reactions include any undesirable effect apparent in the recipient. They may be opposite to the desired effect, allergic or extraneous.
Idiosyncratic are unusual effects seen in some patients due to individual differences. They refers to the tendency within the individual to react unfavorably to certain substances.

\section*{3. Toxic Effects}
${ }^{-}$They are excessive drug effects. They tend to be exaggerations of therapeutic or side effects. For example, toxicity from a central nervous system depressant used for sedation may induce a coma.
- The margin of safety between therapeutic and toxic doses varies greatly.
- Note: Any substance that is physiologically potent enough to produce therapeutic effects is potentially harmful to the body at certain circumstances.
- Toxic symptoms could appear in clients receiving appropriate dosages. This is because drug response, metabolism and excretion vary from nerson to person

\section*{4. Contraindications}
- These are reasons that make it inadvisable to prescribe a particular drug
${ }^{-}$They are conditions or symptoms that alert you to the potential dangers of the drug.
- You MUST always decline to administer any drug that you believe will cause harm to the client. In such cases, let the physician administer the drug personally.
${ }^{-}$In such a situation, there are legal implications and this is the reason for the decision not to administer the drug.

\section*{Dosage Range}

The usual dosage must be included for each method of administration.
Dosages require adjustment according to certain factors:
a) Body mass: Drug dosages are mostly calculated as per kilo of body weight.
b) Nutritional status
c) Pathologic condition
d) Patients' ability to metabolize and excrete the drug
e) Age: The extremes of age that is, children and adults over 60 years require smaller doses than the normal adult dose.
f) Route: The route by which the drug may be given varies and the drug dosage may also vary according to the route of administration.
g) Assimilation: The assimilation of drugs given orally is fairly slow, thus the oral dose is large, whereas any drug injected into the blood stream acts immediately and dosage is proportionately smaller.

Note: When you notice any unusual dosages, you should verify and clarify with the doctor and refuse to carry out an order that, in your judgment, will result in harm to the patient.

\section*{Elimination}
- The efficiency of elimination affects the efficacy and potential for toxicity of a given medication.

Many drugs are deactivated by microsomal enzymes in the liver and excreted by the kidneys.

Always adhere to procedures that promote accurate identification of drugs before administering them to patients.

\section*{Route of Drug Administration}

The route of administration is dependent on the time at which the effect is required.

It is also dependent upon the method most suitable to the drug prescribed.

There are two broad categories of routes:
1. Enteral Route: The desired effect is systemic (non-local), drug is given via the digestive tract. This includes Oral, buccal, sublingual, GIT and Rectal routes. Where possible, oral administration is preferred.
2. Parenteral Route (Injection): The desired effect is systemic, drug is given by routes other than the digestive tract. This can be done in several ways including intra - dermally (dermis), subcutaneously (subcutaneous layer), intramuscularly (muscle), intravenously (vein), intra - arterial (artery), intra - osseous (bone marrow), intra - cerebral (brain parenchyma), intra - cerebroventricular (cerebral ventricular

\section*{ENTERAL ROUTE}

Advantages
-Painless
$\triangleright$ Less risk for infection
- Easier to take
-Doesn't require medical skills
- Cheap/economical

Disadvantages
$\triangleright$ Takes more time to act

\section*{Oral Route:}
- The medication is administered through the mouth and swallowed in tablet, liquid or powder form.
${ }^{-}$They are commonly referred to as per oral (PO).

\section*{Advantages}
- Convenient - can be self- administered, pain free, easy to take
${ }^{-}$Absorption - takes place along the whole length of the GI tract
- Cheap - compared to most other parenteral route
- Most preferred route

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Destruction of drugs by gastric acid and digestive juices
- Effect too slow for emergencies
- Unpleasant taste of some drugs
- Unable to use in unconscious patient
- Can irritate the mouth or cause discoloration
- Not appropriate for patients with oral thrush
- Not appropriate for vomiting patient

\section*{Sublingual Route:}
${ }^{-}$The medication is placed under the tongue where it is allowed to dissolve on its own without chewing till it is absorbed. e.g. adalat (antihypertensive drug)

\section*{Advantages}
- Rapid absorption
- Drug stability
- Avoid first-pass effect

Disadvantages
-Inconvenient
-Small doses
- Unpleasant taste of some drugs

\section*{Buccal Route:}
${ }^{-}$The drug is placed between the gums and the cheek until it is dissolves and gets absorbed.
${ }^{-}$Patient is instructed not to chew or swallow. e.g. miconazole

\section*{GIT Route:}
${ }^{-}$Drugs are given via tubes inserted from external into lower GIT:
"Nose - stomach: Nasogastric tube (NGT)
"Nose - jejunum: Nasojejuno tube
"Opening directly to the stomach: Gastrostomy tube
- The medication should be in should be in liquid form or powder form and mixed with liquid
${ }^{-}$If in tablet form, obtain physician's order before crushing. Never crush coated drugs.

\section*{Rectal Route:}
-Medications include suppositories or enema.
-Suppositories should be kept well and lubricated before insertion to reduce discomfort
-Suitable for unconscious patients and children and for nauseous or vomiting patients
- Easy to terminate exposure
- Absorption may be variable
- Good for drugs affecting the bowel such as
laxatives
Irritating drugs contraindicated

\section*{PARENTERAL ROUTE}

Advantages
- More effective since they by pass metabolism
-Suitable for drugs that can be digested by digestive enzymes, not absorbed by digestive system or those that are too irritant (anti - cancer)
- Dosage is more accurate
${ }^{-}$The therapeutic effect is fast: 15-30 seconds for IV, 3-5 minutes for IM and subcutaneous

100\% bioavailability
One injection can be formulated to last days or even months, e.g., Depo-Provera, a birth control shot that works for three months
${ }^{-}$IV can deliver continuous medication, e.g., morphine for patients in continuous pain, or saline drip for people needing fluids
- Suitable for all patients even the unconscious, uncooperative and critically ill

Disadvantages
- Painful
- Increased risk of infection
- Require skills to administer hence patients are not able to self-administer
Onset of action is quick, facilitating a greater risk of addiction and overdose when injecting drugs of abuse
Belonephobia, the fear of needles and injection.
${ }^{-}$If needles are shared, there is risk of HIV and other infectious diseases
${ }^{-}$It is the most dangerous route of administration because it bypasses most of the body's natural defenses, exposing the user to health problems such as hepatitis, abscesses, infections, and undissolved particles or additives/contaminants
If not done properly, potentially fatal air boluses (bubbles) can occur.
Need for strict asepsis

\section*{Containers for Injectable Drugs}

Injectable medicine are usually packed in two forms of containers:

\section*{Vials}
${ }^{-}$Also known as a phial or flacon
- They are small glass or plastic vessel or bottle, often used to store medication as liquids, powders or capsules.
Ampoule
${ }^{-}$It is a small glass bottle that contains a drug (especially a sealed sterile container for injection by needle).

\section*{SYRINGES}
- A syringe is a simple pump consisting of a plunger that fits tightly in a tube.
- The plunger can be pulled and pushed along inside a cylindrical tube (called a barrel), allowing the syringe to take in and expel a liquid or gas through an orifice at the open end of the tube.
- The open end of the syringe may be fitted with a hypodermic needle, a nozzle, or tubing to help direct the flow into and out of the barrel.
Syringes are often used to administer injections, insert intravenous drugs into the bloodstream and to draw blood or other tissue fluid

They are available in different sizes
- They consist of three parts: Barrel, Plunger and Tip
There are special syringes
Solo shots: They withdraw only a specific amount and have automatic closure once the amount has been reached
Insulin syringe: They are used specifically to administer insulin and are calibrated in units
Cartilages: These contain premeasured type of medication
BCG syringe: Used to administer BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) vaccine and are calibrated in smaller units
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_26_2d87726915aefb74e05ag-0524.jpg?height=1564&width=2287&top_left_y=136&top_left_x=127)

\section*{NEEDLES}

It has three parts:
1. Needle hilt: The part that attaches to the tip of the syringe
2. Shaft: The elongated region
3. Bevel: The extreme end with visible lumen
${ }^{-}$The size is referred to as gauge. The smaller the number of gauge, the larger the lumen

Other routes of drug administration include:
a) Local or Topical Route

Drugs are used locally on the skin (epicutaneous) or in the eye, ear, nose or vagina. Substance is applied directly where its action is desired
1. Vaginal Route:
- Medications administered by this route are pessaries or creams
${ }^{-}$This involves use of an applicator to place or position the drug in the vagina
- The medication melts and it is absorbed via vaginal mucosa

\section*{2. Skin/transdermal/dermal}
- Medications are applied on the skin by painting, rubbing, dusting, applying with a moist dressing, by use of patches, soaking a body in solution or giving medicated bath
- Those drugs mostly act locally hence have less or no systemic effect
3. Ocular/Eye/ Ophthalmic Medication

They are in either semi - solid or liquid form

\section*{Principles of Ophthalmic Administration}
- Never put any medication directly to the pupil. It is very sensitive and it can be irritated and cause pain to the patient
Never allow patients to share medicine
- Use medication only for the affected eye
- When applying on both eyes, take care not to spread infection
${ }^{-}$Applicator should not touch any part of the eye
3. Otic/Ear Administration:
- Otic dosage forms are applied to the ear canal and are used for the treatment of infection, inflammation and/or pain.
- They may be formulated as aqueous or nonaqueous solutions and contain one (or more than one) category of therapeutic agent, e.g. local anesthetics (benzocaine), steroids (prednisolone sodium phosphate, hydrocortisone), antimicrobial agents ( chloramphenicol), in addition to agents that soften ear wax (e.g. carbamide peroxide).Can be given from a squeeze bottle or a dropper
- Never insert the tip of the dropper into the inner ear or touch any part of the ear with it

\section*{4. Nasal Administration:}
${ }^{-}$It provides a rapid systemic delivery of therapeutic agents (whilst avoiding first-pass metabolism).
- Examples include the treatment of migraine (ergot alkaloids, sumatriptin), diabetes insipidus (desmopressin), prostate cancer/endometriosis (gonadotrophin analogues) and smoking cessation (nicotine).
b) Inhalation (Pulmonary Route)

Drugs are gaseous and volatile agents and aerosols inhaled as vapor or sprays e.g. asthma medications Advantages
${ }^{-}$Rapid onset of action due to rapid access to circulation. Fastest method, 7-10 seconds for the drug to reach the brain
${ }^{-}$It allows the dose to be controlled more effectively
${ }^{-}$User can titrate (regulate the amount of drug they are receiving)
Disadvantages
${ }^{-}$Its a slower route of action, it has to be taken into the lungs, and then travels to the systemic circulation from there.

\section*{Forms of Drugs}

Broadly classified to solids, liquids, semi - solids and gaseous form

\section*{SOLIDS}
- Tablet: They are usually cylindrical in shape and are used for oral administration

Caplets: A tablet in oval shape

Capsule: Medication enclosed in a gelatinous material/ shell. Can be powder form, gel etc. It is colored to aid in identification. They dissolve in GIT

Lozanges: They melt in the mouth e.g. vicks kingo

Pill: Used to refer to capsule, tablets and caplets though the real pill is round in shape

\section*{LIQUIDS}
${ }^{-}$Elixir: Medications in clear liquid designed for oral use. They are different from syrups as they contain very little sugar.

Syrup: Medications dissolved in sugar containing solutions. May also contain flavoring to make them more palatable

Suspension: Liquid medications that contain particles dispersed or suspended in them. When left to stand, particles settle at the bottom therefore should be shaken before administering

Solution: Drugs dissolved in other substances can be given orally, rectally, parentally or topically

Lotion: Liquid applied on the skin surfaces

\section*{SEMI - SOLIDS}

Spray and Aerosols: Used on skin conditions.

Gases/Inhalers: Used for respiratory conditions

Gels: Semisolid emulsions that become liquid when applied to the skin or scalp. Useful in acute dermatitis in which there is weeping exudate

Creams: May be suspensions of oil in water or emulsions of water in oil, with a additional ingredients. Are used on skin conditions for their moisturizing and emollient effects.

Pastes: Mixtures of powders and ointments and are used on skin conditions

Ointments: Reduce water loss, lubricate and protect skin.

\section*{Drug Administration}

Administration involves all activities related to safe drug use which are key nursing responsibilities include:
"Assessing the risk to a patient of a new drug order
"Delivering the drug dose to the proper body tissues
"Assessing the patient's response to drug therapy
"Treatment of adverse reactions to drugs
"Consultation with the doctor about adjusting the prescribed regimen
"Educating the patient about the proper use of drug substances
- The nurse administering the drug should know the name, dose, preparation, route of administration, side effects and therapeutic effects of the drug
- She should know the condition of the patient and the suitability of that medication at that given time

\section*{GUIDELINES FOR SAFE DRUG USE}
${ }^{-}$Pay attention during the procedure
- Read the label carefully and compare with the treatment sheet
-Appropriate container should be used to measure medication
${ }^{-}$Always chart drugs immediately after giving, never before
- Never give drugs from unlabeled containers
- Be familiar with commonly used abbreviations
- Observe five (5) rights of drug administration

Five Rights (5Rs) of Drug Administration Accuracy in drug administration depends on five factors:
-The right drug
-The right dose
-The right patient
- The right route and the right time

\section*{1. THE RIGHT DRUG}
${ }^{-}$To ensure that you have used the right drug, you must check and double check the package label and the cardex and the treatment sheet.
- You MUST prepare the medications you give yourself and do not administer drugs prepared by someone else.
- You should recheck the order, the label and the treatment sheet if a client questions the medication. A mentally alert client will notice a change in medication or mention problems that have arisen from the medication.
-Do not ignore statements or questions regarding medication from a client.

\section*{Precautions when administering medicine}
${ }^{-}$All doses are best prepared from the original container
- Medicines should not be prepared in the dark. Good illumination is necessary for positive identification
- Caution clients about the use of non labeled pillboxes
${ }^{-}$Do not to mix supplies of several tablets or capsule in a single container
- Make sure you check medication labels when removed from the shelf, before pouring or measuring and when returning to the shelf
Note: The person who administers the medication

\section*{2. THE RIGHT PATIENT/CLIENT}
${ }^{-}$Ensure that the right client receives the right drug.
Drugs should only be given to the person for whom they are prescribed or recommended for.
${ }^{-}$If the patient is wearing an identification bracelet, check the client's name on their identification bracelet with the name on the treatment sheet.
${ }^{-}$If the patient is conscious and sane, simply call out the patient's name. This check is essential to avoid errors.
Stay there until the patient swallows the drug if oral to ensure they do not default

\section*{3. THE RIGHT DOSE}
- To obtain the right dose, you must carefully measure the medicine.
- Use the proper technique for pouring solid drugs such as capsules and tablets in order to minimize handling of the drugs.
- Pour the medication into the container's cap, and then transfer the required number of units in the dose from the cap to the medication cup/spoon.
${ }^{-}$If you require half of a tablet, a scored tablet may be cut into two pieces with a knife edge/scalpel (small tablets) or folded in clean paper and broken with the fingers (large tablets).
${ }^{-}$Do not attempt to split non scored tablets or to divide the dose of a single capsule.
- When you split tablets, give the two halves in successive doses, so that any deviation from the prescribed dose due to uneven breakage is leveled out as quickly as possible.
- Do not break all the tablets available and mix the halves.
- Liquids should be measured in a container with a scale that provides a mark for the required dose, for example, plastic or glass medicine measures or spoons.
Note: If the dose ordered is not right for the patient, consult with the physician before

\section*{4. THE RIGHT TIME}
${ }^{-}$Administer all drugs at the right time - A +/-30 minutes allowance is acceptable
${ }^{-}$Be conversant with the hospital policy of drug administration
Note: Under normal circumstances the right time for drug administration is not indicated by the doctor. The doctor only indicates the number of times a day a drug is to be given. For example, the doctor might state:
"The hourly interval between doses
"The relation of the dose to the client's activity patterns, such as, before or after meals, on rising or retiring or every 4 hours, 6 hours or 12 hours

\section*{5. RIGHT ROUTE}
- The right route must be used for drug delivery.
- Most medicines are taken orally or by topical application.
${ }^{-}$Ensure that the client understands how the drug is to be taken. Sublingual or chewable tablets should not be swallowed whole.
Crush oral drugs, if swallowing is difficult or if they are to be taken in liquid form.
- Demonstrate to the client procedures for application of topical drugs.
${ }^{-}$Always check the doctor's orders and the cardex or treatment sheet to verify the medication route.
Alert the doctor if the route is not in accord with that which is recommended for the drug preparation.

Note: Giving medication by the wrong route can cause death. The person who administers the drug is held responsible.

\section*{MEDICATION ERRORS}
- Medication errors continue to be a serious problem in many health institutions despite the elaborate rituals used in administering drugs.
- Errors are determined in relation to the five rights of correct administration.
-Common errors include a wrong drug, an incorrect dose, the wrong patient, the wrong route used, drug given at the wrong time and the incompatibility of conversion factors used in calculating doses.

They may arise at any step in the process from the physician's order to the delivery of the dose to the patient.

\section*{Incase an Error occurs:}
- Report an error immediately it occurs. This helps to protect both the patient and the nurse.
- Fast reporting of medication errors means that emergency measures can be taken and undesirable complications may be prevented.

\section*{RECORDING AND PRESCRIBING OF DRUG}

Medical Instructions should be written by the doctor, except in areas where there is none like in health centers or dispensaries.
-Telephone Medical Instructions and verbal Medical Instructions are ONLY permitted under certain circumstances e.g. if the physician is scrubbed up for a surgical procedure, the Medical Instructions may be written by a nurse, provided it is countersigned by the doctor as soon as possible.
If any part of the order appears inappropriate, contact the doctor to correct any mistakes that may have been made.
- Drug orders should always include:
- The name of the patient
- The name of the drug
- The dose
- The route of administration
- The frequency or timing
- Always ask the doctor to verify the route desired if no route has been specified.
- The handwriting of many doctors may not legible. If there is doubt about any element of a drug order, oral verification must be sought from the doctor involved.

\section*{DRUG MEASUREMENTS}

There are three systems used to measure drugs:
1. Household Measurements

Uses containers commonly used at home
-A teaspoonful is approximately 5 ml
-A tablespoonful is approximately 10 ml
-A teacupful is approximately 150 ml
${ }^{-}$A tumblerful is approximately 250 ml
2. Apothecary

This was used in ancient times and included drums and ounce

\section*{3. Metric}

Most commonly used and is based on milligrams, grammes, millilitres, litres, megaunits
"1000 micrograms(mcg) = 1 milligram (mg)
" 1000 milligrams ( mg ) = 1 gramme ( g )
"1000 grammes (g) = 1 kilogram (kg)
" 1000 millilitres ( ml ) $=1$ litre (L)
"1000000 megaunits (mu) = 1 unit

\section*{ABBREVIATIONS}

OD - Once daily (Mostly in the morning)
BD or BID - Twice a day
TDS or TID - Three times a day

\section*{Administration}

\section*{ASSIGNMENT:}

Get the procedure of the following routes of drug administration from the handout
- Oral drug administration
- Injectable drug administration from the handout.
- Ophthalmic drug application
-Ear drug administration
- Nasal drug administration

\section*{OPHTHALMIC APPLICATION}

Requirements
-Medicine with dropper
- Cotton wool or tissue
- Wash basin with warm water and a wash cloth
- Eye pads if necessary
- Examination gloves
- Patient's charts

\section*{Steps}
- Counter - check the medicine with the treatment sheet
${ }^{-}$Identify the patient and explain the procedure to the patient
- Wash hands
- Put on gloves and goggles if necessary
- Clean eyes using cotton balls one for each eye
-Wipe from medial canthus to the lateral canthus to avoid infection of the lacrimal ducts
- If the eyes have dried secretions, place a damp cloth/ cotton ball for a few minutes to loosen them

Ask the patient to lie in supine position or tilt the head if seated. This position facilitates instillation of medication
With tissue / wash towel resting below the lower lid, gently press down the bony orbit retracting the lower lid using the thumb or forefinger. This exposes the conjunctiva sac allowing proper administration.

\section*{Giving Eye Drops}

Check the bottle to ensure it is the right medication for the patient
Ask the patient to look up, this reduces blinking reflexes and lifts cornea away

Instill the prescribed drops into the center of the inverted lower lid, then press gently in the inner canthus. This blocks the lacrimal glands hence protects the drug from entering into it.
- Instruct the patient to close the eyes and apply gentle pressure on the eyelids. This helps to distribute the medicine
- Wipe off any excess medication using cotton wool
- Remove gloves and wash hands
- Return medication to their proper store then document

\section*{Application of Ointment}
- Before administration wipe the tube with a clean cotton ball and discard some little ointment. This preserves/ensures sterility of the drug
- Apply ointment inside the lower lid from inner to outer canthers
${ }^{-}$Do not touch the eye with the tip
- Ask the patient to blink several times to aid in distribution of the medicine
- Use cotton ball or tissue to wipe away any excess medication

EAR ADMINISTRATION
Requirements
- Disposable tissue/cotton/gauze
- Gloves
- Medications
- Patient's charts
- Medicine

Steps
- Counter - check the patient's treatment sheet with the medication
${ }^{-}$Identify the patient and explain the procedure to the patient
- Wash hands and dry them
- Put on gloves
${ }^{-}$Ask the patient to lie on the side with the affected ear uppermost
${ }^{-}$Remove excess drainage with a dry wipe but if there are dry secretions, use a damp warm wash cloth
${ }^{-}$Expose the ear canal by adjusting the ear lobes. For adults pull ear lobes back and out, for children straighten back and for infants straighten down and back
- Hold the dropper above the opening of the external auditory meatus

Allow the medication to drop on the side of the canal, because the tympanic membrane can get irritated once medication is instilled on it
Instill the recommended drops
Instruct the patient to lie in that position for 5 10 minutes. This allows medication to be retained in the canal
If medication is prescribed for both ears allow 15 minutes after instilling the $1^{\text {st }}$ ear before turning the patient. This allows retention of medication for maximum therapeutic effect
Remove gloves, wash hands, store equipment properly and document

\section*{NASAL ADMINISTRATION}

\section*{Requirements}
- Medicine with dropper
- Face towel and a wash cloth
-Small pillow
- Patient's charts

\section*{Steps}
- Counter - check the medicine with the physician's order and confirm the sinus affected
${ }^{-}$Identify the patient and explain the procedure to the patient
- Wash hands and put on gloves
- Inspect the condition of the nose sinus by palpating for tenderness. These findings will provide the baseline to assess the effect of the medicine
Clean of any discharge if present
- Request patient to blow the nose gently because the secretions/mucus will affect the effectiveness of the drug
- Administer the nasal drops while the patient is lying supine and breathing through the mouth Administer by holding the dropper 1 cm above the nostril and instill the prescribed drops
- Have the patient remain in the supine position for 5 minutes to retain the medicine
- Offer face towel/tissue to vault/block the running nose and instruct the patient not to blow the nose
- Position the patient comfortably
- Dispose soiled disposable items
- Wash hands and dry them
- Document
- After 30 minutes check the patient's condition to observe for side effects and therapeutic effects

\section*{Ordering of Drugs}

This mostly depends on individual institution policy. However, there are two recognized methods:
1. Manual

Nurses order by writing in an ordering book, takes it to the pharmacy and collects the drugs back to the ward
-The nurses can also go collect the drugs using the patient's files
2. Automated/Computerized

Drugs are ordered through computers, then the nurse can go for the drugs from the pharmacy or they are delivered to the ward by straps or chains that are onerated hy machine

\section*{Storage and Handling of Drugs}

\section*{Guidelines}
- All drugs storage facilities should be lockable and should remain locked while not in use
$\triangleright$ All medicine should have a clear label
- Controlled drugs should be kept under double lock and key
${ }^{-}$Drugs close to expiry should be used first
- New stock should never be mixed with old stock
${ }^{-}$All medicine should be kept in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions

\section*{PRESERVATION}
${ }^{-}$Drug substances require careful storage and handling to maintain their safety and potency.
${ }^{-}$All drugs must be kept in a special place and secured from access by unauthorized persons.
${ }^{-}$Storage areas should be kept clean, orderly, cool and dry. This is because chemical deterioration is enhanced by heat, moisture and light. Water dissolves solid drugs and heat melts the waxy bases of suppositories and ointment.

Protect sterile substances from bacterial contamination. Inspect stocks periodically, and discard any drugs whose recommended shelf life has expired or that have changed in appearance.

\section*{CONTAINERS}

Drugs are best kept in their original containers. Note that copying labeling may result in transcription errors. Use original containers that protect their contents e.g. light sensitive compounds are packed in amber bottles or in containers that filter out much of the harmful radiation.
- Do not transfer sterile substances from container to container as it increases the probability of contamination. Protect the label from soiling to ensure it remains legible.
Note: Safe drug use requires that medicines have clear, accurate labels at all times.

\section*{DISPENSING /SUPPLY}

There are three systems
1. Stock Supply
- Nurse orders large number quantity of medication and keeps them in the ward in a drug cup - board.
${ }^{-}$An inventory book is kept for this medication
${ }^{-}$It is ideal for drugs that are used often and for emergency drugs
2. Self-administration system
${ }^{-}$The drug is kept by the patient who may be instructed on how to take or the nurse administers them
3. Unit dose
- The ward receives only a 24 hour dose for short term medications, for a few days or long - term medication
- Drugs are issued to a specific patient hence bear the patient's name

\section*{Drug Interactions}

This is when an interactant chemical modifies the therapeutic results that are anticipated with a drug. The interactant may be:
"Another drug
"Some combination of drugs
"Natural or artificial chemical components of the diet
"Pollutant chemicals from the environment
"Endogenous body chemical
Chemicals used for diagnostic laboratory tests

Chances of a drug interaction increase with the number of drugs the patient is taking or when the patient consults more than one physician and a variety of medications are prescribed.
Drug interactions are varied. They may be beneficial or detrimental, and may vary from person to person.
- They may be of major clinical significance or of no clinical significance.
They may affect absorption, distribution metabolism or excretion of drugs.

\section*{Drug Reactions}

\section*{ADVERSE REACTIONS}
${ }^{-}$Adverse reactions to drugs vary in the length of time to develop.
-Some become apparent immediately, others appear weeks or months later.
-They may range from mild to catastrophic in severity.
-They can affect any tissue or organ.

\section*{TOXIC REACTIONS}

Note: Any physiologically active drug has the potential to cause an undesirable reaction that may induce illness in the recipient.
-Hence there is no useful drug that is completely devoid of toxic potential.

\section*{SIDE EFFECTS}

\section*{ALLERGIC REACTIONS}
- They are the result of the body's immunologic response to a drug following previous exposure to that same drug.
${ }^{-}$Allergic reactions do not occur during the first exposure to a drug.
${ }^{-}$Account for up to $10 \%$ of all drug reactions.
- May be triggered by the drug in its unchanged form, by a drug metabolic, or by inert ingredients used in drug manufacture.

\section*{IDIOSYNCRATIC REACTIONS}
-They are defined as genetically determined, unexpected responses to a drug.
- The response may take the form of extreme sensitivity to low doses or extreme insensitivity to high doses to the drug.

\section*{CHAIN REACTIONS}
- Medications are often added to a regimen to control side effects of other drugs.
-This can initiate a chain reaction

\section*{CUMULATIVE REACTIONS}
-Drugs accumulate in the body whenever the dosage exceeds the amount the body can eliminate through metabolism or excretion.
- This can result to reaction

\section*{TOLERANCE AND DEPENDENCE}
- Habitual use of drugs may create a tolerance to the drug in use, as well as other related drugs.
${ }^{-}$This can also produce physical dependence.
- The dependent individual will develop signs and symptoms of illness when the drug is withdrawn..

\section*{Inhalation}
${ }^{-}$Is the act of breathing in
${ }^{-}$It is also used as a route of drug administration through which a substance in the form of gas, vapor or powder is administered

Inhaler (puffer): A medical device used for delivering medication into the body via the lungs. It is mainly used in the treatment of asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

\title{
TYPES OF INHALERS \\ 1. Metered-dose inhalers (MDI) \\ ${ }^{-}$An inhaler that delivers precise and premeasured dose of medication
}
${ }^{-}$It is the most common type of inhaler.
${ }^{-}$The aerosolized medication is drawn into the lungs by continuing to inhale deeply before holding the breath for 10 seconds to allow the aerosol to settle onto the walls of the bronchial and other airways of the lung.
2. Dry powder inhalers (DPI)
- Release a metered or device-measured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a DPI device.
2. Nebulizers
-They supply the medication as an aerosol created from an aqueous formulation.

\section*{ASSIGNMENT}

- Prepare a tent by draping the bed with bed sheets and by securing them with a safety pin. Ensure there are no gaps. An umbrella can be used.
Direct the kettle spout towards the tent
Provide the patient with a sputum bowl and encourage him/her to cough and expectorate
- If a kettle is to be used without a tent, use a small room and ensure the door and all windows are closed and have a thermometer kept in the room The steam can also be directed to the patient's mouth or nose via a cone covering the spout of the kettle. This should last for 30-60 minutes, two or three times a day
Alternatively, a jug can be filled with hot water and covered with a towel. The patient is then instructed to inhale through the towel
A basin of boiled water can be used instead of a jug/kettle for adults

Continue until the water cools
Never leave the patient alone when using the nelson inhaler
When done, leave the patient comfortable. Give the patient a sputum bowl
Clear, decontaminate and document

\section*{3. NEBULIZATION}
${ }^{-}$It is the administration of drugs in form of mist/ vapor or gas to patients using a nebulizer
Nebulizer: It is a device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs.
Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD and other respiratory diseases.
Nebulizers use oxygen, compressed air or ultrasonic power to break up medical solutions and suspensions into small aerosol droplets that can be directly inhaled from the mouthpiece of the device.
An aerosol is a "mixture of gas and liquid

\section*{MAINTENANCE OF FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE}
${ }^{-}$In normal situations, an individual’s fluid intake and output is balanced by maintaining hemostasis
- However under certain circumstances e.g. illness, intake/output is either increased or reduced resulting to fluid excess or deficit which need to be corrected

\section*{EXCESS FLUID}
${ }^{-}$The body has more fluid due to retention.
- Also called hypervolemia

\section*{Causes}
- Defective regulatory mechanism e.g. renal failure coronary heart disease
- Excessive administration of IV fluids
- Excessive administration of sodium (Na+) either orally or through IV fluids
- The excess $\mathrm{Na}+$ can also result from stress from diseases or other physical trauma that causes aldosterone to produce ADH (ante - diuretic hormone) that cause Na and water retention
- Low protein levels

\section*{Clinical Manifestations}
-Swelling in the legs and arms (peripheral edema)
- Weight gain over a short period of time
- Slow emptying of peripheral vein

Distended neck veins
- Crackles and wheeze (altered breath sounds)
- Fluid in the abdomen (ascites).
- Eventually, the fluid enters the air spaces in the lungs, reduces the amount of oxygen that can enter the blood, and causes shortness of breath (dyspnea).
- Fluid can also collect in the lungs when lying down at night, possibly making nighttime breathing and sleeping difficult (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea)decreased hematocrit (volume of RBC in blood in \%)
- Bounding pulse
- Polyuria

\section*{FUID DEFICIT (HYPOVOLEMIA)}
${ }^{-}$This is where there is deficiency of water and electrolyte in the extracellular fluid

\section*{Causes}
${ }^{-}$Loses : Vomiting; Diarrhea; Polyuria; Fever; Excessive sweating
${ }^{-}$Third space fluid shift (entry of fluid in membranous cavities)
- Decreased intake e.g. anorexia
${ }^{-}$Inability to access fluid or take fluid

Clinical Manifestations
- Weight loss over a short period of time
- Reduced skin turgor
-Dry mucous membranes
- Postural/orthostatic hypotension
- Reduced urinary output
-Slow filling of peripheral veins
- Decreased temperature due to reduced metabolism and distribution
- Concentrated urine
${ }^{-}$Flat neck veins when patient is lying down
- Elevated blood urea nitrogen
- Altered level of consciousness
- Reduced central nervous pressure
- Slow capillary refill
- Weak rapid pulse

\section*{Management of Fluid Imbalance}
- Treat the cause
- Oral fluid administration e.g. Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS)
Oral glucose dissolved in water

\section*{Note:}
- The fluid shouldn't be irritable
- Always consider likes and dislikes
- Explain importance of taking fluid to the patient and give fluids at intervals
- Avoid cola and caffeinated fluids because they don't contain electrolytes and can cause diuresis

\section*{MONITORING INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS}

Infusions is administration of fluids to the body through veins
- Allows direct introduction of fluids directly into the blood stream through the vein
Intravenous (IV) fluids are those solutions instilled within the patient's vein.
They may include solutions of water and chemicals normally found within the body, dissolved medications or blood, blood extracts and blood substitutes.

\section*{INDICATIONS FOR INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS}
-To restore fluid balance quickly when a patient experiences a significant fluid loss
- To prevent fluid imbalance for a patient who is currently or potentially likely to experience a loss of body fluid
- To maintain fluid balance when the patient temporarily is unable to eat and drink
-To replace specific electrolytes or other chemicals such as water soluble vitamins
- To provide some measure of nutrition
- To administer medications
- To replace blood cells or specific components of blood

\section*{CATEGORIES OF INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS}

There are two categories of intravenous fluids: crystalloid or colloid solutions.

\section*{1. CRYSTALLOID SOLUTIONS}
${ }^{-}$They are a mixture of water and salt or sugar. The solutions are capable of passing through a semi - permeable membrane.
- They can be further sub-divided into isotonic, hypotonic and hypertonic solutions.
An isotonic solution contains an equal amount of dissolved crystals as normally found in plasma e.g. 0.9 \% saline (normal saline), $5 \%$ dextrose and Ringer's solution or lactated Ringer's.

A hypotonic solution contains fewer dissolved crystals than are normally found in plasma. It presents as a dilute solution in comparison to the fluid within and around cells e.g. $0.45 \%$ sodium chloride (Half Strength Darrow's) and $5 \%$ dextrose in 0.45 saline.

A hypertonic solution has a higher amount of dissolved crystals than present in plasma. Note: They are considered plasma expanders as they draw water into the intravascular compartment from the more dilute areas of water within the cells and interstitial spaces e.g. 10\% and 50\% dextrose

\section*{2. COLLOIDS}
-They are high molecular - weight solutions, which draw fluid into the intravascular compartment via oncotic pressure (pressure exerted by plasma proteins not capable of passing through membranes on capillary wall).
- They are plasma expanders, as they are composed of macromolecules, and are retained in the intravascular space
${ }^{-}$Examples: Albumin, Hetastarch, Pentastarch, Plasma and Dextran

Note:
${ }^{-}$Buffer solutions are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis.
-Lactated Ringer's solution also has some buffering effect.
- A solution more specifically used for buffering purpose is intravenous sodium bicarbonate.

\section*{VENIPUNCTURE}

It is the piercing of vein in order to gain access to blood stream

Sites of Venipuncture
$\triangleright$ Antecubital fossa
-Hand (dorsal aspect especially the metacarpal veins)
-Saphenous and femoral veins
- Median brachial vein
-Skull veins

\section*{Factors to consider when selecting a vein}

Superficial veins are easily located and are more accessible for puncture. Veins in the arm and hands are preferred to veins in the foot or leg.
Use veins in the arm or hand on the patient's non-dominant site. Avoid using an area of a vein that will compromise joint movement.
${ }^{-}$Avoid thin walled and scarred veins. They are difficult to enter. A normal vein is smooth, pliable and resilient.
- Use larger veins for infusing hypertonic solutions, those containing irritant medications, those administered rapidly and those that are thick or sticky.

\section*{INTRAVENOUS ACCESS}

\section*{Hypodermic Needles}
- The simplest form of intravenous access is by passing a hollow needle through the skin directly into the vein.
-This needle can be connected directly to a syringe (used either to withdraw blood or deliver its contents into the bloodstream) or may be connected to a length of tubing for infusion
- The most convenient site is often the arm, especially the veins on the back of the hand, or the median cubital vein at the elbow, but any identifiable vein can be used

It is necessary to use a tourniquet which restricts the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge.

Once the needle is in place, it is common to draw back slightly on the syringe to aspirate blood, thus verifying that the needle is really in a vein.

The tourniquet should be removed before injecting to prevent extravasation of the medication.

\section*{Peripheral Cannula}
-This is the most common intravenous access method.
${ }^{-}$Peripheral IV line consists of a short catheter (a few centimeters long) inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein (any vein not inside the chest or abdomen).
${ }^{-}$This is usually in the form of a cannula-overneedle device, in which a flexible plastic cannula comes mounted on a metal trocar.

Once the tip of the needle and cannula are located in the vein the trocar is withdrawn and discarded and the cannula advanced inside the vein to the appropriate position and secured. Blood may be drawn at the time of insertion.
- Any accessible vein can be used although arm and hand veins are used most commonly, with leg and foot veins used to a much lesser extent. In infants the scalp veins are sometimes used.

The caliber of cannula is commonly indicated in gauge, with 14 being a very large cannula (used in resuscitation settings) and 24-26 the smallest.

The most common sizes are 16-gauge (midsize line used for blood donation and transfusion), 18- and 20-gauge (all-purpose line for infusions and blood draws), and 22-gauge (all-purpose pediatric line).

12- and 14-gauge peripheral lines are capable of delivering large volumes of fluid extremely fast accounting for their popularity in emergency medicine. These lines are frequently called "large bores" or "trauma lines".

To make the procedure more tolerable for children medical staff may apply a topical local anesthesia for about 45 minutes beforehand.

The part of the catheter that remains outside the skin is called the connecting hub; it can be connected to a syringe or an intravenous infusion line, or capped with a heplock, a needleless connection filled with a small amount of heparin solution to prevent clotting, between treatments.
- Ported cannula have an injection port on the top that is often used to administer medicine.

\section*{CALCULATING INFUSION RATE}

Divide the Total number of milliliters to be given by the Hours in which the solution is to be infused Example Scenario
If 2400 mls of solution to be infused over a 24 hour period: $2400 \mathrm{mls} / 24$ hours $=100 \mathrm{mls}$ to infused per hour
Then determine the number of drops to be infused per minute by multiplying the Number of ml per hour with the drop factor and then dividing by 60 minutes
If 100 mls need to be infused per hour, and the intravenous equipment has a drop factor of 20 drops per 1 ml , then: $(100 * 20) / 60=33.3=33$ drops per minute

\title{
Flow Rate= \\ Amount (litres)*1000*drop factor \\ Hours *60
}

Calculate the flow rate of the following:
1. Mr K is to be infused 3 litres of IV fluids in 24 hours. Calculate the flow rate given the drop factor of 20 drops per minute.
2. Mrs M is to be infused 2.5 litres of IV fluids in 24 hours. Calculate the flow rate given the drop factor of 15 drops per minute.

\section*{Factors Influencing the Rate}
${ }^{-}$Length of the Tubing: The larger the tube, the slower the rate
-Height of IV fluids: The higher the fluid, the faster the rate
Position of cannula: Cannula next to a bone/ joint results to a lower rate
Position of the patient: Lying down position has a slower rate while sitting up has a faster rate
Size of the cannula: The larger the cannula, the faster the rate

\section*{Monitoring the Rate of Infusion \\ - Maintain the proper rate of flow}
- Make timely observations at least every hour to determine that the volume of intravenous solution is infusing according to schedule.
$>$ Label the container at points indicating the amounts that should be infusing hour by hour so that at a glance you are able to tell whether the solution is being infused at proper hourly rate.

\section*{Care of Patients}
-Maintain personal hygiene
- Maintain the infusion
${ }^{-}$Inspect and dress the vein puncture site
- Maintain aseptic technique when changing on the dressing the vein puncture site
- Take care when changing solution containers or infusion tubing
- Maintain the input/output chart
- Monitor for complications e.g. dyspnea, noisy breathing and coughing. Respiratory and cardiac problems are caused by circulatory overload.

Purpose of Input / Output Record
-Helps in decision making during fluid therapy
- Used to assess the effectiveness of medication e.g. diuretics
- Used to establish elimination pattern

Note:
Inputs include: Oral fluids and IV fluids
Outputs include: Urine, vomitus, bleeding, watery stool, wound drainage, suction secretions

\section*{Patient Education}
- Tell patient not to discard any urine or body fluid without notifying the nurse
${ }^{-}$Instruct the patient not to take anything per oral without informing the nurse
- Advise the patient to call the nurse if the IV fluids stop flowing or there is a leakage.

Observe the venipuncture site for following:
- A slow rate
- No flow of solution
${ }^{-}$Swelling in the area of the vein puncture site
${ }^{-}$A burning sensation
- Local pallor of the skin
- Coldness

If any of the above occur:
- Remove the needle/cannula and check for phlebitis, which may occur when a solution is irritating to the vein or the vein-puncture device remains in the same site for a prolonged period of time. This is evident by the area being red, warm, swollen and painful.
-Select a new site for introducing additional solution
${ }^{-}$Elevate the arm and place warm compresses over the area of inflammation for 20 to 30 minutes, three to four times a day for one to two

Notify the doctor if the fluid contained a drug that may cause injury to tissue

Avoid further use of vein
- Remove the vein-puncture device
- Restart the infusion in the opposite arm or head

Infection of the site may occur and could spread to other parts of the body through the blood stream. Evidence of infection includes:
-The site may appear red and puffy
- Purulent discharge may be present
- The patient may have a rise in temperature and/or chills

In the event of possible infection:
- Discontinue the infusion and notify the doctor
${ }^{-}$Apply aseptic technique when dressing the wound
- Take pus swab for culture and sensitivity

\section*{DISCONTINUING THE INFUSION}

Discontinue the infusion when the amount of ordered solution has been infused and no more is scheduled to follow.
To discontinue the infusion:
Clamp the tubing and remove the tape that held the dressing and vein-puncture device in place

Gently press a sterile dry gauze swab over the site of puncture

Remove the needle or catheter or cannula by pulling it out without hesitation following the course of the vein

Apply pressure to the injection site for 30 to 45 seconds while elevating the forearm. This technique helps to stop bleeding from the injection site.

Apply a small sterile dry gauze swab over the dressing and secure it firmly

Flex and extend the arm or hand several times to help the patient regain sensation and mobility in the area where the needle was located.
- Record the amount and the type of fluid infused during the current shift on the patient's fluid intake record.

Document and sign for the time of termination, the type of fluid and condition of the vein puncture site in the patient's care index. Remember to also give a verbal report.

\section*{BLOOD TRANSFUSION}
${ }^{-}$It is the process of receiving blood products into one's circulation intravenously.

Transfusions are used in a variety of medical conditions to replace lost components of the blood.
${ }^{-}$Blood can transfused either whole blood or only components of the blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, clotting factors, and platelets.

Purposes
${ }^{-}$To restore blood volume e.g. after excessive hemorrhage
${ }^{-}$To restore Hb level and RBCs in severe anemia
${ }^{-}$To restore leukocytes (WBCs)
${ }^{-}$To replace platelets and clotting factors (fresh frozen plasma)
${ }^{-}$To provide nutrition and reduce toxicity in case of poisoning

\section*{Principles of Therapy}

Blood transfusion therapy is limited to occasions when it is absolutely necessary and stringent screening techniques are used before transfusion begins.

Blood product procurement, storage, preparation, and testing are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, the American Association of Blood Banks, and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.

\section*{a) Blood Compatibility Antigens}
${ }^{-}$Are glycoproteins found on the surfaces of RBCs
- The ABO blood group system is clinically the most significant because $A$ and $B$ antigens elicit the strongest immune response.
${ }^{-}$The presence or absence of A and B antigens on the RBC membrane determines the person's ABO group

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline BLOOD GROUP & ANTIGEN ON RBCs & ANTIBODY IN PLASMA & APPROXIMATE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IN POPULATION \\
\hline A & A & Ant - B & 45\% \\
\hline B & B & Ant - A & 8\% \\
\hline AB & A and B & None & 3\% \\
\hline O & None & Ant - A and Ant - B & 44\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Antibodies \\ ${ }^{-}$Antibodies (or immunoglobulins) are proteins produced by B lymphocytes}
- Generally have a high degree of specificity, and interact only with the antigen that stimulated their production.
- The interaction of antibodies and antigens triggers an immune response, the humoral immune response which depends on the quantity of antibody and antigen.

\section*{b) Blood Transfusion Options}
i) Autologous Transfusion
${ }^{-}$This is when a patient is transfused his/her own blood
- Before elective procedures, the patient may donate blood to be set aside for later transfusion. Patients may donate one unit every 3 to 4 days up to 3 days prior to surgery provided hemoglobin is greater than $11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$.

Autologous RBCs can also be salvaged during some surgical procedures or after traumainduced hemorrhage by use of automated cellsaver devices or by manual suction equipment.

\section*{Autologous blood products must be clearly labeled and identified.}

It eliminates the risks of alloimmunization, immune-mediated transfusion reactions, and transmission of disease, making it the safest transfusion choice.

\section*{ii) Homologous Transfusion}
-Volunteer donors' blood products are assigned to patients randomly.
${ }^{-}$Before donation, volunteer donors receive information about the process, potential adverse effects, tests that will be performed on donated blood, post donation instructions, and education regarding risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and signs and symptoms.
-Donors are screened against eligibility criteria designed to protect donor and recipient

\section*{Blood Donor Eligibility Criteria}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Age & 18 years - 45 years \\
\hline Weight & > 50kgs \\
\hline Vitals & Afebrile, normotensive, pulse 50-100, blood pressure < $180 / 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ \\
\hline Hemoglobin level & $>12.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ \\
\hline History of travel & Travel, exposures, and past illnesses or events may defer or disallow blood donation (travel to malarial areas; blood transfusion or tattoo within 12 months; recent surgery or pregnancy; history of hepatitis or unexplained jaundice; history or most cancers, history of behaviors at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus) \\
\hline Immunizations & Recent attenuated and live vaccines generally result in deferral \\
\hline Illnesses & A variety of current illnesses may defer or disallow \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
iii) Directed Transfusion
${ }^{-}$Blood products are donated by a person for transfusion to a specified recipient.
${ }^{-}$This option may be used in certain circumstances (e.g. a parent who provides sole transfusion support for a child), but in general, no evidence exists that directed donation reduces transfusion risks.
c) Blood Product Screening Serology Testing
${ }^{-}$Assesses the compatibility of a particular blood product with the recipient before release of the blood product from the blood bank at determining the compatibility

The following are done:
${ }^{-}$ABO group and Rh type: Determines the presence of $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and D antigens on the surface of the patient's RBCs.
-Direct Coombs' test: Determines the antibody attached to the patient's RBCs.

Crossmatch (compatibility test): Detects agglutination of donor RBCs caused by antibodies in the patient's serum.

Indirect Coombs' test: Identifies lower molecular weight antibodies (IgG) directed against blood group antigens.

\section*{Screening for Infectious Diseases}
${ }^{-}$Hepatitis: tests for the presence of hepatitis B core and surface antibodies and hepatitis $C$ viral titer.
${ }^{-}$HIV-1 and HIV-2: tests for prior exposure to the virus.
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV): tests for the antibody against CMV
${ }^{-}$Syphilis: tests for the presence of antibody against the spirochete.

Bacteria: contamination may occur during and after collection of blood. Hence maintain a sterile technique during phlebotomy and blood processing procedures, correct storage techniques, visual inspection of blood products, and limitation on shelf life.

Other infections that may be transmitted via blood transfusions e.g. malaria

\section*{Whole Blood and Blood Components}

\section*{WHOLE BLOOD}
- Consists of RBCs, plasma, plasma proteins, and approximately 60 mL anticoagulant/preservative solution in a total volume of approximately 500 ml .
${ }^{-}$Indications include acute, massive blood loss of greater than $1,000 \mathrm{~mL}$, requiring the oxygencarrying properties of RBCs and the volume expansion provided by plasma.

\section*{PACKED RED BLOOD CELLS(RBCs)}
${ }^{-}$Consist primarily of RBCs, a small amount of plasma, and approximately 100 mL anticoagulant/preservative solution in a total volume of approximately 250 to $300 \mathrm{~mL} /$ unit .
-Indications include restoration or maintenance of adequate organ oxygenation with minimal expansion of blood volume.
${ }^{-}$Dosage: Average adult dose administered is 2 units; pediatric doses are generally calculated as 5 to $15 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{kg}$.

\section*{PLATELET CONCENTRATES}
- Consist of platelets suspended in plasma.
- Platelets may be obtained by centrifuging multiple units of whole blood and expressing off the platelet-rich plasma (multiple-donor platelets) or from a single volunteer platelet donor using automated cell separation techniques (apheresis).

Indications include prevention or resolution of hemorrhage in patients with thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction.

Dosage: Average dose is generally 1 unit of platelets for each 10 kg of body weight; however, patients who are actively bleeding or undergoing surgical procedures may require more.

\section*{PLASMA (FRESH OR FROZEN PLASMA)}
- Consists of water (91\%), plasma proteins including essential clotting factors (7\%), and carbohydrates ( $2 \%$ ). Each unit is the volume removed from a unit of whole blood (200 to 250 mL ).
- May be stored in a liquid state or frozen within 6 hours of collection.

Indications include treatment of blood loss or blood clotting disorders related to liver disease and failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), over-anticoagulation with warfarin, all congenital or acquired clotting factor deficiencies.
- Dosage: Depends on the clinical situation and assessment of prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, or specific factor assays.

\section*{Transfusion Reactions}
- Every transfusion of blood components can result in an adverse effect. Reactions can be acute or delayed.
- Because reactions may exhibit similar clinical manifestations, every symptom should be considered potentially serious and the transfusion should be discontinued until the cause is determined.

When an acute reaction is suspected, the following should be done:
- The health care provider should be notified immediately and blood bags with tubing from all products recently transfused should be returned to the blood bank for evaluation.
- Take a clotted blood sample to examine serum for hemoglobin and confirm RBC group and type.
- The first voided urine sample to test for hemoglobinuria.

An anticoagulated blood sample for a direct Coombs' test to determine the presence of antibody on the RBCs.

Precautions must be taken to avoid the hemolysis of RBCs during venipuncture and sample collection because this could lead to invalid test results.

Whenever possible, blood samples should be drawn from a fresh venipuncture and not from existing needles or catheters.

\section*{a) ACUTE REACTIONS}

These may occur during the infusion or within minutes to hours after the blood product has been infused. They include:

\section*{1. Allergic Reactions}
- Occur as a result of sensitivity to plasma protein or donor antibody reacting with the recipient antigen
- Clinical manifestations: Flushing, Itching, Rash, Hives, Asthmatic wheezing, Laryngeal edema, Anaphylaxis

\section*{Management:}

Stop transfusion immediately. Keep vein open (KVO) with normal saline. Notify other health care providers and blood bank.
- Give antihistamine as directed
- Observe for anaphylaxis prepare epinephrine if respiratory distress is severe.
If hives are the only clinical manifestations, the transfusion can sometimes continue at a slower rate.
-Send blood samples and blood bags to blood bank. Collect urine samples for testing.

\section*{Prevention:}
- Proper history taking so that incase of past history of anaphylaxis, be alert, have emergency drugs available, and remain at bedside for the first 30 minutes.

\section*{2. Febrile, Nonhemolytic Reactions \\ ${ }^{-}$Result from hypersensitivity to donor white blood cells, platelets, or plasma proteins}
> - Clinical manifestations: Sudden chills and fever, Headache, Flushing, Anxiety

\section*{Management:}
-Stop transfusion immediately and KVO with normal saline. Notify other health care providers and blood bank.
-Send blood samples and blood bags to blood bank. Collect urine samples for testing.
Check temperature $1 / 2$ hour after chill and as indicated thereafter.
- Give antipyretics as prescribed and treat symptomatically.

\section*{3. Septic Reactions}
${ }^{-}$Result from transfusion of blood or components contaminated with bacteria.
- Clinical manifestations: Rapid onset of chills, High fever, Vomiting, diarrhea, Marked hypotension

\section*{Management:}
-Stop transfusion immediately and KVO with normal saline. Notify other health care providers and blood bank.
- Obtain cultures of patient's blood and return blood bags with administration set to blood bank for culture.
${ }^{-}$Treat septicemia as directed (antibiotics, I.V. fluids, vasopressors, steroids)

\section*{Prevention:}

Do not permit blood to stand at room temperature longer than necessary. Warm temperatures promote bacterial growth.
> ${ }^{-}$Inspect blood for gas bubbles, clotting, or abnormal color before transfusion
- Complete infusions within 4 hours. Change administration set after 4 hours of use.

\section*{4. Circulatory Overload}
${ }^{-}$Result from fluid administered at a rate or volume greater than the circulatory system can accommodate.
${ }^{-}$This causes increased blood in pulmonary vessels and decreased lung compliance.
- Clinical manifestations: Rise in venous pressure, Distended neck veins, Dyspnea, Cough, Crackles at base of lungs

\section*{Management:}
-Stop transfusion and KVO with normal saline. Notify other health care providers.
- Place patient upright with feet in dependent position.
${ }^{-}$Administer prescribed diuretics, oxygen, morphine, and aminophylline.

\section*{Prevention:}
- Concentrated blood products should be given whenever possible.
- Transfuse at a rate within the circulatory reserve of the patient.
- Monitor central venous pressure of patient with heart disease.
5. Hemolytic Reactions
${ }^{-}$Result from infusion of incompatible blood products
- Clinical manifestations: Chills; fever; Lower back pain; Feeling of head fullness; flushing; Oppressive feeling; Tachycardia, tachypnea; Hypotension, vascular collapse; Hemoglobinuria, hemoglobinemia; Bleeding; Acute renal failure

${ }^{-}$Draw testing samples, collect urine sample.
- Maintain blood pressure with I.V. colloid solutions. Give diuretics as prescribed to maintain urine flow, glomerular filtration, and renal blood flow.
Insert indwelling catheter to monitor hourly urine output. Patient may require dialysis if renal failure occurs.

\section*{Prevention:}
- Meticulously verify patient identification from sample collection to product infusion.
${ }^{-}$Begin infusion slowly and observe closely for 30 minutes (consequences are in proportion to the amount of incompatible blood transfused).

\section*{b) DELAYED REACTIONS}
- Delayed reactions occur days to years after the transfusion.
- Include delayed hemolytic reactions, iron overload (hemosiderosis), Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis B, hepatitis C, CMV, Epstein-Barr virus, malaria, HIV,).

FEEDING PATIENTS
${ }^{-}$It is the responsibility of a nurse to ensure nutritional needs of all patients are met
- This may involve preparation, serving and feeding depending on the hospital policy
- Nutrition is a vital component in management of many conditions

Diet is categorized into two categories:
- Normal diet
- Modified diet
1. Normal Diet
${ }^{-}$It is normally taken with no modification.
However it should be balanced
${ }^{-}$It is the most frequently ordered diet
${ }^{-}$The patient should be able to choose food of their choice
2. Modified Diet
${ }^{-}$Food can be altered to meet various goals e.g. suit activity, due to culture and religion and to meet therapeutic needs
${ }^{-}$When food is altered to meet health needs, it is referred to as therapeutic diet

\section*{Reasons for Giving Therapeutic Diet}
- Rising or reducing body weight
- Regulate amount of certain nutrients in some disease
${ }^{-}$Aiding in digestion, malabsorption and maldigestion
- Eliminating food that the body can not tolerate e.g. allergic conditions
Therapeutic diet can be modified in the following ways:
${ }^{-}$According to Texture: Liquid; Normal diet; Soft ${ }^{-}$According to Constituent of Nutrients: High protein; Carbohydrates; Low Calcium
- Accordino to Energy Content - Low calories•
1. MODIFICATION ACCORDING TO TEXTURE
a) Liquid Diet
- These are foods that are liquid at room temperature.
- Mostly used in post - operative patients
${ }^{-}$Also indicated in patients with difficulty in chewing
${ }^{-}$Easily absorbed
- Do not stimulate peristalsis, hence can be used in patients with diarrhea

They include:
i) Clear Liquid
- Contains inadequate calories.
- Patient receiving this diet should be given nutritional supplements. They shouldn't be given this diet for more than three days
${ }^{-}$Examples: Fruit juices, Beverages, Water, Dextrose

\section*{ii) Full Liquid}

Contains most nutrients though may be inadequate in fibre e.g. milk, commercially made liquid diet
${ }^{-}$It is indicated for transition after surgery to soft diet
b) Soft Diet

Is divided into two major categories, both of which are nutritionally adequate and mostly used for transition from liquid to normal diet
i) Digestive Soft Diet
${ }^{-}$Food is easily digested and easily absorbed.
Contains less fat, less fibre and no seasoning.
-Should contain protein but in less amounts
ii) Mechanically Soft Diet
${ }^{-}$Little or no chewing is required.
- Used in patients with difficulty in chewing
- Foods are chopped or blended before being given to patients

\section*{2. MODIFICATION ACCORDING TO CONSTITUENT OF NUTRIENTS}
a) Carbohydrate Controlled Diet
${ }^{-}$The amount of carbohydrates is reduced e.g. diabetes mellitus
${ }^{-}$A specific amount is recommended in such patients depending on blood glucose
-Some carbohydrates may be restricted e.g. In lactose intolerance

\section*{b) Fat Controlled Diet}
${ }^{-}$A low fat diet contains very little or no fats - Carbohydrates are given in such cases to provide energy
${ }^{-}$A diet can also be modified in types of foods and patients are discouraged from taking saturated fats, which are common in animal fats as they increase risk of cardiovascular disease
${ }^{-}$A high fat diet (ketogenic diet) contains high levels of fats is indicated for patients with seizures. It is unfit for patients with malabsorption and pancreatic disease. In such cases, a low fat diet is used

\section*{c) Protein Modified Diet}
- High protein diet used in patients who require tissue repair or those in active growth (children, neonates, adolescence), patients with burns and those who have undergone major surgery
${ }^{-}$Low protein diet (restricted protein diet) mostly prescribed in patients with liver and some kidney disorders
${ }^{-}$A specific type of protein may also be restricted in some conditions e.g. gluten in cases of celiac disease
d) Electrolyte Modified Diet
i) Sodium Restricted Diet

Indicated in patients with cardiovascular disease and renal disease
Mild Restrictions
- Patient should take 3000-4000 mls/day
-Salt can be added when cooking in little amount.
No salt addition on the table
Moderate Restrictions
-Patient should take 1000-2000 mls/day
- No salt should be added while cooking nor on the table

\section*{Strict Restrictions}
- Patient shouldn't take more than 50 mls . No salt addition to food and any salty foods are eliminated from the diet
${ }^{-}$Used in severe hypertension
ii) Calcium Modified Diet
${ }^{-}$It is increased in osteoporosis and reduced in urinary tract stones e.g. renal stones
iii) Phosphorus Modified Diet
${ }^{-}$It is reduced in patients with renal failure
iv) Potassium Modified Diet
-Increased in patients taking diuretics and reduced in patients with kidney failure
e) Fibre Modified Diet

Can be high fibre diet (high fibre content) or low fibre diet (low fibre content).
Soluble fibre decreases amounts of cholesterol in blood and reduce transit time while insoluble fibre increases bulk in stool while increasing peristalsis
${ }^{-}$Low fibre diet is less stimulating to the GIT.
Indicated in severe diarrhea and post - operatively
f) Bland Diet
${ }^{-}$Indicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and gastritis.
${ }^{-}$It is high in calories but limits foods that stimulate gastro - intestinal tract to produce more acid

\section*{3. MODIFICATION ACCORDING TO ENERGY CONTENT}
a) High Calorie Diet
- Used for under nourished patients and those with increased thyroid function
${ }^{-}$Indicated in patients with burns and those undergoing major surgery since they need extra sources of energy
${ }^{-}$Has high contents of all nutrients
b) Low Calorie Diet
- Used to reduce weight especially in obese patients
${ }^{-}$Has low contents of all nutrients

\section*{METHODS OF FEEDING PATIENTS}
i) Self Feeding
- Patient is served but feeds self
ii) Oral Feeding
- Patient unable to feed self but can swallow. They are therefore assisted during feeds

\section*{iii) Tube Feeding}
${ }^{-}$Feeding is through a tube inserted through the nose or abdomen to GIT (nasal - gastric; nasal jejunal, gastrostomy)
Indicated in patients unable to swallow for various reasons

\section*{iv)Parenteral Feeding}
- Feeding via intravenous route

Points to Consider before Feeding Patients
- Make patients comfortable
- Give a bedpan or urinal before meals to prevent interruption
- Cover any wounds, blood or urine bags
- Remove all unnecessary items
- Avoid unpleasant drugs or painful injections during meals
${ }^{-}$Analgesics should be given 30 minutes before meals to ensure patient is pain free
-Position patients appropriately in Fowler's position unless the condition doesn't allow
- Serve food in small frequent feeds
- Fill glasses and cups $\frac{3}{4}$ full to avoid spilling the content
${ }^{-}$Be pleasant while serving food
- Take time to chat with the patient

\section*{Procedure of Serving Patients who can Feed themselves}

\section*{Requirements}
${ }^{-}$Know the number of patients and those on special diet
${ }^{-}$Arrange food with covers on a trolley
- Take a bed table or a locker bedside

\section*{Steps}
- Wash hands
- Start from one corner of the ward and be alternating the starting side
${ }^{-}$Inform patients that food is available and allow them to make choices
- Explain to the patient the reason they are on a given diet
-Serve food on plates according to the patient's request
- Place it on the bed table/locker where the patient can reach with ease
- Apply serving guidelines
-When done, go round checking on patients who have not fed and enquire why
- When patients are done with eating, clear equipment and ensure they are washed

\section*{Oral Feeding}

Requirements
${ }^{-}$Food on a tray
- Utensils
- Mouth wash
- Feeding towel
- Cup of warm water

Preparation
- Wash hands and dry them
${ }^{-}$Position the patient

Steps
- Place the feeding towel on patient's chest
${ }^{-}$Using a spoon, give patient food, giving him/her time to chew and swallow
- Give him sips of water when he needs it
${ }^{-}$At the end of the meal, help patient wash the mouth
Leave patient comfortable
Clear the equipment

\section*{Parenteral Feeding}
-It is indicated when a patient is unable to meet nutritional needs orally due to mechanical or psychological problem or restriction
- It entails IV fluid administration and total parenteral nutrition
- Food is given directly through veins

\section*{TUBE FEEDING}

\section*{Indications}
- Unconscious patients or those unable to swallow - Oral trauma or surgery

\section*{Types of Tubes}

Nasal - Gastric Tube: Inserted through the nose to the stomach
Nasal-Jejunal Tube: Inserted through the nose to the jejunum
Gastric tube/Gastrostomy: Inserted through the abdominal wall to the stomach
-Jejunal Tube: Inserted through the abdominal wall to the jejunum

\section*{Nasal - Gastric Tube}

\section*{Indications}
- Feeding
- Drug administration
- Gastric lavage/washout
- Management of gastric retention
- Diagnostic purposes
- Pre - operative and post - operative management of gastric operations

\section*{ASSIGNMENT}

Write the procedures of the following the hand out:
- NG Tube Insertion and Feeding
- Aspiration
- NG Tube removal
- Gastric Lavage/Stomach Washout

\section*{Procedure of NG Tube Insertion and Feeding}

\section*{Requirements}

A tray containing the following:
- Gloves
- Towel - wet (face towel)
${ }^{-}$Bowl or kidney dish with nasal - gastric tube
-Lubricant in a gallipot
-20 ml and 50 ml syringes
-Spigot
- Receiver with blue litmus paper
-Strapping and scissors
-30 ml clean water

\section*{Additional for feeding}
${ }^{-}$Required feed in a jar in a bowl of warm water
- Towel
-Spoon

\section*{Steps}
- Greet the patient and explain the procedure
${ }^{-}$Screen the bed
${ }^{-}$Bring the set tray at bedside and place on the locker
${ }^{-}$In conscious put patient in upright position. If unconscious place patient in lateral position.
- Wipe the face with wet towel (flannel) and clean the nostrils if necessary
- Drape the patient's neck and chest with a towel
- Wash and dry hands and put on gloves
- Remove the tube from its sterile package and place it on sterile kidney dish
- Measure the length of the tube to be inserted from tip of nose to earlobe and down to xiphoid process (tip of sternum) identify the mark
- Lubricate the end of the tube
- Explain about insertion and request patient assist to hyperextend the head to allow the nurse visualize nasal passage for easier insertion

Pass the tube through the nostril and down the nasopharynx. When it touches the oral pharynx ask the patient to swallow it or give sips of water to help him swallow and prevent vomiting
- Look inside the patient's mouth to see if the tube is passing down
Pass the length as indicated by previously identified mark on the tube
Aspirate some stomach content, this confirms tube in stomach. If you are not sure test for acidity on blue litmus paper, which should turn red
- Other ways of confirming this is by:
- Using a syringe push 5 ml of air once and listen over epigastric area with a stethoscope, a whooshing sound indicates air in the stomach
- Immersing the free end tip of the tube in sterile water in a medicine measure, if air bubbles are observed, it indicates the tube is in the lungs Attach the spigot to the tube and secure with a strapping

\section*{Feeding}
${ }^{-}$If the tube is for feeding test the temperature of the feed and measure the amount to be used
${ }^{-}$Pinch the tube and remove the spigot
- Fix the syringe and pour 15 ml warm water into the barrel and allow it to run into the tube slowly
Pinch the tube when the water reaches the bottom of the syringe but it is still in the syringe
Pour the feed and allow to run slowly by gravity until the total feed has been given
- Cleanse the tube with the remaining water and pinch it before the water finishes to prevent air entry
- Spigot the tube and leave it well secured
- Remove towel from the neck and chest
- Thank the patient for co - operation and make him/her comfortable
- Enter the amount of feed and time of feeding in feeding/fluid chart
Note: A funnel may be used for feeding instead of a syringe
- For subsequent feeds aspirate stomach contents to determine the amount of feed retained
- If more than 15 ml is aspirated from an adult or 10 from an infant check with the in charge before proceeding with feeds
- Clear, decontaminate and clean the equipment and sore them appropriately for the next feed
- Wash and dry hands
- Report as necessary

Procedure of Aspiration
-This is the process of removing gastric content by suction and use of a syringe

\section*{Purposes}
- Relieve abdominal discomfort
- Maintain patency of the tube
- Maintain gastric decompression after surgery
-Measure and monitor gastric bleeding and feeds

\section*{Indications}
${ }^{-}$Poisoning and Bleeding ulcers
- Intestinal obstruction
- Before every subsequent feeds

\section*{Steps}
${ }^{-}$Pinch the tube, remove spigot and fix the syringe with a plunger and release the pinch
- Gently withdraw plunger of the syringe, this will cause content to come out
- When syringe is almost full, pinch tube again, remove syringe, replace spigot then release the pinch and empty syringe in a container
${ }^{-}$Repeat this process till no aspirate is drawn
- Leave patient comfortable and ensure spigot is in place
- Measure amount of aspirate and record in fluid chart
- Examine aspirate for content, color and smell
${ }^{-}$Record and report

\section*{Removal of NG Tube}

Requirements
-Mouthwash
- Receiver
- Gauze swabs

Steps
${ }^{-}$Explain procedure to the patient
-Flush the tube with $10-30 \mathrm{mls}$ of water
- Remove strapping
${ }^{-}$Remove 15 - 20 cm of the tube slowly. This ensures that the tube has reached esophagus
- Remove the remaining part as you guard it with a gauze
- Rationale for flushing with water is to remove any debris and release the tube from stomach lining
- As you remove, instruct the patient to hold the breath, this helps in closing the epiglottis
- Discard the tube and give the patient mouthwash
- Leave patient comfortable

\section*{Complications of Tube Feeding}
1. Mechanical Complications

These are problems associated with the tube. They include:
i) Tube Clogging
-This is blockage of tube by feeds or medication given
- Commonly occurs in smaller tubes and can be prevented by flushing the tube with warm water after every feed
${ }^{-}$If it occurs the tube should be removed and another one inserted

\section*{ii) Tube Dislocation}
-This is when tube changes location. It may move to the intestines or come out through the esophagus
-This can be prevented by proper anchoring of the tube
${ }^{-}$If it occurs, the tube should be repositioned properly
iii) Nasal Irritation
${ }^{-}$This is trauma caused by the tube.
${ }^{-}$It can be prevented by:
"Use of a lubricant during insertion
"Use of a small tube
"Pronerly securing it to prevent movement

\section*{iv) Aspiration Pneumonia}
- This is when gastric contents enters into the respiration system during feeding
- It may result from improper positioning of the patient; due to lack of cough reflex or due to incompetence of esophageal sphincters
${ }^{-}$It can be prevented by proper positioning of the patient; tube and elevating patient for at least 1 hour after feeds
If unconscious, place them in left lateral position
2. Metabolic Complications

Result due to change of diet. They include:
- Hypoglycemia
- Fluid electrolyte imbalance - aspiration and discarding the aspirates causes increased loss of electrolytes especially hydrogen
- Renal dysfunction - results from electrolyte imbalance and fluid deficit

\section*{3. GIT Complications}
-They include: Nausea; Vomiting; Infection; Diarrhea
${ }^{-}$They result from: Lack of fibre in diet; Poor fluid intake; Fast administration of feeds

\section*{4. Psychological Complications}
- The presence of tube especially in conscious patients causes psychological trauma and a feeling of worthlessness as it affects their body image

\section*{CATHETERIZATION}

A catheter is a tube made of vicryl or latex and is inserted into the urinary bladder to drain urine Catheterization is the process of inserting a catheter through the urethra into the urinary bladder for drainage of urine or instillation of drugs

\section*{TYPES OF CATHETERS}
1. According to Site
a) Urinary Catheter

Inserted through the urethral meatus into the bladder

\section*{b) Supra - pubic Catheter}

Inserted through an incision made at the supra pubic area into the bladder
It is used when there is obstruction of urethra or after urethral operation
c) Uridom/Uricondom

It is used in male patients to cover the penis.
It is an external male catheter used in patients with urinary incontinence

2. According to Duration
a) Straight or In and Out Catheter

Inserted to drain urine and removed immediately and discard

\section*{b) In-dwelling/Retention}
- The catheter remains in place for sometime and is anchored by an inflated balloon inside the bladder
- The most commonly used of Foley's catheter which contains two cavities, one for urinary out flow and the other for inflating the balloon
Others may have three or more cavities e.g. those used for bladder irrigation

\section*{Types of Urine Specimen \\ a) Random Specimen}
- This is collected at any time of the day and it is used for routine screening test
${ }^{-}$If voided at home, should reach the laboratory within 2 hours

\section*{b) Early Morning Specimen}
- Collected upon rising up before taking breakfast
- This is the time it is mostly concentrated and specimen is ideal for pregnancy diagnostic test (PDT)
c) Double Voided Specimen
${ }^{-}$The patient is instructed to empty bladder and take fluid if possible
- The patient then voids and a sample is then taken for testing
- This ensures the sample is fresh thus a valid indicator of current blood glucose or acetone
-Tests glucose and acetone
d) Clean Midstream Urine Specimen
${ }^{-}$It helps to avoid contamination of sample with urethral cells, mucus and micro - organisms
-Perineum is cleaned with antiseptic then patient voids into the toilet about 30 mls then into a container and the rest of the urine into the toilet
e) Admission Urine Specimen
${ }^{-}$A routine urine specimen collected on admission of a patient
f) 24hour Urine Specimen
- The patient's urine is collected over a 24 hour period and measured

\section*{3. Sterile Specimen}
${ }^{-}$If a patient doesn't have a catheter, catheterize, clamp the catheter for 30 minutes to allow urine to collect in the bladder
${ }^{-}$Using aseptic technique, swab the outside distal end of the catheter with antiseptic
- Insert a sterile needle and syringe and aspirate the required amount of urine
${ }^{-}$Empty the collected amount into the specimen container

\section*{4. 24 hour Urine Specimen}
- Give patient a container to void in
- Instruct the patient to collect all urine for 24 hours
- Have the patient void when the 24 hour period is about to begin and discard this urine since it was formed before the 24 hour period began
- Measure, record and keep all the urine voided for 24 hour period
${ }^{-}$Instruct patient to void a few minutes before the end of 24 hours. This ensures that the bladder is empty before the end of 24 hours
- The most appropriate time is 8am - 8am
- Label the specimen and send to the lab together with the request form

Note: Incase the patient is female and is having her menses, wash the genitalia, plug the vagina, collect the specimen and unplug the vagina immediately

\section*{STOOL}

It is examined for several reasons:
- To determine the presence of infection
-To observe for amount, consistency, content and color
- To identify parasites, either ova and cyst of the parasite
- To identify bacteria incase of infection

Characteristics of Stool
${ }^{-}$Brown in color but may change depending on diet
- Has characteristic odor
- Soft and formed
${ }^{-}$Contents include indigestible food, mucous,

\section*{Abnormalities of Stool}
- Constipation - Hard stool
-Diarrhea-Loose watery with increased frequency
- Bright red stool- Indicates bleeding in the rectum and lower colon
- Dark red (melena) stool - Indicates bleeding in upper GIT
- Black stool- Results from iron supplements

- For culture and sensitivity - to check micro organisms especially bacteria and determine which antibiotic is to be used

Note: Should be collected early in the morning before the patient takes breakfast. Patient should be given plenty of fluids the night before to help in expectoration as it makes sputum less viscous

WOUND DRESSING
${ }^{-}$A wound is any abnormal opening on the skin.
- Wound dressing is the process by which a wound is cleaned and a sterile dressing applied
- The purpose is to render the wound free from micro - organisms and enhance healing

Indications for Wound Dressing
-Surgical Incisions
${ }^{-}$Septic Wounds
- Pressure (decubitus) Ulcers
- Removal of stitches/staples/clips/drains

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF WOUNDS}

Wounds are classified based on various factors:
a) According to Intension
-Intentional Wounds: Occur out of will e.g. surgical wounds
b) According to Mechanism of Injury

Incised: Caused by a sharp object and have sharp edges e.g. surgical wounds
-Lacerated: Have rugged/uneven edges. They are caused by things like barbed wire
${ }^{-}$Abrasion: Results from rubbing of the skin against a surface
Contused: Result from a blunt force and are characterized by excessive damage to soft tissue
Puncture: Wounds that are deep into a tissue but with a small opening on a surface e.g. a bullet wound
c) According to Degree of Contamination

Clean Wound: Made using aseptic technique. It is usually sutured
Contaminated Wound: Occurred accidentally or surgically but there was a break of asepsis or spillage from GIT. Require cleaning with antiseptic before suturing
Infected Wound: Contaminated by disease causing micro - organisms

\section*{DRESSING}

This is the covering applied on a wound. They are made of three layers:
Contact Layer: Directly applied to the wound
Middle Layer: Absorbs secretion of the wound
Outer Layer: Holds/ secures the inner layers properly

\section*{Types of Dressing}
a) Dry-dry Dressing

Placed to protect the wound from contamination. Placed when dry and removed when dry unless the wound is oozing

\section*{b) Wet-dry Dressing}
-Dressing are soaked with normal saline solution and placed on the wound. They are left to dry then they are removed
-Tissue debris or necrotic tissue and drainage that sticks are removed with the dressing

\section*{c) Wet - wet Dressing}

Dressings are soaked in solution and remain wet until they are removed
- They provide moisture and warmth conducive for wound healing
-Thick secretions can also be made loose and removed

Advantages of Dressings
- Used to remove necrotic/ dead tissues
- Prevent invasion by micro - organisms
- Absorbs drainage
- Control bleeding
- Used to apply medication
- Promote healing by providing warmth and moisture
- Provide comfort
- Protect wound from injury and trauma
-Splint or immobilize the wound
- Lesser scar tissue formation

\section*{Disadvantages}
- Provide warmth and moisture which is a conducive environment for micro - organisms multiplication
- They hinder wound from direct observation
- Hinder activities like bathing, mobility and comfort of the patient
-Some patients are hypersensitive to some dressing materials e.g. adhesive tape
-They are expensive

OXYGEN THERAPY

This is the administration of oxygen as a medical intervention, which can be for a variety of purposes in both chronic and acute patient care. Oxygen is essential for cell metabolism, and in turn, tissue oxygenation is essential for all normal physiological functions.

\section*{Indications}
- Hypoxemia - Deficient oxygenation of the blood
- Hypoxia - Deficient oxygenation of body tissues
- Dyspnea
- Cardiovascular reasons for example shock; heart attack

\section*{OXYGEN SUPPLY SOURCES}
i) Oxygen Cylinders
- These are small and large cylindrical containers filled with oxygen.
ii) Oxygen Concentrators
-They are special devices that concentrate room air, compress it and extract oxygen providing at in substantially higher concentrations than available in ambient air
iii) Oxygen Strollers
-They are portable containers containing liquid oxygen

\section*{Oxygen Concentrators}

\section*{iv) Hyperbaric Chambers}
- They are chambers that provide oxygen at a higher concentration and higher atmospheric pressure. Can be used to treat air embolism, carbon monoxide poisoning and anaerobic infection for example gas gangrene and also during heart surgery

\section*{v) Piped / Walled Oxygen}

This is oxygen delivered through a piped system whereby a wall is fitted with outlets that are near each bed

\section*{Hyperbaric Chamber}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_09_26_2d87726915aefb74e05ag-0872.jpg?height=1378&width=2002&top_left_y=360&top_left_x=239)

\section*{Oxygen Delivery Devices}

They are classified into two groups:
${ }^{-}$High flow
- Low flow

LOW FLOW DEVICES
-They don’t provide a known oxygen concentration
-They are influenced by the patient's breathing patterns
${ }^{-}$They don't provide a constant oxygen concentration, part of which comes from the atmosphere
Examples: Nasal cannula; simple masks, partial rebreather mask, non - partial rebreather mask
a) Nasal cannula
- They have two tubes that are fitted into the nostrils.
${ }^{-}$Patients can feed and talk when on oxygen
Disadvantages
${ }^{-}$Can be irritating to the nostrils and lead to swelling especially when high flow is needed
- Can cause drying of the nostrils
b) Simple Mask
-Contains two holes or vents which patients exhale
-Patient draws air from the atmosphere through the same vents

\section*{c) Partial Rebreather Mask}
${ }^{-}$It is similar to a simple mask but has a reservoir bag which shouldn't collapse even during inspiration
${ }^{-}$To achieve this, the nurse should regulate the oxygen flow rate.
Oxygen enters the mask through a small opening inform of a tube that connects at junction between the mask and the bag
${ }^{-}$As patient inhales, gas is drawn from the bag, mask and room air
- As patient exhales, most of the gas is vented through the hole but a small percentage is collected in the bag

\section*{d) Non - Rebreather Mask}

Similar to rebreather mask except that they have two valves
${ }^{-}$The $1^{\text {st }}$ valve is located between reservoir bag and the base of the mask. It allows gas to move from the bag and oxygen source to the patient but hinders exhaled air from the patient and mask from moving to the back
${ }^{-}$The $2^{\text {nd }}$ valve is located at the vent and allows exhaled air to move outside the mask but hinder atmospheric air from getting into the mask during inspiration
e) Oral Pharyngeal Catheter
${ }^{-}$It is a tube or catheter inserted through the nostrils to the pharynx.
${ }^{-}$Should be used for a short period

\section*{HIGH FLOW DEVICES}
-These a provide a specific and constant concentration of oxygen
${ }^{-}$They are independent of the patient's breathing pattern
${ }^{-}$The inspired oxygen is free from room air

\section*{a) Ventum Mask}

Similar to non - rebreather mask but has an adductor which is made in such a way that it delivers a specific concentration of oxygen ${ }^{-}$It is the most reliable an d accurate method of delivering a precise concentration of oxygen, and is non - invasive
b) Trans tracheal Catheter
${ }^{-}$It is inserted directly into the trachea
${ }^{-}$It is indicated for patients who require long term O2 therapy
c) 02 Tent
${ }^{-}$A tent bed is made and O 2 is connected into it
d) T Piece
${ }^{-}$It is connected to endotracheal tube in mechanical ventilation
e) Tracheostomy Collar
- Used by patients with tracheostomy

\section*{Hazards of $\mathbf{O 2}$ Administration}

O2 administration should be done with restrictions and patient be monitored closely because 02 therapy can result to:

\section*{1. Ventilation Suppression}
-This is the cessation of breathing that results from suppression of respiratory system due to increased levels of O 2 in blood. This happens in patients with pulmonary disease e.g. asthma - The part of the brain that controls respiration detects amount of O 2 in the blood and if high it stimulates respiration system to reduce breathing in terms of depth and rate
2. O2 Toxicity
- When administered at a high concentration for a long time i.e. more than 50\% over 48 hours, it results in the production of O 2 free radicals that are harmful to the cells
${ }^{-}$Signs of toxicity include: Sternal discomfort; Paresthesia; Cyanosis; Restlessness; Fatigue
3. Fire
4. Infection

\section*{Precautions of O2 Therapy}
- Warn patients against lighting matches and cigarettes and ensure patient has no matches
${ }^{-}$Ensure there is a warning near the bed or the rooms
${ }^{-}$Never use oil on O2 apparatus, they can light in presence of O2
${ }^{-}$Always turn O2 on before applying mask to the patient
- Gain patient's co - operation and instruct him/ her not to move the tubes or equipment
- Ensure patient is comfortable: linen is not wet, patient is not hungry, patient is warm. These help minimize O2 need
Assess and monitor the effect of O 2 to the patient. This will help in early detection of any complications in case they arise
- Ensure patient can move in bed to prevent complications e.g. bed sores and thrombus formation. However instruct them not to hyperactivity as this increase O 2 demand

\section*{Procedure for 02 Administration}

\section*{Requirements}
- O2 cylinder
-O2 Tubing
-Flowmetre or gauge
- Humidified and distilled O2
- O2 mask/nasal prongs
- Face mask with a breathing bag
- Pulse oximeter
- O2 stand
- Emergency/resuscitation tray

\section*{Steps}
${ }^{-}$Wash hands and explain the procedure to the patient
${ }^{-}$Assemble the equipment and connect the various gadgets
Correctly position the O2 delivery device and secure it in place properly
Open the cylinder and start O2 flowing and close flowmetre
- Regulate O2 flow as required connect it to the patient and connect patient to a pulse oximeter
${ }^{-}$Encourage patient to breath normally (where possible) and leave patient comfortable
Clear the environment and record

\section*{OPERATIVE NURSING}

Surgery is an art and science of treating disease and disorders by operation and instrumentation.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF SURGERIES}
1. According to Risks Involved
a) Major Surgery

It is an operation that has any of the following characteristics:
- Alteration of extensive body parts
- Poses a great risk to life e.g. one that involves a vital organ

\section*{b)Minor Surgery}

Operation that poses less risk to life, doesn't involve a vital organ
- Can be done under local anesthesia e.g. circumcision

\section*{2. According to Agency}

\section*{a) Emergent Surgery}

Operations that must be done immediately to save life.

\section*{${ }^{-}$Delay can lead to loss of life or body function e.g.}
intestinal obstruction, cord prolapse

\section*{b) Urgent Surgery}
- Essential operations that can be delayed for 1-2 days without causing harm to the patient
c) Elective Surgery
-They are pre-planned by the doctor and the patient and are performed on patient's choice
$>$ Their delay can't cause harm to the patient
-They can be optional where the operation is not essential e.g. cosmetic surgery
3. According to Purpose
a) Reconstructive Surgery
- Performed to restore function to a body part.
${ }^{-}$They can also be done to restore body image e.g.
plastic surgery, skin grafting
b) Constructive Surgery
-Performed to ensure normal function of body following congenital disorder e e.g. cleft palate
c) Ablative Surgery
${ }^{-}$They involve excision/ removal of a body part e.g. appendicectomy
d) Reparative Surgery

Operations that repair body part e.g. wound repair
e) Diagnostic Surgery
${ }^{-}$Used to assess and make a diagnosis e.g. explorative laparotomy
f) Transplant Surgery
- Done to replace defective/ diseased body part/ organ with a health one e.g. kidney transplant, bone marrow transplant
g) Palliative Surgery
-Aimed at relieving symptoms but doesn't cure the condition e.g. colostomy

\section*{PHASES OF OPERATIVE NURSING}
i) Pre - Operative
-The period from when the decision is made for operation to take place up to the time the patient is wheeled to the operating table
ii) Intra - Operative
-The period from when the patient is on the operating table to the time he/she is taken to the recovery room (PACU)
iii) Post - Operative
-The period from when the patient is in the recovery room to the time the patient is fully recovered

\section*{Pre - Operative Care}

\section*{Guidelines}

\section*{1. Informed consent}
-The patient should be informed on the need for the operation then explained to the procedure, benefits, possible risks, complications, possible outcome
${ }^{-}$This is done by the surgeon but it is the role of a nurse to ensure it is done
${ }^{-}$A nurse gives a patient the consent form and ensures it is signed by the patient him/herself unless patient is a minor, mentally ill or unconscious
Incase of emergency operations, it can be done

\section*{2. Patient Assessment}
${ }^{-}$Aimed at identifying disorders that may complicate surgery
${ }^{-}$A comprehensive history should be obtained and a physical (head to toe) examination done
${ }^{-}$Ensure specimen for baseline investigations (Hb, U/E/Cs etc.) is taken to the laboratory and results obtained in time
Check the vitals to ensure they are within the normal ranges
Surgical review should be done by the surgical team to determine if patient is fit to undergo the surgery (anesthetist, surgeon, assistant surgeon)

\section*{3. Patient Education}
- Aims to prepare the patient on what is expected of him/her before and after surgery, which helps promote quick recovery and prevent complications.
${ }^{-}$It involves explaining the procedure and what is expected
- Teaching about breathing exercises they will use post - operatively to prevent respiratory complications
- Explaining on pain management
- Discussing the post - operative equipment they will need
4. Physical and Psychological Preparation
- Psychological preparation is meant to allay anxiety and promote coping depending on the outcome of the surgery The patient should be counseled and reassured especially those receiving operations such as amputation, hysterectomy or mastectomy.
- Physical preparation varies depending on the type of surgery
a) Skin Preparation:
${ }^{-}$Ensure patient takes a bath with soap
- The area to be operated on should be cleaned with antiseptic
-Shaving if the area is hairy

\section*{b) Elimination}
- The bladder of the patient should be empty. This is done by catheterization or by giving a bed pan and urinal
${ }^{-}$Enema may be given if prescribed the eve or in the morning of the surgery
- These depend on type of surgery

Patients should not feed orally 6-10 hours before surgery to prevent:
Obstruction
-Vomiting during surgery which may result to aspiration
Patient soiling during surgery

\section*{5. Nutrition}

Since the patient is not taking anything (Nil Per Oral - NPO), he/she should be on IV fluids containing glucose and intake and output monitored

\section*{6. Pre - Operative Drugs}

Any drug prescribed should be given 45 - 75 minutes before the patient is taken to the theatre e.g. atropine

\section*{7. Rest and Sleep}

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF INFECTION PREVENTION IN OPERATING THEATRE}

\section*{SCRUBBING}

Done to remove micro-organisms from the forearm and arms by mechanical washing and chemical disinfections before taking part in surgical procedure.
${ }^{-}$This helps prevent the possibility of the patient being contaminated by bacteria from the hands and arms.

\section*{Procedure of Scrubbing}

\section*{Preparation}
-The theatre suit should have the top/shirt tidily tucked in. Roll the sleeves up to at least three inches above the elbow.
${ }^{-}$A cap should be worn to cover all the hair, tie the tape at the back.
${ }^{-}$A mask should be worn with the short side above the nose and the long side under the chin.
${ }^{-}$Remove all jewelry, wide wedding rings, dress rings, watches, earrings and necklaces.
- Finger nails must be short and clean without nail varnish.
- The staff should be free from cuts, wounds or septic wound on fingers; upper respiratory tract infection; gastroenteritis.
- Wear a mackintosh apron to protect your scrub suit.
- Regulate temperature and flow of water to suit you.
Scrubbing time varies according to the type of soap or chemical used. For example when using soap, which contains hexachlorophene disinfectants, you should scrub for five minutes; if using hibiscrub, two minutes; ordinary soap, ten to fifteen minutes.

\section*{Steps}
${ }^{-}$Use the wall clock to time yourself.
- Wet the hands and arms to the elbow.
- Pick the soap and make a lot of lather on the hands and arms (the soap remains in hands until the point of drop off later).
${ }^{-}$Wash hands and arms for one minute. This is called a social wash.
- Keeping the fingertips uppermost all the time, rinse hands to the elbow.
- Using the elbow, press the hutch of the dispenser and pick one sterile brush. Lather the brush and keep tablet of soap at back of the brush between your palm and brush in your right hand.

Starting with the left hand put your fingers together and scrub the fingernails. Move to the fingers, and then wipe off the hand and palm. Use a circular movement inside the palm. Spend extra time at the folds of the wrist. Do this for $1 \frac{1}{2}$ minutes, rinsing often and starting again. Rinse the hands from fingertips to wrists after the $1 \frac{1}{2}$ minutes. Rinse the brush and soap as well.
Change over to the right hand and repeat the procedures
Spend another $11 / 2$ minutes. Drop the brush into the correct receptacle provided. Keep the soap still in hands.

Lather hands and wash up to the wrist for another minute.
- Rinse the soap and drop it back into the soap dish.
- Take all necessary precautions to avoid touching the tap handles during this exercise as this contaminates the hands.
- Rinse the hands and arms thoroughly in one direction only starting from fingertips working down systematically to elbows.
Close the taps using elbows. Keep hands together upright, fingers higher than elbows.
- The circulating nurse will remove the mackintosh apron

\section*{DRYING}
- Pick up the towel and step back.
${ }^{-}$Start with the left hand and blot dry the fingers, the webs of the hand and the palm well. and then move to the back of the hand, and the forearm, using a circular movement to the elbows.

Change the towel to the left hand with the wet part against the left palm.
${ }^{-}$Using the dry part of the towel, repeat the same procedure on the other arm. When you get to the elbow, discard the used towel in the dispenser provided.

\section*{GOWNING}
-The following procedure should be followed when gowning:
- Pick a gown and step back.
- Hold the neck-band and let the bottom hem drop.

Open the gown and slide both hands in through the arm holes.
${ }^{-}$Do not touch the outside of the gown with your bare hands.
- The Runner Nurse will first tie the neck and shoulder bands then wristbands without touching the gown.

\section*{GLOVING}

The following procedure should be adhered to: - Arrange gloves on the trolley with glove finger portion away from you.
- Pick the glove with left hand holding at the folded part and slip in your right hand. Fold the tip of the sleeve on right hand and pass the glove over.
${ }^{-}$Using the gloved hand slip your fingers beneath the folded area of the remaining glove and slip in the left hand into the glove.
- Unroll the cuff of the glove covering the cuff of the sleeve. Do the same for the opposite hand using the same technique. Ensure you do not contaminate any area that will come in contact with the sterile field.

\section*{Post - Operative Care}

The general principles in postoperative care include:
${ }^{-}$Ensuring clear airway
-Supporting circulation
- Controlling bleeding
- Preventing infection
- Monitoring any complications
- Controlling pain
- Ensuring return of gastro intestinal motility
- Ensuring early and easy ambulation
- Preparing the patient for discharge and homebased care

${ }^{-}$Check the pulse, level of consciousness and state of the surgical wound
${ }^{-}$Ask about special instructions by the surgeon
${ }^{-}$Ask for the vital signs, any complications or drugs given during the operation
${ }^{-}$Transfer the patient to the stretcher gently

Place your tray at the foot of the stretcher and the charts at the side
- Return the patient to the ward and place him/her in appropriate position in bed
- Position all tubings properly to ensure patency
- Check IV fluids to regulate them
- Check the state of the wound
- Monitor vitals $1 / 4$ hourly for the 1 st hour, $1 / 2$ hourly for the next 2 hours, 1 hourly for the next 4 hours and then four hourly till patient recovers
Continue assessing the skin status for paleness, cyanosis
Monitor input/output of fluids

Subsequent Care
Elimination

- Maintain NPO state till bowel sounds return, after which feeding is resumed in the order of warm water oral sips, then oral diet, soft foods and finally normal diet

\section*{Rest and Sleep}
${ }^{-}$Encourage patient to have enough sleep and rest
- Enhance this by ensuring comfort and alleviating pain
Promotion of Wound Healing
- Dress wound aseptically
- Offering diet high in protein
- Giving prescribed medication
${ }^{-}$Removal of stitches as prescribed
Encourage early ambulation

\section*{Post - Operative Complications}

IMMEDIATE COMPLICATIONS
Hemorrhage and Shock
-Should be prevented by assessing the wound, taking vital signs and giving IV fluids
${ }^{-}$In case of they occur, call for help, control bleeding, maintain IV infusion and position the patient with the foot of the bed raised

\section*{Hypoxia}

Occurs due to depression of respiratory system by anesthesia

\section*{Hypothermia}

Occurs due to depression of muscle activity by anesthesia
${ }^{-}$It is prevented by keeping the patient warm and monitoring the temperature

\section*{DELAYED COMPLICATIONS Wound complications}

Dehiscence: Sutures separate (skin gapes)
Evisceration: Viscera protrudes through the incision site
Keloids: Excessive scar tissue formation
Contracture: Scarring at joints limiting joint function

Respiratory Complications
They include
- Aspiration pneumonia
- Hypostatic pneumonia
- Atelectasis

Circulatory Complications
They include
- Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)
- Embolism
-Thrombophlebitis

\section*{CRITICAL CARE NURSING}

This is the nursing care given to a patient whose health is in danger or in a crisis, so as to save their life or prevent complications.

Critical is defined as 'at a crisis'.
-The word 'crisis' is defined in the Dorland's Pocket Medical Dictionary as: 'The turning point of a disease for better or worse, especially a sudden change

Purpose
- To maintain accurate continuous observations of the patient's vital functions and to treat or support a failing or failed biological system.
${ }^{-}$It focuses on the whole body system so as to maintain health.

The patient is considered critical depending on the following factors:
- The magnitude or extent of anatomical structural damage, for example, second degree burns of more than 25\%
${ }^{-}$Severe injuries to the head or chest
- The effect of the disease/condition on circulation, breathing, and electrolyte balance
- The organs affected by the disease, for example, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, pulmonary distress, and renal failure

These patients include:
- Post-operative patients during the first 48 hours
- Unconscious patients
- Patients under special procedures, for example under water seal drainage
- Patients with severe respiratory distress

Note: The patient's survival rate will highly depend on your quick and accurate intervention.

These interventions should be prioritized on the CAB principles of first aid care, which state that:
Circulation must be promoted and maintained
Airway must be established and maintained
Breathing established

\section*{Critical Care Facilities}

\section*{1. ACUTE ROOM}
-Patients who are nursed here require life support equipment and continuous monitoring or observation.
${ }^{-}$Hence this room must be located closer to the nursing station than others.
- These patients do not only need close observation but also full time communication with the nursing team and other health care providers. This ensures continuity of care.
- It is recommended that a nurse should always be in the acute room, preferably at a ratio of one nurse to two patients at any given time.

An acute room can, therefore, be set up in a ward where one cubicle/corner can be identified and set aside for patients needing critical care in hospitals without established intensive care units.

Equipment in Acute Room
-Suction equipment
- Oxygen administration equipment fully assembled, ready for use
- Intravenous administration apparatus
-Adequate stocks of linen as patients nursed in
this room often require frequent changing of bed linen.
- Other requirements include observation equipment, a torch, diagnostic sets,

\section*{2. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU)}
${ }^{-}$It is a room/unit in which a critically ill patient is being actively treated as well as monitored.
${ }^{-}$Intensive care units are more advanced than acute rooms.
- The purpose of intensive care is to maintain life until the precipitating causes of body failure can be identified and successfully treated to allow the system to regain selfcontrol.

Generally, there is no universally ideal plan for an intensive care unit and each unit varies according to the needs of the patients it will take care of.
The ratio of nurse to patient should be 1:1 at any given time.
Ideally, no new hospital should be built without an intensive care unit. Provincial or regional and national hospitals are bound to have ICUs.
The size of the unit depends on the size of the hospital; one bed for every 50 beds in the hospital is the most ideal

Types of Intensive Care Units
a) General Intensive Care Unit
-This is where one unit admits all types of patients.
${ }^{-}$This is the most common in Kenya. It admits: adults, neonates, pediatrics, cardiac care patients and burns patients

\section*{b) Coronary Care Unit}
-This admits only those suffering from coronary and heart related emergencies e.g. myocardial infarction and heart surgeries.
c) Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)
${ }^{-}$These admit general pediatric emergencies.
e) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)
- Neonates requiring critical care are admitted and managed here.
f) High Dependent Unit (HDU)
${ }^{-}$These function as a step down to ICU.
- Patients are nursed in these units after discharge from ICU before getting to the general wards.

\section*{3. BURNS UNIT}
${ }^{-}$Used for the care of the patients with burns, however, in the Kenyan health facilities, most burns patients receive care in the general ward of a hospital (due to lack of space or financial capacity).
- The burns unit is basically designed to reduce the risk of infection. Infection in burns occurs as a result of the loss of the mechanical barrier provided by the skin cover.
${ }^{-}$It must therefore be maintained at a very high level of cleanliness.
${ }^{-}$Infection control measures such as management of visitors and changing of garments and shoes before entering the unit must be adhered to.
$\triangleright$ The unit must be well ventilated.
- Medical staff should avoid working in the unit when they have upper respiratory tract infections.
In an ideal situation, a burns unit is supposed to meet all the requirements of an intensive care unit.

\section*{4. RENAL DIALYSIS UNIT}
-This room is designed to ensure maintenance and sustenance of the life of patients during the dialysis procedure.
- The unit is piped with a specially treated water system to ensure an acceptable electrolytes concentration.
${ }^{-}$In addition to the dialysis equipment, the room must be equipped with resuscitation and monitoring equipment just like an intensive care unit.

\section*{SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CRITICAL ILLNESS}
- Low blood pressure
- Weak peripheral pulse

Cold extremities and peripheral cyanosis.
Poor cardiac output produces constriction of arterioles and stimulation of sweat glands, resulting in characteristically cold, pale and clammy skin.
Cerebral function alteration: The most frequent signs of impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues .
Chest pain

Coma is an obvious sign of severe illness. Drastic changes in mental status may indicate serious hemodynamic or metabolic abnormalities.
- Reduced urinary output
- Dyspnea
- High temperature
- Unexplained fatigue
- Tachycardia or palpitation

\section*{NEEDS OF A CRITICALLY ILL PATIENT}
${ }^{-}$Interference of oxygen intake and hence require basic life support in their management.
- Nutrition, for example, those that require artificial feeding such as nasal gastric tube feeding.
- Fluid and electrolyte balance, for example, dehydration.
- Skin integrity, for example, risk of developing bedsores.
- Mobility, for example, lack of movement of joints and muscles.
${ }^{-}$The affective domain, for example, feelings, lack of verbal communication.

Social or cultural issues, for example, family and relatives' anxiety.

\section*{MANAGEMENT OF UNCONSCIOUS PATIENTS}

\section*{Unconsciousness:}
${ }^{-}$Unconsciousness is a condition in which there is a depression of cerebral function ranging from stupor to coma.
- Coma results from impairment in both the arousal and the awareness of consciousness.
${ }^{-}$The arousal of consciousness is mediated by the reticular activating substance (RAS) in the brain stem.

The awareness component of consciousness is mediated by the cortical activity within the cerebral hemispheres.

\section*{Consciousness:}
${ }^{-}$It is the state of being aware of self environment.
- The level at which a patient is able to respond to stimuli is referred to as level of consciousness

Note: Both arousal and awareness are assessed when using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)

\section*{Causes of altered state of consciousness}
- Hypoxemia
- Trauma
- Vascular disorders
- Neoplasms
- Degenerative and infectious disorders as well as a
- Metabolic disorders and
- Structural neurologic lesions.

Note: Diagnostic evaluation and management depend on the underlying cause, overall intracranial dynamics, age, comorbidities, and general state of health.

\section*{GLASGOW COMA SCALE}

It is a numerical system used to evaluate patients level of consciousness especially after head injury

\section*{Assessment of Unconscious Patients}
- History taking
- Physical Examination
- Ability of patient to respond to stimuli, which is done by determining the degree of consciousness impairment by evaluating behavioral response in three areas, with points adding to 15: Eye Opening
(4); Verbal Response(5) and Motor Response (6)

\section*{Glasgow Coma Scale}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Parameter & Finding & Score \\
\hline 1. Eye Opening & Spontaneously & 4 \\
\hline & To Speech & 3 \\
\hline & To Pain & 2 \\
\hline & Do Not Open & 1 \\
\hline 2. Verbal Response & Oriented & 5 \\
\hline & Confused & 4 \\
\hline & Inappropriate Speech & 3 \\
\hline & Incomprehensible Sounds & 2 \\
\hline & No Verbalization & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline 3. Motor Response & Obeys Command & 6 \\
\hline & Localizes Pain & 5 \\
\hline & Withdraws from Pain & 4 \\
\hline & Abnormal Flexion & 3 \\
\hline & Abnormal Extension & 2 \\
\hline & No Motor Response & 1 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
1. Eye Opening (4 grades)
- No eye opening: 1
- Opening to response to pain: 2
${ }^{-}$Eye opening in response any speech (or shout, not necessarily request to open eyes): 3
-Spontaneous eye opening: 4
2. Verbal Response ( 5 grades) Record best level of speech.
Orientated: Patient knows who he is, where he is and why, the year, season, and month: 5
Confused Conversation: Patient responds to questions in a conversational manner but some disorientation and confusion: 4
Inappropriate Speech: Random or exclamatory articulated speech, but no conversational exchange: 3
Incomprehensible Speech: Moaning but no words: 2
None: 1
3. Motor Responses ( $\mathbf{6}$ grades)

Obeying Command: The patient does simple things you ask (beware of accepting a grasp reflexes in this category): 6
${ }^{-}$Localizing Pain: Put pressure on the patient's finger nail bed with a pencil then try supraorbital and sternal pressure: purposeful movements towards changing painful stimuli is a 'localizing' response: 5
- Withdraws to Pain: Pulls limb away from painful stimulus: 4

Abnormal flexor response to pain: Pressure on the nail bed causes abnormal flexion of limbs "decorticate posture": 3

Extensor posturing to pain: The stimulus causes limb extension (adduction, internal rotation of shoulder, pronation of forearm) "decerebrate posture": 2

No response to pain: 1

\section*{Interpretation:}

The score is expressed in the form "GCS $9=$ E2 V4 M3 at 07:35 Am"
Best Score $=15$, this shows that the patient is fully conscious
${ }^{-}$A score of 13 or higher correlates with a mild head (brain) injury,
${ }^{-}$A score of 9 to 12 is a moderate head (brain) injury
${ }^{-}$A score of 8 or less a severe head (brain) injury.
-Worst Score = 3, this shows severe neurological impairment

Changes from baseline are most important

When using the GCS, coma may be defined as no eye opening on stimulation, absence of comprehensible speech, and failure to obey commands.

Note: The GCS is designed to provide a rapid assessment of level of consciousness (LOC) and does not provide a means to monitor or localize neurologic dysfunction.

\section*{Care of the Unconscious Patients}

The management pathway is divided as follows:
1. Basic Ventilatory Support/Airway Care-
${ }^{-}$This is airway control through positioning.
${ }^{-}$The recovery position is best as it encourages drainage of secretions from the oral cavity.

Suction of the airways to remove secretion and administration of oxygen, intubation of the trachea and artificial ventilation may be required.
2. Monitoring of Respiration
- This is meant to enable early detection of any changes that may indicate complication, for example, increase in respiration rate, abnormal respiration sounds, etc.

\section*{3. Ensuring Adequate Circulation}
-This is achieved through maintaining adequate blood volume by administering enough fluids through the intravenous route to supplement the nasal gastric tube feeding.
${ }^{-}$A meticulous input/output chart must be maintained.
- The use of physiotherapy to exercise the joints and muscles also helps to improve circulation.
- Monitoring of circulation functions by taking and recording blood pressure and pulse rates, ECG, and oxygen saturation are important.

\section*{4. Nutritional Management}
${ }^{-}$Can be achieved through insertion of a nasal gastric tube and using it for feeding.
- The intravenous route is also used to give parenteral feeds if the patient is not digesting, and to maintain fluid and electrolyte balances.
- Intravenous fluids are selected and administered to meet the electrolyte need in the body.

\section*{5. Skin Integrity}

This is maintained through proper skin hygiene, which includes
- Daily bathing,
- Two (2)-hourly turning of the patient and
- Keeping the patient's bed linen clean and dry.

\section*{6. Elimination}
${ }^{-}$Adequate fluid intake ensures that kidney function is maintained.
${ }^{-}$Some patients may require catheterization to keep them dry and for proper monitoring of urine production.
- Adequate fluids and feeding help to maintain bowel motion.

\section*{7. Psychosocial Needs}
-This includes addressing the patient by their name at all times, while providing care.
${ }^{-}$It is important to assume that the patient can hear and, therefore, you should inform the patient of any intended action that you intend to perform on them.
- Relatives should be informed of patient's progress and encouraged to provide the social support necessary to reassure the patient that they are not abandoned.
8. General Monitoring of the Vital Signs
${ }^{-}$This must be done to evaluate the patient's progress and identify early any impending complication

MANAGEMENT OF THE TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS

Terminal Illness is a disease or condition that may end in death within a limited period of time
- The care of terminally ill is also referred to as palliative care which is caring for people (and their families) who are suffering from life limiting illnesses.

WHO definition of palliative care: The active total care of patients whose disease is not responsive to curative treatment,
${ }^{-}$It aims at achieving the best possible quality of life for all patients and their families by meeting their physical, psychological and spiritual needs.

Palliative care employs a holistic approach, which enables people to die with dignity while supporting those close to them.

Diseases that may require Palliative Care
- HIV/AIDS
- Cancer: cancer of the cervix, prostate cancer, cancer of the esophagus, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, cancer of the breast, cancer of the pancreas and many others
- Terminal liver disease and kidney disease
- Degenerative nervous system disorders

Important aspects of this care are:
- Management of signs and symptoms e.g. control of pain
${ }^{-}$Psychological support
-Social support
${ }^{-}$Spiritual support

\section*{Principles of Palliative Care}

Palliative care is based on the philosophy of total care. It employs the following principles.
Teamwork: Involving team of medical workers, i.e. physicians, nurses , social workers, pastoral care professionals, physical and occupational therapist, pharmacist whose skills are required.
Pain Relief: Ensuring that the client experience death free of avoidable pain and suffering and in accordance with the client's and family's issue.
Support: Ensuring availability of support for the client to enable them carry out activities they enjoy doing that improve the quality of their life.

Management of Signs and Symptoms
The common problems in the terminally ill patients are:
a. Pain
- These patients are usually in very severe pain. They are therefore put on medications that help alleviate pain/ reduce it to a bearable level.
${ }^{-}$This is aimed at ensuring that the client experience death free of avoidable pain and suffering and in accordance with the client's and family's issue.

WHO Recommendations on Pain Management
Drugs
The drugs should be given:
1. By Mouth

This should be the route of choice because it is convenient and easy. If no longer tolerable, subcutaneous route should be used.
2. By Clock

This means that drugs should be given regularly at the same time.

\section*{3. By ladder}

This means that you start with one drug that is the weakest, increase the dosage as necessary and only move to the next stronger drug after exhausting the potential of the weaker drug e.g. you cannot move straight to opioid drugs such as morphine before you finish exploiting paracetamol.

The WHO Analgesic Ladder:
Step 1: Non Opioids: -
These are drugs such as Paracetamol and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Step 2: Mild Opioids: -
These are drugs such as Codeine often combined with Paracetamol.
Step 3: Strong Opioids: -
In this category, there is morphine which can be of immediate release e.g. Oramorph and of sustained release e.g. subcutaneous Diamorphine.
b. Anorexia

These patients are unable to eat because of being weak, anxious, depressed and nauseated
The patient should therefore:
${ }^{-}$Be encouraged to feed
$>$ Given drugs that reduce nausea
- Given the opportunity to choose diet
${ }^{-}$Given cool and more appealing drinks
-In case patient can’t feed orally, alternative methods should be used

\section*{c) Nausea and Vomiting}
${ }^{-}$This can be reduced by giving treatment for the same
-Patient should be positioned properly to prevent aspiration.
${ }^{-}$Anti - emetics should be administered, dry foods and carbonated beverages should be encouraged as they are less nauseating
d) Depression

It requires treatment and referral to psychiatrists for management
${ }^{-}$Social support from family and friends is also essential so that the patient does not feel neglected
e) Diarrhea

It results from side - effects of medication, infection and change in diet
Patients should be given low residue diet
Gas causing foods should be eliminated from the diet
- Patient should be encouraged to take fluids other than plain water to replace lost electrolytes
- Perineal care essential
${ }^{-}$In case of constipation, high residue diet should be given and nurse should continuously monitor
f) Dehydration

Results from reduced intake of fluids
Note: Some dehydration is beneficial as it dries secretions and reduces the risk of fluid accumulation in cavities but severe dehydration should not be allowed
Oral fluids should be administered and if need be IV fluids should be used.
- Monitor input output accurately
- Mouth care should be maintained
g) Skin Breakdown

Most patients are bed ridden because they are weak or depressed
${ }^{-}$Adequate nutrition and hydration should be maintained to promote skin integrity
-Pressure area care should be done
${ }^{-}$Position changing should be done frequently (at least 2 hourly) to prevent bed sore

\section*{h) Respiratory Problems}

They are common due to retained secretions which result from inability to expectorate and immobility
- Respiration rate and depth should be monitored
- Chest physiotherapy should also be done
- O2 should be administered when necessary
-Suctioning should be done in case of increased secretions
- Appropriate positioning necessary
- Drugs that reduce secretions may be used e.g. atropine

\section*{Importance of Palliative Care}
${ }^{-}$It improves the quality of life for the sick
- It is suited to home care
${ }^{-}$It offers freedom from unnecessary pain and suffering
${ }^{-}$It makes use of affordable and effective drugs
${ }^{-}$It enables people to prepare for death and to die with dignity
-It also supports families and caretakers
${ }^{-}$It empowers communities to respond to the emerging HIV/AIDS crisis and cancer

REPORTS

Report is the process of disseminating information about a patient/client to the staff, reporting to the institution management or during nurses' ward round

\section*{TYPES OF REPORTS \\ a) WRITTEN REPORT}

This is giving report in writing either manually or electronically. The report includes:
"Patient's past and present state
"Patient’s progress
"Diagnostic procedure

\section*{Treatment}
- Response to treatment

\section*{Types of Written Reports}

\section*{i) Assessment Report}
- This record all the information about the patient that was observed from health interview, physical assessment and investigation e.g. doctor's clinical charts and clerking reports

\section*{Ii) Plan of Care Report}
- These are reports that give information of what should be done to the patient. Includes nursing care plans, doctor's plan of care notes and other notes from other members of the health team e.g. physiotherapists,
iii) Progressive Report
- They are periodic entries that describe procedures, treatment and response to treatment at a point in time
- Examples:
"Nursing cardex
"Treatment sheet
- Observation chart
${ }^{-}$Fluid chart
"Feeding chart

\section*{iv) Continuing of Care Report}
- Reports that give information that help in ensuring continuity of patient's care e.g. diagnostic procedures, teaching plan, transfer note, discharge summary

\section*{v) Incident Reports}
- Records of occurrences in the hospital ward outside routine observation e.g. theft, accidents in the ward

\section*{vi) Matron's Report}
${ }^{-}$A written report on a ward to the hospital matron at different intervals depending on the hospital policy
${ }^{-}$Includes the number of patients in the ward, number of staff on dutv including students.

\section*{Reasons for Report Writing}
- Communication among health care providers, patients and employer
- For accountability - being responsible for ones actions. Health reports act as evidence that health care providers have acted responsibly and this evidence that be used in legal matters incase a patient files a case in court of law concerning the services offered
- To fulfill regulatory requirements by the government or hospital management. Ensures standard of care

\section*{Principles and Guidelines of Report Writing}
${ }^{-}$A report should be accurate and complete
- Report what you see or observe without giving your opinion. Avoid judgmental language e.g. poor
${ }^{-}$Reports should be specific. Avoid ambiguity and generalizations e.g. patient had a calm night
${ }^{-}$Be prompt in report writing, late entry should be indicated
- Use patients quotes when reporting e.g. "pain has reduced"
- Indicate date and time of each entry and use black or blue ink pen

Be clear and consistent, only use accepted/ approved/ standardized abbreviations Don't leave vacant lines and in case a line is left , put a line across the extra space. If you continue to the next page, indicate the date and time
- NEVER use an eraser or correction fluid on patient's health records. IT IS ILLEGAL. If an error is made in writing cross out in a single and enclose with parenthesis. Write your name and sign e.g. the patient collapsed
- Respect confidentiality when reporting patient's information. This should be shared only to the relevant people
- Record all and any relevant information

\section*{Nursing Cardex}
${ }^{-}$It is a sheet of paper that shows patient's details and it is used for recording all nursing care and other procedures that he/she receives
${ }^{-}$It also has admission data
- Time and date of the procedure should be indicated and the person who carried out the procedure should write his/her name and signature against the report
${ }^{-}$All reports should be written in third person e.g. the patient was fed on porridge and retained.

\section*{Nursing Cardex}

Name of patient:
Age:
Sex :

Date of Admission(D.O.A):
Diagnosis:
Date of Discharge(D.O.D):

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Date & Time & Daily Progress Report & Name of Nurse \& Signature \\
\hline 20.04.2010 & 7.30 AM & Patient was received lying in bed. Reported reduced pain & Yiya \\
\hline 20.04.2010 & 8.00 AM & Bed making done, linen changed and patient left comfortable, seated in bed & Yiya \\
\hline 20.04.2020 & 9.00 AM & IV Ceftriaxone 2 gm given, no reaction observed. PO Paracetamol given because the patient was complaining of pain & Yiya \\
\hline 20.04.2010 & 10.00AM & Patient took one cup of tea & Yiya \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{B) VERBAL REPORTS}

Several times during the day, a nurse is required to give oral reports to others. The nurse summarizes the activities and conditions of the patient/s assigned to them and gives an oral report.
${ }^{-}$It may also be tape recorded
${ }^{-}$It accompanies a written report
${ }^{-}$It should include:
"Significant patient’s data
${ }^{-}$Special nursing and medical order
${ }^{-}$Recent test results
"Vital signs and Scheduled diagnostic tests
"Discharge or transfer plans

\section*{Indications for Verbal Report}
- Change of shift by the nursing staff
- Communicating information to doctors and other members of the health team
- Transfer of patients to other departments

\section*{Giving Verbal Reports}
- Need to have a cardex or report book and other patient's notes including observation charts, nursing care plans, fluid charts if any
Check on those notes for relevant information to report at that particular time
-Move from on patient to another reporting on each as all other members of staff listen and observe to confirm the condition

\section*{Advantages of Verbal Reports}
- Eliminates errors by identifying the patient being reported on
${ }^{-}$Helps to spot check the written report
- No patient can be missed
-Patients can be observed when report is being given
- Useful in the wards where there are too many patients and patents share beds or lie on the floor

Disadvantages
- Takes time
- Confidentiality is not well maintained
- May create anxiety among patients

\section*{Confidential Verbal Report}

\section*{Preparation}
- The nurse reporting should check the patient prior to reporting
- S/he needs to collect all pertinent data e.g. nurses’ notes, doctors’ orders etc. and meet in a private room with incoming staff

\section*{Method}
- The nurse then gives the number of patients in the ward, new admission, discharges, deaths etc.
${ }^{-}$Report is given on each patient including bed number, name, diagnosis and patient's condition.
-The report should be clear and audible so that all staff are totally aware

DEATH
- Death is the permanent cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism.
${ }^{-}$It occurs from distal to proximal, outside to inside

\section*{Signs of Approaching Death}
${ }^{-}$Incontinence which results from loss of sphincter control
- Reduced intake of food and fluids
- Cold extremities due to diminishing circulation
- Hallucinations
- Change in pattern of breathing, noisy breathing called death rattle
- Heartbeat and pulse become slow and weak
- Patients become unresponsive to touch and pain
- Pupils become dilated and fixed

\section*{Signs of Death or Strong Indications that Death has occurred:}
${ }^{-}$Cessation of breathing
- Cardiac arrest (no pulse)
- Pallor mortis, paleness which happens in the 15120 minutes after death
${ }^{-}$Livor mortis, a settling of the blood in the lower (dependent) portion of the body

Algor mortis, the reduction in body temperature following death. This is generally a steady decline until matching ambient temperature
- Rigor mortis, the limbs of the corpse become stiff and difficult to move or manipulate
- Decomposition, the reduction into simpler forms of matter, accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor.

\section*{Types of Death Clinical Death}
-This is cessation of blood circulation and breathing, the two necessary criteria to sustain life.
${ }^{-}$It occurs when the heart stops beating in a regular rhythm, a condition called cardiac arrest.

\section*{Brain/Biological Death}
-This is permanent cellular damage, resulting from lack of oxygen, that is not reversible.

\section*{Stages of Dying by Kubler - Ross}

Kubler-Ross described 5 stages of dying. These are:
1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining
4. Depression
5. Acceptance

Note: The stages do not necessarily appear in this order. Each terminally ill patient presents differently because of difference in personalities.

\section*{1. Denial}
${ }^{-}$A person may act as though nothing has happened and may refuse to believe or understand what the impending loss means.
-The person doesn't believe the diagnosis and may search for optional treatment from other health care providers
-Some may fail to comply with treatment and refuse offers of comfort and isolate themselves from sources of accurate information

Examples of responses:
-Verbal: 'This can not be me!'
-Behavioral: A client is diagnosed with lung cancer but continues to smoke two packs of cigarette daily

Nursing Action
-Support the patient's emotions without supporting the denial
- Give company to the patient, with assistance from relatives and friends
- Be empathetic and listen to the patient
- Encourage the patient to share fears and concerns instead of telling him/her what they may not need to hear
2. Anger
- Occurs due to the feeling of hopelessness
${ }^{-}$It is directed towards self, others or God
- The individual resists the loss and may be irritable at everyone around them
${ }^{-}$The client becomes demanding, accusing and when it is directed towards self, it causes anxiety and can result to suicide
-The patient may become hostile even to staff

Examples of Responses
-Verbal: "Why me?"
${ }^{-}$Behavioral: Client stikes out at care givers or relatives and may even attempt suicide

Nursing Actions
- Provide explanation and guidance about feelings and emotions

Do not take anger personally
- Ensure that the patient's needs are met
-Do not provoke the patient

\section*{3. Bargaining}
-The patient realizes nothing can be done and starts bargaining for more time
-The individual tries to postpone awareness e.g. 'God ,if you give me life I will serve you better' as though the loss can be prevented.

\section*{Examples of Responses}
-Verbal: Client prays, "Please God, just let me live long enough to see my son graduate"

Behavioral: Client tries to "make deals" with care givers

\section*{Nursing Actions}
${ }^{-}$Allow expression of feelings by the patient
- Offer information that help in decision making and NEVER give false hope

\section*{4. Depression}
${ }^{-}$This is sadness or grief as the patient realizes that death is inevitable. The person realizes the impact of the loss.
- They feel very lonely and may withdraw from interpersonal interaction, refusing to talk and even suicidal.
$>$ They may resort to unhealthy behavior e.g. taking drugs and sexual defiance
