                        <p><strong>Advocate</strong> - Pleads the cause of the patients' rights by protecting the client's human and legal rights and providing assistance in asserting those rights if the need arises. Advocacy empowers the clients to be partners in the therapeutic process rather than passive recipients of care</p>
                        <p><strong>Teacher</strong> - This is an intrinsic part of nursing, where the nurse views each interaction with a client as a learning opportunity (both client and nurse can learn). Teaching can be formal, informal, intentional or incidental. Here the nurse provides information, seeks to empower clients for self care, encourages compliance with prescribed medications and promotes healthy lifestyle</p>
                        <p><strong>Change Agent:</strong> The nurse is proactive (takes initiative to make things happen) rather than reactive (responding to things after they happen). Change should be planned carefully and implemented in a deliberate way to facilitate the client's progress</p>
                        <p><strong>Team Member:</strong> A vital role. The nurse works in collaboration with other healthcare providers. He/she should use effective interpersonal skills and promotes continuity of care.</p>
                        <p><strong>Counselor</strong> - Assists clients with problem identification and resolution. He/she facilitates client action and does NOT tell the patient what to do but assists them in decision making</p>
                        <p><strong>Manager</strong> - The nurse makes decisions, coordinates activities of others, allocates resources, evaluates care and personnel and serves as a leader.</p>
                        <p><strong>Critical Thinker</strong> - Uses decision making and critical thinking skills in conjunction with nursing with the nursing process in management of clients</p>
                        <p><strong>Expert</strong> - He/she is an advanced practice clinician, conducts research, teaches in school of nursing, contributes to professional literature and provides testimony at government hearings and in courts</p>
                        <p><strong>Case Manager</strong> - Tracks the client's progress through the health care system. Coordinate care to ensure continuity</p>
                        <p><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> - Ensures clients return to a maximal state of functioning. When a person experiences alteration in health, the nurse's role is to promote client adaptation and coping.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Nurse - Client Relationship</h3>
                        <p>This is a one - to - one interactive process between client and nurse directed at improving the client's health status or assisting in problem solving. The primary goal is the client's achievement of therapeutic outcomes.</p>
                        <h4>Characteristics of the therapeutic relationships</h4>
                        <p><strong>Warmth</strong> - This is exhibiting positive behavior towards the client. Expressed by respect, genuine interest and caring</p>
                        <p><strong>Hope</strong> - This is anticipating the future by helping clients look realistically at their potential. Hope should not be confused with false reassurance. "Hope is the energy source that allows individuals to plan, act and achieve" (Forbes).</p>
                        <p><strong>Rapport</strong> - Is a bond or connection between two people that is based on mutual trust. To establish this, the nurse has to implement behavior that promote trust. The nurse's actions should show that the client is considered important</p>
                        <p><strong>Trust</strong> - It must be present for help to be given and received. The major activities that facilitate development of trust are consistency, respect and honesty.</p>
                        <p><strong>Empathy</strong> - A key element that refers to understanding the other person's perception of the situation. By perceiving the client's understanding of their own needs, the nurse is able to assist clients in determining what will work best.</p>
                        <p><strong>Acceptance</strong> - This is accepting and working with clients even those who sometimes exhibit some undesirable behavior. It means caring for individual whose value system may differ greatly from that of the nurse and not expressing shock or surprise at the patient's behavior.</p>
                        <p><strong>Compassion</strong> - is caring about what happens to the other person. Kindness and genuine concern are expressed through compassionate acts</p>
                        <p><strong>Active Listening</strong> - Listening that focuses on the feelings of the individual who is speaking. The listener is cognizant of three elements of communication: verbal, Para verbal (the way in which a person speaks, including voice tone, pitch and inflection) and nonverbal communication.</p>
                        <p><strong>Self - Awareness</strong> - Being aware of ones feelings. Allows the nurse to remain objective i.e. separate enough to distinguish one's own feelings and needs from those of the patient</p>
                        <p><strong>Humor</strong> - Helps break the ice, decreases fear and establishes trust. Note that it is defined to a great deal by one's cultural background hence the need to be very sensitive to the client's interpretation and use of humor. Is a powerful coping tool as it helps individuals relieve stress and express anger in a socially acceptable way.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nonjudgmental Approach</strong> - Acting without biases, preconception, or stereotypes. The nurse does not judge the client or tell them what to do, they accept them as they are.</p>
                        <p><strong>Flexibility</strong> - The nurse should be ready for unexpected - knowing that every day is filled with unplanned events and situations. Staying calm during a crisis is a characteristic of a flexible nurse.</p>
                        <p><strong>Risk - Taking</strong> - Is a behavior that leads to innovative problem solving. To be risk takers, the nurses need to try something new, step out of the ordinary and not to be bound by tradition or fear.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Personal Grooming</h3>
                        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Every patient has a mental picture of how their nurse should be. The nurses appearance provides security and hope to a patient.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The uniform should neither be too tight or too loose to hinder free movement during an emergency</li>
                            <li>The dress or skirt should be below the knee to give to give allowance when bending</li>
                            <li>Should not be made of light (see-through) material</li>
                            <li>Should be kept clean to prevent cross - infection and well pressed</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In most ancient civilizations, women were responsible nurturing, nourishing and providing care to children and ill family members. Nursing was a community service that preserved and protected the family.</p>
                        <p>In many cultures, illness was believed to be directly related to religious believes, mythical magic and evil spirits that took control of the body. Medicine men, healers exorcised these evil spirits from the sick using incarnations.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Under the influence of Christianity, educated and wealthy women dedicated themselves to caring for the sick.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During renaissance (AD1400-1550), interests in philosophy, science and art emerged. Universities were constructed throughout Europe, but even though medicine moved into the university setting, no formal nursing schools were founded. This era has been described as the darkest age in nursing because there was little to no organization, education or social standing left in nursing</p>

                        <p>In 1854 as the Crimean war began, she prepared and led a group of 38 nurses to British military hospital in Turkey to care for the injured soldiers. She found the hospital so crowded with patients on the floor with bloody uniforms.</p>
                        <p>She therefore established hospital sanitary conditions where units were cleaned and clothing washed regularly.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Rise in patient's acuity</strong> - This leads to higher level skills, knowledge and specialization of nurses</p>
                        <p><strong>Shift to community based care</strong> - Patients receive care for chronic conditions at home and community clinics provide PHC for many clients</p>
                        <p><strong>Care on outpatient basis</strong> - This has called for more nurses to care for those patients</p>
                        <p><strong>Technology</strong> - Advanced technology requires nurses to learn how to operate sophisticated equipment to manage conditions in hospital and to make accurate diagnosis and treat and also to teach family members and fellow nurses how to use such equipment</p>
                        <p><strong>Social Factors</strong> - Many clients are of low social classes (poverty and lack of health insurance), this predisposes them to diseases. This combined with emergence of diseases e.g. TB, HIV has increased disease burden hence need for more nurses.</p>
                        <p><strong>Changes in Nursing Education</strong> - Emphasis on learning more than clinical services and availability of career ladder programs</p>
                        <p><strong>Autonomy</strong> - Nurses are now more assertive and independent. They are able to make diagnoses and intervene as needed</p>
                        <p><strong>Lifestyle</strong> - Rise in life expectancy as a result disease prevention and healthy lifestyle has lead to increased population which requires more nurses for health promotion.</p>

                            <li>Consistency in carrying out the nursing care plan</li>
                            <li>Patient needs are quickly met as high number of nurse's hours are spent on the patient</li>
                            <li>Relationship based on trust is developed between the nurse and the patient's family</li>
                            <li>Educational needs of the client can be closely monitored</li>
                            <li>Workload in the unit can be equally divided among staff</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It can be very costly</li>
                            <li>Many clients may not require the intensity of care inherent with this type of service</li>
                            <li>The method must be modified if non professional health workers are to be used effectively</li>
                            <li>Need of more nurses</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Functional Nursing</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is a task-oriented method wherein a particular nursing function is assigned to each staff member.</li>
                            <li>The medication nurse, treatment nurse and bedside nurse are all products of this system.</li>
                            <li>For efficiency, nursing was essentially divided into tasks, a model that proved very beneficial when staffing was poor.</li>
                            <li>The key idea was for nurses to be assigned to tasks, not to patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A very efficient way to deliver care.</li>
                            <li>Could accomplish a lot of tasks in a small amount of time</li>
                            <li>Staff members do only what they are capable of doing</li>
                            <li>Least costly as fewer nurses are required</li>
                            <li>It is easy to organize</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Care of patients become fragmented and depersonalized</li>
                            <li>Patients do not have one identifiable nurse</li>
                            <li>Very narrow scope of practice for nurses</li>
                            <li>Leads to patient and nurse dissatisfaction</li>
                            <li>Nurses are accountable for the tasks rather than the client</li>
                            <li>There is risk for diminishing continuity of care</li>
                            <li>Monotony hence boredom</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Team Nursing</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nursing staff in a ward is divided into teams, each team taking responsibility for the total care of a subgroup of the patients.</li>
                            <li>It was developed in the 1950's in order to somewhat ameliorate the fragmentation that was inherent in the functional model. The goal of team nursing is for a team to work democratically.</li>
                            <li>It has the team leader who is accountable for all the care of the patients.</li>
                            <li>The team member possessing the skill needed by the individual patient is assigned to that patient.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each member's capabilities are maximized so job satisfaction should be high</li>
                            <li>Patients have one nurse (the Team Leader) with immediate access to other health care providers</li>
                            <li>Work load is shared and balanced</li>
                            <li>Each team member has a chance to learn from others</li>
                            <li>Division of work enables members to gain leadership skills</li>
                            <li>Interests in clients' well being care shared by several people, reliability of decisions is increased</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Requires a team spirit and commitment to succeed</li>
                            <li>RN may be the Team Leader one day and a team member the next, thus continuity of patient care may suffer</li>
                            <li>Care is still fragmented with only 8 or 12 hour accountability</li>
                            <li>All personnel must be client - centered, which may not be the case</li>
                            <li>There is less individual responsibility and independence regarding nursing actions</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Primary Nursing</h3>
                        <p>This is a patient-centered nursing system. One nurse (the primary nurse) assumes individual responsibility for a particular patient/patients. Theoretically this responsibility extends over the entire period the patient requires nursing (from admission/start of treatment to discharge/end of treatment) although in practice there has to be delegation to other nurses (the associate nurses) during periods of absence from the ward.</p>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is continuity of care</li>
                            <li>There is increased accountability, responsibility and independence</li>
                            <li>Good and trusting relationship is developed between the nurse, patient and relatives</li>
                            <li>Increased satisfaction for patients and nurses</li>
                            <li>More professional system: The nurse plans and communicates with all healthcare members.</li>
                            <li>Nurses are seen as more knowledgeable and responsible.</li>
                            <li>Nurses more satisfied because they continue to learn as part of the in-depth care they are required to deliver to their patient</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only confines a nurse's talents to a limited number of patients, so other patients cannot benefit if s/he is competitive</li>
                            <li>Can be intimidating for nurses who are less skilled and knowledgeable</li>
                            <li>The nurse may be isolated from colleagues</li>
                            <li>If the nurse is not competent, the patient will be disadvantaged</li>
                            <li>There is little avenue for group planning and sharing ideas concerning patient's care</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Progressive Client Care Nursing</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient care is provided in accordance to the unit e.g. ICU for critically ill, post intensive care unit, regular care unit</li>
                            <li>The client is evaluated and managed based on the intensity of care needed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Advantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Efficient use of personnel and equipment</li>
                            <li>The clients are in the best place to receive the care they require</li>
                            <li>Clients move towards independence and is fostered where indicated</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There may be discomfort to patients who are moved too often</li>
                            <li>Continuity of care is not adequate even though possible</li>
                            <li>Long - term nurse client relationships are difficult to manage</li>
                        </ul>
