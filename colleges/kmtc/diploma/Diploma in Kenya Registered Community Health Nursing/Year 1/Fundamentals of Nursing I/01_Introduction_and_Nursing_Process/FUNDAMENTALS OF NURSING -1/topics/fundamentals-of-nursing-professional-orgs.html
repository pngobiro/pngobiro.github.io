                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Nurses need to know and apply legal aspects in their many different roles. Nurses need to understand laws that regulate and affect nursing practice to ensure that their actions are consistent with current legal principles and to protect the nurse from legal liability. Competence in nursing practice is determined and maintained by various credentialing methods e.g licensure, certification and accreditation.</p>

                        <h3>Patient's Bill of Rights</h3>
                        <p>The patient has the right to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Considerate and respectful care.</li>
                            <li>Obtain from care givers relevant, current and understandable information concerning diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.</li>

                            <li>Privacy. Case discussion, consultation, examination and treatment should be conducted to protect each patient's privacy.</li>
                            <li>Expect all communication and records pertaining his/her care will be treated as confidential.</li>
                            <li>Review records pertaining his/ her medical care and to have the information explained or interpreted as necessary except when restricted by the law.</li>
                            <li>Consent or decline to participate in proposed research studies or human experimentation affecting care and treatment or requiring direct patient involvement.</li>
                            <li>Be informed of the hospital policies and practices that relate to patient care, treatment and responsibilities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Informed Consent</h3>
                        <p>Is an agreement by a client to accept a course of treatment or a procedure after being provided complete information, including benefits and risks of treatment and prognosis if not treated by a health care provider.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Types of Consent</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Express</strong> - may be a written or an oral agreement. The greater the potential for risk to the client, the greater the need for written permission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Implied</strong> - exists when the individual's nonverbal behavior indicates agreement e.g taking of vital signs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Information for Informed Decision</h4>
                        <p>General guidelines on information required for the client to make an informed decision include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The purposes of treatment</li>
                            <li>What the client can expect to feel or experience</li>
                            <li>The intended benefits of the treatment</li>
                            <li>Possible risks or negative outcomes of the treatment</li>
                            <li>Advantages and disadvantages of possible alternatives</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Elements of Informed Consent</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Must be given voluntarily.</li>
                            <li>Must be given by a client or individual with the capacity and competence to understand.</li>
                            <li>The client or individual must be given enough information to be the ultimate decision-maker.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Exceptions for Informed Consent</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Minors.</li>
                            <li>Persons who are unconscious or injured in such a way that they are unable give consent.</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Nurse's Role in Informed Consent</h4>
                        <p>The nurse is not responsible for explaining the procedure but for witnessing the client's signature on the form. The nurse's signature according to Sullivan (1998) confirms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Client gave consent voluntarily</li>
                            <li>Signature is authentic</li>
                            <li>Client appears competent to give consent.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Legal Protections in Nursing Practise</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Laws and strategies are in place to protect the nurse against litigation.</li>
                            <li>Providing safe, competent practice by following the nurse practice and standards of practice is a major legal safe guard for nurses.</li>
                            <li>Accurate and complete documentation is also a critical component of legal protection of the nurse.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Good Samaritan Acts</h3>
                        <p>Good Samaritan acts are laws designed to protect health care providers who provide assistance at the scene of an emergency against claims of malpractice unless it can be shown that there was a gross departure from the normal standard of care or willful wrongdoing on their part.</p>
                        <h4>Guidelines for Emergency Care</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limit actions to those normally considered first aid, if possible.</li>
                            <li>Do not perform actions that you do not know how to do.</li>
                            <li>Offer assistance, but do not insist.</li>
                            <li>Have someone go for or call for additional help.</li>
                            <li>Do not leave the scene until the injured person leaves or another qualified person takes over.</li>
                            <li>Do not accept any compensation.</li>
                        </ul>
