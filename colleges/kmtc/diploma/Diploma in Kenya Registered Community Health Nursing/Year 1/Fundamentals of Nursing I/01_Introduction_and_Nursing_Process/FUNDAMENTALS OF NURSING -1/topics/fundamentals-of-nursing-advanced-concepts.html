                        <p>Accurate diagnosis rests firmly upon the foundation of a thoughtful and inclusive history and a competently performed physical examination.</p>
                        
                        <h3>History Taking</h3>
                        <p>Good history taking is an important first step in treating the patient. It is a key component of patient assessment, enabling the delivery of high-quality care.</p>

                        <h4>Components of a Comprehensive Patient History</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chief Complaint (CC):</strong> Why the patient is seeking care.</li>
                            <li><strong>History of Present Illness (HPI):</strong> Using mnemonics like OPQRST (Onset, Provocation, Quality, Region/Radiation, Severity, Timing) or SOCRATES (Site, Onset, Character, Radiation, Associations, Timing, Exacerbating/Relieving factors, Severity).</li>
                            <li><strong>Past Medical History:</strong> Previous illnesses, surgeries, injuries, hospitalizations, immunizations, allergies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family History:</strong> Health status of parents, siblings, children; history of diseases in the family.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Physical Examination</h3>
                        <p>Physical assessment findings, or objective data, are obtained through the use of four specific diagnostic techniques: inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.</p>

                        <h4>Assessment Techniques</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> Critical observation using all senses. Look at color, shape, symmetry, position, and note any odors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Palpation:</strong> Light and deep touch to assess skin temperature, texture, moisture, tenderness, and organ characteristics.</li>
                            <li><strong>Percussion:</strong> Striking the body surface to produce sounds that indicate if tissue is air-filled, fluid-filled, or solid.</li>
                            <li><strong>Auscultation:</strong> Listening to sounds produced by the body, usually with a stethoscope (e.g., heart sounds, breath sounds, bowel sounds).</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li><strong>Planning:</strong> Prioritize problems/diagnoses, formulate goals/desired outcomes, select nursing interventions, and write nursing orders. Goals should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound).</li>
                            <li><strong>Implementing:</strong> Reassess the client, determine the need for assistance, implement nursing interventions, supervise delegated care, and document activities. This is the "doing" phase.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluating:</strong> Collect data related to outcomes, compare data with outcomes, relate nursing actions to client goals, draw conclusions about problem status, and continue, modify, or terminate the client's care plan.</li>

                            <li><strong>Nursing:</strong> The attributes, characteristics, and actions of the nurse providing care.</li>

                        <h3>Major Theorists and Their Models</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Florence Nightingale:</strong> Environmental Theory. Linked health with five environmental factors: pure air, pure water, efficient drainage, cleanliness, and light.</li>
                            <li><strong>Virginia Henderson:</strong> Definition of Nursing. Conceptualized the nurse's role as assisting individuals to gain independence in meeting 14 fundamental needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dorothea Orem:</strong> Self-Care Deficit Theory. Focuses on the concepts of self-care, self-care deficit, and nursing systems (wholly compensatory, partly compensatory, supportive-educative).</li>
                            <li><strong>Betty Neuman:</strong> Systems Model. Views a client as an open system's relationship to stress, reaction to it, and reconstitution factors. Interventions are based on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hildegard Peplau:</strong> Interpersonal Relations Model. Focuses on the therapeutic relationship between the nurse and client, which evolves in four phases: orientation, identification, exploitation, and resolution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Martha Rogers:</strong> Science of Unitary Human Beings. Views humans as irreducible, indivisible, pan-dimensional energy fields integral with the universe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Imogene King:</strong> Theory of Goal Attainment. Describes a dynamic, interpersonal relationship in which a person grows and develops to attain certain life goals, set mutually by the nurse and client.</li>
                        </ul>
