                        <p>You have chosen to be a nurse. What does it mean?</p>
                        <h3>Who is a nurse?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Nurse is a person who has completed a program of basic generalized nursing education and authorized by appropriate regulatory authority to practice nursing.</li>
                            <li>The word nurse has its roots in the Latin noun nutrix which means "nursing mother", often referring to a wet nurse. The French term nourrice also referred to a woman who suckled a child.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Definitions</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The word nursing itself is derived from the Latin nutrire "to nourish".</li>
                            <li>The spirit of nursing has no sexual boundaries. Human beings of both sexes have a natural tendency to respond to helplessness or a threat to life from disease or injury (Donahue, 1996).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Nursing is.....</h3>
                        <p>The use of clinical judgement in the provision of care to enable people to improve, maintain, or recover health, to cope with health problems, and to achieve the best possible quality of life, whatever their disease or disability, until death.</p>
                        <h3>Nursing is.....</h3>
                        <p>An intellectual, physical, emotional and moral process which includes the identification of nursing needs; therapeutic interventions and personal care; information, education, advice and advocacy; and physical, emotional and spiritual support.</p>
                        <p>In addition to direct patient care, nursing practice includes management, teaching, and policy and knowledge development.</p>
                        <h3>Nursing is.....</h3>
                        <p>"The unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health or its recovery (or to peaceful death) that he would perform unaided if he had the necessary strength, will, or knowledge and to do this in such a way as to help him gain independence as rapidly as possible. (Virginia Henderson)</p>
                        <h3>Nursing is.....</h3>
                        <p>Act of using the environment of the patient to assist him in his recovery. (Florence Nightingale)</p>
                        <h3>NURSING (as a science)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the scientific knowledge and skills in assisting an individual to achieve optimal health.</li>
                            <li>It is the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to actual or potential problems</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>NURSING (as an art)</h3>
                        <p>"Nursing...its very principle lies in the creative imagination, the sensitive spirit, and the intelligent understanding that provides the very foundation for effective nursing care". Donahue(1985)</p>
                        <h3>Nursing is...</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nursing is caring</li>
                            <li>Nursing is an art</li>
                            <li>Nursing is a science</li>
                            <li>Nursing is client-centered</li>
                            <li>Nursing is holistic</li>
                            <li>Nursing is adaptive</li>
                            <li>Nursing is concerned with health promotion, health maintenance, and health restoration</li>
                            <li>Nursing is a helping profession</li>

                            <li>Nursing began as women provided for their families' health needs.</li>
                            <li>Documentation of the profession is available only for the last 150 years.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>History of Nursing</h3>
                        <p>The nursing profession has developed throughout history, seeing a transformation in practice, types of caregivers, roles, and policy changes, but nursing remains a profession of caring and service to those in need.</p>
                        <p>The earliest nurses never attended nursing school; they were often nuns or other women who provided care for the sick, poor, or homeless without family support.</p>
                        <p>Women were frequently called in to work as midwives to help deliver babies, or as wet nurses to breastfeed.</p>
                        <p>During the Middle Ages, early hospitals were operated by nurses who were often affiliated with religious organizations.</p>
                        <p>Many of these institutions were places for patients to die, with nurses providing comfort during the final hours.</p>
                        <p>In the 18th and 19th centuries, the nursing profession expanded to include care of soldiers during many prominent wars.</p>
                        <p>In 1853, Florence Nightingale served as a nurse during the Crimean War, during which she not only cared for the injured, but set standards of cleanliness in the areas where she worked; her sanitary reforms reduced the overall incidence of infection where they were implemented.</p>
                        <p>At the end of the 19 th century, more nurses began to work toward changing policy in leadership and education in nursing schools, recognizing their role as more than that of a bedside caregiver.</p>
                        <p>By implementing change, many nurses went beyond the scope of care to educate those in leadership about the need for prevention and to reach some groups of people that may have fallen through the cracks.</p>
                        <p>In 1893, Lillian Wald began promoting the role of the public health nurse to help those living outside of the hospital setting; and in 1925, Mary Breckinridge started the Frontier Nursing Service to help some of the poor and destitute living in rural parts of America.</p>
                        <p>During the 20th century, nursing continued to evolve, with the addition of new programs and professional organizations designed to specifically address some of the challenges of the nursing profession.</p>
                        <p>Nursing programs changed to offer students new courses to become licensed practical nurses and to require certification and testing to become registered nurses.</p>
                        <p>Nursing schools began to evolve from traditional hospital-based programs to university-level curricula. Nurses began to gain further education in the form of advanced degrees.</p>

                            <li>English: After the Crimean war, Florence Nightingale received funding to start a school of nursing St. Thomas Hospital. School administration separate from hospital administration.</li>
                            <li>United States: school under hospital administration ; apprenticeship program. Pupil nurses staffed the hospitals. Program length initially 2 years, increased to 3 years. Seen as women's work. Service first, Education second.</li>

                        <h3>The Nightingale Pledge</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I solemnly pledge myself before God and in the presence of this assembly, to pass my life in purity and to practice my profession faithfully.</li>
                            <li>I will abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous, and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful drug.</li>

                        <h3>Florence Nightingale's contribution in nursing</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Florence Nightingale brought nursing from a disreputable and immoral vocation into the honest and ethical profession that is enjoyed today by emphasizing strict morals in the personal and work lives of her nursing students.</li>
                            <li>Nightingale viewed nurses as "educators, political and social advocates, health promoters, facilitators, leaders, administrators, researchers, statisticians, and mangers"</li>
                            <li>Her contributions to modern nursing are felt today. From proper wound care and the sterile conditions of the modern operating room to the current shift from hospital care to outpatient and homehealth care</li>
                            <li>She started the first sectarian school of nursing. Before that, nursing schools were religious in nature or military orders for men. The Nightingale School of Nursing was funded through donations largely from the British soldiers she aided during the war.</li>
                            <li>She was also an early researcher. "She used statistics to analyze social conditions and the effectiveness of public policy and then to influence the allocation of resources."</li>
                            <li>Nightingale was a prolific writer, authoring texts, journals, reports and more than 200 personal letters to accomplish her goals. Her book, Notes on Nursing: What it is, What it is Not, was used as a nursing textbook for decades. It emphasized her focus on the environmental aspects of nursing-pure air, light, cleanliness, pure water and efficient drainage.</li>
