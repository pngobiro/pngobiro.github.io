                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Positioning a client in various positions is done for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Some of the reasons include promoting comfort, restoring body function, preventing deformities, relieving pressure, preventing muscle strain, restoring proper respiration and circulation, and giving nursing treatment.</p>

                        <h3>Guidelines for Positioning</h3>
                        <h4>Positioning the Client for Comfort</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Maintain functional client body alignment.</li>
                            <li>Maintain client safety.</li>
                            <li>Reassure the client to promote comfort and cooperation.</li>
                            <li>Properly handle the client's body to prevent pain or injury.</li>
                            <li>Follow proper body mechanics.</li>
                            <li>Obtain assistance, if needed to move heavy or immobile clients.</li>
                            <li>Follow specific orders.</li>
                            <li>Do not use special devices (e.g. Splints, traction) unless ordered for examination and treatment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Outcomes of Safe Positioning</h4>
                        <p>Outcomes of safe and appropriate positioning should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Optimal exposure of the surgical site</li>
                            <li>Airway management, ventilation and monitoring access for the anesthesia care provider</li>
                            <li>Physiologic safety for the patient</li>
                            <li>Maintenance of patient dignity by controlling unnecessary exposure</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Common Patient Positions</h3>
                        <h4>Horizontal Recumbent Position</h4>
                        <p>This position is required for most physical examinations. The client lies on the back with the legs extended. The arms are placed, folded on the chest, or along side the body.</p>

                        <p><strong>Body Mechanics:</strong> is the effort; coordinated, and safe use of the body to produce motion and maintain balance during activity.</p>
                        <h3>Proper Body Mechanics</h3>
                        <p>Use of the safest and most efficient methods of moving and lifting is called body mechanics. This means applying mechanical principles of movements to the human body.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Basic Principles of Body Mechanics</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>It is easier to pull, push, or roll an object than to lift it. The movement should be smooth and continuous, rather than jerky.</li>
                            <li>Often less energy or force is required to keep an object moving than it is to start and stop it.</li>
                            <li>It takes less effort to lift an object if the nurse works as close to it as possible. Use the strong leg and arm muscles as much as possible. Use back muscles, which are not as strong, as little as possible. Avoid reaching.</li>
                            <li>The nurse rocks backward or forward on the feet and with his or her body as a force for pulling or pushing.</li>
                            <li>Plan the move or transfer carefully. Free the surrounding area of obstacles and move the required equipment near the head or foot of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Obtain assistance of other people or use mechanical devices.</li>
                            <li>Adjust the working area to waist level and keep the body close to the area; elevate adjustable beds.</li>
                            <li>Always face the direction of the movement.</li>
                            <li>Start any body movement with proper alignment.</li>
                            <li>Before moving an object, increase stability by widening your stance and flexing your knees, hips and ankles.</li>
                            <li>Avoid working against gravity. Push, pull, roll or turn objects instead of lifting them.</li>
                            <li>Use your gluteal and leg muscles rather than sacrospinal muscles of the back to exert an upward thrust when lifting.</li>
                            <li>When pushing an object, enlarge the base of support by moving the front foot forward.</li>
                            <li>When moving objects, hold them as close as possible to your centre of gravity. The person's center of gravity is located in the pelvic area.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Lifting Patients</h3>
                        <h4>Lifting Consideration</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider the weight of object/patient.</li>
                            <li>Communicate with partner.</li>
                            <li>Identify the need for help before lifting.</li>
                            <li>Have a plan.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Guidelines for Safe Lifting</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Consider the weight of the patient together with the weight of the stretcher or other equipment being carried and determine if additional help is needed.</li>
                            <li>Know your physical ability and limitations. Know your combined ability with your partner. If absolutely necessary, you can ask bystanders to help.</li>
                            <li>Lift without twisting. Avoid any kind of swinging motion when lifting as well.</li>
                            <li>Position your feet shoulder width apart with one foot slightly in front of the other.</li>
                            <li>Communicate clearly and frequently with your partner. Decide ahead of time how you will move the patient and what verbal commands will be used. Also, tell the patient what you will be doing ahead of time. A startled patient may reach out or grab something and cause a loss of balance.</li>

                        <h4>Guidelines for Carrying Patients</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whenever possible, move patients on devices that can be rolled.</li>
                            <li>Minimize the distance needed to carry patients.</li>
                            <li>Work in a coordinated manner with your partner.</li>
                            <li>Keep the weight as close to your body as possible.</li>
                            <li>Keep your back in a locked-in position and refrain from twisting.</li>
                            <li>Flex at the hips, NOT the waist, and bend at the knees.</li>
                            <li>Do not hyperextend your back (do not lean back from the waist).</li>
                            <li>Try to lift with a partner that has similar height and strength.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Steps of Proper Lifting</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Let your legs do the work.</li>
                            <li>Pick the object up from between your knees. Keep the load close to your body and then stand up, using your leg muscles. Keep your back as straight as possible and tighten your abdominal muscles as you rise from the floor.</li>
                            <li>Avoid twisting.</li>
                            <li>When you're standing and ready to move, hold the load close to your body to lessen the strain on your lower back. Avoid turning or twisting while holding the load. Turn by pivoting your feet, not your back. Avoid lifting heavy loads above your waist.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Equipment for Moving Patients</h3>
                        <h4>Wheeled Stretcher</h4>
                        <p>Stretchers are usually adjustable to different heights and different angles. Some can be adjusted to elevate the legs (Trendelenberg position). Additional equipment may be attached to the stretchers including oxygen, IV lines, and cardiac monitors or defibrillators.</p>
                        <p>Guidelines for transferring a patient by stretcher:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Push the stretcher with the patient's feet forward.</li>
                            <li>Pull it head-first into elevators.</li>
                            <li>Pull it feet-first down ramps.</li>
                            <li>Never leave a patient on a stretcher unattended.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>Safety Measures with Wheelchairs</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ALWAYS LOCK THE BRAKES WHEN TRANSFERRING</li>
                            <li>CLEAN THE WHEELCHAIR ON A REGULAR BASIS</li>
                            <li>MOVE THE FOOTRESTS OUT OF THE WAY WHEN TRANSFERRING</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Transferring a Patient Between Chair and Bed</h3>
                        <p>Your patients may need to be transferred between the bed and a chair or wheelchair. Remember the following points:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient should wear footwear with nonskid soles to avoid slipping.</li>
                            <li>Always get help if the patient is unable to assist or is very heavy. Encourage the patient to help, however, whenever possible.</li>
                            <li>If you are moving a patient to a vinyl-covered chair, cover the seat and back with a bath blanket. This will make the patient more comfortable by absorbing perspiration. Placing a pillow on the seat will serve the same purpose.</li>
                            <li>Determine if the patient has a weaker side. If so, allow the patient to lead with the strong side. Make sure the patient can see the chair or bed that you are transferring to.</li>
                            <li>DO NOT ALLOW THE PERSON TO PUT HIS ARMS AROUND YOUR NECK.</li>
                            <li>MAKE SURE YOU LOCK THE WHEELS ON THE BED AND WHEELCHAIR.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Proper Positioning in a Chair</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>THE PATIENT IN A CHAIR SHOULD SIT UP STRAIGHT.</li>
                            <li>THE BACKS OF HIS KNEES SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM THE SEAT OF THE CHAIR.</li>
                            <li>HIS LOWER BACK SHOULD REST AGAINST THE BACK OF THE CHAIR.</li>
                            <li>HIS FEET SHOULD EITHER REST ON THE FLOOR OR ON A STOOL.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        <h4>Wheelchairs:</h4>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Make sure the chair is locked when removing or seating the person.</li>
                            <li>Pull the wheelchair backwards up steps or curbs.</li>
                            <li>Adjust the height of the foot pedals so the person is sitting at a 90 degree angle at the hip and knee.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4>Modes of Lifting patients</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Through arm wrist crossed over grip</li>
                            <li>Thumb through grip</li>

                        <h4>IF THE PATIENT CAN ASSIST:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HAVE THE PATIENT GRASP THE HEADBOARD AND BEND HIS KNEES.</li>
                            <li>PLACE YOUR FOREARMS UNDER HIS SHOULDERS AND KNEES.</li>
                            <li>LIFT AT THE COUNT OF THREE.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_26_4087327da418d6677da7g-0277-1.jpg" alt="A nurse assisting a patient to move up in bed." class="content-image" style="max-width: 50%;">
                        </figure>
                        <h4>IF THE PATIENT HAS A TRAPEZE ON THE BED:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HAVE THE PATIENT GRASP THE TRAPEZE AND BEND AT THE KNEES.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>USING A LIFT SHEET</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A LIFT SHEET MAKES LIFTING EASIER.</li>
                            <li>HELPS PREVENT FRICTION AGAINST THE PATIENT'S SKIN.</li>
                            <li>TAKES TWO WORKERS TO LIFT.</li>
                            <li>IF PATIENT CAN HELP, HAVE HIM BEND HIS KNEES.</li>
                            <li>USE FOR PERSONS WHO CAN NOT HELP WITH THE MOVE.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        <h3>Patient Mobility Assistive Devices</h3>
                        <p>Clients who are unable to ambulate independently can use devices designed to help them walk safely. Determination of which device to use is based on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Upper arm strength</li>
                            <li>Endurance (stamina)</li>
                            <li>Presence or absence of one-sided weakness</li>
                            <li>Weight-bearing ability</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Turning Patients</h3>
                        <h4>Reasons for turning frequently</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provides exercise for muscles</li>
                            <li>Stimulates circulation</li>
                            <li>Helps prevent decubitis ulcers and contractures</li>
                            <li>Provides comfort to the patient</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>General Principles for Turning the Adult Patient</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sometimes the physician will specify how often to turn a patient.</li>
                            <li>A schedule can be set up for turning the adult patient throughout his "awake" hours.</li>
                            <li>The patient should be rotated through four positions (unless a particular position is contraindicated).</li>
                            <li>Record the position change each time to ensure that all positions are used.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One example of a schedule for turning would be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>10 a.m Prone position</li>
                            <li>12 p.m. Left Sim's position</li>
                            <li>2 p.m Supine position</li>
                            <li>4 p.m. Right Sim's position</li>
                            <li>6 p.m. Prone position</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Certain conditions may make it impossible to turn the patient.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turning may be impossible if the patient has fractures that require traction appliances.</li>
                            <li>Turning may be harmful to patients with spinal injuries.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In these cases, you need to rub the back by lifting the patient slightly off the bed and massaging with your hand held flat.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Logrolling</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Logrolling is a technique used to turn a patient whose body must at all times be kept in a straight alignment (like a log).</li>
                            <li>This technique is used for the patient who has a spinal injury.</li>
                            <li>Logrolling is used for the patient who must be turned in one movement, without twisting.</li>
                            <li>Logrolling requires two people, or if the patient is large, three people.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>

                        <h4>Logrolling Technique</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash your hands.</li>
                            <li>Approach and identify the patient (by checking the identification band) and explain the procedure (using simple terms and pointing out the benefits).</li>
                            <li>Provide privacy.</li>
                            <li>Position the bed. The bed should be in the flat position at a comfortable working height.</li>
                            <li>Lower the side rail on the side of the body at which you are working. Position yourself with your feet apart and your knees flexed close to the side of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Fold the patient's arms across his chest.</li>
                            <li>Place your arms under the patient so that a major portion of the patient's weight is centered between your arms. The arm of one nurse should support the patient's head and neck.</li>
                            <li>On the count of three, move the patient to the side of the bed, rocking backward on your heels and keeping the patient's body in correct alignment.</li>
                            <li>Raise the side rail on that side of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Move to the other side of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Place a pillow under the patient's head and another between his legs.</li>
                            <li>Position the patient's near arm toward you.</li>
                            <li>Grasp the far side of the patient's body with your hands evenly distributed from the shoulder to the thigh.</li>
                            <li>On the count of three, roll the patient to a lateral position, rocking backward onto your heels.</li>
                            <li>Place pillows in front of and behind the patient's trunk to support his alignment in the lateral position.</li>
                            <li>Provide for the patient's comfort and safety. Position the call bell. Place personal items within reach. Be sure the side rails are up and secure.</li>
                            <li>Report and record as appropriate.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Transfers</h3>
                        <p>Patients are transferred to wheelchairs, chairs, and stretchers. Correct procedures must be followed to prevent injury to both patient and worker.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mechanical Lifts</h3>

                            <li>Frequently used to transfer weak or paralyzed patients.</li>
                            <li>Check straps, clasps, and sling for any defects.</li>
                            <li>Use smooth even movements while operating lift.</li>
                            <li>Reassure frightened patients that lift is safe.</li>
                            <li>Move unnecessary furniture out of the way during transfers.</li>

                        <p><strong>Nutrition</strong> is the process by which the body metabolizes and utilizes nutrients.</p>
                        <p><strong>Digestion</strong> refers to the mechanical and chemical processes that convert nutrients into a physically absorbable state.</p>
                        <p><strong>Absorption</strong> is the process by which the end products of digestion—monosaccharides (simple sugars), amino acids, glycerol, fatty acid chains, vitamins, minerals, and water—pass through the epithelial membranes in the small and large intestines into the blood or lymph systems.</p>
                        <p>Understanding the role of basic nutrients provides the foundation for selecting foods that promote health. Selecting the healthiest forms of each of these nutrients and eating them in proper balance enables the body to function at its optimal level of health.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Diet</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Nothing by Mouth/ Nil per Oral (NPO):</strong> This intervention is prescribed prior to surgery and certain diagnostic procedures, to rest the GI tract (and prevent diarrhea or vomiting), or when the client's nutritional problem has not been identified.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clear-Liquid Diet:</strong> Dairy products are not allowed. The client is allowed to ingest only liquids that keep the GI tract empty (no residue), such as water, apple juice, and gelatin. Prescribed primarily for surgical clients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Liquid Diet:</strong> A liquid (or full liquid diet) consisting of various types of liquids is prescribed mainly for postoperative clients because of calorie and nutrient considerations. If tolerated, the diet is progressed as tolerated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Soft Diet:</strong> Promotes the mechanical digestion of foods. Prescribed for clients experiencing difficulty in chewing and swallowing, or with impaired digestion/absorption (e.g., ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease). Foods to avoid include nuts, seeds, raw fruits/vegetables, fried foods, and whole grains.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pureed Diet:</strong> Provides food that has been blenderized to a smooth consistency. Prescribed for clients with dysphagia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mechanical Soft Diet:</strong> Similar to a soft diet but allows more variation (e.g., chili beans). Prescribed for clients with difficulty chewing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Low-Residue Diet:</strong> Reduced fiber and cellulose. Prescribed to decrease GI mucosal irritation (e.g., diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis). Foods to avoid are raw fruits (except bananas), vegetables, seeds, plant fiber, and whole grains. Dairy limited to two servings a day.</li>
                            <li><strong>High-Fiber Diet:</strong> Opposite of low-residue foods. Integral for diverticulosis treatment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Liberal Bland Diet:</strong> Eliminates chemical and mechanical food irritants, such as fried foods, alcohol, and caffeine.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fat-Controlled Diet:</strong> Reduces total fat by replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fats and restricting cholesterol. Prescribed for atherosclerosis, heart disease, and obesity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sodium-Restricted Diet:</strong> Mild (2-3 g), moderate (1000 mg), strict (500 mg), severe (250 mg). Prescribed for excess fluid volume, hypertension, heart failure, MI, and renal failure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lactose Intolerance Diet:</strong> Eliminates milk and all dairy products except yogurt.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Nursing Measures that Promote Patient Feeding</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Before bringing the meal tray, ask whether the client needs to void or have a bowel movement.</li>
                            <li>Provide hygiene measures before serving the meal tray.</li>
                            <li>Position the client comfortably, preferably in a chair.</li>
                            <li>Ask about eating habits and food preferences.</li>
                            <li>Ensure foods are served at the correct temperature.</li>
                            <li>Provide assistance if needed with utensils or opening containers.</li>
                            <li>Provide adequate time for clients with difficulty chewing or swallowing. Ensure someone is present.</li>
                            <li>Document the type and amount of food taken.</li>
                            <li>Remove the tray after the meal and provide hygiene measures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Tube Feeding</h3>
                        <h4>Types of Feeding Tubes</h4>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Do's and Don'ts of Tube Feeding</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not hurry/force feeding to avoid abdominal distention & discomfort.</li>
                            <li>Use clean not sterile technique.</li>
                            <li>Formula should be at room temperature (Warm = bacterial growth; Cold = gastric cramping).</li>
                            <li>Formula can hang for 8 hrs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Procedure for Checking Tube Placement</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>X-ray is the best and most accurate.</li>
                            <li>Air insertion and listen with stethoscope.</li>
                            <li>Aspirate gastric contents (should be less than 50 mls). Note - any gastric contents should be returned to the stomach.</li>
                            <li>Check pH of aspirate with pH paper (Stomach is acidic 1-4; Intestine is 7 or greater).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Feeding is not given if no bowel sounds are heard, abdomen is distended, too much residual, or tube dislodged.</p>

                        <h4>Position for Tube Feeding</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fowler's position before and after to prevent aspiration.</li>
                            <li>Regulate the flow of the feeding (Gravity/ feeding pump).</li>
                            <li>Flush tube well post feeding.</li>
                            <li>Clamp tube post flushing.</li>
                            <li>Monitor intake/output.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Elimination patterns are essential to maintain health. The urinary and gastrointestinal systems together provide for the elimination of body wastes. During periods of stress and illness, clients experience alterations in elimination patterns. The nurse's role encompasses teaching clients self-care activities to promote independence and health.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Factors Affecting Elimination</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Control over bladder and bowel movements is typically mastered by age 4.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Adequate fluid and fiber intake are critical. Inadequate fluid intake is a primary cause of constipation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Enhances muscle tone, leading to better bladder and sphincter control and promoting peristalsis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Diuretics increase urine production. Antidepressants, antihypertensives, and antihistamines may lead to urinary retention.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Urinary Elimination</h3>
                        <p>Continence in the adult requires anatomic integrity of the urinary system, nervous control of the detrusor muscle, and a competent sphincter mechanism. Urinary incontinence occurs when abnormalities of one or more of these factors cause an uncontrolled loss of urine.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Common Urinary Elimination Alterations</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urinary retention</li>
                            <li>Urinary incontinence (stress, total, acute)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Urinary Catheterization</h4>
                        <p>Urinary catheterization is an aseptic procedure but is also the most common cause of hospital-acquired infections. Patients should be catheterized only if clinically indicated.</p>

                        <h3>Fecal Elimination</h3>
                        <p>Defecation is the expulsion of feces from the anus and rectum. Normal feces are made up of about 75% water and 25% solid mass.</p>

                        <h4>Fecal Elimination Problems</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Constipation:</strong> fewer than three bowel movements per week.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diarrhea:</strong> passage of liquid feces and an increased frequency of defecation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bowel incontinence:</strong> loss of voluntary ability to control fecal and gaseous discharges.</li>
                            <li><strong>Flatulence:</strong> presence of excessive flatus in the intestines.</li>
                        </ul>
