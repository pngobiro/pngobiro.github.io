                        <p>Nursing is a profession that requires extensive training in patient care and procedures. One of these tasks is learning how to make a bed properly, especially since beds are such an integral part of the patient's world while staying in the hospital.</p>

                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>A hospital bed is the piece of equipment most frequently used by the hospitalized patient. Hospital beds are also found in long-term-care facilities, as well as patients' homes. The ideal hospital bed should be selected for its impact on patients' comfort, safety, medical condition, and ability to change positions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Importance of Bed Making</h3>

                        <h3>General Guidelines for Bed Making</h3>
                        <p>a. Gather all the required linen and accessories before making the bed (Sheets, Pillowcases, Blankets, Bedspread, Extra pillows).</p>
                        <p>b. Avoid shaking the linen to prevent the spread of microorganisms and dust particles.</p>
                        <p>c. Avoid placing linen, clean or dirty, on another patient's bed.</p>
                        <p>d. Do not place dirty linen on the floor.</p>
                        <p>e. Do not hold dirty linen against your uniform.</p>
                        <p>f. Always use good body mechanics; raise the bed to its highest position to make bed-making easier.</p>
                        <p>g. Stay on one side of the bed until it is completely made; then move to the other side and finish the bed. This saves time and steps.</p>
                        <p>h. Observe the patient and document any nursing observations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check for areas of redness that may lead to decubiti formation.</li>
                            <li>Note tolerance of activity level while out of bed.</li>
                            <li>Note observations about the physical and emotional status of the patient.</li>
                            <li>Note any patient teaching or reinforced teaching given and the patient's response.</li>
                            <li>Check for drainage, wetness, or other body fluids and record observations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Rules to be Observed When Making Beds</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All equipment should be collected before starting.</li>
                            <li>Two nurses are required and they should work in harmony.</li>
                            <li>The bed should be made in such a way that the patient can be put in it without difficulty.</li>
                            <li>The bed should be free from crumbs and creases and should provide maximum comfort to the patient.</li>
                            <li>Pillows and other bed accessories should be well arranged to give support where necessary.</li>
                            <li>The patient's face should never be covered by sheets or blankets.</li>
                            <li>The patient must never be exposed.</li>
                            <li>Extra assistance should be available and, if necessary, one should be called upon to help lift the patient.</li>
                            <li>When pillows are being shaken, the nurse should turn away from the patient.</li>
                            <li>Any conversation during bed making should not be on personal matters between the nurses.</li>
                            <li>The open side of a pillowcase should be away from the main door of the ward.</li>
                            <li>Always have a dirty linen bin at hand in which to put dirty linen.</li>
                            <li>Dirty linen should not be carried across the ward to prevent cross infection.</li>
                            <li>Allow room for the patient's feet for free movement or turning when placing the top sheet over the patient.</li>
                            <li>Always wash hands before and after bed making.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Specific Methods of Bed-making</h3>
                        <h4>Unoccupied (Closed) Bed</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Raise the bed to a comfortable working height, if adjustable.</li>
                            <li>Lower siderails, if present.</li>
                            <li>Remove pillows and pillowcases. Set the pillows aside in a clean area.</li>
                            <li>Fold and set the blankets and spreads aside (to be reused).</li>
                            <li>Loosen the linen along the edges of the bed, and move toward the end of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Wash the mattress if necessary, turn the mattress to the opposite side if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Place the bottom sheet.</li>
                            <li>Place a draw sheet on the center of the bed, if it is needed. Tuck in the free edge on one side, then stretch and tuck on the opposite side.</li>
                            <li>Place the top sheet, blanket (if used), and bedspread, positioning them evenly. Miter the bottom corners, tucking all three parts together, leaving the loose ends free.</li>
                            <li>Fanfold the top linen back to the foot of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Place a clean pillowcase over the pillow and place it at the head of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Adjust the bed to its lowest position, if adjustable.</li>
                            <li>Reposition the head up slightly, if the patient prefers.</li>
                            <li>Raise the siderails opposite the side of the bed where the patient will enter.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Occupied (Open) Bed</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Wash your hands.</li>
                            <li>Identify the patient, explain the procedure, and ensure cooperation.</li>
                            <li>Check the condition of the bed linens to determine supplies needed.</li>
                            <li>Provide for the patient's privacy.</li>
                            <li>Obtain the necessary linen.</li>
                            <li>Place the bath blanket over the patient and the top cover.</li>
                            <li>Loosen the top bedding from the foot of the bed and remove it.</li>
                            <li>Move the mattress to the head of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Move the patient to the distal side of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Make the bed on one side.</li>
                            <li>Move or turn the patient to the clean side of the bed, and finish making the bed on the opposite side. Place the clean linen on top, and remove the bath blanket.</li>
                            <li>Attach the patient's signal cord within reach.</li>
                            <li>Provide for the patient's safety and comfort.</li>
                            <li>Tidy the room.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Anesthetic, Surgical, or Post-Operative Bed</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Gather all needed supplies.</li>
                            <li>Make the bed as though you are making an unoccupied bed, except that the top sheet and blanket are not tucked under the mattress at the foot of the bed, and the corners are not mitered.</li>
                            <li>Fanfold the top covers to the side or to the foot of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Place a towel or disposable pad at the head of the bed to protect the sheet if the patient should vomit.</li>
                            <li>It is a good idea to place a drawsheet on the bed as it can be used to move the patient more easily.</li>
                            <li>Place the pillow(s) on a chair near the bed or in an upright position at the head of the bed.</li>
                            <li>Leave the bed in the high position.</li>
                            <li>Lock the brakes on the bed.</li>
                            <li>Move the furniture away from the bed for easier access for the recovery room stretcher and personnel.</li>
                            <li>Make certain an emesis basin is readily available and suction is available where indicated.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Body Mechanics in Bed Making</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Know limitations. Don't lift, turn, or move a resident alone if in doubt.</li>
                            <li>Get close to the side of the bed; don't make it from the top or bottom.</li>
                            <li>Keep back straight, knees bent, feet apart.</li>
                            <li>Move feet to turn in the desired direction & avoid twisting your back.</li>
                            <li>Raise the bed to a comfortable height.</li>
                            <li>Make one side of the bed before beginning the other side.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Pressure area care refers to moving the patient into another position to relieve pressure on a part of the body and prevent the development of a pressure ulcer or 'bed sore'. One of the best ways of preventing a pressure ulcer is to reduce or relieve pressure on areas that are vulnerable (e.g., bony parts of the body). This is done by moving around and changing position as much as possible.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Common Pressure Area Sites</h3>
                        <p>Common sites include the sacrum, back, buttocks, heels, back of the head, and elbows. Other sites include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Occiput, Acromion process, Scapula, Olecranon</li>
                            <li>Ischial tuberosity, Thoracic vertebrae, Lumbar vertebrae</li>
                            <li>Iliac crest, Coccyx, Trochanter</li>
                            <li>Lateral tibia condyle, Medial tibia condyle</li>
                            <li>Metatarsals (toes), Calcaneus (heel)</li>
                            <li>Medial malleolus (inner ankle), Lateral malleolus (outer ankle)</li>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Method</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wash each area, massage well with the palm of your hand using soap.</li>
                            <li>Rinse each area, dry it and apply powder, cream or vaseline depending on the patient's need.</li>
                            <li>If needed, the patient may be seated on an air ring or soft pillow to relieve pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Pressure Ulcers (Decubitus Ulcers)</h3>
                        <p>A pressure ulcer is any lesion caused by unrelieved pressure that results in damage to underlying tissue. Also known as decubitus ulcers, pressure sores or bed sores.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>Etiology of Pressure Ulcers</h4>
                        <p>Occur due to localized ischaemia. When blood cannot reach the tissues, the cells are deprived of oxygen and nutrients. The waste products of metabolism accumulate in the cells and the tissue consequently dies. Prolonged, unrelieved pressure also damages the small blood vessels.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Risk Factors</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Immobility:</strong> reduction in the amount and control of movement a person has e.g due to paralysis, weakness, pain.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inadequate nutrition:</strong> causes weight loss, muscle atrophy and loss of subcutaneous tissue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fecal and urinary incontinence:</strong> moisture promotes skin maceration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decreased mental status:</strong> e.g unconscious or heavily sedated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diminished sensation:</strong> paralysis, stroke.</li>
                            <li><strong>Excessive body heat:</strong> elevated body temperature increases the metabolic rate thus increasing the cells' need for oxygen.</li>
                            <li><strong>Advanced age:</strong> brings several changes in the skin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic medical conditions:</strong> e.g Diabetes Mellitus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other factors:</strong> poor lifting techniques, incorrect positioning, repeated injections on the same site, hard support surfaces, incorrect application of pressure relieving devices.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Wear gloves and apron.</li>
                            <li>Maintain privacy as required. Assess the oral cavity using an appropriate assessment tool. You may need a tongue depressor and a torch to carry out the assessment efficiently.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Purpose of Oral Assessment</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To provide a baseline, initial information about the condition of the patient's oral cavity.</li>
                            <li>To monitor progress of oral care/treatments.</li>
                            <li>To identify any new problems (Dougherty and Lister, 2008).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Equipment Required</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Torch, Toothbrush and paste, Tongue depressor</li>
                            <li>Cotton tipped applicator, padded applicator</li>
                            <li>Vaseline (if necessary)</li>
                            <li>Kidney dish</li>
                            <li>Suction equipment (if appropriate)</li>
                            <li>Clean procedure gloves</li>
                            <li>Tissues or wipes</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Procedure for Mouth Care</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gain consent.</li>
                            <li>Assemble equipment - soft toothbrush, toothpaste, clothing protection, receiver, glass of water for rinsing mouth, tissues.</li>
                            <li>Ask the patient to get into an upright position if possible or assist them to do this. (If the patient needs to lie flat, special care must be taken to avoid choking. The procedure should be undertaken with the patient's head turned to the side, and suction equipment should be at hand).</li>
                            <li>Wet the toothbrush head and apply a small amount of toothpaste only. Use a gentle, rotational movement to clean the inner, outer and biting surfaces of the teeth. You may also gently brush the surface of the tongue and the gums.</li>
                            <li>If the patient cannot tolerate the use of a toothbrush (e.g due to mouth tenderness) foam sticks and mouthwash can be used instead (Dougherty and Lister, 2008).</li>
                            <li>Allow the patient to take mouthfuls of water, rinse the mouth and spit into the receiver. Use tissues to dry around the mouth.</li>
                            <li>Apply moisturizer to the patient's lips if required.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Mouth Care for an Unconscious Patient</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Position:</strong> Side lying with the head of the bed lowered, so saliva automatically runs out by gravity rather than being aspirated. If the patient's head cannot be lowered, turn it to one side.</li>
                            <li>Rinse the patient's mouth by drawing about 10 ml of water or mouth wash into the syringe and injecting it gently into each side of the mouth.</li>
                            <li>If injected with force, some of it may flow down the client's throat and be aspirated into the lungs.</li>
                            <li>All the rinse solution should return; if not, suction the fluid to prevent aspiration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Denture Care</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gain consent.</li>
                            <li>Assemble equipment - gloves and apron, a denture brush or toothbrush, and denture cleaner or toothpaste.</li>
                            <li>Assess the oral cavity as above.</li>
                            <li>Remove dentures and partial dentures from the oral cavity.</li>
                            <li>Clean at a sink.</li>
                            <li>Pat dry and rinse with cold water before repositioning in the patient's mouth (Hickson 2008).</li>
                            <li>Dentures may be soaked occasionally - use a specific soaking solution and follow manufacturer's instructions. Always use a dedicated denture container, carefully labelled with the patient's details.</li>
