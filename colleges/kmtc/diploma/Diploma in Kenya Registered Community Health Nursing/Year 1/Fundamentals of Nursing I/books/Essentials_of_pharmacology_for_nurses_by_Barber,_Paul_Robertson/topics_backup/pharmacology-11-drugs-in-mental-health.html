                        <p>The aim of this chapter is to introduce you to drugs used in common mental health problems. The chapter examines three key areas of mental health intervention:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>anxiety;</li>
                            <li>depression;</li>
                            <li>psychosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Mental health issues extend into all aspects of nursing and an appreciation of the range of medications and how they work is essential for today's nurses. One in four adults in the UK experience at least one diagnosable mental health problem in any one year, and one in six experiences this at any given time (Office for National Statistics 2001). It is estimated that approximately 450 million people worldwide have a mental health problem (World Health Organization 2001).</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Anxiety</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Anxiety is a fairly common, normal and usually self-limiting emotion, with which we are all familiar. For some people however, feelings of anxiety can be intolerable and can become disabling. This level of anxiety is considered to be pathological and requires prompt diagnosis and active treatment to help the sufferer regain and maintain their previously normal lifestyle. At this level, anxiety can manifest with wide and varied symptoms, both physical and psychological.</p>
                        <p>Anxiety is not simply one illness but a group of disorders characterized by psychological symptoms such as diffuse, unpleasant and vague feelings of apprehension, often accompanied by physical symptoms of autonomic arousal such as palpitations, light-headedness, perspiration, 'butterflies' and, in some patients, restlessness.</p>
                        <p>There are six main classifications of anxiety disorders:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>panic disorder;</li>
                            <li>social phobia;</li>
                            <li>generalized anxiety disorder;</li>
                            <li>obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD);</li>
                            <li>post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD);</li>
                            <li>mixed anxiety and depressive disorder.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>An understanding of the physiological mechanisms thought to be involved in the development of pathological anxiety is vital to ensure appropriate treatment of anxiety disorders. First, it is important to understand that two brain systems appear to be involved in the generation of anxiety.</p>
                        <h3>The defence system</h3>
                        <p>The defence system controls our responses to danger. It receives stimuli related to the threat of danger and the brain interprets these stimuli and responds as required. The defence system is responsible for the so-called 'fear, fight or flight' responses. It can be a protective mechanism, whereby we can respond to threats or perceived threats and prepare the body to defend itself or to flee from the danger. It can also be activated by things which are not real threats, but are perceived as real by the anxiety sufferer and can become pathological.</p>
                        <h3>The behavioural inhibition system</h3>
                        <p>This system prevents a person from getting into danger and is responsible for avoidance behaviour. It is also involved in learning not to do dangerous things, therefore allowing future avoidance of anxiety-provoking situations. This can lead to anxiety sufferers withdrawing from reallife situations because of the fear of being placed in danger, leading to agoraphobia, claustrophobia and social isolation.</p>
                        <h3>Neurotransmitters in anxiety</h3>
                        <p>The brain is a complex organ and with respect to anxiety many different neurotransmitters are involved. These include the following monoamines:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>noradrenaline (NA);</li>
                            <li>5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin;</li>
                            <li>gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The exact role these neurotransmitters play in anxiety is not fully elucidated, but using drugs that act on these systems can be beneficial in the management of anxiety.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Medicine management of anxiety</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Although there is much commonality within the various anxiety disorders, it would be unwise to try to treat them all in the same way as they have important differences which necessitate variances in treatment. Anxiety management can be broken down into the following categories:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>non-pharmacological: psychological;</li>
                            <li>pharmacological: single and combined psychotropic and non-psychotropic treatments;</li>
                            <li>combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments;</li>
                            <li>surgical.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In reality the mainstay of anxiety treatment is pharmacological. Anxiolytic treatment should ideally be effective and quick-acting for rapid relief from the disabling symptoms. The treatment should not be too sedative as this can be as detrimental as the anxiety itself. This is achievable in the current pharmacological climate, but can often come at a price. The following drugs have all been used to treat the symptoms of anxiety; many are still in use today:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>barbiturates;</li>
                            <li>benzodiazepines;</li>
                            <li>beta blockers;</li>
                            <li>azaspirodecanediones;</li>
                            <li>antipsychotics;</li>
                            <li>antidepressants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Barbiturates</h3>
                        <p>Barbiturates are potentiators of the GABA-A receptor which has a pentameric structure. It has five sub-units which surround an ion channel which conducts chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) ions (see Figure 11.1). It is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and central nervous system. Therefore, potentiation of an inhibitory transmitter channel leads to increased inhibition, or reduced activity at the receptors the chloride ion acts on. This causes a 'dampening down' effect for all neuronal activity. When the Cl<sup>-</sup> ion channel is opened by GABA, the barbiturate drug molecule can enter the channel and causes it to remain open for a longer period of time than GABA alone would. This allows for more chloride from outside the neurone to enter it, so reducing the chance of an action potential being generated. This means that the barbiturate drugs cause a potentiation of GABA transmission and a reduction in neuronal activity.</p>

                        <p>There are downsides to using barbiturate drugs such as amobarbital (formerly amylobarbitone). They have a narrow therapeutic index, which means that the blood level of the drug needed for a beneficial effect is very close to the blood level which is toxic. This in turn means that it is easy to take too little and have no drug effect, or too much and reach toxicity. They also have addictive properties and patients can easily become dependent on them. They can also cause problems if taken with alcohol as it can increase their effects. For this reason they are very rarely used in anxiety management in modern times.</p>
                        <h3>Benzodiazepines</h3>
                        <p>For many years, the commonest and first-line pharmacological treatment for anxiety disorders was the prescription of a benzodiazepine drug. More recently this approach has changed with increased knowledge of the addictive and dependence problems and the abuse potential associated with benzodiazepines such as diazepam and temazepam. The use of these drugs has been related to significant long-term problems. The CSM issued the following advice which is incorporated in the BNF section on prescribing benzodiazepines in anxiety (2014: 68):</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>1-Benzodiazepines are indicated for the short-term relief (2-4 weeks only) of anxiety that is severe, disabling or subjecting the patient to unacceptable distress, occurring alone or in association with insomnia or short-term psychosomatic, organic or psychotic illness.</p>
                            <p>2-The use of benzodiazepines to treat short-term 'mild' anxiety is inappropriate.</p>
                            <p>3-Benzodiazepines should be used to treat insomnia only when it is severe, disabling, or causing the patient extreme distress.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>All things considered however, benzodiazepines are still one of the most effective treatments for acute, transient anxiety. Like barbiturates, these drugs potentiate the effects of GABA but do so by a different mechanism. They bind to a specific benzodiazepine binding site (or receptor) which is situated on one of the sub-units of the GABA-A receptor. Their mechanism of action is to increase the affinity of GABA which leads to an increased ability and frequency of GABA to open the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel. Unlike barbiturates, benzodiazepines need GABA to be present all the time the channel is open, not just at activation, for them to have their effect. This makes them safer than barbiturates because they have a wider therapeutic index and less chance of toxicity and accidental overdose.</p>
                        <p>For use in anxiety, doses tend to be low, with higher doses being reserved for use in insomnia. This means that the side-effect of sedation should occur at a lower incidence although for some people drowsiness is a problem.</p>
                        <p>Another major side-effect of benzodiazepines is respiratory depression, and this should be monitored on initiation of therapy.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-197-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>When a patient starts taking a benzodiazepine it is very important that you warn them of the possible sedative effects and discuss the dangers of driving or operating heavy machinery.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Beta-adrenergic blockers</h3>
                        <p>These drugs are used not to treat the central nervous system transmitters thought to be involved in anxiety, but to treat the physical symptoms that are often manifest in anxiety such as palpitations, tremors, sweating and shortness of breath. They will not affect the psychological aspects of anxiety, so the patient will still feel anxious.</p>
                        <p>There are many beta-blocking drugs, but only propranolol and oxprenolol are licensed for use in the management of anxiety. The use of these drugs may help people with mild anxiety to function in situations where before their symptoms would have proved problematic.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-198-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>If the patient also suffers from diabetes, do not forget to warn them that taking a beta blocker may inhibit the normal signs and symptoms of a hypoglycaemic attack.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Azaspirodecanediones</h3>
                        <p>Buspirone is the only drug in its class available for the treatment and management of anxiety symptoms. Its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated but it is known to affect the serotonergic receptors, inhibiting serotonergic transmission. This effect develops quickly but the anxiolytic effect does not typically occur for two to three weeks. This can be problematic in anxiety treatment as patients often cannot tolerate the delayed onset of action.</p>
                        <p>Buspirone is not associated with addiction or dependence, but is only licensed for short-term use, although it can be used for several months under specialist supervision. In practice this drug is not used alone but in conjunction with other medication and can be a useful adjunct.</p>
                        <h3>Antipsychotics</h3>
                        <p>There is evidence that certain antipsychotic drugs have positive benefit in the treatment and management of anxiety. The method by which they relieve anxiety is not known, but these drugs are associated with emotional changes and effects on symptoms such as agitation. In anxiety management they are used in doses much lower than would be needed for their antipsychotic effects. Drugs such as haloperidol, flupentixol and trifluoperazine can be used as anxiolytics and have a quick onset. They are especially useful if the patient has a diagnosis of psychosis, as their anxiety may be related to this.</p>
                        <p>Like barbiturates and benzodiazepines, some of the side-effects of antipsychotic drugs can be compounded by alcohol.</p>
                        <h3>Antidepressants</h3>
                        <p>The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have a positive effect in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, although many of these drugs are not licensed for such indications. TCAs have been used in the past for mixed anxiety/depressive disorders but they do not appear to have a significant specific anxiolytic activity.</p>
                        <p>It may be that their anxiolytic effect is related to their sedative properties. It takes two to three weeks for the anxiolytic and antidepressant effect to develop, suggesting that the mechanisms for both are related.</p>
                        <p>Another type of antidepressant, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can appropriately be used in chronic anxiety of longer than four weeks' duration. Their mechanism of action is fully explained in the section on depression. The anxiolytic action takes two to three weeks to develop which is concurrent with the onset of antidepressant effect, again suggesting that the mechanisms are related. Some SSRIs have associated increased anxiety until the antidepressant effect occurs, and for this reason concomitant use of a benzodiazepine for the first two or three weeks is often recommended in anxiety, with a low starting dose of SSRI building up as tolerated.</p>
                        <p>Treatment is usually long term and often doses are at the higher end of the dosage scale for full effect. Examples of SSRIs in common use for anxiety are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>fluoxetine and sertraline, licensed to treat anxiety symptoms accompanying depression and for OCD;</li>
                            <li>fluvoxamine, licensed for the treatment of OCD;</li>
                            <li>citalopram, licensed for the treatment of panic disorder;</li>
                            <li>paroxetine, licensed for the treatment of social phobia, panic disorder, OCD and mixed anxiety and depression.</li>
                        </ul>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Depression is one of the most common serious psychiatric illnesses. Depressive or affective disorders involve a disturbance of mood or affect (cognitive and emotional symptoms), which are frequently associated with changes in behaviour, energy levels, appetite and sleep patterns (biological and physiological symptoms). Depression sufferers report a poor quality of life or morbidity. This often extends to their carers and can be detrimental to their close relationships. Depression has a high incidence of mortality which can often be due to suicide. Depression can be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Unipolar</strong>, where the mood or affect is always low. This is characterized by misery, malaise, despair, guilt, apathy, indecisiveness, low energy and fatigue, changes in sleep patterns, loss of appetite and thoughts of suicide. It can be either reactive or endogenous. Reactive depression implies that the cause of the illness is brought about by severe stress. Endogenous depression on the other hand occurs when no obvious external causative factor can be identified.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bipolar</strong>, where the mood or affect and behaviour swing between depression and mania. This type of depression has a greater tendency to include an inherited component.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For a diagnosis of depression the patient must have certain key symptoms and also exhibit some ancillary symptoms. This assists the diagnosis and categorization of the depression.</p>
                        <h3>Key symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Depressed mood.</li>
                            <li>Inability to experience pleasure from normally pleasurable life events such as sex (anhedonia).</li>
                            <li>Lack of energy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Ancillary symptoms</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Changes in weight and appetite.</li>
                            <li>Sleep disturbance.</li>
                            <li>Low self-esteem.</li>
                            <li>Psychomotor agitation or retardation.</li>
                            <li>Guilt or self-reproach.</li>
                            <li>Difficulty in concentrating.</li>
                            <li>Suicidal thoughts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Depression can be defined as mild, moderate or severe based on the number and incidence of these symptoms.</p>
                        <p>The aetiology of depression is still unclear. The biological theories relating to the disease would suggest that there are many factors in the development of depressive disorder including psychological, genetic, biological and neurochemical.</p>
                        <h3>Psychological factors</h3>
                        <p>These are known to play a part in the development of many types of depression and can be categorized as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Childhood and developmental experiences that are seen as negative, such as abuse, be it physical, mental or sexual; separation from one or both parents with maternal separation being particularly traumatic; breakdown of the relationship between parents and/or problems with the parent-child relationship.</li>
                            <li>An unusually high number of what are termed 'significant life events'. These are often ranked according to their perceived impact, with bereavement, especially of a spouse, topping the list. Surprisingly, 'positive' life events such as getting married or the birth of a baby also have a significant impact. This may be due to a major change in lifestyle.</li>
                            <li>Stress which can be deemed as unusual or continual such as stress at work or in a relationship.</li>
                            <li>The absence of a secure or confiding relationship. This can be particularly relevant to the elderly and those who have lost a loved one, and may also explain why those who live alone have a higher tendency to become clinically depressed.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Genetic factors</h3>
                        <p>These are implicated in many areas of mental and physical health. Although no individual genes have yet been identified in depressive disease, there is a strong suggestion from family and twin studies of a genetic basis for a vulnerability to depression. A number of genes may be related to the function of known neurotransmitters and receptors, suggesting a biological effect. Other genes may be involved in influencing how a person perceives and responds to a certain kind of event or stressor, which may lead to depression in certain people but not in others.</p>
                        <h3>Biological factors</h3>
                        <p>Biological factors have become a major focus for research into depression and antidepressant drugs. Two distinct areas are implicated:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>hormonal influences;</li>
                            <li>the monoamine hypothesis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Hormonal influences</h4>
                        <p>Cortisol, a corticosteroid, is known as the 'stress hormone' and has been linked to depression. Many people go on to develop depression if they are subjected to repeated and prolonged stress. Ongoing research is linking corticosteroids with monoamines to try to complete the picture.</p>
                        <h4>The monoamine hypothesis</h4>
                        <p>Many monoamines have been implicated in depression. Monoamines are, as their name suggests, organic compounds with a single (mono) amine group. They have the biological function of being neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and exert their effects at receptors located predominantly on neurones. They were first implicated as having a role in depression in the 1960s. This was due to the fact that the main antidepressant drugs used at that time (the TCAs and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs) both have chemical actions on monoamines. It was suggested that reduced levels of monoamines could be a causative factor in depressive illness, although this hypothesis can be argued both for and against. Hence the monoamine hypothesis could explain why:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>drugs that deplete levels of monoamines are depressant in their nature (e.g. reserpine, methyldopa);</li>
                            <li>drugs that increase the availability of monoamines can improve mood in depressed patients (e.g. TCAs and MAOIs);</li>
                            <li>the concentration of some monoamines is notably reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of depressed patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>But equally the hypothesis does not explain why:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>drugs that increase the availability of monoamines have no effect on mood in depressed patients (e.g. amphetamines, cocaine).</li>
                            <li>some older antidepressants have no effect on monoamine systems (e.g. iprindole);</li>
                            <li>there is a therapeutic delay of two weeks for the full effects of monoamine antidepressants to be seen.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Tricyclic antidepressants</h3>
                        <p>TCAs are powerful drugs which block the reuptake of two major monoamines, noradrenaline and serotonin, also known as 5-HT. This means that there is more of the monoamine available to the receptors and this has an antidepressant effect. However, drugs in this class, such as amitriptyline, act at other receptors which can lead to side-effects such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>sedation, which can be useful if the drug is taken at night and insomnia is a problem. Sedation can be increased if the drugs are taken with alcohol and this can be problematic;</li>
                            <li>cardiac rhythm problems, which can be severe in overdose;</li>
                            <li>anticholinergic effects produced by action at muscarinic receptors, such as urinary retention and constipation;</li>
                            <li>more seizures in epileptic patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These side-effects and the advent of newer, safer medications for depression mean that TCAs are not prescribed as first line treatment for depression.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-201-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Please remember to reassure the patient that side-effects of TCAs such as a dry mouth, blurred vision and becoming dizzy on standing (postural hypotension) are common. However, if the patient finds these intolerable they should make an appointment to discuss other drug options.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors</h3>
                        <p>Monoamine oxidase (MAO) exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, and both are responsible for chemically breaking down monoamines to render them inactive. MAOIs block this breakdown, and phenalzine is an example. The blocking leads to an increase in the availability of the monoamines which, as with TCAs, leads to an antidepressant effect.</p>
                        <p>These drugs are used infrequently due to their high risk of drug interactions, especially with other antidepressants. They are also able to interact negatively with some foodstuffs containing tyramine and dopamine (e.g. some cheeses, red wine, pickled herring and others). This interaction can cause blood pressure to increase to a dangerous level and patients on these medications are warned to avoid these foods.</p>
                        <p>MAOIS bind irreversibly but there is a reversible MAOI, moclobemide, which is also used.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-201-2.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>You will not often encounter the use of MAOIs in clinical practice. However, if you do, please remember that the patient will need a treatment card. This will have information about diet, the taking of other medicines and the use of alcohol. The patient needs to be told to carry this card at all times and to show it to any doctor or dentist treating them.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors</h3>
                        <p>This group of drugs act selectively at serotonin (5-HT) neurones to produce their antidepressant action. They have very similar profiles regarding their antidepressant effects and the main differences between them lie in their abilities to cause drug interactions and effects.</p>
                        <p>5-HT is released from the neurone into the synapse to have its action on receptors (see Figure 11.2). After release it is taken back up into the neurone that released it by a transporter located in the neuronal membrane. SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT from the synapse after it has been released. This leads to an increase in the amount of 5-HT present in the synapse available for action at receptors which respond to 5-HT and has an antidepressant effect (see Figure 11.3).</p>

                        <p>SSRIs have far fewer side-effects than other antidepressants and are safe in overdose. This makes them a good first-line choice of drug for treating most types of depression.</p>
                        <p>The main drugs prescribed in this class are fluoxetine and citalopram. The main reported side-effects include nausea and diarrhoea, loss of sexual desire and libido, some anxiety during initiation of treatment and occasionally sleep disturbances.</p>
                        <p>The effects of SSRIs take 14-21 days to fully develop and this should be explained to patients at commencement of treatment. The NICE guideline on the management of depression (2009) recommends the use of SSRIs. There is some evidence to suggest that, particularly in adolescence, SSRIs can increase the risk of suicide and self-harm. Any such risks should be balanced against the effectiveness of using these drugs in treating a patient's depression.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-203-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>When prescribing SSRIs, doctors, nurses and pharmacists should warn patients of the possible risks of suicidal behaviour and monitor them closely in the early stages of treatment.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Other drugs</h3>
                        <p>There are some other drugs that are useful in the treatment of depression (see Box 11.2). They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Flupentixol:</strong> an antipsychotic drug which can be used to treat mild to moderate depression.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mirtazapine:</strong> an alpha adrenoceptor antagonist which is a relatively sedating antidepressant.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reboxitine:</strong> a noradrenaline specific reuptake inhibitor.</li>
                            <li><strong>Venlafaxine:</strong> a noradrenaline and 5-HT specific re-uptake inhibitor which may have a quicker onset of action compared to noradrenaline or SSRIs alone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tryptophan:</strong> a naturally occurring precursor to 5-HT which is obtained from our diet but can be given in its pure form. The theory is that if more of the precursor is available, the body will make more 5-HT, leading to an antidepressant effect. It can be used as an adjunct therapy with MAOIs and TCAs.</li>

                        <p>For bipolar depression, the treatment options are limited to lithium and some anticonvulsant drugs. Lithium treatment has been used for many years to prevent and treat bipolar depression. It is referred to as a 'mood stabilizer' as it helps to prevent the swings of mood (from depression to mania) typical of this type of illness. Lithium is a naturally occurring metallic element. Its action in the management of bipolar depression is poorly understood, but is thought to be linked to its actions on monoamine neurotransmission. It is however unclear how its actions relate to its therapeutic effects. It is a drug with a narrow therapeutic index and a long half-life so it needs careful monitoring as there is a high risk of toxicity in overdose which can be fatal.</p>

                            <p>It is important to remember that every patient taking lithium should be provided with a treatment card detailing the correct dose, blood test details and advice on drinking alcohol, taking other medicines and the effects of toxicity. When caring for someone who is taking lithium you should be aware of the need for monitoring the patient's fluid intake and also of the implications of sickness and diarrhoea. It is important that the patient avoids dehydration as this will increase the risk of lithium toxicity.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Some anticonvulsant medicines such as sodium valproate and carbamazepine have been found to have beneficial effects in bipolar depression. They are thought to be safer than lithium but are still associated with serious side-effects.</p>
                        <h3>St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum)</h3>
                        <p>Although not a drug prescribed for depression in the UK, St John's wort is worthy of a mention in this section. It is a popular herbal remedy, readily available for the management of mild forms of depression and used by many people. However, St John's wort can induce drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver which can lead to changes in how the body metabolizes other medications, causing interactions and side-effects. For this reason, the use of St John's wort with many medications is not recommended. The BNF section on interactions (Appendix 1) should be consulted for all patients taking St John's wort to ascertain its risk with other medicines. Interestingly, many of the drugs affected are conventional antidepressants. The concentration of active ingredients in St John's wort varies from preparation to preparation, making monitoring difficult.</p>
                        <p>When patients cease taking St John's wort there are concomitant changes in drug metabolizing enzyme performance, and therefore a risk of drug toxicity.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Schizophrenia is the main psychotic mental health disorder because of its prevalence, its young age of onset (15-45 years) and its chronic and disabling nature. The pathophysiology is not completely understood but several theories have been postulated, including one linking dopamine to the condition. This has been strengthened by the fact that many drugs which are effective in schizophrenia act as dopamine receptors.</p>
                        <p>Schizophrenia is a disorder of thought and thought processes, perception, emotion and volition. Its symptoms fall into two main categories, positive and negative in character, which can include the following:</p>
                        <p><strong>Positive:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>delusions;</li>
                            <li>hallucinations;</li>
                            <li>disordered thought.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Negative:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>poverty of speech;</li>
                            <li>flattened affect;</li>
                            <li>social withdrawal;</li>
                            <li>anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure);</li>
                            <li>apathy;</li>
                            <li>attention deficit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The distinction between positive and negative symptoms is important, as the main drug treatments tend to have most effect on positive symptoms, whereas negative symptoms are very hard to treat.</p>
                        <p>Other psychotic illnesses include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>schizoaffective disorder;</li>
                            <li>delusional disorders;</li>
                            <li>some depressive and manic disorders.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication is the mainstay of antipsychotic intervention. It has its actions on the dopaminergic system and receptors. It may take several weeks to have its full effect and these drugs are associated with many side-effects. The antipsychotic actions and extra-pyramidal side-effects of neuroleptic drugs are strongly correlated with their ability to block central dopaminergic transmission. The extra-pyramidal system is a neural network located in the brain that is part of the motor system involved in the coordination of movement. Antipsychotic drugs, by blocking dopamine receptors, can lead to a variety of movement disorders as a result of their effect on the extra-pyramidal system. This means that often, to obtain full control of the symptoms of schizophrenia, the doses used can cause increased side-effects. The ability of certain drugs to act on dopaminergic transmission and relieve the symptoms of psychosis was the basis of the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia first postulated in the 1960s.</p>
                        <p>Antipsychotic drugs are classified as typical or atypical in their actions. There are many dopamine receptors and other receptor types that are acted on by these drugs. Most typical antipsychotics act at D<sub>2</sub> receptors while most atypical antipsychotics act at D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> receptors. Having said this, most of these drugs have actions at other receptors as well, especially at higher doses and this is often what causes the side-effects.</p>
                        <p>A particular problem with taking antipsychotic medication daily is that certain patients may not see the need to continue taking the medicine. Quite often the patient has little understanding of their problem and as a result they may feel well and therefore decrease intake. Certain antipsychotic drugs are therefore given as what is known as a depot injection. This is an injection of a drug, usually given via the IM route, which releases its active compound in a consistent way over a long period of time. Depot injections are usually either solid or oil based. The advantages of using a long-acting depot injection include increased medication compliance and a more consistent serum concentration. However, one significant disadvantage is that the drug is not immediately reversible since it is slowly released.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-205-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>When giving a depot injection you should use a 'Z track' injection method. This seals the medication deeply within the muscle and allows no exit path into the subcutaneous tissue and skin. This is accomplished by moving the skin and subcutaneous tissues by 2.5-3.75 cm laterally, prior to the injection, and immediately releasing the same tissues after the injection.</p>

                        <h3>Typical antipsychotics</h3>
                        <p>Typical antipsychotics are associated with more side-effects despite their good antipsychotic action, due to their actions at the D<sub>2</sub> receptors.</p>
                        <p>They are structurally similar and chemically related. The actions at D<sub>2</sub> receptors can be viewed in terms of the three main pathways they influence (see Figure 11.4):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>the mesolimbic pathway;</li>

                        </ol>
                        <h4>Mesolimbic pathway</h4>
                        <p>This is associated with the psychological effects of these drugs:</p>

                            <li><strong>hyperprolactinaemia:</strong> this is a high blood level of prolactin from the pituitary gland which can cause production of breast milk as well as menstrual/erectile problems;</li>
                            <li><strong>amenorrhoea:</strong> the absence of periods in a woman of reproductive age;</li>
                            <li><strong>galactorrhoea:</strong> the spontaneous flow of milk from the breast;</li>
                            <li><strong>gynaecomastia:</strong> this is enlargement of male breast tissue;</li>
                            <li><strong>infertility:</strong> this is the biological inability of a man or a woman to contribute to conception.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Nigrostriatal pathway</h4>
                        <p>This is associated with movement disorders produced by these drugs:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Parkinsonism:</strong> characterized by lack or slowness of movement, muscular rigidity and tremor;</li>
                            <li><strong>dystonia:</strong> characterized by sustained muscle contractions causing twisting or repetitive movements, or adoption of abnormal postures;</li>
                            <li><strong>akathisia:</strong> characterized by restlessness and unease;</li>
                            <li><strong>tardive dyskinesia:</strong> characterized by abnormal involuntary movements of the face.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">

                            <p>As a nurse it is important that you are an advocate on behalf of the patient. This means reporting any signs and symptoms of any medication to senior colleagues or the medical staff. This will ensure side-effects can be dealt with early.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Atypical antipsychotics</h3>
                        <p>These drugs, unlike the typical antipsychotics, share very little similarity in structure or chemistry.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Clozapine</strong> is a dibenzodiazepine neuroleptic and exerts its effect via dopamine receptors but also acts at muscarinic and 5-HT receptors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sulpiride</strong> is a dopamine and 5-HT blocker and is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is suggested that sulpiride has more action at mesolimbic dopamine receptors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Risperidone</strong> has a higher affinity for 5-HT than dopamine and a lower incidence of sedation and extra-pyramidal side-effects at low doses than other neuroleptics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-206-2.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Clozapine carries the risk of lowering the agranular white blood cell count (agranulocytosis), therefore monitoring of blood levels of neutrophils is a mandatory condition of treatment. As these blood cells protect us from infection it is important that the level does not drop significantly. You should be aware of patients on this medication that complain of relatively minor ailments such as repeated sores.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Side-effects</h3>
                        <p>The side-effects of typical antipsychotics occur because of the actions at a variety of receptors, including the dopamine receptors which are responsible for their beneficial effects. Antipsychotics are associated with a high level of side-effects, some of which are quite severe in their nature and are commonly referred to as extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSEs). Examples are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dopaminergic side-effects</strong> such as acute neurological effects (dystonia, Parkinsonism) and chronic neurological effects (tardive dyskinesia, tardive dystonia).</li>
                            <li><strong>Neuroendocrine side-effects</strong> such as amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea and infertility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Idiosyncratic side-effects</strong> such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome. This is a life-threatening reaction that some people have to antipsychotic medicines.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cholinergic side-effects</strong> such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, ejaculatory failure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Histaminergic side-effects</strong> (sedation).</li>
                            <li><strong>Adrenergic side-effects</strong> such as hypotension, arrhythmia.</li>
                            <li><strong>Miscellaneous side-effects</strong> such as photosensitivity, heat sensitivity, cholestatic jaundice, retinal pigmentation.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>Often the first sign of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a fever. Therefore you should be observant and report any changes in the temperature of an individual who has just commenced their medication regimen. If treated early this condition does not have to be fatal.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Management of these side-effects is often necessary by prescription of other drugs to reduce their severity. These drugs can be grouped as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Anticholinergics</strong>, used for motor side-effects (e.g. benzhexol, procyclidine).</li>
                            <li><strong>Psychostimulants</strong>, used in demotivation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong>, used for akathisia (e.g. lorazepam).</li>
                            <li><strong>Beta blockers and antihistamines</strong>, occasionally used for akathisia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Atypical antipsychotics in general have a much better side-effect profile and are generally better tolerated and safer to use.</p>

                            <p>Atypical antipsychotics are far from being free of side-effects. You should warn patients that on certain drugs weight gain can be a significant problem. Also, secondary type II diabetes is becoming a problem associated with taking atypical antipsychotics and you may be involved in screening patients by urine testing or carrying out random blood glucose measurements.</p>

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>One in four adults in the UK experience at least one diagnosable mental health problem in any one year.</li>
                            <li>There are some 450 million people worldwide with a mental health problem.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Anxiety</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anxiety can become intolerable for some people and is therefore considered to be pathological.</li>
                            <li>It is a group of disorders characterized by both physical and psychological symptoms.</li>
                            <li>There are six main classifications.</li>
                            <li>Our defence mechanism can become stimulated by perceived threats.</li>
                            <li>Avoidance behaviour can be initiated.</li>
                            <li>A number of neurotransmitters are involved (e.g. noradrenaline).</li>
                            <li>Anxiolytic treatment should be effective and quick-acting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Medicine management of anxiety</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Barbiturates potentiate GABA.</li>
                            <li>They have a low therapeutic index.</li>
                            <li>They have addictive properties.</li>
                            <li>They are rarely used in anxiety management.</li>
                            <li>Benzodiazepines are still one of the most effective treatments for acute and transient anxiety.</li>
                            <li>They also potentiate the effects of GABA.</li>
                            <li>These drugs have a wider therapeutic index and are therefore less toxic than barbiturates.</li>
                            <li>Beta-adrenergic blockers are used to treat the physical symptoms of anxiety.</li>
                            <li>They may help people with mild anxiety to function in certain situations.</li>
                            <li>Buspirone is the only azaspirodecanedione in its class used in the treatment of anxiety.</li>
                            <li>Some evidence exists to suggest that antipsychotics may have a positive benefit in the treatment of anxiety.</li>
                            <li>How they relieve anxiety is not known and they are only used in low doses.</li>
                            <li>Drugs such as haloperidol and flupentixol may be used.</li>
                            <li>Antidepressants such as tricyclic compounds seem to have an effect in generalized anxiety disorder.</li>
                            <li>SSRIs can appropriately be used in chronic anxiety (e.g. fluoxetine).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Depression</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Depression is the most common serious psychiatric illness.</li>
                            <li>Has a high incidence of morbidity.</li>
                            <li>Unipolar depression is characterized by a continuous lowering of mood.</li>
                            <li>Bipolar disorder is characterized by a swinging of mood between depression and mania.</li>
                            <li>Depression is characterized by certain key symptoms such as lowering of mood, sleep disturbance and changes in weight and appetite.</li>
                            <li>The aetiology is still unclear but is thought to include psychological factors, genetic factors and biological factors.</li>
                            <li>A variety of neurotransmitters (monoamines) have been implicated in the causation of depression.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Medicine management of depression</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>TCAs affect the re-uptake of noradrenaline and serotonin.</li>
                            <li>Side-effects include sedation, anticholinergic effects and cardiac dysrhythmias.</li>
                            <li>MAOIs work by stopping the body breaking down neurotransmitters such as serotonin.</li>
                            <li>These drugs are now infrequently used due to the high risk of drug interactions.</li>
                            <li>SSRIs act selectively at serotonin neurones.</li>
                            <li>Serotonin is increased at the synapse.</li>
                            <li>SSRIs have less side-effects and are safer in overdose compared to other antidepressants.</li>
                            <li>Venlafaxine is a drug that has a quick onset and raises the levels of noradrenaline and serotonin available to the body.</li>
                            <li>Bipolar depression is treated with lithium or certain anticonvulsant drugs.</li>
                            <li>Lithium needs careful monitoring as it can cause toxicity.</li>
                            <li>Drugs such as sodium valproate and carbamazepine have also been found to be beneficial in the treatment of bipolar disorder.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Psychosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Schizophrenia is the main psychotic mental health disorder.</li>
                            <li>Positive symptoms include delusions, hallucinations and disordered thought.</li>
                            <li>Negative symptoms include social withdrawal, flattened affect and apathy.</li>
                            <li>Drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia block the actions of dopamine in the brain.</li>
                            <li>Typical antipsychotics are associated with more side-effects.</li>
                            <li>Typical antipsychotics block the three main dopamine pathways.</li>
                            <li>Typical antipsychotics produce side-effects which are often described as being extrapyramidal.</li>
                            <li>Atypical antipsychotics include clozapine, sulpiride and risperadone.</li>
                            <li>Atypical antipsychotics in general have less severe side-effects, are tolerated better and are safer to use.</li>
