                        <p>The final chapter in this section on long-term conditions may seem at first glance to be a collection of 'other' conditions! Although you will encounter patient's whose only condition is epilepsy, Parkinson's disease or hypertension, the reason we have grouped them together with the section on multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy is that patients frequently have these conditions as well as other conditions. As you will learn, epilepsy is a complex multifaceted condition which can affect anyone at any age, and therefore can be seen in all aspects of your nursing. Hypertension affects many patients in modern society and is frequently accompanied by other conditions. With Parkinson's disease being largely a disease of old age, these patients often already have other conditions we need to consider.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Hypertension (high blood pressure) is associated with a risk of coronary heart disease. Increased pressure in the blood vessels has a direct effect on the heart and vasculature. One of the major problems of having hypertension is that it has few symptoms and individuals often only discover they have the condition on routine screening. The effects of raised blood pressure have a pronounced effect on the heart, particularly the left ventricle. This increases in size (ventricular hypertrophy) as it attempts to pump against an increased peripheral resistance.</p>
                        <p>The arteries also respond to the increased pressure within them by enlargement of their muscular walls. This hypertrophy both in the heart and vessels leads to cardiac failure as a muscle cannot restore its normal contractility.</p>
                        <p>The risk of cerebral vascular accident (stroke) also rises significantly with elevation in systolic and diastolic pressures. Hypertensive disease is also associated with the formation of fatty plaques in the walls of blood vessels, a condition we call atherosclerosis. This is a Catch-22 situation as atherosclerosis leads to further hypertension. The combination of high pressure and artherosclerosis leads to weakness in the walls of arteries and increases the risk of them rupturing. The blood vessels most commonly affected are the cerebral, coronary and renal vessels. Therefore, as well as the increased risk of cerebral vascular accident and myocardial infarction, the individual is also likely to suffer from renal disease.</p>
                        <p>Hypertension may be defined as primary or secondary. In secondary hypertension the elevated blood pressure is caused by renal or endocrine disease. However, the majority of cases of hypertension are primary or 'essential' and this condition is still not fully understood. The causation of hypertension is most likely to be due to a number of interrelated factors which may be genetic or environmental.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of cause, hypertension is a fatal, silent killer, unless treated. In most instances the disease process extends over a long period of time and this is known as benign hypertension. However, in a small minority of cases the disease progresses very rapidly and is very difficult to control. This is referred to as malignant hypertension and is usually triggered by kidney disease arising from essential hypertension or other causes.</p>
                        <p>Arterial pressure is regulated by the performance of the heart (measured as cardiac output) and the diameter of the arterioles (total peripheral resistance). Hypertension involves an increase in either cardiac output or the peripheral resistance. Mechanisms that seem to be involved affect the extracellular fluid volume and expand the circulating blood volume. This involves excessive renin secretion from the kidney. Renin is a hormone that raises blood pressure in the body. Increased sympathetic activity which activates stress hormones and an excessive dietary salt intake, possibly associated with a low potassium intake, are also implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease.</p>
                        <p>Non-pharmacological remedies for hypertension are usually the first to be prescribed before commencing medicines. Weight reduction, salt restriction, moderation in alcohol consumption and cessation of smoking are all recommended before prescribing treatment. A GP may also prescribe a regime of moderate exercise which has been shown to be beneficial in helping to lower systolic pressure. Relaxation and biofeedback are also techniques that are advisable prior to drug therapy. It is important that the disease is diagnosed and treated early as intervention, be it pharmacological or non-pharmacological, can reduce the risk of much cardiovascular disease associated with hypertension.</p>
                        <p>In the past, treatment of hypertension involved giving patients medicines that had many side-effects, however, as medicine has progressed so has the pharmacology. Generally, patients are commenced on a thiazide diuretic. If this does not give adequate control then the patient may be prescribed drugs from the beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist (beta blocker) group. If the blood pressure remains elevated then the individual would progress onto more potent groups of drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or calcium antagonists (calcium channel blockers).</p>
                        <p>Finally a blockade of alpha adrenoreceptors would be commenced. Typically, drug regimes for people with hypertension consist of a number of these drugs used in combination (see Box 10.1).</p>
                        <h3>Thiazide diuretics</h3>
                        <p>These are usually the first-line treatment for mild to moderate hypertension, providing there are no contraindications. A drug that is used commonly is bendroflumethiazide. You may come across other diuretic drugs such as frusimide. This works on a different part of the kidney (loop of henle). It is a more powerful diuretic and is not usually used for the treatment of hypertension.</p>
                        <p>Bendroflumethiazide works by stopping the body from selectively reabsorbing sodium. This has an effect on the circulating blood volume causing it to decrease. It has also been noted that this group of diuretics has an effect on blood vessels, causing them to vasodilate and lower blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>Bendroflumethiazide is well absorbed from the GI tract so is usually given as a tablet. A dose of 2.5 mg daily is usually prescribed. Higher doses do not necessarily mean a greater fall in blood pressure, but would increase the side-effects. The maximum effect takes place at four to six hours and its duration of action is between 8 and 12 hours.</p>
                        <p>Problems can occur with this drug. First, it increases the amount of uric acid present in the plasma because it prevents that acid from being secreted from the body. Therefore, anybody suffering from gout should not take the medicine. Another common side-effect is potassium depletion.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-175-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>If a patient is a diabetic, controlling their blood sugar will become more difficult when taking drugs for high blood pressure. Male impotence can be caused by thiazide diuretics in about 20 per cent of individuals. However, this is reversible by stopping the medication. Caution should also be taken if the patient is receiving lithium for bipolar disorder as the diuretic can cause blood levels of lithium to become elevated.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Even on a small dose of 2.5 mg of bendroflumethiazide, the doctor should be carrying out routine urea and electrolyte blood investigations yearly. More significant side-effects can occur and the drug can cause hyperglycaemia.</p>
                        <h3>Beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists</h3>
                        <p>In practice these drugs are usually referred to as beta blockers. If a patient develops hypertension then taking this group of medicines will cause a gradual fall in arterial pressure. However, this will take several days or weeks to occur. How these drugs work is not fully understood but they appear to have actions that reduce the cardiac output, reduce renin production from the kidney and reduce the release of stress-related hormones such as adrenaline.</p>
                        <p>In the body you have at least two types of beta-adrenoreceptors, some in the heart (beta 1 receptors) and some in the lungs (beta 2 receptors). Beta blockers are either selective, whereby they stop the effect of adrenaline at beta1 receptors, or nonselective whereby the drug blocks both types. This is a consideration as beta 2 receptors bring about bronchodilation. Therefore, blocking this effect in patients with airway disease is not desirable. Such patients should be given a selective drug such as atenolol.</p>
                        <p>This group of medicines can all be given in tablet form. Some are taken once daily (e.g. atenolol) and others need to be taken more often (e.g. propranolol). Serious side-effects are not common but are important when giving information to patients.</p>
                        <p>Patients with diabetes need to be informed that they might not recognize when they are going hypoglycaemic. The signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia are mediated through the sympathetic nervous system. This group of drugs inhibits sympathetic responses and the patient may therefore get little warning of impending lowering of blood glucose levels.</p>
                        <p>Due to the fall in circulating blood volume, peripheral perfusion of tissues is a consideration. Often a person will complain of having cold hands and feet. Therefore, patients with peripheral vascular disease pose a particular problem and this type of medicine should be avoided. Other side-effects may include fatigue, a low pulse rate (bradycardia) and very vivid dreams and nightmares.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-176-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>One way you can usually identify a drug from this group is that it ends in 'olol' (e.g. atenolol).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</h3>
                        <p>These are known as ACE inhibitors and work by stopping the powerful vasoconstricting effects of angiotensin II on the blood vessels. In order to become active angiotensin II has to convert from angiotensin I. This group of drugs, which includes captopril, stops this conversion from taking place, therefore lowering the blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>It is important that the patient drinks plenty of fluids while on these drugs. Dehydration lowers the blood pressure further, so causing an unwanted severe hypotensive state. Captopril can be used on its own or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. It is a powerful hypotensive drug and therefore patients usually start on a low dose.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes it is advisable to take the initial dose of the drug before going to bed, so removing the chances of faints or falls due to hypotension.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-176-2.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Most drugs ending in 'pril' are usually from the ACE inhibitor group (e.g. captopril).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A dry cough from irritation of the bronchial mucosa is a common side-effect with some patients going on to experience bronchospasm. Captopril has certain individual side-effects due to the nature of its biochemistry. It can cause rashes, changes in taste, a lowering of a group of white cells called neutrophils (neutropenia) and protein to appear in the urine (proteinurea).</p>
                        <p>Other drugs in this group such as lisinopril and ramipril will not cause the same degree of side-effects as captopril because their chemical structure is slightly different. Patients who have a narrowing of their renal artery (renal artery stenosis) will develop renal failure if treated with this group of drugs as their bodies depend on a fully functioning renin angiotensin cycle.</p>
                        <h3>Calcium antagonists</h3>
                        <p>These drugs act by limiting the amount of calcium that enters smooth and cardiac muscle. This causes the blood vessels to dilate, therefore causing the blood pressure to fall. Some of these drugs act better on the heart muscle (e.g. verapamil) and others work better on smooth muscle of the blood vessels (e.g. nifedipine and amlodipine).</p>
                        <p>Calcium antagonists are well absorbed by the GI system and are given in tablet form. However, drugs differ in how short or long acting they are and this has an effect on dosage and unwanted side-effects. For example, nifedipine has a short half-life and needs to be taken more frequently than amlodipine which is taken once a day. However, slow-release preparations of nifedipine are available.</p>
                        <p>Unwanted side-effects are an extension of the drug's therapeutic activities. Shorter-acting medicines may cause flushing and headaches and if used over a long period of time can cause ankle swelling. Apart from these predictable side-effects these drugs are relatively trouble-free.</p>
                        <h3>Alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonists</h3>
                        <p>A drug called prazosin was the first selective alpha antagonist to be developed and was used for many years. However, better drugs have now been developed, for example, doxazosin and terazosin. These can be taken once a day.</p>
                        <p>Like beta blockers, these drugs work by inhibiting the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on body systems. The drugs mentioned above are highly selective, which means they can affect vessels, so causing dilatation, but do not speed up the heart rate (tachycardia). Neither do they lead to any appreciable severe lowering of blood pressure when standing (postural hypotension). Perhaps for these reasons that they have become more popular, especially in combination with other antihypertensive therapies.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">Parkinson's disease</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This is a progressive disorder of movement. Certain neurones in part of the brain called the basal nuclei degenerate and this leads to a lack of a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Typically, this disease occurs in people who are over the age of 50. The reduction in the release of dopamine causes the basal nuclei to become overactive and this over-activity presents itself in a number of ways. The patient develops a persistent tremor, even at rest, and quite often there are head-nodding and pill-rolling movements of the fingers. Their posture becomes affected and they begin to bend forward and walk in small, shuffling steps. Textbooks used to describe the person's face as 'mask-like' because they acquire a stiff facial expression. Finally, the patient has trouble in initiating and coordinating movement.</p>
                        <p>Parkinson's disease was first described by James Parkinson in 1817. In 1960 Hornykiewicz demonstrated that the dopamine content of the substantia nigra in post-mortem examination of patients with the disease was extremely low - in some cases 10 per cent less than normal. More sophisticated diagnostic tests have revealed similar findings and suggest the loss of dopamine occurs over several years. Symptoms only show themselves when the dopamine content of this area has fallen below between 20 and 40 per cent of the normal.</p>
                        <p>With this knowledge, one would expect to be able to find a cure. It would seem on the face of it that all we need to do is replace the lost dopamine and the patient would return to a normal state. Drugs that are given for this debilitating disease do work by increasing dopamine in the brain in a number of ways, however despite these pharmacological interventions patients do not return to a normal state. Many deteriorate and suffer dementia. In addition to the effects of the disease there are also side-effects to the medication (see Box 10.2).</p>
                        <h3>Levodopa</h3>
                        <p>This remains the first-line treatment for Parkinson's disease. You cannot give pure dopamine as the BBB will not allow it to enter and it is also destroyed quickly by enzymes in the peripheral tissues. Levodopa is a drug that can cross the BBB and then be converted by the central nervous system into dopamine. It is nearly always combined with another substance that stops peripheral enzymes breaking down dopamine. This means that generally more levodopa is available to the brain and also a lower dose of dopamine can be given as most of it remains intact rather than being destroyed by enzymes. Examples of medicines that are combined or given with levodopa are carbidopa and benserazide.</p>
                        <p>When given levodopa the response rates of patients are good. Some studies suggest that 20 per cent of patients may actually be restored to normal function for a while. However, this improvement is often only short lived and as time goes by the levodopa becomes less effective. This loss of efficacy is probably due to the unrelenting course of the disease.</p>
                        <p>Two major side-effects are associated with giving levodopa. First, a condition called dyskinesia can develop which means that the individual develops a series of involuntary movements, causing acute embarrassment as they usually affect the face and limbs. If the dose is lowered, the dyskinesia does stop, but is replaced by the rigidity it had improved. This is a fine line that the patient and doctor walk in order to accept the consequences of both illness and treatment.</p>
                        <p>A second side-effect associated with this drug group is called the 'on-off' effect. This is where, quite suddenly, the drug therapy seems to stop working. This can be quite distressing for the patient and can sometimes occur when they are in the middle of doing something. The reason for this fluctuation is not fully understood, however, patients should be made aware of both these side-effects when commencing treatment.</p>
                        <p>The patient may also suffer more short-term side-effects from the medication, though these quite often improve over a period of time. They may feel sick, have no appetite and suffer a slight drop in blood pressure. This decrease in blood pressure could have a more serious effect if the patient is having antihypertensive therapy as they could develop postural hypotension. A small number of patients may develop delusions and hallucinations as the brain is given extra dopamine which is thought to mimic the high levels found in patients with schizophrenia.</p>
                        <h3>Selegiline</h3>
                        <p>This medicine works by stopping the enzyme that breaks down dopamine in the synapses, therefore making more dopamine available. The enzyme is called monoamine oxidase-B and appears only in regions of the brain which are dopamine rich. This means that the drug only works in these areas of the brain, so limiting any side-effects or interactions. Giving this drug with levodopa seems to have better results than giving levodopa on its own. However, when levodopa is given in combination with either carbidopa or benserazide, there is no difference noted between this and giving selegiline only.</p>
                        <h3>Dopamine receptor agonists</h3>
                        <p>This group of drugs works by mimicking the action of dopamine on dopamine receptors.</p>
                        <p>Examples of this class are bromocriptine and pergolide. Their duration of action is longer than that of levodopa so they do not need to be given as often. The toxic effects of these drugs are similar to levodopa, however, the schizophrenic-type symptoms can be more severe. Sometimes these drugs are given in combination with levodopa in order to reduce overall side-effects or improve the patient's response.</p>
                        <h3>Acetylcholine antagonists</h3>
                        <p>Prior to the discovery of levodopa this group of drugs was the main treatment for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Dopamine works opposite to acetylcholine in the nigra striatel system, therefore if dopamine is lacking, by stopping the actions of acetylcholine, balance can be restored albeit at a lower level. This is the thinking behind acetylcholine antagonists. The action of drugs like benzatropine is more limited than levodopa in that they do not reduce rigidity significantly.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Epilepsy is the most common chronic disabling condition of the nervous system. Epileptic seizures result from an imbalance of the excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms within the brain, the nerve impulses generated from the neurones being abnormal and uncoordinated. The form of seizure that the person suffers usually depends on the part of the brain affected. Seizures can range from brief lapses in attention to full-blown convulsive fits which may last up to several minutes. The classification of epilepsy recognizes two major categories: partial and generalized.</p>
                        <h3>Partial seizures</h3>
                        <p>These tend to occur in a localized area of the brain. The symptoms depend on which brain region is discharging these abnormal impulses. Simple partial seizures are an example of this, where the motor cortex is irritated, resulting in twitching. The patient does not lose consciousness. The twitching sometimes spreads from a small area of the body to a larger area as the impulse spreads across the motor cortex. This is called a Jacksonian seizure.</p>
                        <p>Complex partial seizures usually originate from the temporal lobe and are preceded by what is called an aura or warning. The person then commences to enter into a period of altered behaviour where they repeat movements over and over again. Examples of this may be rubbing, patting or plucking activities. Patients may also describe alterations in sensation like a smell or a sense of being there before (déjà vu). These seizures may last a few minutes, after which the person has no memory of the events. The behaviours during these seizures can be bizarre and accompanied by strong emotional responses, for example aggression.</p>
                        <h3>Generalized seizures</h3>
                        <p>These involve the whole brain and affect the reticular formation centres responsible for consciousness and arousal. Abnormal impulses arise throughout both hemispheres. Two important categories are absent seizures which used to be called petit mal and tonic clonic seizures which used to be called grand mal.</p>
                        <p>Absent seizures are characterized by a brief alteration in consciousness which is sometimes very difficult to see. This type of seizure happens more in children and can be frequent in nature.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-180-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>In an absent seizure the person may abruptly stop what they are doing, even mid-sentence, and stare vacantly. There is usually little or no motor involvement. During these brief spells the person is unaware of their surroundings but recovers quickly with no after-effects. Often this type of epilepsy is only detected when a child falls behind with their school work or their grades start to fall.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Tonic clonic seizures are vastly different. These consist of an initial strong contraction of the whole muscular system causing a rigid spasm. Respiration ceases with defecation, micturition and salivation often occurring. This tonic stage lasts for approximately a minute. The person then begins to suffer a series of violent rhythmic jerking movements of the limbs. They usually develop an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and begin to sweat. This phase lasts about two to four minutes, followed by a coma. The person is usually sleepy after the seizure and often cannot remember the event.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-181-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>A condition known as status epilepticus can occur in some patients, where one tonic clonic seizure follows another. This may continue for a period of time and can become life-threatening. Medical treatment needs to be implemented urgently in such cases.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Treatment for epilepsy is aimed at producing a life free of seizures. In order for this to be achieved patients are prescribed a range of drugs which are called anticonvulsants (see Box 10.3). These medicines work in one of three ways. Some block sodium channels in the neurone, others block calcium channels and the third group enhance an inhibitory neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).</p>
                        <h3>Inhibition of sodium channel function</h3>
                        <p>In Chapter 4 we discussed the firing of a neurone (see p. 42) and the importance of the passage of sodium into the neurone. It can be deduced that if we block this action in some way, then neurones will be less likely to fire. Sodium-inhibiting drugs do not block all sodium channels but are selective to channels that allow high frequency impulses to take place. In other words, they dampen down the excitability in neurones without switching them off. An example of this class of drug is phenytoin.</p>
                        <h4>Phenytoin</h4>
                        <p>This drug is still widely used but not for absent seizures, which may get worse if the drug is administered. It is well absorbed by the body when given orally but has certain characteristic pharmacokinetic tendencies which must be taken into consideration before it is prescribed. First, it binds to plasma proteins in the blood, which is not unusual for drugs to do, however when giving drugs that unblock this mechanism (e.g. salicylates) there is an increase of the phenytoin in the person's plasma. Phenytoin also increases enzymes into the liver that can affect the breakdown (metabolism) of other drugs that the patient may be taking. This process is called enzyme induction. For example, if the patient is taking oral anticoagulants the effect of these will be unpredictable if phenytoin is also given.</p>
                        <p>Phenytoin works to its full potential between 40 and 100 micromoles per litre. If the range exceeds this the patient gets more toxic side-effects without any further protection from seizures. This is why it is important to impress upon the patient the need for regular blood monitoring while on this therapy.</p>
                        <p>Side-effects begin to appear when the dose pushes the blood plasma levels to over 100 micromoles per litre and become severe if the blood plasma increased beyond 150 micromoles per litre. The patient may complain of feeling dizzy (vertigo), have headaches and their movements may become shaky. They may have difficulty walking (ataxia). In some cases people begin to have involuntary rapid movement of their eyes, a condition we call nystagmus. If the blood levels begin to rise further, the patient becomes confused and there is marked intellectual impairment. One particularly unpleasant side-effect of this drug is the development of swelling of the gums. This is called hyperplasia and can often be disfiguring and therefore acutely embarrassing.</p>
                        <p>Phenytoin has also been responsible for malformations in babies born to women taking the drug. Problems such as cleft palate were increased more than in the general population, therefore if a woman falls pregnant while taking the medication she should seek professional advice immediately.</p>
                        <h3>Inhibition of calcium channels</h3>
                        <p>Some of the anticonvulsant drugs are thought to have minor involvement in blocking calcium channels. Indeed, gabapentin, a fairly recent addition to the anticonvulsant range, may have some action on calcium channels. The only drug known for its action purely on calcium uptake in the neurone is ethosuximide.</p>
                        <h4>Ethosuximide</h4>
                        <p>This is the first-line management drug when it comes to treatment for absent seizures. It has little or no effect in other types of epilepsy and can sometimes actually increase the risk of seizures.</p>
                        <p>The drug works on a certain class of calcium channels. It is thought that through their action they moderate the firing of neurones in an area of the brain called the thalamus. The abnormal firing of neurones in this area seems to play a role in the generation of absent seizures. The dose of the drug in adults is usually 0.5-2 g daily. In children it falls to 10-20 mg per kg once a day.</p>
                        <p>Side-effects are relatively minor but obviously troublesome if you are the one taking the medication. They include nausea, anorexia and sometimes lethargy and dizziness. Very rarely the drug can have severe hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
                        <h3>Enhancement of GABA action</h3>
                        <h4>Sodium valproate</h4>
                        <p>It is not entirely clear exactly how valproate works as it does several things in the brain. First, the chemical messenger (or neurotransmitter) GABA is 'inhibitory' on the brain - i.e. it calms the brain down. Once it has worked there are other chemicals (or enzymes) in the brain which are there to break GABA down so that it can no longer work. In people with normal levels of GABA this prevents there being too much GABA. In some people it is thought that there may not be enough GABA in the brain. This lack seems to 'trigger' fits or over-activity. Valproate helps to stop the breakdown of GABA and so leaves enough of this chemical in the brain to help prevent fits.</p>
                        <p>Second, it may inhibit 'repetitive firing' of neurones. When a message is passed, there is a short refractory period or gap (about one-thousandth of a second) before the next message can be passed, during which time the nerve ending resets itself. Valproate may increase this refractory period, or time, by a small amount. Under normal circumstances, this will make no difference at all, but if the brain is overactive and lots of messages are being passed in quick succession the valproate will reduce the number of messages back to the normal level (e.g. if the next message follows along before the nerve has reset itself, the message can't be passed).</p>
                        <p>Compared with other anticonvulsant drugs, valproate is relatively free of unwanted side-effects, however the patient should be informed that they may feel sleepy to start with and so need to take extra care when driving or operating any type of machinery. This effect should wear off after the patient has been taking the medicine for a while. Valproate can cause some people to become more hungry than usual and they may then put on weight. Some patients may put on weight even without eating more. The patient should be informed to see a dietician for advice if weight gain becomes problematic.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Valproate can be given by a variety of routes. The starting dose is usually 600 mg daily after food but this may be increased. It is especially important that the patient swallows enteric-coated tablets or capsules whole. These tablets should not be crushed or chewed. The coating helps to prevent stomach upsets. Crushing or chewing will cause the drug to be released too soon and may result in side-effects. Sodium valproate tablets which are not enteric coated (i.e. Epilim 100 mg) may be crushed if necessary.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The most serious side-effect is poisoning of the liver (hepatotoxicity). For the first six months of treatment the patient will need a regular blood test (e.g. every month) to check that the drug is not affecting their liver. The patient may also need to have blood tests from time to time to make sure that the dose of valproate is enough and not too much or too little for them.</p>
                        <p>It is also important for the patient to consider that there will be a risk from taking this medicine during pregnancy. Major malformations occur spontaneously in about 2-4 per cent of all pregnancies, even if no drugs are taken. A medicine causing teratogenicity (foetal malformation) is called a teratogen. Since a baby has completed its main development between days 17 and 60 of the pregnancy (the so-called 'first trimester'), these first 2 to 16 weeks are the main concern. After that, there may be other problems (e.g. some medicines may cause slower growth). The infant may also be affected after birth (e.g. withdrawal effects are possible with some drugs). There is some evidence of problems of this nature when taking valproate (e.g. a 1 in 100 chance of spina bifida and a 'valproate syndrome'). Therefore this drug is not normally given in pregnancy.</p>
                        <h4>Vigabatrin</h4>
                        <p>Vigabatrin works by stopping the breakdown of GABA in the brain by the enzyme GABA transaminase. The drug is extremely specific for this enzyme, so enhancing the inhibitory effects of GABA in humans. It is well absorbed from the GI tract and is therefore given as a tablet. It has a short plasma half-life but because it blocks the GABA-destroying enzyme irreversibly it can be given once daily. The body will obviously make more GABA transaminase so the drug has to be given continuously. The main side-effects are depression and psychotic disturbances.</p>

                            <p>Patients can become quite hostile and aggressive on receiving this medication. The drug is often tried on patients for whom conventional therapy has failed to reduce their seizures.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-comorbidities" class="section-heading">
                        <span class="heading-text">Multiple comorbidities and chronic diseases</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Comorbidity basically means that a patient has more than one disease process occurring in their body at the same time. Quite often these diseases will be chronic in nature, for example, a 50-year-old male might have depression, type II diabetes, hypertension and osteoarthritis at the same time. As a result he will be on a number of different medicines to alleviate each condition. Now imagine that person requires surgery and all its additional implications. Indeed, from talking to nurses working on medical wards, the time spent doing the medicine rounds quite frequently runs into hours as each patient has a myriad of medicines to be administered. It would seem inevitable that the concept of comorbidity is one of the biggest challenges to health care in developed countries.</p>
                        <h3>Consequences for patients</h3>
                        <p>Having multiple chronic diseases is often challenging. If we take our 50-year-old male from the previous example we can see that the more medications he takes, the greater the chance he will experience side-effects from the drugs, as you will have learned from reading previous chapters. The more medication a person takes, the greater the chances of drug interactions occurring, especially if we start to factor in age-related physiology of major organs like the heart, liver and kidneys.</p>
                        <p>For many patients with comorbidities the quality of their life begins to be eroded. For instance, if a patient has a number of diseases this can multiply the amount of time spent attending outpatient clinics. Even if the GP is following up care prescribed by a consultant physician, time devoted to attending routine blood tests, X-rays and electrocardiograms can run into hours for that individual. It must be quite difficult for the patient to know which disease is the most important to focus upon at any one time and what issues have the highest priority.</p>
                        <p>Is it any wonder then that with the side-effects of their medicines, as well as their own time constraints, and their desire to make healthier choices and adopt healthier lifestyles, that the patient population can begin to suffer from psychological stress? This can be displayed as anxiety and depression.</p>
                        <h3>Polypharmacy</h3>
                        <p>It is generally accepted that polypharmacy relates to taking four or more medications by a patient. It is also true that those who suffer from the risk of polypharmacy are people aged 65 and over. Indeed some commentators suggest that 40 per cent of older adults living in their own homes are currently receiving polypharmacy. Polypharmacy begins to become problematic when too many health care staff become involved in the patient's care and there is no joined-up thinking. Taking multiple medicines for multiple health conditions only increases the risk of adverse drug reactions and interactions, particularly if no single individual is taking responsibility for the patient's complete medication profile.</p>
                        <p>This problem can be further exacerbated by some individuals buying OTC medicines, such as vitamin and mineral supplements. Also, there is a trend towards people buying herbal remedies, which they see as being natural but may have major implications for the prescription drugs they are taking. Sometimes patients do not see the point in telling their health care provider that they are taking this class of medicines as patients often do not see them as drugs.</p>
                        <p>Many drugs, such as paracetamol, ibuprofen and aspirin, can be bought freely over the counter, however it could be suggested that these medicines contribute significantly to adverse drug reactions in the elderly. The most commonly involved drug categories in adverse reactions are cardiovascular agents, antibiotics, diuretics, anticoagulants, hypoglycemics, steroids, opioids, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
                        <p>You will encounter long medicine rounds, and you will come across people taking a myriad of different medicines in the community. It is important that you recognize the impact of polypharmacy and take the opportunity to help identify patients at risk for inappropriate polypharmacy and to educate patients and families about the risks.</p>
                        <p>You have now reached the end of the section on drugs used in chronic conditions. In this final part you will find all of the key learning points from this and the previous two chapters along with case studies, multiple choice questions and drug calculations.</p>
