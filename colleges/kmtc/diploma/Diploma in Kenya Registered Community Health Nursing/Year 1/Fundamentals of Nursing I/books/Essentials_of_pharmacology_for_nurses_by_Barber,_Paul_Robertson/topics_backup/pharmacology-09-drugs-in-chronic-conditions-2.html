                        <p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease of metabolism caused by either an insufficient production of insulin in the body or an insufficient effect of insulin in the peripheral tissues. The main problems stem from a wide fluctuation in the range of blood glucose levels which leads to a number of short- and long-term difficulties for the individual. There are two main forms of diabetes: type I and type II (see Box 9.1).</p>
                        <p>In type I diabetes the body produces little or no insulin in cells contained in the pancreas and known as the 'Islets of Langerhans' or the beta cells. The pancreas is a specialized gland that lies just behind the stomach. Its functions range from regulating the amount of sugar (glucose) you have in your blood to producing enzymes that help break down and digest proteins, carbohydrates and fats. It is thought that the beta cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the body's own immune response: hence diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Someone with type I diabetes will be required to take insulin for the rest of their lives.</p>

                            <p>Sometimes professionals will refer to type I diabetes as 'juvenile' because it usually starts before the age of 40 and is most common in the teenage years.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>In type II diabetes the beta cells may produce small amounts of insulin but not enough to control the levels of glucose in the plasma. In addition, the cells of the body, and particularly in the periphery, cannot utilize insulin properly. This means that glucose is not allowed to enter peripheral cells, so increasing the glucose levels in the plasma. This type of diabetes is linked to the problem of obesity.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-163-2.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Sometimes you will hear people refer to type II diabetes as 'maturity onset' as it occurs in people over the age of 40.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>It is estimated that approximately 2 million people in the UK are currently being treated for type II diabetes. However, researchers suggest that there are as many people who are under-diagnosed. The risk of this type of diabetes is also higher if it runs in the family or if the patient is overweight. From this perspective, it is clear that prevention of obesity will also lead to prevention of type II diabetes.</p>
                        <p>Without treatment, the main symptoms of diabetes can be divided into two major areas: acute symptoms and chronic complications. There are a number of symptoms that could be referred to as 'classic'. These are excessive thirst (polydypsia), producing lots of urine necessitating many trips to the toilet (polyuria), blurring of vision, tiredness and weight loss due to muscle wasting (loss of muscle mass).</p>
                        <p>The chronic complications of diabetes are caused by long-term raised glucose levels in the body. This leads to damage, particularly to blood vessels and peripheral nerves.</p>

                            <p>'Macrovascular disease' refers to damage to the larger blood vessels and results in coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular disease. 'Microvascular disease' refers to damage to smaller vessels, resulting in eye problems (retinopathy) and kidney damage (nephropathy). Damage to the outside of the nerves (the nerve sheaths) is also a problematic complication. This process is referred to as 'neuropathy'.</p>

                        <h3>Diabetic ketoacidosis</h3>
                        <p>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a condition that comes as a complication of diabetes. A patient with DKA will have high blood glucose levels (hyperglycaemia), high levels of ketone bodies in their plasma (ketosis), and because these ketone bodies are acidic the patients' blood becomes more acidic (metabolic acidosis). DKA occurs mostly in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient often reports feelings of nausea and may actually start to vomit. Another common symptom is complaints of abdominal pain. If these signs and symptoms are left unchecked the condition can progress to cerebral oedema, coma, and death. DKA therefore is diagnosed by detection of ketosis and metabolic acidosis in the presence of hyperglycaemia. Treatment of DKA involves replacing fluids, administrating insulin and preventing the patient's potassium levels from dropping (hypokolaemia).</p>
                        <p>As we have indicated, DKA is most common among patients with type 1 DM and develops when their ability to produce insulin levels is insufficient to meet the body's basic metabolic requirements. In a small minority of patients DKA is the first indication of type 1 DM. Insulin deficiency can be described as absolute, for example, if a patient does not administer their insulin. Insulin deficiency can also be described as relative, for example, when the usual level of insulin is not enough to meet the body's metabolic demands from physiological stress. Stressors that can cause this relative imbalance and cause DKA include acute infection such as pneumonia or developing a urinary tract infection. Myocardial infarction is another situation that can trigger DKA. Certain drugs are also implicated in causing DKA and they include corticosteroids, thiazide diuretics and sympathomimetics. In type 2 diabetes DKA is less common, but it can occur in individuals in situations of unusual physiologic stress.</p>
                        <h3>Treatment</h3>
                        <p>The most urgent goals are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>rehydration using intravenous fluids;</li>
                            <li>correction of hyperglycaemia and acidosis;</li>
                            <li>preventing hypokalemia (low level of potassium).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Identification of reasons for this event are also of great importance. Ideally treatment should occur in intensive-care settings because clinical and laboratory assessments are initially needed every hour or every other hour, with appropriate adjustments in treatment.</p>
                        <p>Intravenous fluids are needed immediately as intravascular volume should be restored in order to raise blood pressure and therefore ensure kidney perfusion. Once this immediate intravenous fluid has been given, the team needs to ensure that the remaining total body water deficits are corrected more slowly. This may take place over the next 24 hours.</p>
                        <p>Note though that fluid deficits in children are estimated differently. This is calculated by using a formula of 60 to 100 mL/kg body weight. As with adults once the initial fluids have been replaced, the maintenance fluids (for ongoing losses) must also be provided. Rather than replacing this fluid over a 24-hour period the remaining fluid deficit should be replaced over 36 hours. Again this should be calculated by use of a formula, in this circumstance the rate of infusion for the maintenance fluids should be about 2 to 4 mL/kg/hour, depending on the degree of dehydration.</p>
                        <p>Hyperglycaemia needs correcting and the obvious way to do this is by giving the patient regular insulin such as Humulin and Novolin. Initially the patient may require 0.1 unit/kg as an IV bolus. This would then be followed by use of a continuous IV infusion of 0.1 unit/kg/h in 0.9 per cent saline solution. During this time the patients' blood sugar is being regularly monitored. If the plasma concentration of glucose does not fall by 50 to 75 mg/dL (2.8 to 4.2 mmol/L) in the first hour, insulin doses should be doubled. Children should be given a continuous IV insulin infusion of 0.1 unit/kg/h or higher with or without a bolus.</p>
                        <p>If insulin is given in sufficient doses you should begin to see an improvement in the levels of circulating ketones. Sometimes an improvement in ketosis is linked to an improvement in the pH of the blood. This means that ketone decline may take some time until the blood pH improves. If acidosis is of real concern then a more direct and rapid response is necessary. In this situation quick correction of pH by HCO<sub>3</sub> (Bicarbonate) administration may be considered if pH remains lower than 7. However this technique should not be used routinely as the practice is not without its problems, one being the development of acute cerebral oedema - this is a particular problem in children.</p>
                        <p>As the patient's condition improves, attention must turn to the type of insulin now being given. Insulin replacement will be switched to regular insulin 5 to 10 units, also the route will be altered to that of subcutaneous injection the medicine would now be given every four to six hours. When the patient's condition has been stabilized and they are able to eat and drink normally, a typical split-mixed or basal-bolus insulin regimen is begun. During this transitional period the patient should continue intravenous insulin for one to four hours after the initial dose of subcutaneous insulin is given. In comparison, children should continue to receive 0.05 unit/kg/h insulin infusion until subcutaneous insulin is initiated and pH is greater than 7.3.</p>
                        <p>Hypokalemia, which means a low potassium level, needs to be prevented. This occurs in DKA because of urinary loss. Prevention requires close monitoring and replacement of potassium, which will be given alongside their intravenous fluids. Levels should be checked hourly or every other hour in the initial stages of treatment.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The overall aim of the treatment of diabetes is to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range (normoglycaemia). This will relieve the acute symptoms and should minimize the impact of chronic complications on the individual. In reality, achieving normoglycaemia is very difficult and drug treatments are aimed at an individual level. An increase in exercise and cessation of smoking are advisable in order to reduce high blood pressure (hypertension) and high fat content in the blood (hyperlipidaemia). These measures have been shown to reduce the risk of long-term complications of this disease. However, the most important key to treatment of diabetes is diet. This can be used alone or can be combined with the use of insulin or other oral hypoglycaemic agents.</p>
                        <h3>Insulin</h3>
                        <p>The hormone insulin is released in the body as a direct response to a raised blood glucose level. Insulin is released directly into the blood and stimulates the uptake of glucose; it is the key that allows glucose to enter cells, and without it the door remains locked and glucose builds up in the blood. Insulin also promotes conversion of glucose to a substance called glycogen, which allows the body to store glucose for periods when the person is not eating but still requires glucose for bodily functions.</p>
                        <p>Insulin also limits the amount of fat breakdown in the body, a process called lypolysis. Triglycerides (large fat molecules) which are normally stored in your fatty (adipose) tissue are broken down into their constituent fatty acids and glycerol. These are then transported to the liver where they are used to fuel certain metabolic pathways. As insulin is either missing or low in quantity in diabetes these metabolic pathways soon become saturated, resulting in the production by the body of acidic compounds such as ketone bodies and acetate.</p>
                        <h4>Treatment with insulin</h4>
                        <p>At one time insulin was extracted from the pancreas of cattle (bovine insulin) or pigs (porcine insulin). However, today it is almost entirely human. This is possible through a process called recombinant DNA technology, which involves inserting the DNA code for human insulin production into bacteria so that they then produce commercial amounts of insulin (see Boxes 9.2 and 9.3).</p>
                        <p>Insulin is destroyed in the GI system which is why you never see it given by mouth as a tablet, for example.</p>
                        <p>Once absorbed, insulin has a short half-life of approximately 10 minutes. Therefore, for longer-term control, long-acting insulin is required (see p. 148).</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-167-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Insulin is usually given by injection. The commonest method of administration is by the SC route. It can be auto-injected by means of a device called a 'pen', although some patients prefer to use a small insulin pump. The newest device on the market at the moment is the insulin jet system which can be used on the abdomen, thighs or buttocks. It forces a very small stream of insulin through a nozzle placed on the skin. The jet of insulin is propelled with such force that it penetrates the skin without the need for a needle.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Short-acting insulins</h4>
                        <p>Soluble insulin produces a quick and short-lived effect. It works in the same way as natural insulin by binding to the receptors on the cells and allowing glucose to enter. It also causes the cells in the liver, muscles and fat to increase their uptake of glucose from the blood. Insulin lispro is a special form of human insulin which works more rapidly but for a shorter period of time. This enables people to inject themselves just prior to eating a meal if they so wish.</p>
                        <p>These types of insulins are the only ones suitable for IV injection.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-167-2.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>An example of soluble insulin is Actrapid. When given subcutaneously it works within 30 to 60 minutes and its effects last for about eight hours. It is usually injected 15 to 30 minutes before a meal so that the increasing blood glucose levels after eating can be controlled. You will see these sorts of insulins being used in clinical practice as treatment for ketoacidosis where the regime is also called a 'sliding scale'. This means the insulin dose is determined by the person's blood glucose value, which is obtained at predetermined times (e.g. every two hours).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Intermediate insulins</h4>
                        <p>Longer-acting preparations of insulin are made possible by mixing the insulin with a substance which slows its use in the body. An example of this is isophane insulin which starts working about an hour and a half after administration. Its maximum effect occurs between four and eight hours after administration and ends as long as 24 hours afterwards.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-167-3.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Isophane insulin is naturally white and cloudy in appearance and should not be used if it is not uniformly this colour after mixing. To mix the vial, gently roll it in your hands at least 10 times before administration.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Mixtard insulin contains a mixture of two types of insulin, soluble and isophane. Mixtard is available in a range of preparations containing these two insulins in differing proportions. Together, the combination is called biphasic isophane insulin. Premixed combinations provide a rapid initial lowering of blood glucose, followed by a more prolonged effect that lasts throughout the day. This is thought to mimic the body's own insulin production more closely.</p>
                        <h4>Long-acting insulins</h4>
                        <p>By mixing insulin with protamine and zinc an even longer action can be elicited. Lente and ultralente insulins start working after six hours and last for 24 hours. Insulin glargine is modified insulin and is opposite in its effect to insulin lispro in that it is designed to provide a constant insulin supply and mimic even more closely the body's own physiological production of insulin. It is hoped that in conjunction with short-acting insulin a more normoglycaemic blood sugar can be maintained throughout a 24-hour period, lessening the risk of having a low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) during the night. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has endorsed the use of this insulin product in both type I and type II diabetes.</p>
                        <h4>Side-effects</h4>
                        <p>The main problem of giving insulin is that the blood sugar may be lowered too much, a state we call hypoglycaemia, which can cause brain damage. A person using insulin is three times more likely to be at risk from the effects of hypoglycaemia than a non-user.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-168-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Patients suffering hypoglycaemia become dizzy, feel faint, begin to sweat and often appear to be drunk. The obvious way to treat this is to give sugar in the form of sweet drinks, glucose tablets or sugary snacks. If the person is unconscious, and this can occur relatively quickly, they will need IV glucose or intramuscular glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone which works in an opposite way to insulin and raises the blood glucose level by promoting the breakdown of stored glucose in the liver and muscles.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Insulin pumps</h4>
                        <p>An insulin pump is portable and attached to the patient (Figure 9.1). It consists of a main pump unit which holds an insulin reservoir (usually 3 ml capacity like the cartridges used in an insulin pen). The reservoir is attached to a long, thin piece of tubing with a needle or cannula at one end which is known as the 'infusion set'.</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>To use the pump, the cartridge is filled with fast-acting insulin and fitted inside. There is no need to take long-acting insulin because the insulin pump delivers constant amounts to the body. The needle or cannula is inserted under the skin and held in place with an adhesive patch, which fixes to the surrounding skin. The other end of the tube is connected to the pump which then delivers insulin through the infusion set according to its programming.</p>
                        <p>Using a pump, patients can instantly change the insulin dose, and fast-acting insulin is more easily absorbed by the body. Because the body gets a constant, regular flow of insulin, the effect is more constant also.</p>
                        <p>Two types of dose are taken, basal and bolus. Modern insulin pumps allow users to regulate both doses at the same time and adjust the basal rate at any point. The basal rate is the same as a long-acting insulin regime for those diabetics without an insulin pump. This programme is consistent and regular, and controls the level of insulin into the bloodstream.</p>
                        <p>The bolus dose is designed to counteract the food being eaten. Therefore, when a diabetic eats a snack or at mealtimes the insulin pump can be programmed to provide an extra boost of insulin. Pumps can also be programmed to release a bolus dose over a longer period, which is be ideal for meals in restaurants and other similar occasions.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>These are drugs that are usually given for type II diabetes. Dietary control certainly works for some people, however many others have difficulty in changing their lifestyles, especially on a permanent basis. For those people whose blood sugar is not controlled by diet alone there are a range of medicines available.</p>
                        <h3>Metformin</h3>
                        <p>Metformin is an antidiabetic medicine from a drug group called biguanides. It works in people with type II diabetes in three ways. First, it reduces the amount of glucose produced by cells in the liver. Second, it increases the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin. Third, it delays movement of glucose from the GI tract to the blood following a meal. The cumulative effect of these processes is to lower the person's blood glucose level.</p>
                        <p>Metformin is described as being a first-line medicine in the treatment of type II diabetes. It can be used in combination with other antidiabetic medicines to provide better normoglycaemia.</p>
                        <p>The drug has a half-life of approximately three hours and a dose of 500 mg three times a day with or after food is usually prescribed. The most common side-effects are anorexia (lack of appetite), diarrhoea and nausea. An increase in lactic acid in the blood is a rare but potentially fatal consequence of taking the medication. This is more common in patients who already have kidney, liver or heart failure who should not be prescribed the drug.</p>
                        <h3>Sulfonylureas</h3>
                        <p>This classification of drug is also used in the treatment of type II diabetes, particularly in people whose diabetes cannot be controlled by diet alone. They work by stimulating the beta cells in the pancreas to secrete insulin. There are two generations of this type of medicine, first generation drugs such as tolbutamide and second generation drugs such as glipizide.</p>
                        <p>Tolbutamide comes as a tablet and is usually taken twice or three times a day. The drug may lead to hypoglycaemia, but, of the first generation drugs, it is probably the safest, especially with the elderly. Its duration of action is approximately six hours and therefore is less likely to cause hypoclycaemia.</p>
                        <p>Glipizide is a more potent drug than tolbutamide, however, both are equally effective in their overall hypoglycaemic ability. This drug is usually well tolerated by patients, but hypoglycaemia is a usual side-effect.</p>
                        <aside class="callout warning" role="alert">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-170-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Patients should be alerted to report symptoms such as shakiness, dizziness, sweating, sudden changes in behaviour and mood, and weakness as these may indicate a low blood sugar.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Oral hypoglycaemic agents such as tolbutamide and glipizide have been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. However, there is no conclusive evidence that suggests that taking these drugs increases the risk of death from myocardial infarction.</p>
                        <p>There are some significant drug interactions with sulfonylureas, and certain drugs potentiate the hypoglycaemic effects. NSAIDs will lead to hypoglycaemia when given with sulfonureas. However, drugs such as thiazide diuretics and corticosteroids lessen the hypoglycaemic effects. This means that patients should have their blood glucose monitored more closely to ensure adequate control is maintained.</p>

                        <p>Some drugs such as meglitnides that are not based on sulfonylureas have also been developed to expand the range of therapy. One such drug is nateglinide, which works in a similar way to sulfonylureas in that it enhances secretion of insulin from the beta cells in the pancreas. It is not as potent as most of the sulfonureas, is rapidly absorbed and has a fairly short elimination half-life of three hours. This means that it has a short duration of action and there is therefore a lower risk of hypoglycaemia as a side-effect.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-170-2.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Nateglinide comes in tablet form and is usually taken three times daily. It can be taken up to 30 minutes before or just prior to a meal. If a meal is missed the patient should not take the tablet; equally, an extra meal will require an extra tablet.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Thiazolidinediones (glitazones)</h3>
                        <p>This class of drug came from a chance finding when it was being used as a fat-lowering treatment and it was noticed that thiazolidinediones also lowered blood glucose. The action of this class of drugs is complex. They reduce the breakdown of stored glucose in the liver and increase the amount of glucose entering muscle tissue. Insulin that is circulating is enhanced by these drugs. The accumulation of these actions leads to a lowering of the blood glucose level. They do not cause hypoglycaemia as a side-effect when used on their own but may do so if combined with insulin or a sulfonurea.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that this class of drugs also lowers fats that are thought to be implicated in the build-up of fatty plaques in blood vessels (atherosclerosis). The only tablet in this group is pioglitazone. Its cardiovascular safety profile compares favourably with rosiglitazone (Avandia), which was withdrawn after concerns about an increased risk of cardiac events. Pioglitazone is used on its own or alongside metformin and/or another antidiabetic medicine to treat type II (non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus. It can also be used with insulin. Pioglitazone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once daily with or without meals. It should be taken at around the same time every day.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-171-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>You should inform the patient that it may take two weeks for their blood sugar to decrease and several weeks longer for them to feel the full effect of pioglitazone.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Common side-effects include nausea, difficulty in focusing, ankle swelling, an increase in appetite and weight gain. Pioglitazone and other similar medications for diabetes may cause or worsen congestive heart failure (a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the other parts of the body).</p>
                        <h3>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors</h3>
                        <p>A drug called acarbose is used from this family of medicines to treat type II diabetes. It works by slowing down the action of chemicals in the body that break down foods which release glucose. Slowing food digestion helps to keep the blood glucose from rising very high after a meal.</p>
                        <p>The medicine is given as a tablet, usually three times a day. It is important that the patient takes each dose with the first bite of their meal. Side-effects include flatulence, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating due to the amount of unabsorbed carbohydrates left in the GI system. Acarbose is not a treatment for diabetes that you will encounter often in a hospital setting although it is an option for patients.</p>
