                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A large number of chronic diseases are brought about by demographic, environmental and lifestyle changes. Common conditions include asthma, diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. As you will see we have split the section on drugs used in chronic conditions into three manageable chapters for you to study. These three chapters will focus on the drug management of each of these conditions. The chapters are only introductory and not intended as comprehensive coverage of all chronic conditions and their pharmaceutical management.</p>
                        <p>This is a large section as there are many chronic and long-term conditions that you will encounter in your nursing career. Choose how to study these chapters using the following as a guide:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start with the respiratory conditions and study these together. You will see many common features in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and indeed the medications used in each are the same for the most part. Be sure you have a good understanding of the respiratory long-term conditions and management before moving on.</li>
                            <li>Diabetes is a huge area of study with the need to look at Type 1 and Type 2 as well as the different oral medications and the range of insulin therapy available. Study this topic and get a good feel for the differences in the types of diabetes and the management before moving on.</li>
                            <li>Many patients you will encounter have a diagnosis of hypertension. The cause of hypertension is often undiagnosed and referred to as 'essential'. Nevertheless treatment is vital as prolonged raised blood pressure can be extremely detrimental to health. It is important that you are aware of the various different drugs available to treat raised blood pressure and how they exert their effect.</li>
                            <li>Parkinson's disease is a condition largely of old age, and with an ageing population one we are seeing more of. Study the medications and become familiar with them before moving on.</li>
                            <li>Epilepsy is a complicated range of conditions and although many of the medications used straddle the types of epilepsy it is important to understand their pharmacological actions so you can see how decision-making in this condition is influenced not only by the condition, but the patient and the medication available.</li>
                            <li>Of course some of the patients you meet will have more than one long-term condition, and this consequently means they may be on many medications (polypharmacy). Look at the section on comorbidities and polypharmacy for a full understanding of the impact that chronic conditions and their pharmacological management can have on your patient.</li>
                            <li>Finally look at the case studies and the multiple choice questions and calculations to help test your learning at the end of the section.</li>
                            <li>Most of all remember the bulk of this section is directly related to the fact that the majority of people you care for over your nursing career will be living with chronic conditions.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Asthma is the leading chronic disease in developed countries and its incidence is increasing. The condition is brought on by a reversible obstruction of the airways which in turn causes the individual to become breathless and start to cough or wheeze. Asthma may be described as being acute or chronic. Severe acute asthma (known as status asthmaticus) is not reversed very easily and, as a result, continues to be fatal and requires prompt treatment. Chronic asthma usually has an intermittent pattern of breathlessness (dyspnoea), coughing and wheezing.</p>
                        <p>In acute asthma the main reason for obstruction of the airways is bronchoconstriction caused by a substance called histamine. Further significant obstruction of the airways is brought about by inflammatory changes in the mucosa which cause an increase in mucous production, more epithelial cells being shed and swelling of the tissues within the respiratory passages.</p>
                        <p>Asthma symptoms are thought to be caused by what doctors describe as hyper-reactivity or hyper-responsiveness of the cells lining the air passages. It seems that bronchiolar tissue in certain individuals is more sensitive to certain trigger factors than other people in the general population. Trigger factors include irritant chemicals, exposure to foreign proteins called allergens, and cold air.</p>
                        <p>Numerous cells and chemicals play a part in the changes that take place in the tissues of a person who suffers from asthma. We will now consider these changes in order to provide an understanding of how drugs used in this condition work.</p>
                        <h3>Pathological changes in asthma</h3>
                        <p>The changes in the respiratory system that bring about asthma are initiated by an allergic reaction.</p>
                        <p>The trigger factor stimulates the body's immune response and as part of this the body produces a type of white cell called a B-lymphocyte. Some of these B-lymphocytes mature into a type of cell called a plasma cell. These cells produce a chemical called immunoglobulin E which is a type of antibody. These antibodies in turn attach themselves to a type of tissue cell called a mast cell.</p>
                        <p>These mast cells are now stimulated to produce a substance called histamine. Histamine is a potent constrictor of the muscles in the air passages, causing them to become narrowed. This is called bronchoconstriction. Histamine also causes local blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable so that other inflammatory cells in the plasma can move into the tissues. Not only does histamine cause constriction of bronchial smooth muscle, it also leads to swelling of the tissues.</p>
                        <p>Another specific group of white cells thought to be involved in asthma are the eosinophils. This group of cells are implicated in the inflammatory response by releasing a range of chemicals that contribute to the contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, permeability of small blood vessels and excessive secretion of mucous. It is also suggested that the eosinophils produce chemicals that have a toxic effect on the epithelial lining of the airways and are responsible for the greater amount of epithelial shedding associated with this condition.</p>
                        <p>Macrophages are a type of bacteria-engulfing cell or phagocyte which are protective in function. However, in asthma these cells are responsible for releasing a group of substances called prostaglandins and platelet-activating factors which sustain the bronchial hyperactivity. This is thought to occur by increasing mucosal oedema, facilitating the number of eosinophils in the airway tissues.</p>
                        <p>The swelling of the local tissues from oedema is compounded by extra mucous production. Mucous is part of our general defence strategy in that it provides us with a mechanism to trap particles and bacteria and clear them from the upper respiratory tract. However, in asthma the size of the bronchial glands and goblet cells is increased and they subsequently produce large amounts of mucous which is thickened by cell debris from the epithelial shedding. The cilia that normally waft debris towards the pharynx also have their capability curtailed, contributing to the overall obstruction of the person's air passages.</p>
                        <h3>Asthma in children</h3>
                        <p>Asthma is the leading cause of chronic illness in children. It affects as many as 15 per cent of children in the UK and, for unknown reasons, is steadily increasing. It can begin at any age, but most children have their first symptoms by age 5. Children still die from asthma - there were 27 recorded deaths in 2005 - and there is still significant disability associated with the disease, particularly severe childhood asthma, despite pharmacological advances.</p>
                        <p>There are many risk factors for developing childhood asthma, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>presence of allergies;</li>
                            <li>family history of asthma and/or allergies;</li>
                            <li>frequent respiratory infections;</li>
                            <li>low birth weight;</li>
                            <li>exposure to tobacco smoke before and/or after birth;</li>
                            <li>being male;</li>
                            <li>being black;</li>
                            <li>obesity;</li>
                            <li>being raised in a low-income environment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>No one really knows why more and more children are developing asthma. Some experts suggest that children are being exposed to more and more allergens such as dust, air pollution and second-hand smoke. These factors are all triggers of asthma. Others suspect that children are not exposed to enough childhood illnesses to build up their immune system, meaning that the body fails to make enough protective antibodies. Still others suggest that decreasing rates of breastfeeding have prevented important substances of the immune system from being passed on to babies.</p>
                        <p>Diagnosis of asthma in children is difficult because of the complex nature of the disorder in the young. In an adult a wheeze is a very important sign in the diagnosis of asthma, however, in children there are many different causes of wheeze. In addition, children younger than 5 are generally unable to perform pulmonary function tests with the result that doctors rely heavily on history, symptoms and examination in making a diagnosis.</p>
                        <p>Most asthma medications that are given to adults and older children can also safely be prescribed to toddlers and younger children. Drugs that are approved for younger children are given in doses adjusted for their age and weight. Specifically, children of 4 years and up may be prescribed the asthma inhaler seretide. This treats both airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. In the case of inhaled drugs, a different delivery device based on the child's age and ability may be required because many children are not able to coordinate their breathing well enough to use a standard inhaler.</p>

                            <p>You will probably be asked to give a child asthma medications using a nebulizer while on placement. A nebulizer delivers asthma drugs, usually bronchodilators, by changing them from a liquid to a mist. The child gets the drug by breathing it in through a facemask. These breathing treatments usually take about 10-15 minutes and are given several times a day. Children may be able to use a metered dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer. A spacer is a chamber that attaches to the MDI and holds the burst of medication (see Figure 8.1).</p>

                        <p>There are two basic drug groups given to patients who have asthma: bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents (see Box 8.1). They are not mutually exclusive - i.e. some bronchodilators may have an effect on inflammatory cells. Bronchodilators are the first group of drugs that we will focus upon.</p>
                        <h3>Beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists</h3>
                        <p>These drugs are referred to as bronchodilators. They open the air passages by directly activating beta receptors, relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of the bronchioles. This allows a more normal movement of air between the atmosphere and the alveoli. This group of drugs is available in both short- and long-acting forms. An example of a short-acting form in this class is salbutamol.</p>

                            <p>Beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists are often referred to as 'rescue remedies' because they ease the difficult breathing (dyspnoea), shortness of breath and wheezing associated with an asthma attack. Generally, these drugs have a short period of action.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Most short-acting beta 2 agonists are available as aerosols to inhale by mouth several times a day. Most are also available as solutions that can be used with a special apparatus called a nebulizer. The maximum effect occurs within 30 minutes and the duration of action is between four and six hours. The patient is usually prescribed the drug on a 'prn' (pro re nata - as required) basis.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">

                            <p>The longer-acting drugs in this class are often called 'controllers' because they help people with moderate to severe asthma control their symptoms. The effects of these drugs are longer-lasting at around 12 hours. An example of a drug in this class is salmeterol.</p>

                        <p>These medications are also available as dry powders, administered by inhalation. However, they are not prescribed on a prn basis but are taken regularly, such as twice a day. Sometimes you may find this type of drug being used alongside a glucocorticoid preparation.</p>
                        <p>Beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists do not control the inflammatory response in asthma and if a patient is finding it difficult to control their symptoms by using this class of drug a corticosteroid preparation may be added. The most common side-effect of beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists is tremor.</p>
                        <h3>Methylxanthines</h3>
                        <p>The drug from this family most commonly employed in the clinical setting is theophylline, which works as a bronchodilator by relaxing the bronchial smooth muscle. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed but it is still unclear how this drug produces its effects. Recently theophylline has also been shown to have some anti-inflammatory activity, especially with regard to mast cell activity. Theophylline is a useful drug in that it produces bronchial dilation so reducing the symptoms of chronic asthma, reducing the dosage of oral corticosteroids and reducing the requirement for symptomatic use of beta 2 adrenoreceptor agonists.</p>
                        <p>The drug is well absorbed from the GI tract and therefore can be given orally. Peak levels are achieved within one to two hours. However, if given with food, this will take longer. The drug has a relatively short half-life and therefore you will come across a variety of sustained release preparations.</p>
                        <p>The drug is metabolized in the liver by a group of enzymes called cytochrome P450. Therefore, if the patient is taking other drugs using the same enzyme system, theophylline will accumulate. Two examples of drugs that might cause this interaction are erythromycin and ciprofloxacin.</p>
                        <p>Theophylline is used both in chronic asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, see p. 138) and as an emergency treatment in acute severe asthma. Despite its effectiveness it is not used as a first-line treatment but rather a third- or fourth-line option. One of the factors that limits its use is the high incidence of side-effects within its therapeutic range and narrow therapeutic index. As the plasma levels of the drug increase, so do the side-effects, and concordance with this drug can be poor because of these side-effects. Theophylline has a stimulant effect on the central nervous system causing increased alertness, and can interfere with sleep. The drug also stimulates the cardiovascular system: the heart rate increases as does the force of contraction and thereby the patient's blood pressure. Indigestion is also a common side-effect, probably due to the drug increasing gastric secretion and relaxation of the cardiac sphincter, therefore leading to reflux.</p>
                        <p>Deaths associated with theophylline have been reported and are due to the serious cardiovascular side-effect of dysrhythmia. Seizures are also a further life-threatening side-effect and can occur in concentrations only just above the therapeutic level.</p>
                        <h3>Muscarinic receptor antagonists</h3>
                        <p>The parasympathetic nervous system causes bronchoconstriction; therefore, if these effects on the bronchioles of the lungs were blocked dilatation would take place. This is the basic premise of this group of drugs. The compounds are used mainly in asthma, chronic bronchitis and COPD.</p>
                        <h4>Ipratropium</h4>
                        <p>This medicine comes as a solution to inhale by mouth, either as an aerosol or in a nebulizer. The aerosol is usually prescribed four times a day. The bronchodilator effect begins after approximately 45 minutes and lasts for about three to five hours. This drug can cause side-effects ranging from leaving an unpleasant taste in the mouth and/or a dry mouth to rashes, hoarseness and chest pain.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-155-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>It is recommended that an asthmatic patient who needs to use a bronchodilator more than once or twice daily on a regular basis should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids. Patients should be advised that inhaled corticosteroids will have no effect when taken for acute symptoms. Patients should also understand that it will take a number of weeks before they start to appreciate the benefit of these medicines. The usual maintenance dose of these drugs is in the range of 200-800 mcg per day, usually given in two to four doses.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Inhaled corticosteroids</h3>
                        <p>Glucocorticoids are dealt with in more detail in Chapter 6. They do not bring about bronchodilatation and are not given as an immediate response to the trigger factor. However, inhaled corticosteroids are now a regular therapy in asthma management. Two drugs commonly used are beclometasone dipropionate and budesonide. Both have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity. When inhaled they prevent the production of a chemical called arachidonic acid which in turn leads to the reduced formation of prostaglandins and leucotrienes, reducing the inflammatory response (see Chapter 6). Both drugs when taken regularly reduce the frequency of 'rescue' bronchodilator intake.</p>
                        <p>Inhaled corticosteroids are now preferred to oral steroids because of the reduced incidence of side-effects. However, side-effects do still occur but are usually only local in nature, for example sore and dry throat, and occasionally patients may develop oral thrush (candidiasis).</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-156-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>Candidiasis can be prevented to some extent by rinsing the mouth after inhaling the drug or using a special device called a spacer which reduces the deposits of the drug in the tissues of the mouth and throat. The patient may have to be treated with antifungal lozenges.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>More serious local side-effects are hoarseness and changes of the voice (dysphonia). General or systemic side-effects are seen in high dosages. Beclometasone may cause weakening of bone (osteoporosis), while other side-effects may include increased bruising and thinning of the skin (dermal thinning).</p>
                        <h3>Cromoglicate</h3>
                        <p>This medicine is not a bronchodilator, however if given prior to an asthmatic attack it prevents the immediate and later bronchoconstrictive reactions to inhaled allergens by stopping the release of mediators such as histamine from mast cells. It is thought that this medicine blocks calcium channels from opening in the mast cells. As calcium is blocked from entering the cells, so in turn is the release of inflammatory mediators. However, its exact mode of action is still not known.</p>
                        <p>Cromoglicate is given by inhaler, initially two puffs four times daily. For protection against bronchospasm caused by exercise the medicine should be used 15 to 30 minutes beforehand. If adequate response to the medicine is obtained then the dose may be reduced to two to six puffs daily.</p>
                        <p>The most frequently reported adverse reactions are throat irritation or dryness, a bad taste in the mouth, coughing, wheezing and nausea. Severe anaphylaxis and bronchospasm can occur but are fortunately rare.</p>

                            <p>As inhaled medicines are so important in the management of asthma it is equally important that nurses educate their patients in a systematic manner (Figure 8.2).</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Get the patient to hold the inhaler with the clear end pointing upwards. Place the metal canister inside the clear end, ensuring that it is fully and firmly in place and that the canister is at room temperature.</li>
                                <li>Remove the protective dust cap from the end of the mouthpiece. If the cap was not placed on the mouthpiece, check the mouthpiece for dirt or other objects.</li>
                                <li>If the patient is using the inhaler for the first time or has not used it in the last three days, get them to prime it by pressing down on the canister to release two sprays into the air, away from their face. Ensure they do not spray the medication into their eyes.</li>
                                <li>Ask the patient to breathe out as completely as possible through their mouth, then to hold the inhaler between the thumb and the next two fingers with the mouthpiece at the bottom and facing them. The patient should then place the open end of the mouthpiece into their mouth and avoid covering the drug outlet piece with their tongue. The patient should close their lips tightly around the mouthpiece and close their eyes.</li>
                                <li>The patient should now breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece at the same time pressing down firmly on the top of the canister.</li>
                                <li>The patient should hold their breath for a count of 10, then remove the inhaler and breathe out slowly.</li>
                                <li>If the patient is to take another dose, ask them to wait for approximately 15 seconds and then repeat steps 4-6.</li>
                                <li>Finally ask the patient to replace the protective cap on the inhaler.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>COPD is a general term which includes the conditions chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD is the preferred term, but you may also hear it called 'chronic obstructive airways disease' (COAD). Chronic bronchitis and emphysema commonly occur alongside each other, leading to the airways becoming narrowed and a limitation of the flow of air to and from the lungs, causing shortness of breath. In clinical practice, COPD is defined by its characteristically low airflow in lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, this limitation is poorly reversible and usually gets progressively worse over time. In England, approximately 1 person in 59 is diagnosed with COPD at some point in their lives.</p>
                        <p>The most common cause of COPD is smoking. Once you give up smoking, you gradually reduce the chances of suffering from COPD, and you slow down its progress if you already have it. Occupational factors, such as coal dust and some inherited problems can also cause COPD. Whether pollution is a factor is under investigation.</p>
                        <p>A productive cough is usually the first symptom to develop, meaning that the patient produces sputum (phlegm). This cough tends to come and go at first, and then gradually becomes more persistent (chronic). The patient may actually refer to this cough as being a 'smoker's cough' in the early stages of the disease. When breathlessness begins, people often become more concerned.</p>
                        <p>Breathlessness and a wheeze may at first occur only when the person is exerting themselves, such as when they climb the stairs. The symptoms become gradually worse over the years especially if the person continues to smoke. Difficulty with breathing may eventually become quite distressing.</p>
                        <p>Chest infections are more common in a person who has COPD. A sudden worsening of symptoms (such as when the patient has an infection) is called an exacerbation. Wheezing with a cough and breathlessness become worse than usual and the patient may cough up more sputum than normal. Such infections can be caused by bacteria or viruses. Bacteria (which can be killed using antibiotics) cause about one in two or three exacerbations of COPD. Viruses (not killed with antibiotics) such as the common cold virus may also be responsible for up to one in three exacerbations.</p>
                        <p>Stopping smoking is the most important treatment and no other may be needed if the disease is at an early stage and the symptoms are mild. If symptoms become troublesome, one or more of the following treatments may be advised (treatments do not cure COPD but they can ease the symptoms). As a general rule, a trial of one to three months of a treatment will give an indication as to whether it is helpful or not. The main treatments are medications in powdered form given via inhalers.</p>

                        <p>Doctors use several kinds of medications to treat the symptoms and complications of COPD. A patient may take some medications on a regular basis and others as needed.

However there are other drugs that you will come across when nursing someone with COPD that you will need to know about.</p>

                        <p>For patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, long-acting bronchodilators are the mainstay of therapy; as symptoms progress, guidelines recommend combining bronchodilators from different classes to improve efficacy.</p>
                        <h3>Inhaled long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABAs)</h3>
                        <p>Examples of medicines in this category that you are likely to come across are formoterol and salmeterol. They improve the function of the lungs, the patient will also state that they feel breathing is easier for them and they feel generally less breathlessness. They may also report that they do not get as out of breath as they used to when carrying out daily activities. The medicines have also been associated with the patient having fewer occurrences of acute signs and symptoms (exacerbations) from their COPD. This class of medicines, therefore, improves the quality of life for the patient. However, because COPD is not curable not all patients will see an improvement in their signs and symptoms. Commentators express the view that use of this class of medicine is advisable as they have an acceptable safety record and have not been associated with an increased respiratory death rate.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title"><img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_3dc7bd3278906e468293g-159-1.jpg" alt="decorative icon" style="height: 1em; display: inline; margin: 0;"> Clinical tip</h4>
                            <p>The more long-acting beta 2 agonist the patient takes, the more likely are side-effects such as fine tremor, tachycardia, headache and muscle cramp, therefore the nurse should ask the patient to report and document these, as palpitations and tremor may limit the dose that can be tolerated.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Formoterol and salmeterol have 12-hour durations of action; this compares to 4-6 hours in salbutamol. This is desirable as a more sustained opening of the bronchioles (bronchodilation) is needed. Researchers are currently looking to develop an even longer-lasting bronchodilator, as a LABA with a 24-hour duration of action could provide the capacity for beneficial change, compared with twice-daily LABAs. A once-daily dosing regimen could help improve compliance as the patient would be more likely to remember to take it. Ideally, a newly developed LABA would demonstrate a rapid onset of action, and a safety record at least comparable to existing LABAs.</p>
                        <p>Indacaterol is a new LABA that is being developed with the characteristics that we have just outlined. Indacaterol has a 24-hour duration of bronchodilation and rapid onset of action, and currently is the most advanced drug in this classification. Preliminary results from large clinical trials suggest indacaterol improves the function of the lungs when compared with a tablet that has no known effect (placebo) and other long-acting medicines. Other LABAs that are being developed with a 24-hour duration of bronchodilation are carmoterol, vilanterol trifenatate and oldaterol, early conclusions seem to indicate that these drugs may now be ready for trials with patients.</p>
                        <p>The introduction of once-daily LABAs also provides the opportunity to develop combination inhalers of two or more classes of once-daily long-acting bronchodilators, so are very similar to the combination of short-acting beta 2 agonists which you will have come across. This would be an obvious advantage to the patient with COPD patients as it would simplify the medicine regime as well as lead to beneficial changes in the patient's condition. These once-daily LABAs could be used on their own, combined with another LABA or used in combination with long-acting muscarinic antagonists. This advance in pharmacology looks very promising for patients with this debilitating chronic condition.</p>
                        <h3>Long acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs)</h3>
                        <p>It is not only LABAs that have increased the quality of life for patients with COPD but also the advent of long-acting anti-muscarinic drugs such as tiotropium, aclidinium and glycopyrronium.</p>
                        <p>Tiotropium is probably the drug you are most familiar with. This was the first to be formulated in this classification of drugs. It has been shown by many studies to be an effective bronchodilator which has a long-lasting effect on the tissues. Tiotropium provides consistent 24-hour bronchodilation. It improves the symptoms for the individual and just as the LABAs it therefore improves their quality of life. The bonus for the patient is just like the LABAs it has also been found to lessen the rate of exacerbation. Tiotropium comes in what is known as the handihaler and the respimat device. The handihaler (Figure 8.3) uses a dry powder which the patient inhales on a daily basis. The powder is released from a capsule which is placed in the device and pierced by a mechanism. You will find that this device is prescribed to the patient once a year and then they get monthly refills on their prescription. Some patients have difficulty using the handihaler. For patients unable to use this device the drug company have produced an alternative called the respimat.</p>

                        <p>Aclidinium bromide is a newer drug in this classification of medicines that results in bronchodilation. Unlike Tiotropium it is administered twice daily to relieve symptoms in COPD. As we have already stated this is another example of a LAMA. This one is administered via a breath-activated dry powder inhaler (Figure 8.4). Aclidinium should now be considered as a first-line LAMA, according to NICE Quality Standards Guidelines.</p>

                        <p>Glycopyrronium is another medicine in this category. It is administered (Figure 8.5) once per day to relieve symptoms in moderate to severe COPD. This medicine is also a first line LAMA as per the NICE Quality Standards Guidelines. However, patients that have already been prescribed tiotropium do not need to be switched simply for the sake of it. Some patients may suffer cardiovascular side-effects with this medicine, so it is important that they are monitored to ensure the benefits are outweighing the risks.</p>

                        <h3>Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors</h3>
                        <p>With inflammatory changes occurring in the lung tissues of a patient with COPD, it is not surprising to find cells associated with inflammatory changes being present. The main inflammatory cells found in the tissues in COPD patients are macrophages and lymphocytes, with polymorphs increasing during acute exacerbations. As the COPD progresses so does the severity of inflammation in the small airways and lung tissue. These physiological alterations contribute to tissue in the airways becoming thicker, narrowing the air passages. Due to lung tissue destruction, the elastic recoil of the lungs becomes diminished. Another physiological response in inflammation is hypersecretion of mucus, which diminishes airway size even further and makes gaseous exchange more difficult.</p>
                        <p>If we could pharmacologically inhibit the inflammatory response in this disease then we would improve the symptoms for the patient and his quality of life. This is what the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors do. They are a relatively new addition to the treatment of COPD and their mode of action is anti-inflammatory in nature. Examples of drugs in this class are cilomilast and roflumilast-described as potent and selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors. We discussed the medicine theophylline earlier in this chapter, and theophylline is a weak non-selective PDE inhibitor. In comparison to theophylline, the selective PDE4 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, with demonstrated efficacy in improving lung function, decreasing the rate of exacerbations and improving quality of life, with proven anti-inflammatory effects in patients with COPD.</p>
                        <p>As we have discussed earlier theophylline is a difficult drug to use in clinical practice. You have to be very careful to get the right amount of medicine into the plasma, or toxic side-effects will occur. As a result the patient will require routine blood tests to check the level of the drug in the patient's plasma. Also the patient requires careful monitoring of the cardiovascular and central nervous system for signs or symptoms of side-effects. Many patients may need dose adjustment before getting the best result from use of this medicine. In contrast, the selective PDE4 inhibitors are more convenient to use for both patient and nurse. Because of this and because of the potency of the anti-inflammatory effects of the PDE4 inhibitors, you will see more of these medicines being used in clinical practice and less theophylline.</p>
