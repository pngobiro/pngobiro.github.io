                        <p>In order to become safe in the administration of medicines and become competent in the education of patients with regard to their medication, the nurse must have knowledge of basic pharmacology and physiology. Also, in the interests of patient safety, they must be able to complete simple drug calculations. This book has introduced you to the knowledge necessary when engaging in these skills.</p>
                        <p>The focus of your career is nursing and it is important that any science subject is applied to that discipline. The clinical tips have been designed to give you an insight into the importance of understanding pharmacology and to be relevant to the process of nursing. We hope that the first two chapters managed to set the scene in terms of introducing topics and concepts that enabled you to understand Chapters 4 to 9 in more depth.</p>
                        <p>Chapter 3 should have enabled you to consolidate your understanding of drug calculations. This chapter is more of a reminder, and is not meant to be an exhaustive appraisal of different calculating regimens, but refers you to other text to help with this, and instead focuses on the basic numerical skills required for safe calculation.</p>
                        <p>Chapters 4 to 11 should have given you a feel for the fascinating world of pharmacology and also demonstrated to you how important this concept is to nursing. The links to physiology should have been helpful in terms of your understanding. We hope that the breadth and depth of the discussion has left you wanting to read further and there are many books out there which can give you more detail and cover a wider range of medicines.</p>
                        <p>Chapter 12 should have given you an insight into the patient's role and responsibility with regard to their medicine management. Nurses generally are well placed to help patients understand the need to adhere to instruction and advice. Often the nurse is the agent of continuity in the patient's journey, therefore we hope you have gained some insight into the importance of your role as a health educator.</p>
                        <p>Several studies during the past few years have suggested that nurses were not very accurate in drug calculations. This resulted in changes taking place at a pre-registration education level. Most universities now test the competence of their students in drug calculations by either formal or informal methods. We hope that the questions at the end of most chapters were realistic and helped you to practise your mathematics in relation to drug dosages.</p>
                        <p>The whole area of giving a medicine is fraught with potential pitfalls. That is why we hope you enjoyed Chapter 13. Calculating the correct dose is obviously important, but there remain other areas of law and professional standards which need upholding if you are to become a safe practitioner.</p>
                        <p>Overall we hope this book has given you the motivation and interest to want to increase your knowledge in this important area of nursing. There are many texts that you can refer to as you become more knowledgeable and inquisitive (see our suggestions for further reading). We hope that our book has been one of the first stepping stones in your chosen career as a nurse.</p>
