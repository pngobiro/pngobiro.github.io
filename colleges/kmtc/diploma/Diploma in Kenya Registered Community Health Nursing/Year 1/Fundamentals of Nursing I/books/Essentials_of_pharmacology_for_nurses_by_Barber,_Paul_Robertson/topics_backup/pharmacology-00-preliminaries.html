                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"This latest edition of a key textbook onpharmacologyfor nurses has moved forward from previous editions by becoming stronger by the inclusion of a greater scope of material so maintaining its place as an essentialpharmacology bookfor current and forthcoming nursing students in all clinical practice fields to give them a strong evidence base for their studies and clinical practice. The addition of a chapter on drug calculations is an essential step forward in this edition for all students as this is a key component within all current nursing degree programmes. The continued use of case studies and clinical tips makes learning fun both as an individual but also in small learning groups of students.</p>
                            <p>It follows a clear pathway for learning: it is easy to read, is clearly written and shows the importance of aspects of pharmacology within the work of a nurse."</p>

                        <p>As this book is primarily for undergraduate nursing students it seems fitting that we let them begin the introduction.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>'Nurses need pharmacology education so they can inform the patient of what they're giving, why they're giving it and what it's going to do to them, and what to look out for.'</p>
                            <p>'The patient needs to know what they're taking, why they're taking it and when to take it, they need to know what it's for precisely, and its precise function in their life so that they take it seriously.'</p>
                            <p>'Pharmacology education will be important in the future because the nurse's role is expanding, taking more away from junior doctors. Nurse prescribing is expanding in the community, and is probably going to happen more in hospitals.'</p>
                            <p>'I think I had about two separate sessions that lasted about an hour. It was definitely not enough, we complained about it several times actually, that we should have had more pharmacology sessions. I'm sure they could have fitted a few more pharmacology sessions in.'</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Where then do we start with the process of education? It is our belief that the key to education is through a process of motivation. We both remember, as students, sitting and trying to come to terms with scientific language and almost falling asleep in an attempt to unravel the intricacies of mathematical formulae and biochemical presentations of molecular function.</p>
                        <p>Learning about medicines is a fundamental part of the nurse's role, whichever field of nursing you decide to choose as a career pathway. This book is written in an attempt to bring to life and engage you in the subjects of pharmacology and calculation of drugs. First, you will notice that not all drugs are listed. Indeed, we have tried to focus on some of the major drug groups so as to give you a taste of how interesting the subject can be, without initially overwhelming you. Each of the chapters that discusses major drug groups has been enhanced by the inclusion of relevant aspects of physiology.</p>
                        <p>When putting the initial idea for the book together, we decided that it should include both aspects of pharmacology and drug calculations. However, the book does not contain detailed types of formulae - rather it gives you a basic structure on which to build. We wanted the calculations to reflect each of the chapter's contents and give you a sense of what might be expected in practice. You will not find many examples of the giving of intravenous fluids, because we felt this to be well covered in other texts, some of which you will find in the recommended reading section at the end of each chapter. These sections deliberately repeat the key texts in this field for your ease of reference, and in addition include works specific to the chapter's topic.</p>
                        <p>A further feature of the book is the inclusion of case studies. At the end of each chapter you will find two, three or four scenarios (although the chapters on chronic conditions are treated differently). Unlike most other books, we have included examples of some of the issues that you should consider in analysing each case.</p>
                        <p>Where possible we have also tried to focus the pharmacology on nursing practice. You will notice that in each chapter there are several boxes entitled 'Clinical tip'. These are designed to increase your understanding of the importance of pharmacology within nursing. They should also assist you in reflecting on your everyday practice in medicines' management.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we have included 10 multiple choice questions for each of the chapters in the book; those questions relating to Chapters 8-10 are in Chapter 10. All the questions are based on information included in the chapter so there are no trick questions. We thought the idea of evaluating what you have gained in knowledge from reading each chapter was important and we hope you enjoy getting them all right!</p>
                        <p>Well dear student, it is now time to embark on what we hope will be a fascinating journey. We hope this journey will assist you with your initial learning needs, inspire you to ask more questions, and also motivate you to move on to more detailed texts. As we said earlier, motivation is the key to education. You are now our judge and jury. Enjoy!</p>
