                        <p>It is important that you are familiar with the structure of numbers and how they are expressed in written form. Going back to basics and starting from simple principles will help you develop your knowledge as we move into the area of drug calculation.</p>
                        <p>Number format and the way numbers are written and expressed are important. We are all familiar with numbers but how many of us think about the written format and what it means to us when we perform calculations?</p>
                        <h3>Number order</h3>
                        <p>The order in which a digit is placed within a written number tells us the value of that digit. If we look at single digits we call these units and they contain the numbers 0 to 9. They form the basis of all the numbers we can make. Look at Box 3.1 to see how numbers are divided into places within an individual number.</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>So again if we look at some numbers we can work out the value of each digit within the number:<br>
                        1.2 contains the digits 1 (units column) and 2 (tenths column).<br>
                        2.75 contains the digits 2 (units column), 7 (tenths column) and 5 (hundredths column).<br>
                        3.825 contains the digits 3 (units column), 8 (tenths column), 2 (hundredths column) and 5 (thousandths column).</p>
                        <p>Look at the numbers you see in everyday practice and reflect on what order each digit takes within a number and how you think of that number. Consider the following about number order:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It helps us decide how big or small a number is.</li>
                            <li>It helps us decide how numbers relate to one another.</li>
                            <li>It helps us structure our working to ensure we carry out calculations properly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We will apply the principle of number order when we start to carry out simple calculations.</p>
                        <p>Before we get to grips with drug calculations, let's remind ourselves of basic arithmetic skills and how to manipulate numbers.</p>

                        <p>Take a look at the contents of Box 3.3. You should be familiar with all of these symbols and their meanings before moving on, so look carefully at each one and ensure you can pair the correct process with its accompanying mathematical symbol.</p>

                        <p>Now let us look at these processes one by one.</p>
                        <h3>Addition</h3>
                        <p>Addition is the process of taking two or more numbers and combining them to make a new number. It is a simple process but often used to work out how many tablets a patient needs to take at any one time. For example:</p>
                        <p>Jane is on a medication A for her heart and she takes 1 tablet in the morning.</p>
                        <p>She is also on a medication B for her blood pressure, she takes 2 tablets for that in the morning.</p>
                        <p>Finally, she is on a medication C for pain and takes 2 tablets for that in the morning.</p>
                        <p>How many tablets does she take first thing? Let's break this down into a sum:<br>A is 1<br>B is 2<br>C is 2<br>Now let's add them all together and use the mathematical symbols:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$1+2+2=5$$</div>
                        <p>This means Jane takes five tablets every morning.</p>
                        <p>Addition of number is a process whereby the order of the digits in the number need to be considered before starting the process. Here is a simple example to show you how to add different numbers together.</p>
                        <p>In the number 51 we have 5 (tens) and 1 (units). If we want to add the number 22 we have to ensure that we add the tens together and then the units together.</p>
                        <p>We would therefore place them in the following way</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>  51
+ 22
----
  73</code></pre>
                        <p>We can see that the 5 and the 2 combine to for 7 (tens column) and the 1 and the 2 combine to form 3 (units column) giving us a new number of 73.</p>
                        <p>The same principles apply to larger numbers and we must ensure that units, tens, hundreds and so on are all in the correct place before carrying out the addition process.</p>
                        <p>Try the following to test your addition skills, the answers are at the end of the chapter.</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>11 + 27 =
23 + 45 =
101 + 273 =
450 + 339 =
1022 + 2174 =</code></pre>
                        
                        <h3>Subtraction</h3>
                        <p>Subtraction is the process of taking one or more numbers from a starting number to make a new number. Again this is a simple process but often used to work out how long a bottle of medication may last.</p>
                        <p>John has a 100 ml bottle of medication. He knows he need to take 10 ml per day and he has already had 4 days' worth from it, so has used 40 ml . He is going away for 7 days and knows he needs 70 ml to last him the whole time he is away. He needs to calculate how much is left in his current bottle.</p>
                        <p>He started with 100 ml and has used 40 ml. Let's make that into a calculation and use the mathematical symbols.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$100-40=60 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>That means John does not have enough medication and must obtain more.</p>
                        <p>Like addition, it is important that we consider the order of the digits in the number before commencing the process. Here is a simple example to show you how to subtract different numbers from one another:</p>
                        <p>In the number 59 we have 5 (tens) and 9 (units). If we want to subtract the number 22 we have to ensure that we add the tens together and then the units together.</p>
                        <p>We would therefore place them in the following way.</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>  59
- 22
----
  37</code></pre>
                        <p>Try the following to test your subtraction skills, the answers are at the end of the chapter:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>19 - 17 =
53 - 41 =
177 - 73 =
458 - 334 =
1726 - 1114 =</code></pre>

                        <h3>Multiplication</h3>
                        <p>Multiplication is the process of taking one or more numbers and combining them to make a new number called a product. Many of you will have learned simple multiplication (or times) tables at school. This gives us a good grounding in multiplication of small numbers and helps us to work out how to do this as number size increases. As we often give drugs many 'times' a day we can use multiplication to calculate the total amount of medicine a person needs in a day.</p>
                        <p>Francine needs her medication 4 times per day. Each time she takes it she needs to have 2 tablets. How many does she take in a day?</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$4 \times 2=8 \text{ tablets per day}$$</div>
                        <p>Knowledge of our 2 or 4 times table would have helped with this. It is worthwhile revising your tables to familiarize yourself with simple multiplication. Tables can be found on the internet. Try this website: http://www.mathsisfun.com/tables. html. Or they can be bought in book form from many retailers.</p>
                        <p>Here is a number table and you can see how it can be used to find the answer above:</p>

                        <p>When multiplying larger numbers it is important that we consider the order of the digits in the number before commencing the process. Here is a simple example to show you how to multiply larger numbers:</p>
                        <p>In the number 55 we have 5 (tens) and 5 (units). If we want to multiply by the number 4 we have to ensure that we place the tens and then the units correctly.</p>
                        <p>We would therefore place them in the following way</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>  55
x  4
----
 220</code></pre>
                        <p>This allows us to multiply the units by 4 ($4 \times 5=20$).</p>
                        <p>And the tens by 4 ($4 \times 50=200$). To give an answer of 220.</p>
                        <p>Try the following to test your multiplication skills, the answers are at the end of the chapter:</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>3 × 4 =
9 × 7 =
10 × 3 =
20 × 4 =
6 × 15 =</code></pre>

                        <h3>Division</h3>
                        <p>This is the opposite of multiplication where we take one number and divide it by another to create a new number. If we have calculated a total dose a patient has to receive over a day in more than one dose, we can use division to find out how much each individual dose should be.</p>
                        <p>Sam requires 100 mg of medication to be given today, but he must have the 100 mg split into 4 equal doses. How many mg for each dose?</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$100 / 4=25 \mathrm{mg} \text{ for each dose.}$$</div>
                        <p>When dividing numbers it is important that we consider the order of the digits in the number before commencing the process. Here is a simple example to show you how to divide one number by another:</p>
                        <p>In the number 66 we have 6 (tens) and 6 (units). If we want to divide by the number 3 we have to ensure that we place the tens and then the units correctly.</p>
                        <p>We would therefore place them in the following way</p>
                        <pre class="code-block"><code>66 / 3 = 22</code></pre>
                        <p>This allows us to divide the units by 3 (6 / 3 = 2). And the tens by 3 (60 / 3 = 20). To give an answer of 22.</p>

                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{\mathrm{D} \times \mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{H}}=\mathrm{X}$$</div>
                        <p>Where:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>D = desired dose</li>
                            <li>H = strength available</li>
                            <li>Q = quantity or unit of measure (for tablets Q=1, for liquids Q can vary)</li>
                            <li>X = dose to be determined/amount to be given</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The steps for using the basic formula method are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>first, memorize the formula;</li>
                            <li>remember to convert all the units to same system and size;</li>
                            <li>place all of the unit information into the correct position within the basic formula;</li>
                            <li>calculate your answer;</li>
                            <li>label all answers (e.g. tablets, capsules, millilitres).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Here are some examples:</p>
                        <p>The doctor orders a dose of 50 mg to be given orally.</p>
                        <p>You have 25 mg tablets.</p>
                        <p>How many tablets should you give?</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{50}{25} \times 1 = \mathrm{X}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{2}{1} \times 1 = 2$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{X} = 2 \text{ tablets}$$</div>
                        <p>The patient requires 400 mg of liquid to be given orally.</p>
                        <p>You have 250 mg in 5 ml of solution. What volume of drug should be given?</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{400}{250} \times 5 = \mathrm{X}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{8}{5} \times 5 = 8$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$\mathrm{X} = 8 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>The patient needs 240 mg of drug D by injection 150 mg in 5 ml of liquid is available.</p>
                        <p>How many millilitres will you administer?</p>
                        <p>The dose has to be given at a rate of 1 ml every 30 seconds: how long will each dose last?</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{240}{150} \times 5 = \mathrm{X}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{24}{15} \times 5 = 8 \mathrm{ml} \text{ to be given}$$</div>
                        <p>1 ml every 30 seconds = 2 ml every minute</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$\frac{8}{2}=4 \text{ minutes}$$</div>
                    </div>

                        <p>We have considered basic processes, unit conversion and formula for calculation. These can help in many of the worked examples above, but there are other areas of drug calculation we should explore in more depth now.</p>
                        <h3>Solid dose calculations</h3>
                        <p>Much of the drug calculations you will perform are solid dose calculations, as tablets and capsules are by far the largest area of prescribed medication.</p>
                        <p>Look at the drug prescriptions for solid dose medication below and we will apply the basic formula to each one to help cement your understanding of these types of calculation. Remember that, when using the basic formula equation for solid dose drugs, Q will always = 1.</p>
                        <p>Your patient needs 150 mg of Drug A. 50 mg tablets are available. How many tablets will you give?<br>
                        D = 150<br>H = 50<br>Q = 1<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$150 / 50 \times 1=3 \text{ tablets}$$</div>
                        <p>Can you see how that works? Let's do some more.</p>
                        <p>Your patient needs 375 mg of Drug B. 75 mg tablets are available. How many tablets will you give?<br>
                        D = 375<br>H = 75<br>Q = 1<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$375 / 75 \times 1=5 \text{ tablets}$$</div>
                        <p>Your patient needs 37.5 mg of Drug C. 12.5 mg tablets are available. How many tablets will you give?<br>
                        D = 37.5<br>H = 12.5<br>Q = 1<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$37.5 / 12.5 \times 1=3 \text{ tablets}$$</div>
                        <p>Your patient needs 400 mg of Drug D. 200 mg tablets are available. How many tablets will you give?<br>
                        D = 400<br>H = 200<br>Q = 1<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$400 / 200 \times 1=2 \text{ tablets}$$</div>
                        <p>Your patient needs 0.5 g of Drug E. 250 mg tablets are available. How many tablets will you give?</p>
                        <p>First we need to make a unit conversion so:<br>
                        0.5 g × 1000 = 500 mg<br>
                        D = 500<br>H = 250<br>Q = 1<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$500 / 250 \times 1=2 \text{ tablets}$$</div>
                        <p>I hope these examples have helped you to see and understand the processes in solid dose calculation.</p>

                        <h3>Liquid dose calculations</h3>
                        <p>Many medications are available in liquid form, whether this be oral or injectable liquids. The principles are the same for each. Look at the drug prescriptions for liquid dose medication below and we will apply the basic formula to each one to help cement your understanding of these types of calculation. Remember that, when using the basic formula equation for liquid dose drugs, Q will vary.</p>
                        <p>Your patient needs 125 mg of Drug A by subcutaneous (SC) injection. 50 mg in 1 ml of liquid for SC injection is available. How many millilitres will you administer?<br>
                        D = 125<br>H = 50<br>Q = 1<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$125 / 50 \times 1=2.5 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>Can you see how that works? Let's do some more.<br>
                        Your patient needs 150 mg of Drug B orally. 125 mg in 5 ml of Syrup is available. How many millilitres will you administer?<br>
                        D = 150<br>H = 125<br>Q = 5<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$150 / 125 \times 5=6 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>Can you see how Q changed from 1 to 5 for this calculation?</p>
                        <p>Your patient needs 25 mg of Drug C intravenously. 10 mg in 1 ml of liquid for intravenous (IV) injection is available. How many millilitres will you administer?<br>
                        D = 25<br>H = 10<br>Q = 1</p>
                        <p>So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$25 / 10 \times 1=2.5 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>Your patient needs 240 mg of Drug D by intramuscular (IM) injection. 150 mg in 5 ml of liquid for IM injection is available. How many millilitres will you administer?<br>
                        D = 240<br>H = 150<br>Q = 5<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$240 / 150 \times 5=8 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>Your patient needs 150 mg of Drug E orally. 250 mg in 10 ml of liquid is available. How many millilitres will you administer?<br>
                        D = 150<br>H = 250<br>Q = 10<br>
                        So our calculation should look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$150 / 250 \times 10=6 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>I hope these examples have helped you to see and understand the processes in liquid dose calculation.</p>

                        <h3>Bolus doses and drug calculations of time</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes we have to give bolus doses, or a one-off dose. We need to calculate this and very often these doses cannot be given in an instant, such as swallowing a tablet, and must be infused over a period of time.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example to illustrate this point:<br>
                        Your patient requires a bolus dose of 2 g of medication. You have 500 mg in 5 ml solution for injection available. The drug can be given at a rate of 1 ml every minute.</p>
                        <p>First we calculate the dose and we start with our unit conversion.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$2 \mathrm{~g} \times 1000=2000 \mathrm{mg}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$2000 / 500 \times 5=20 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>So we know we need to give 20 ml and we can do so at a rate of 1 ml every minute:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$20 \times 1=20 \text{ minutes.}$$</div>
                        <p>That was quite simple so let's look at another example.</p>
                        <p>Your patient requires a bolus dose of 1.2 g of medication. You have 300 mg in 5 ml solution for injection available. The drug can be given at a rate of 1 ml every 30 seconds.</p>
                        <p>First we calculate the dose and we start with our unit conversion:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$1.2 \mathrm{~g} \times 1000=1200 \mathrm{mg}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$1200 / 300 \times 5=20 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>So we know we need to give 20 ml and we can do so at a rate of 1 ml every 30 seconds:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$20 \times 30=600 \text{ seconds}$$</div>
                        <p>To convert this to minutes we need to divide by the number of seconds in a minute, so:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$600 / 60=10 \text{ minutes to give the dose.}$$</div>
                        <p>Shall we do one more?<br>
                        Your patient requires a bolus dose of 3.6 g of medication. You have 600 mg in 2 ml solution for injection available. The drug can be given at a rate of 1 ml every 15 seconds.</p>
                        <p>First we calculate the dose and we start with our unit conversion:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$3.6 \mathrm{~g} \times 1000=3600 \mathrm{mg}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$3600 / 600 \times 2=12 \mathrm{ml}$$</div>
                        <p>So we know we need to give 12 ml and we can do so at a rate of 1 ml every 15 seconds.</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$12 \times 15=180 \text{ seconds}$$</div>
                        <p>To convert this to minutes we need to divide by the number of seconds in a minute so:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$180 / 60=3 \text{ minutes to give the dose.}$$</div>
                        <p>I hope these examples have helped you to see and understand the processes in bolus dose calculations over time.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Drug calculations by weight</h3>
                        <p>Some medications require us to calculate the dose based on a patients weight. These drugs are prescribed on a mg per kg basis and therefore we must obtain the patients weight in kg in an accurate manner. Many of these calculations are for medication for children and it is essential we get doses correct as errors can lead to overdose and complications.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example to illustrate the point:<br>
                        Your patient requires their medicine at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day (milligrams per kilogram per day). They weigh 12 kg.</p>
                        <p>So the calculation will look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$60 \times 12=720 \mathrm{mg} \text{ per day.}$$</div>
                        <p>This may be a one off dose or it may be required to be split. In this case we want to give it in 4 divided doses, so:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$720 / 4=180 \mathrm{mg} \text{ per dose}$$</div>
                        <p>Can you see how that worked? Let's do another.<br>
                        Your patient requires their medicine at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day. They weigh 15 kg. The dose must be given in 3 divided doses.</p>
                        <p>So the calculation will look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$30 \times 15=450 \mathrm{mg} \text{ per day}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$450 / 3=150 \mathrm{mg} \text{ per dose}$$</div>
                        <p>That is the basis of weight calculations. Sometimes these are in children and often that means a liquid dose calculation too, so let's do all of the steps.</p>
                        <p>Your patient requires their medicine at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. They weigh 20 kg. The drug must be given in 4 divided doses and you have a liquid available that is 125 mg in 5 ml.</p>
                        <p>So the calculation will look like this:</p>
                        <div class="equation">$$50 \times 20=1000 \mathrm{mg} \text{ per day}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$1000 / 4=250 \mathrm{mg} \text{ per dose}$$</div>
                        <div class="equation">$$250 / 125 \times 5=10 \mathrm{ml} \text{ per dose}$$</div>
                        <p>I hope that makes weight calculations clear for you.</p>
                        <p>You should now be able to attempt the practice calculation questions at the end of this and other chapters in the book. Have a look at the case studies below where drug calculations are essential in the proper delivery of medication.</p>
