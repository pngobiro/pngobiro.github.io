                        <p>Mary Ann is a new graduate and has just finished her orientation. She works the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift on a busy monitored vascular surgical unit. The client census is 48, making this a full unit. Although there is an associate nurse manager for the shift, Mary Ann is charge nurse for the shift. Her responsibilities include receiving and transcribing orders, contacting physicians with any information or requests, reviewing laboratory reports and giving them to the appropriate staff members, checking any new medication orders and placing them in the appropriate charts, relieving the monitor tech for dinner and breaks, and assigning staff to dinner and breaks.</p>
                        <p>When Mary Ann comes to work, she discovers that one registered nurse (RN) called in sick. She has two RNs and three unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs) for staff and a full census. She panics and wants to refuse to take report. After a discussion with the charge nurse from the previous shift, she realizes that this is not an option. She sits down to evaluate the acuity of the clients and the capabilities of her staff.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Delegation is not a new concept. In the Old Testament, Moses was instructed to identify seventy elders "so they will share with you the burden of this nation and you will no longer have to carry it by yourself" (Numbers 11:16-17). In her Notes on Nursing, Florence Nightingale (1859) clearly states:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Don't imagine that if you, who are in charge, don't look to all these things yourself, those under you will be more careful than you are.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>She continues by directing,</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>But then again to look to all these things yourself does not mean to do them yourself. If you do it, it is by so much the better certainly than if it were not done at all. But can you not insure that it is done when not done by yourself? Can you insure that it is not undone when your back is turned? This is what being in charge means. And a very important meaning it is, too. The former only implies that just what you can do with your own hands is done. The latter that what ought to be done is always done. Head in charge must see to house hygiene, not do it herself. (p. 17)</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>By definition, delegation is the reassigning of responsibility for the performance of a job from one person to another (ANA, 1996). Although the responsibility for the task is transferred, the accountability for the process or outcome of the task remains with the delegator, or the person delegating the activity. Nightingale refers to this delegation responsibility when she infers that the "Head in charge" does not necessarily carry out the task, but still sees that it is completed.</p>
                        <p>Delegation may be direct or indirect. <strong>Direct delegation</strong> is usually "verbal direction by the RN delegator regarding an activity or task in a specific nursing care situation" (ANA, 1996, p. 15). In this case, the RN decides which staff member is capable of performing the specific task or activity at this time. <strong>Indirect delegation</strong> is "an approved listing of activities or tasks that have been established in policies and procedures of the healthcare institution or facility" (ANA, 1996, p. 15).</p>
                        <p>Permitted tasks may vary from institution to institution. For example, a certified nursing assistant performs specific activities designated by the job description approved by the specific healthcare institution. Although the institution delineates tasks and activities in the job description, this does not mean that the RN cannot decide to assign other personnel in specific situations. Take the following example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Mrs. Rankin was admitted to the unit from the neurological intensive care unit. She suffered a Grade II subarachnoid hemorrhage 2 weeks ago and has a left hemiparesis. She also has difficulty with swallowing. She is still receiving tube feedings through a gastrostomy tube; however, she has been advanced to a pureed diet. She needs assistance with personal care, toileting, and feeding. Although a physical therapist comes twice a day to get her up for gait training, the physician wants her in a chair as much as possible.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Assessing this situation, the RN might consider assigning a licensed practical nurse (LPN) to this client. The swallowing problems place the client at risk for aspiration, so feeding may present a problem. There is a potential for injury. The LPN is also capable of managing the tube feeding. While assisting with bathing, the LPN can perform ROM exercises to all the client's extremities and assess her skin for breakdown. The LPN also knows the appropriate way to assist the client in transferring from the bed to the chair. The RN may not assign an individual to perform a task or activity not specified in his or her job description or within the scope of practice, such as allowing a nursing assistant to administer medications or perform certain types of dressing changes.</p>
                        <p>Delegation should not be confused with supervision. <strong>Supervision</strong> is more direct and requires directly overseeing the work or performance of others. Supervision includes checking with individuals throughout the day to see what activities have been completed and what may still need to be finished. For example, you have assigned a nursing assistant to take all the vital signs on the unit and give the morning baths to eight clients. Three hours into the morning, you find that she is far behind. At this point, it is important to discover why. Perhaps one of the clients required more care than expected or the nursing assistant needed to run an errand off the floor. Reevaluation of the assignment may be necessary. When working with another registered nurse, you do not need to supervise. This is a collaborative relationship and includes consultation and giving advice when needed.</p>
                        <p>Individuals who supervise others also delegate tasks and activities. Chief nursing officers often delegate tasks to associate directors. This may include record reviews, unit reports, client acuities, etc. The chief nursing officer still remains accountable for making sure that the activities are completed.</p>
                        <p>Supervision sometimes entails more direct evaluation of performance. For example, a nurse manager both supervises and delegates. Certain administrative tasks, such as staff scheduling, may be delegated to another staff member, an associate manager, for example. However, performance evaluations and discussions regarding individual interactions with clients and other staff members fall under supervisory duties.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of where you work, you cannot assume that only those in the higher levels of the organization delegate work to other people. You, too, will be responsible at times to delegate some of your work to other nurses, to technical personnel, or to another department. Decisions associated with this responsibility often cause some difficulty for new nurses. Knowing each person's capabilities and job description can help you decide which personnel can assist with a task.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As nurses, we understand the nursing process. The same concept can be applied to delegation (Hansten & Washburn, 1998). Before deciding who should care for a particular client, the nurse must assess each client's particular needs, set client-specific goals, and match the skills of the person assigned responsibilities with the tasks that need to be accomplished (<strong>assessment</strong>). After accomplishing this task, the nurse needs to mentally identify which staff member is best suited for the task or activities. Thinking this through before delegating helps prevent problems later (<strong>plan</strong>). Next, the nurse determines which personnel have the knowledge and skill to care for the client and assigns the tasks to the appropriate person (<strong>implementation</strong>). Once this is done, however, the nurse must still oversee care and determine whether client care needs have been met (<strong>evaluation</strong>). It is also important for the nurse to allow time for feedback during the day. This enables all personnel to see where they are and where they want to go.</p>
                        <p>Often, the nurse must first coordinate care for groups of clients before being able to delegate tasks to other personnel. By looking at the needs of each client, the nurse makes an educated decision about which staff members have the appropriate education and skill to deliver safe, quality care. The nurse also needs to consider his or her responsibilities. This includes assisting other staff members with setting priorities, clarifying instructions, and reassessing the situation.</p>
                        <p>The National Council of the State Boards of Nursing (1995) published a paper addressing the issue of delegation. They developed a concept called the "Five Rights of Delegation," similar to the five rights regarding medication administration. These five "rights" are listed in Box 4-1. Before being able to delegate tasks and activities to other individuals, however, the nurse must understand the needs of each client.</p>

                        <h3>Coordinating Assignments</h3>
                        <p>One of the most difficult tasks for new nurses to master is coordinating daily activities. Often, you not only have a group of clients for whom you are expected to provide direct care but you also must supervise the work of others, such as non-nurse caregivers and licensed practical or vocational nurses. Although care plans, critical (or clinical) pathways, and computer information sheets are available to help identify client needs, these items do not provide a mechanism for coordinating the actual delivery of care. To do this, you can develop personalized worksheets that prioritize tasks for each client. Using the worksheets helps the nurse identify tasks that require the knowledge and skill of a registered nurse and those that can be carried out by assistive personnel.</p>
                        <p>On the worksheet, tasks are prioritized on the basis of client need, and not nursing convenience. For example, an order states that a client is to receive continuous tube feedings. Although it may be convenient for the nurse to fill the feeding bag with enough supplement to last 6 hours, it is not good practice and not safe for the client. Instead, the nurse should plan to check the tube feeding every 2 hours.</p>
                        <p>Remember Mary Ann in the beginning of the chapter? Here is where a worksheet helps to determine who can do what. First, Mary Ann needs to decide what particular tasks she must do. These include receiving and transcribing orders, contacting physicians with information or requests, reviewing lab reports and giving them to the appropriate staff members, and checking any new medication orders and placing them in the appropriate charts. Another RN may be able to relieve the monitor technician for dinner and breaks and a second RN assign staff to dinner and breaks. Next, Mary Ann needs to look at the needs of each client on the unit and prioritize them. Mary Ann is now ready to effectively delegate to her staff.</p>
                        <p>Some activities must be done at a certain time, and their timing may be out of your control. Examples include medication administration and clients who need special preparation for a scheduled procedure. The following are some tips for organizing your work on personalized worksheets to help you establish client priorities (Tappen, Weiss, & Whitehead, 1998).</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Plan your time around these activities.</li>
                            <li>High-priority activities must be done first.</li>
                            <li>Some activities are best done in a cluster.</li>
                            <li>You are still responsible for activities delegated to others.</li>
                            <li>Consider your peak energy time when scheduling optional activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This list acts as a guideline for coordinating client care. The nurse needs to use critical thinking skills in the decision-making process. For example, activities that are usually clustered include bathing, changing linen, and parts of the physical assessment. Some clients may not be able to tolerate too much activity at one time. Take special situations into consideration when coordinating client care and deciding who should carry out some of the activities. Remember, though, even when you delegate, you remain accountable.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The 1990s brought rapid change to the healthcare environment. Several forces coming together at one time contributed to these changes, including the nursing shortage, healthcare reform, an increased need for nursing services, and demographic trends. These changes continue to have an impact on the delivery of nursing care, requiring institutions to hire other personnel to assist nurses with client care.</p>
                        <p>Healthcare institutions often use UAPs to perform certain client care tasks (Habel, 2000; Huber et al., 1994). A survey conducted by the American Hospital Association revealed that 97% of hospitals currently employ some form of UAP (Parkman, 1996). Because so many institutions employ these personnel, many nurses feel that they know how to work with them and safely delegate tasks to them. This is not the case, and therefore many nursing organizations have developed definitions for unlicensed personnel and criteria regarding their responsibilities. The ANA defines UAPs as follows:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Unlicensed assistive personnel are individuals who are trained to function in an assistive role to the registered nurse in the provision of patient/client care activities as delegated by and under the supervision of the registered professional nurse. Although some of these people may be certified (e.g., certified nursing assistant [CNA]), it is important to remember that certification differs from licensure. When a task is delegated to an unlicensed person, the professional nurse remains personally responsible for the outcomes of these activities. (ANA, 1994)</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Use of the RN to provide all the care a client needs may not be the most efficient or cost effective use of professional time. As the use of LPNs or client care extenders increases, the nurse's focus will be on diagnosing client care needs and carrying out complex interventions (Conger, 1994). The ANA cautions against delegating nursing activities that include the foundation of the nursing process and require specialized knowledge, judgment, or skill (ANA, 1996). Non-nursing functions (Hayes, 1994), such as clerical/receptionist duties, trips or errands off the unit, cleaning floors, making beds, collecting trays, and ordering supplies, however, should not be carried out by the highest paid and most educated member of the team. These tasks are easily delegated to other personnel.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 1990, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) adopted a definition of delegation, stating that delegation is "transferring to a competent individual the authority to perform a selected nursing task in a selected situation" (p. 1). In its publication Issues (1995), the council again presented this definition. Accordingly, the American Nurses Association (ANA) Code for Nurses states, "The nurse exercises informed judgment and uses individual competence and qualifications as criteria in seeking consultation, accepting responsibilities, and delegating nursing activities to others" (1985). To delegate tasks safely, nurses must delegate appropriately and supervise adequately (Barter & Furmidge, 1994).</p>
                        <p>In 1997, the NCSBN developed a Delegation Decision-Making Grid. This grid acts as a tool to help nurses delegate appropriately. It provides a scoring instrument for seven categories that the nurse should consider when making delegation decisions. The categories for the grid are listed in Box 4-2.</p>

                        <p>The scoring of the components helps the nurse evaluate the situations, the client needs, and the healthcare personnel available to meet the needs. A low score on the grid indicates that the activity may be safely delegated to personnel other than the RN, and a high score indicates that delegation may not be advisable.

As stated earlier, the National Council for the State Boards of Nursing provides criteria to assist nurses with delegation.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The purpose of delegation is not to assign tasks to others that you do not want to do yourself. When you delegate to others effectively, you should have more time to perform the tasks that only a professional nurse is permitted to do.</p>
                        <p>When you delegate, you must consider both the ability of the person to whom you are delegating and the fairness of the task to the individual and the team (Tappen, Weiss, & Whitehead, 1998). In other words, you need to consider both the task aspects of delegation (Is this a complex task? Is it a professional responsibility? Can this person do it safely?) and the interpersonal aspects (Does the person have time to do this? Is the work evenly distributed?).</p>
                        
                        <h3>TASK-RELATED CONCERNS</h3>
                        <p>The primary task-related concern in delegating work is whether the person assigned to do the task has the ability to complete it. Team priorities and efficiency are also important considerations.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Ability</h4>
                        <p>To make appropriate assignments, the nurse needs to know the knowledge and skill level, legal definitions, role expectations, and job description for each member of the team. It is equally important to be aware of the different skill levels of caregivers within each discipline, because ability differs with each level of education. Additionally, different individuals within each level of skill possess their own particular strengths and weaknesses. Prior assessment of the strengths of each member of the team will assist in providing safe and efficient care to clients. Figure 4-2 outlines the skills of various healthcare personnel.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_25_8d0a0d2b8b6b5731b36fg-66-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart for delegation decision making. It starts with a task needing to be done and asks a series of questions: Is it a nursing task? Is it within the scope of practice of the RN, LPN, or UAP? Is the person competent and confident? If all answers are yes, the task is delegated. If no, the RN performs the task." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 4-2 • Delegation decision making.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>People should not be assigned a task they are not skilled in or knowledgeable to perform, regardless of their professional level. People often are reluctant to admit that they cannot do something. Instead of seeking help or saying they do not feel comfortable with the task, they may avoid doing it, delay starting it, do only part of it, or even bluff their way through it, a risky choice in health care.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the length of time individuals have been in a position, employees need orientation when assigned a new task. Those who seek assistance and advice are showing concern for the team and the welfare of their clients. Requests for assistance or additional explanations should not be ignored, and the person should be praised, not criticized, for seeking guidance (Tappen, Weiss, & Whitehead, 1998).</p>

                        <h4>Priorities</h4>
                        <p>You have probably noticed that the work of a busy unit rarely ends up going as expected. Dealing with sick people, their families, physicians, and other team members all at the same time is a difficult task. Setting priorities for the day should be based on client needs, team needs, and organizational and community demands. The values of each may be very different, even opposed. These differences should be discussed with team members so that decisions can be made based on team priorities.</p>
                        <p>One way to determine patient priorities is to base your decisions on Maslow's hierarchy of needs (see Fig. 9-2). Maslow's hierarchy is frequently used in nursing to provide a framework for prioritizing care to meet client needs. The basic physiologic needs come first because they are necessary for survival. Oxygen and medication administration, IV fluids, and enteral feedings are included in this group.</p>
                        <p>Identifying priorities and deciding the needs to be met first help in organizing care and in deciding which other team members can meet client needs. For example, nursing assistants can meet many hygiene needs, allowing licensed personnel to administer medications and enteral feedings in a timely manner.</p>

                        <h4>Efficiency</h4>
                        <p>Efficiency means that all members of the team know their jobs and responsibilities and work together like gears in a well-built clock. They mesh together and keep perfect time.</p>
                        <p>The current healthcare delivery environment demands efficient, cost-effective care. Delegating appropriately can increase efficiency and save money. However, incorrect delegation can decrease efficiency and cost money in the end. When delegating tasks to individuals who cannot perform the job, the RN must often go back to perform the task. There may be legal implications if a client is injured as a result of inappropriate delegation. To date, courts have not declared nurses responsible for the negligent acts of a subordinate, provided that the nurse delegated responsibly and appropriately (Habel, 2000).</p>
                        <p>Although institutions often need to "float" staff to other units, maintaining continuity, if at all possible, is important. Keeping the same staff members on the unit all the time, for example, allows them to develop familiarity with the physical setting and routines of the unit as well as the types of clients the unit services. Time is lost when staff members are reassigned frequently to different units. Although physical layouts may be the same, client needs, unit routines, and use of space are often different, as is the availability of supplies. Time spent to orient reassigned staff members takes time away from delivery of client care. However, when staff members are reassigned, it is important for them to indicate their skill level and comfort in the new setting. It is just as important for the staff who are familiar with the setting to identify the strengths of the reassigned person and build on them.</p>

                        <h4>Appropriateness</h4>
                        <p>Appropriateness is another task-related concern. Nothing can be more counterproductive than floating, say, a coronary care nurse to labor and delivery. More time will be spent teaching the necessary skills than on safe mother-baby care. Assigning an educated, licensed staff member to perform non-nursing functions to protect safety is also poor use of personnel.</p>
                        
                        <h3>RELATIONSHIP-ORIENTED CONCERNS</h3>
                        <p>Relationship-oriented concerns include fairness, opportunities for learning, health concerns, compatibility, and staff preferences. Each of these is discussed next.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fairness</h4>
                        <p>Fairness is evenly distributing the workload in terms of both the physical requirements and the emotional investment in providing health care. The nurse who is caring for a dying client may have less physical work to do than another team member, but in terms of emotional care to the client and family, he or she may be doing double the work of another staff member. Fairness also means considering equally all requests for special consideration. The quickest way to alienate members of your team is to be unfair. It is important to discuss with team members any decisions you have made that may appear unfair to others. Allow the team to participate in making decisions regarding assignments. Their participation will decrease resentment and increase cooperation. In some healthcare institutions, team members make such decisions as a group.</p>

                        <h4>Learning Opportunities</h4>
                        <p>Including assignments that stimulate motivation and learning and assisting team members to learn new tasks and take on new challenges is part of the role of the RN.</p>

                        <h4>Health</h4>
                        <p>Some aspects of caregiving jobs are more stressful than others. Rotating team members through the more difficult jobs may decrease stress and allow empathy to increase among the members. Special health needs, such as family emergencies or special physical problems of team members, also need to be addressed. If some team members have difficulty accepting the needs of others, the situation should be discussed with the team, bearing in mind the employee's right to privacy when discussing sensitive issues.</p>

                        <h4>Compatibility</h4>
                        <p>No matter how hard you may strive to get your team to work together, it just may not happen. Some people work together better than others. Helping people develop better working relationships is part of team building. Creating opportunities for people to share and learn from each other increases the overall effectiveness of the team.</p>
                        <p>As the leader, you may be forced to intervene in team member disputes. Many individuals find it difficult to work with others they do not like personally. It sometimes becomes necessary to explain that liking another person is a plus but not a necessity in the work setting and that personal problems have no place in the work environment. Take the example of Laura:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Laura had been a labor and delivery room supervisor in a large metropolitan hospital for 5 years before she moved to another city. Because a position similar to the one she left was not available, she became a staff nurse at a small local hospital. The hospital had just opened its new birthing center. The first day on the job went well. The other staff members seemed cordial enough.</p>
                            <p>As the weeks went by, however, Laura began to have problems getting other staff to help her. No one would offer to relieve her for meals or a break. She noticed that certain groups of staff members always went to lunch together, but she was never invited to join them. She attempted to speak to some of the more approachable coworkers, but she did not get much information. Disturbed by the situation, Laura went to the nurse manager.</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager listened quietly while Laura related her experiences. She then asked Laura to reflect back on some of the events of the past weeks, particularly the last staff meeting. Laura realized that she had alienated the staff during that encounter because she had monopolized the meeting and kept saying that in "her hospital" things were done in a particular way. Laura also realized that, instead of asking for help, she was in the habit of demanding it. Laura and the nurse manager discussed the difficulties of her changing positions, moving to a new place, and trying to develop both professional and social ties. Together, they came up with several solutions to Laura's problem.</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h4>Preferences</h4>
                        <p>Considering the preferences of individual team members is important but should not supersede the other criteria for delegating responsibly. Allowing team members to always select what they want to do may cause the less assertive members' needs to be unmet.</p>
                        <p>It is important to explain the rationale for decisions made regarding delegation so that all team members may understand the needs of the unit or organization.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many nurses, and particularly new ones, have difficulty delegating. The reasons for this include experience issues, licensure issues, quality-of-care issues, and assigning work to others.</p>
                        <h3>Experience Issues</h3>
                        <p>Many nurses received their education during the 1980s, when primary care was the major delivery system. These nurses lacked the education and skill needed for delegation (Mahlmeister, 1999). Nurses educated before the 1970s worked in settings with LPNs and nursing assistants, where they routinely delegated tasks. However, client acuity was lower and the care less complex. Older nurses have considerable delegation experience and may be used as a resource for younger nurses.</p>
                        <p>The added responsibility of delegation creates some discomfort for nurses. Many believe that they are unprepared to assume this responsibility, especially when it comes to deciding the competency of another person. To decrease this discomfort, nurses need to participate in establishing the guidelines for UAPs within the institution.</p>
                        <h3>Licensure Issues</h3>
                        <p>Today's healthcare environment requires nurses to delegate. Many nurses voice concerns about the personal risk regarding their licensure if they delegate inappropriately. The courts have usually ruled that nurses are not liable for the negligence of other individuals, provided that the nurse delegated appropriately. Delegation is within the scope of nursing practice (Parkman, 1996). The art and skill of delegation are acquired with practice.</p>
                        <h3>Quality-of-Care Issues</h3>
                        <p>Nurses have expressed concern over the quality of client care when tasks and activities are delegated to others. Remember Nightingale's words earlier in the chapter, "Don't imagine that if you, who are in charge, don't look to all these things yourself, those under you will be more careful than you are." She added that you do not need to do everything yourself to see that it is done correctly. When you delegate, you control the delegation. You decide to whom you will delegate the task. Remember that there are levels of acceptable performance and not every task needs to be done perfectly.</p>
                        <h3>Assigning Work to Others</h3>
                        <p>This is difficult for several reasons:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Some nurses think they must do everything themselves.</li>
                            <li>Some nurses distrust subordinates to do things correctly.</li>
                            <li>Some nurses think that if they delegate all the technical tasks, they will not reinforce their learning.</li>
                            <li>Some nurses are more comfortable with the technical aspects of client care than with the more complex issues of client teaching and discharge planning.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Families and clients do not always see professional activities. They see direct client care. Nurses believe that when they do not participate directly in client care, they do not accomplish anything for the client. The professional aspects of nursing, such as planning care, teaching, and discharge planning, help to promote positive outcomes for clients and their families. Knowing the scope of practice of LPNs or vocational nurses helps in making delegation decisions.</p>

                        <p>The concept of delegation is not new. The delegation role is essential to the RN/LPN and RN/UAP relationship. Personal organizational skills are a prerequisite for delegation. Before the nurse can delegate tasks to others, he or she needs to understand individual client needs. Using worksheets and Maslow's hierarchy helps the nurse understand these individual client needs, set priorities, and identify which tasks can be delegated to others. Using the Delegation Decision-Making Grid assists the nurse in delegating safely and appropriately.</p>
                        <p>As the nurse, it is also important for you to be aware of the capabilities of each staff member, the tasks that may be delegated, and the tasks that the RN needs to perform. When delegating, the RN uses professional judgment in making decisions. Professional judgment is directed by the state nurse practice act and national standards of nursing. Institutions develop their own job descriptions for UAPs and other healthcare professionals, but institutional policies cannot contradict the state nurse practice act. Although the nurse delegates the task or activity, he or she remains accountable for the delegation decision.</p>
                        <p>Understanding the concept of delegation helps the new nurse organize and prioritize client care. Knowing the staff and their capabilities simplifies delegation. Utilizing staff members' capabilities creates a pleasant and productive working environment for everyone involved.</p>

                        <p>Steven works at a large teaching hospital in a major metropolitan area. This institution services the entire geographical region, including indigent clients, and because of its renowned reputation also administers care to international clients and individuals who reside in other states. Like all healthcare institutions, this one has been attempting to cut costs by using more UAPs. Nurses are often floated to other units. Lately, the numbers of indigent and foreign clients on Steven's unit have increased. The acuity of these clients has been quite high, requiring a great deal of time from the nursing staff.</p>
                        <p>Steven arrived at work at 6:30 a.m., his usual time. He looked at the census board and discovered that the unit was filled, and bed control was calling all night to have clients discharged or transferred to make room for several clients who had been in the emergency department since the previous evening. He also discovered that the other RN assigned to his team called in sick. His team consists of himself, two UAPs, and an LPN who is shared by two teams. He has eight clients on his team: two need to be readied for surgery including preoperative and postoperative teaching, one of whom is a 35-year-old woman scheduled for a modified radical mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer; three are second day post-ops, and two of these require extensive dressing changes, are receiving IV antibiotics, and need to be ambulated; one post-op client is required to remain on total bed rest, has a nasogastric tube to suction as well as a chest tube, is on TPN and lipids, needs a CVC line dressing change, has an IV, is taking multiple IV medications, and has a Foley catheter; one client is ready for discharge and needs discharge instructions; and one client needs to be transferred to a subacute unit and report must be given to the RN of that unit. Once the latter client is transferred and the other one is discharged, the emergency department will be sending two clients to the unit for admission.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>How should Steven organize his day? Set up an hourly schedule.</li>
