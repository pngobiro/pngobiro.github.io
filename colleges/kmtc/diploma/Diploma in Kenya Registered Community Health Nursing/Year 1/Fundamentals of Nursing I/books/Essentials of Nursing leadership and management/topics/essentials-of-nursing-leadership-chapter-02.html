                        <p>Inez has been working on a busy oncology floor for several years. Although she usually has a caseload of 8 to 12 clients on her shift, she believes that she provides safe, competent care to her clients.</p>
                        <p>While Inez was on her way to medicate a client suffering from cancer of the bone, a colleague called to her, "Inez, come with me, please." Inez responded, "I need to medicate Mr. J. in Room 203. I will come right after that. Where will you be?" "Never mind!" her colleague answered. "I'll find someone who's more helpful. Don't ask me for help in the future."</p>
                        <p>This was not the response Inez had expected. She thought she had expressed both an interest in her client and a willingness to help her colleague. What was the problem?</p>
                        <p>After Inez gave Mr. J. his pain medication, she went back to her colleague. "Sonja, what's the matter?" she asked. Sonja replied, "Mrs. V. fell in the bathroom. I needed someone to stay with her while I got her walker." "Why didn't you tell me it was urgent?" asked Inez. "I was so upset about Mrs. V. that I wasn't thinking about what else you were doing," answered Sonja. Inez said, "And I didn't ask you why you needed me. I guess we need to work on our communication, don't we?"</p>
                        <p>In the busy and sometimes chaotic world of nursing practice, nurses work continuously with all sorts of people. This variety makes the job dynamic and challenging. Just when it appears that things have settled down, something else happens that requires immediate attention. All of these busy people need to communicate effectively with each other. They also must responsibly delegate tasks to others or the workload will be insurmountable. This chapter will help new nurses communicate more effectively with their colleagues, work with people of all kinds, and share the workload equitably, even in situations that are filled with multiple demands and constant change.</p>

                        <p>The process of communication between two people historically has been viewed as consisting of five elements (Berlo, 1960). The first element is the encoder, or sender. The second element is the message, or the information that needs to be conveyed. The third element is the sensory channel, or the method of sending the communication. The fourth element, or the decoder, receives the message. The last element is the feedback, or return. The feedback to the sender indicates the degree of understanding of the message. A more contemporary model of communication views the process as a circular one that is affected by many factors. Communication in this model has both a content and a relationship context. This means the activity is continuous, mutually interdependent, and influenced by the behaviors of each communicator. Cultural influences, communication abilities, values, needs, goals, and previous experiences all affect the content of the communication (Arnold & Boggs, 1995; Fontaine & Fletcher, 1995) (Fig. 2-1).</p>

It shows a sender on the left and a receiver on the right, with arrows indicating the message flowing from sender to receiver and feedback flowing from receiver to sender. Both sender and receiver are influenced by internal factors like perception, values, and emotions, and external factors like culture and environment, all of which affect the message's interpretation." class="content-image">

                        <p>People often assume that communication is simply giving information to another person. Communication involves the spoken word and also the nonverbal message, the emotional state of people involved, and the cultural background that affects their interpretation of the message (Fontaine & Fletcher, 1995).</p>
                        <p>The two basic channels of communication are verbal and nonverbal:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Verbal.</strong> Verbal communication uses words to communicate messages. Communication is achieved by writing or speaking in a code or language that is mutually understood. Talking is the verbal or spoken mode. Written communication translates a thought or spoken word into printed form.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nonverbal.</strong> Nonverbal communication is a set of behaviors that conveys messages without words. It often supplements verbal communication. Most nonverbal communication is done unconsciously and is more difficult to control than verbal communication. Discrepancies often exist between verbal and nonverbal communication. What is stated is not necessarily felt or believed. It is important for nurses to observe nonverbal behavior when communicating with colleagues and clients and to try to make their own nonverbal behavior congruent with their verbal communications. Telling people you understand their problem when you appear thoroughly confused or inattentive is an example of incongruence between verbal and nonverbal communication. The way people move their bodies or parts of their bodies while communicating is called body language. People use body language as a way of presenting themselves to the world (Vacarolis, 1994).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Paralanguage is the nonverbal component of spoken language. Paralanguage includes speech rhythm, pitch, stress, intonation, rate, and volume (Fontaine & Fletcher, 1995), all of which affect the interpretation of the message being communicated.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Listening is the most critical of all communication skills. You indicate to another person that you are listening through attending behaviors, such as eye contact, attentive body language, vocal qualities, and verbal tracking.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eye contact</strong> requires the listener to look at the speaker. This indicates interest in the information being conveyed. Although expected in American culture, direct eye contact is considered disrespectful in some other cultures. Members of some cultures look away when they are being spoken to and make direct eye contact only when they are speaking. During interactions with colleagues or clients who are culturally different, these behaviors need to be understood and not misinterpreted as disinterest or rudeness on the part of the other person.</p>
                        <p><strong>Attentive body language</strong> conveys interest and openness. Leaning forward, having open arms, and maintaining an interested facial expression indicate that the listener is actively involved in the interaction and open to the other person's ideas. Sitting back, folding the arms across the chest, and looking away indicate disinterest in what is occurring or unwillingness to accept what the other person is saying.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vocal qualities</strong> include pitch, volume, and rapidity of speech. When people are hurried, annoyed, angry, anxious, or distracted by other thoughts or activities, their vocal qualities change. Their speech may become rapid and choppy or slow and halting. The pitch, or highness, of the voice may change; this occurs when a person is surprised or anxious. Volume changes when individuals are annoyed or angry. A listener needs to be aware of changing pitch and volume when responding during a communication.</p>
                        <p><strong>Verbal tracking</strong> is paying attention to what is being said. To verbal-track accurately, one must actively listen to what is being said. Often summarizing and paraphrasing parts of the conversation indicate to the speaker that what is being said has been heard (Box 2-1).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>To communicate effectively with others, consider the following seven principles (Table 2-1):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Information-giving alone is not communication.</strong> As stated earlier, communication requires the sharing of information. Sharing the information means that the person receiving it understands the content of the message or the feelings communicated in the message, or both.</li>
                            <li><strong>The sender is responsible for clarity.</strong> Making messages clear to the others involved in the communication decreases frustration and confusion. It is up to the sender to be sure that the message is understood. Asking for feedback from the receiver helps to clarify any confusion. Help the sender to communicate more effectively by bringing focus to the interaction. Repeating key words or phrases as questions or using open-ended questions can accomplish this. For example: "You have been telling me that Susan is not providing safe care to her patients. Can you tell me specifically what you have identified as unsafe care?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Use simple but precise language.</strong> Both written and spoken messages should be stated clearly and concisely in language that is easily understood by all involved.</li>
                            <li><strong>Feedback should be encouraged.</strong> This is the best way to help people understand each other and work together better. Remember that feedback may not be complimentary and that the ideas of the receiver and sender may be in conflict. It is important to always evaluate feedback and deal with it in a constructive manner.</li>
                            <li><strong>The sender must have credibility.</strong> The personal and the professional credibility of the sender are both important. If the receiver does not perceive the sender as credible, it is not likely that the message will be given importance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acknowledging the contributions of others is essential.</strong> It may sometimes be difficult to do this, but everyone wants to feel that he or she has worth.</li>
                            <li><strong>Direct channels of communication are best.</strong> The greater the number of individuals involved in filtering a message, the less likely the message is to be received correctly. Just as in the game "Whispering down the Lane," messages sent through a variety of senders become distorted. Most of the time, face-to-face communication is preferable to telephone or written communication, because people can see nonverbal behaviors and ask for immediate clarification. Information that is controversial or may elicit negative responses should definitely be delivered so that the receiver can ask questions or receive further clarification. A memo delivered "To all nursing staff" in which cutbacks in staffing are discussed will deliver a different message from a meeting in which all staff members are allowed to talk about their feelings and ask questions.</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Assertive behaviors allow people to stand up for themselves and their rights without violating the rights of others. Assertiveness is different from aggressiveness (Tappen, Weiss, & Whitehead, 1998). People use aggressive behaviors to force their wishes or ideas on others. In assertive communication, an individual's position is stated clearly and firmly using "I" statements. For example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>The nurse manager noticed that Steve's charting has been of lower quality than expected during the past few weeks. She rescheduled her lunch break to have some time to speak with him. After her break, the nurse manager said to Steve, "JCAHO surveyors are coming in several months. I have been reviewing records and noticed that on several of your charts some pertinent information is missing. I have scheduled time today and tomorrow from 1 to 2 in the afternoon for us to review the charts. This allows you time to make the necessary corrections and return the charts to me."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>By using "I" statements, the nurse manager is confronting the issue without being accusatory. Assertive communication always requires congruence between verbal and nonverbal messages. If she shook her finger close to Steve's face or used a loud voice, the nurse manager might think she was being assertive when in reality her manner was aggressive.</p>
                        <p>Many misconceptions exist regarding assertive communication. The first is that all communication is either aggressive or passive. Actually, communication may be passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, or assertive. Passive communication happens when someone does not voice opinions about an issue. Aggressive individuals express their opinions in a direct and often hostile manner that infringes on others' rights. These people think that they must be the "winner" in all communications. Passive-aggressive communication is aggressive communication presented in a passive way. During passive-aggressive communication, little verbal communication takes place and the verbal and nonverbal behaviors are not congruent.</p>
                        <p>The second misconception is that people who communicate assertively always get what they want. Being assertive involves both rights and responsibilities. Assertive communicators have the right to speak up, but they also must be prepared to listen to the response.</p>
                        <p>The third misconception about assertiveness is that it is unfeminine. This misconception substantiates the idea that all nurses are women. Women are often taught to withdraw rather than be assertive. Learning to be assertive is part of effective nursing action. Nurses who continue patterns of either nonassertive or overaggressive behaviors may have a negative impact on themselves and the nursing profession (Arnold & Boggs, 1995). During the 1990s, more men entered the nursing profession than in previous years. Currently, however, the profession remains predominantly female.</p>
                        <p>The fourth misconception is that assertiveness and aggressiveness are synonymous, but to be assertive is not the same as being aggressive. Assertiveness does not force agreement between participants but permits them to disagree while promoting clarification of each position. Developing assertive behavior may decrease stress as individuals respond appropriately and at the appropriate time.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>People often are unwilling or unable to accept responsibility or to perform a specific task because they do not fully understand what is expected of them. Professional nurses are required to communicate client information to other members of the nursing team. Although this may sound easy, there are potential barriers to communication. These barriers may be physical, psychological, or semantic.</p>
                        <h3>Physical Barriers</h3>
                        <p>Physical barriers to communication include extraneous noise, too much activity in the area where the communication is taking place, or physical separation of the people trying to engage in verbal interaction.</p>
                        <h3>Psychological Barriers</h3>
                        <p>Social values, emotions, judgments, and cultural influences can impede communication. Previous life experiences and preconceived ideas about other cultures may influence how we communicate.</p>
                        <h3>Semantic Barriers</h3>
                        <p>Semantic refers to the meaning of words. Sometimes, no matter how great the effort, the message just does not get across. For example, words such as neat, cool, or bad may convey meanings other than those intended. Many individuals have learned English as a second language and therefore understand only literal translations of certain words. For example, to many people, cool means interesting, unique, clever, or even sharp (e.g., "This is a cool way to find the vein"). To someone for whom the word cool refers only to temperature (e.g., "It is cool outside"), the preceding statement would make very little sense.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Members of the nursing team include administrators, directors of nursing, supervisors, clinical specialists, nurse managers, ancillary personnel, and nursing students. Each of these individuals is involved with client care in different ways.</p>
                        <p>Promoting trust and sincerity enhances communication among team members. Congruency between your words and your deeds promotes trust. If team members feel that you are trustworthy and sincere, they will be more likely to ask questions and seek clarification if they are uncertain of something. Box 2-2 gives guidelines for facilitating communication among team members.</p>
                        <p>To manage client care effectively, it is important to keep the lines of communication open on all levels. Using active listening skills and assertive behavior supports clear communication.</p>
                        <h3>Telephone Etiquette</h3>
                        <p>Nurses spend a significant amount of time gathering and relating information by telephone. Using telephone etiquette takes into account the needs of both senders and receivers. The courtesy and clarification that you would use in a face-to-face contact are just as important in a telephone contact.</p>
                        <h3>Information Systems</h3>
                        <p>Communication through the use of computer technology is rapidly growing in nursing practice. A study conducted by KPMG-Peat Marwick of healthcare systems that were using bedside terminals found that medication errors and use of client call bells decreased and nurse productivity increased. Additional benefits of computerized systems for healthcare applications are listed in Box 2-3 (Arnold & Pearson, 1992).</p>

                        <h3>Developing the Change-of-Shift Report</h3>
                        <p>It is important to understand exactly how your day at work will begin. Regardless of which shift an individual works, some things never change. Nurses have traditionally given one another "the report." The change-of-shift report has become the accepted method of communicating client care needs from one nurse to another. During report, pertinent information related to events that occurred is given to the individuals responsible for providing continuity of care (Box 2-4). Although historically the report has been given face-to-face, there are also newer ways to share information. Many healthcare institutions use audiotaping and computer printouts as mechanisms for information-sharing. These mechanisms allow the nurses from the previous shift to complete their tasks and those coming on duty to make inquiries for clarification as necessary.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">BOX 2-4: INFORMATION FOR CHANGE-OF-SHIFT REPORT</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Identify the client, including the room number and bed.</li>
                                <li>Include the client diagnosis.</li>
                                <li>Account for the presence of the client on the unit. If the client has left the unit for a diagnostic test, surgery, or just to wander, it is important for the oncoming staff members to know the client is off the unit.</li>
                                <li>Provide the treatment plan that specifies the goals of treatment. The goals and the critical pathway steps either achieved or in progress should be discussed. Personalized approaches can be developed during this time and client readiness for those approaches evaluated. It is helpful to mention the client's primary care physician. Include new orders and medications and treatments currently prescribed.</li>
                                <li>Document client responses to current treatments. Is the treatment plan working? Evidence for or against this should be presented. Pertinent lab values should be included as well as any untoward reactions to medications or treatments. Any comments the client has made regarding the hospitalization or treatment plan that the oncoming staff members need to address should be discussed.</li>
                                <li>Omit personal opinions and value judgments about clients as well as personal/confidential information not pertinent to providing client care. If using computerized information systems, make sure that you are knowledgeable in how to present the material accurately and in a concise manner.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The report should be organized, concise, and complete with relevant details. Not every unit uses the same system for giving a change-of-shift report. The system is easily modified according to the pattern of nursing care delivery and the types of clients serviced. For example, many intensive care units, because of their small size and the more acute needs of their clients, use walking rounds as a mechanism for giving the report. This system allows nurses to discuss the current client status and to set goals for care for the next several hours. Together, the nurses gather objective data as one ends a shift and the other begins. In this way, there is no confusion as to what the client's status was at shift change. This same system is often used in emergency departments and labor and delivery units. Larger client care units may find the walking report timeconsuming and an inefficient use of resources.</p>
                        <p>It is helpful to take notes or create a worksheet while listening to the report. A worksheet helps organize the work for the day (Fig. 2-2). As specific tasks are mentioned, the nurse coming on duty makes a note of the activity in the appropriate time slot. Medications and treatments can also be added. Any changes from the previous day should be noted, particularly when the nurse is familiar with the client. Recording changes counteracts the tendency to remember what was done the day before and repeat it, often without checking for new orders. During the day, the worksheet acts as a reminder of the tasks that have been completed and those that still need to be done.</p>

                        <h3>Presenting the Information</h3>
                        <p>Reporting skills improve with practice. When presenting information in a report, certain things must be included. The report should begin with the identification of the client and the admitting as well as current diagnoses. Include the expected treatment plan and the client's responses to the treatment. For example, if the client has had multiple antibiotics and a reaction occurred, this information is important to relay to the next nurse. Value judgments and personal opinions about the client are not pertinent to the report (Fig. 2-3). All individuals involved in client care share information through verbal and written communication in an interdisciplinary team conference. The team conference begins by stating the client's name, age, and diagnoses. Each member of the interdisciplinary team then explains the goal of his her discipline, the interventions, and the outcome. Effectiveness of treatment, development of new interventions, and setting new goals are then discussed. The key to a successful interdisciplinary conference is presenting the information in a clear and concise manner.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In many settings, nurses are the client care managers. Integration, coordination, and communication among all disciplines delivering care to a specific client ultimately are the responsibility of the nurse care manager. Nurses spend time with the client on a day-to-day basis and therefore are in a particularly advantageous position to observe the client's responses to treatments. For example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Mr. Richards is a 75-year-old man who was in a motor vehicle accident. He had right-sided weakness and dysphagia. The speech therapy, physical therapy, and social services departments were called in to see Mr. Richards. A speech therapist was working with Mr. Richards to assist him with swallowing. He was to receive pureed foods for the second day. The RN assigned an LPN to feed Mr. Richards. The LPN reported that although Mr. Richards had done well the previous day, he had difficulty swallowing today. The nurse immediately notified the speech therapist, and a new treatment plan was developed.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The role of professional nurses in relation to their clients' physicians is to communicate changes in the client's condition, share other pertinent information, discuss modifications of the treatment plan if necessary, and clarify physician orders. This can be stressful for a new graduate who still has some role insecurity. Using good communication skills and having the necessary information at hand are helpful when discussing client needs.</p>
                        <p>Before calling a physician, make sure that all the information you need is available. The physician may want more clarification. If you are calling to report a drop in a client's blood pressure, be sure that the list of the client's medications, vital signs, a general assessment of the client's present status, and blood pressure trends is at hand.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes when a nurse calls a physician, the physician does not return the call. It is important to document all physician contacts in the client's record. Many units keep physician calling logs. The physician's name, the date, the time, and the reason for the call should be entered in the log. The time the physician returns the call is also entered.</p>
                        <p>Professional nurses are responsible for accepting, transcribing, and implementing physicians' orders. The two main types of orders are written and verbal. Written orders are dated and placed on the appropriate institutional form. Verbal orders are given from the physician directly to the nurse, either by telephone or face to face. A verbal order needs to be written on the appropriate institutional form, with the time and date noted, and signed as a verbal order by the nurse. The physician later co-signs it. When receiving a verbal order, it is necessary to repeat it back to the physician for confirmation. If the physician is speaking too rapidly, ask him or her to speak more slowly, and then repeat the information as confirmation.</p>
                        <p>Professionalism and a courteous attitude by all parties are necessary ingredients to maintain collegial relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Communicating with clients and their families occupies a major portion of the nurse's day. Nurses teach clients and their families about medications and the client's condition, clarify the physician's treatment plan, and explain procedures. To do this effectively nurses need to use communication skills and recognize the barriers to communication.</p>
                        <p>Today's healthcare environment requires nurses to be creative and effective when communicating with clients and their families. The healthcare consumer, often confronted by the bureaucracy of the managed care environment, may enter the setting in a highly charged emotional state. Nurses need to recognize the signs of the anxious or angry client and promptly intervene to defuse the situation before it escalates. Practicing good listening skills and showing interest in the client often help.</p>
                        <p>Early morning admissions on the day of surgery and short-term stays make client teaching a challenge. The nurse must complete the admission requirements, surgical checklists, and preoperative teaching within a short period of time. Time for postoperative teaching is also shortened. It is important for the nurse to communicate clearly and concisely what will be done and what is expected of the client. Allow time for questions and clarifications. For many clients, a written preoperative and/or postoperative teaching guide helps to clarify the instructions.</p>

                        <p>The responsibility for delivering and coordinating client care is an important part of the role of the professional nurse. To accomplish this, nurses need good communication skills. Being assertive without being aggressive and conducting interactions in a professional manner enhance the relationships nurses develop with colleagues, physicians, and other members of the interdisciplinary team.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps if Inez and her colleague had known more about communication, especially how to ask for help, their day would not have been so difficult. Staying calm and good communication skills demonstrate professionalism and an ability to work with others.</p>

                            <li>This is your first position as an RN, and you are working with an LPN who has been on the unit for 20 years.

Demonstrate how you would respond to this statement using assertive communication techniques.</li>
                            <li>A physician orders, "Vit K 10 mg . IVP." You realize that this is a dangerous order. How would you approach the physician?</li>
                            <li>A client is admitted to the same-day surgical center for a breast biopsy. She is accompanied by her significant other, who has just had an altercation with an admissions secretary about the managed care criteria for payment. The client is required to wait for 30 minutes after her designated arrival time. The nurse comes out to call the client back to the holding area and the significant other turns and says loudly, "What is wrong with you people? Can't you ever get anything straight? If you can't get the insurance right and you can't get the time right, how can we expect you to get the surgery right?" As the nurse, how would you diffuse the situation?</li>
