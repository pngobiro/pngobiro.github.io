                <section id="introduction" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-2">
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is 1961. In a large metropolitan hospital, 10 healthcare professionals are meeting to consider the cases of three different individuals. Ironically, the cases have something in common. Larry Jones, age 66, Irma Kolnick, age 31, and Nancy Roberts, age 10, are all suffering from chronic renal failure and are in need of hemodialysis. Equipment is scarce, the cost of the treatment is prohibitive, and it is doubtful that treatment will be covered by health insurance. The hospital is able to provide this treatment to only one of these individuals. Who shall live, and who shall die? In a novel of the same name, Noah Gordon called this decision-making group "the Death Committee" (Gordon, 1965). Today, such groups are referred to as ethics committees.</p>
                        <p>Not so long ago, we had neither the knowledge nor the technology to prolong life. The main role of nurses and physicians was to support patients through the time of illness, helping them toward recovery or keeping them comfortable until death. There were few "who shall live, and who shall die?" decisions.</p>
                        <p>In the late 1960s, technological advances made the intensive care unit possible. Health care can now keep alive people who would die without intervention. The development of new drugs and advances in biomechanical technology permit physicians and nurses to challenge nature. This progress also brings new, perplexing questions. The ability to prolong life has created some heartbreaking situations for families and terrible ethical dilemmas for healthcare professionals. How is the decision made about when it is time to turn off the life support machines that are keeping alive someone's beloved son or daughter after, for example, an auto accident? Families and professionals alike are faced with some of the most difficult ethical decisions at times like this. How do we define death? How do we know when it has occurred? Perhaps we also need to ask, "What is life? Is there ever a time when life is no longer worth living?"</p>
                        <p>Healthcare professionals have looked to philosophy, especially the branch that deals with human behavior, for resolution of these issues. The field of biomedical ethics (or simply bioethics), a subdiscipline of the area known as ethics—or the philosophical study of morality, has evolved. In essence, bioethics is the study of medical morality, the moral and social implications of health care and science in human life (Mappes & Zembaty, 1991).</p>
                        <p>To understand biomedical ethics, we need to first consider the basic concepts of values, belief systems, and morality. We will then discuss the resolution of ethical dilemmas in health care.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">VALUES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The dictionary defines values as the "estimated or appraised worth of something, or that quality of a thing that makes it more or less desirable, useful" (Webster's New World Dictionary, 1990). Values, then, are judgments about the importance or unimportance of objects, ideas, attitudes, and attributes. They become a part of a person's conscience and worldview. Values provide a frame of reference and act as pilots to guide behaviors and assist people in making choices.</p>
                        <h3>Value Systems</h3>
                        <p>A value system is a set of related values. For example, one person may value (believe to be important) material things, such as money, objects, and social status. Another person may value more abstract concepts, such as kindness, charity, and caring. Values may vary significantly based on an individual's culture. One's system of values frequently affects how people make decisions. For example, one person may base a decision on cost, and another person placed in the same situation may base the decision on kindness. There are different kinds of values:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Intrinsic values</strong> are those related to sustaining life, such as food and water (Steele & Harmon, 1983).</li>
                            <li><strong>Extrinsic values</strong> are not essential to life. Things, people, and ideas such as kindness, understanding, and material items are extrinsically valuable.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal values</strong> are qualities that people consider valuable in their private lives. Such things as strong family ties and acceptance by others are personal values.</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional values</strong> are qualities considered important by a professional group. Autonomy, integrity, and commitment are examples of professional values.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>People's behavior is motivated by values. Individuals take risks, relinquish their own comfort and security, and generate extraordinary efforts because of their values (Edge & Groves, 1994). Stroke patients may overcome tremendous barriers because they value independence. Racecar drivers may risk death or other serious injury because they value competition and winning.</p>
                        <p>Values are also the basis of standards by which people judge others. For example, if you value work over leisure activities, you will look unfavorably on the coworker who refuses to work over the weekend. If you believe that health is more important than wealth, you would approve of spending money on a relaxing vacation or perhaps joining a health club, rather than putting it in the bank. Often people adopt the values of individuals they admire. For example, a nursing student may begin to value humor after observing it used effectively with clients. You can see that values provide a guide for decision making and give additional meaning to life. Individuals develop a sense of satisfaction when they work toward achieving values they believe are important.</p>
                        <h3>How Values are Developed</h3>
                        <p>Values are learned (Wright, 1987). Values can be taught directly, incorporated through societal norms, or modeled through behavior. Children learn by watching their parents, friends, teachers, and religious leaders. Through continuous reinforcement, children eventually learn about and then adopt values as their own. Because of the values they hold dear, people often make great demands on themselves, ignoring the personal cost. Here is an example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>David grew up in a family in which educational achievement was highly valued. Not surprisingly, he adopted this as one of his own values. At school, he worked very hard because some of the subjects did not come easily to him. When his grades did not reflect his great effort, he felt as though he had disappointed his family as well as himself. By the time David reached the age of 15, he had developed severe migraine headaches.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Values change with experience and maturity. For example, young children often value objects, such as a favorite blanket or stuffed animal. Older children are more likely to value a particular event, such as a scouting expedition. As they enter adolescence, they may value peer opinion over the opinions of their parents. Young adults often value certain ideals, such as beauty and heroism. The values of adults are formed from all of these experiences as well as from learning and thought.</p>
                        <p>The number of values that people hold is not as important as what values they consider to be important. Choices are influenced by values. The way people use their own time and money, choose friends, and pursue a career are all influenced by values.</p>
                        <h3>Values Clarification</h3>
                        <p>Values clarification is deciding what you believe is important. It is the process that helps people become aware of their own values. Values play an important role in everyday decision making. For this reason, nurses need to be aware of what they value and what they do not. This process helps them to behave in a manner that is consistent with their values. Both personal and professional values can affect nurses' decisions. Understanding your values simplifies solving problems, making decisions, and developing better relationships with others when you begin to realize how they develop their values. Raths, Harmon, and Simmons (1979) suggested using a three-step model of choosing, prizing, and acting, with seven substeps, to identify your own values (Table 13-1).</p>

                        <p>You may have used this method when making the decision to return to school. Today, many career options are available to men and women. For some people, nursing is a first career; for others, it may be a second career. Using the model in Table 13-1, let's analyze the valuing process:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Choosing.</strong> After researching alternative career options, you freely chose nursing school from a whole range of options. This choice was most likely influenced by factors such as educational achievement and abilities, finances, support and encouragement from others, time factors, and feelings about people.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prizing.</strong> Once the choice was made, you were satisfied with it and told your friends about it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acting.</strong> You have entered school and begun the journey to your new career. Later in your career, you may decide to return to school for a bachelor's or master's degree.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>As you have progressed through school, you have probably begun to develop a new set of values—your professional values. Professional values are those established as being important in your practice, such as caring, quality of care, and ethical behaviors.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Belief systems are an organized way of thinking about why people exist within the universe. The purpose of belief systems is to explain such mysteries as life and death, good and evil, and health and illness. Usually these systems include an ethical code that specifies appropriate behavior. People may have a personal belief system or participate in a religion that provides such a system, or both.</p>
                        <p>Members of primitive societies worshiped events in nature. Unable to understand the science of weather, for example, early civilizations believed these things to be under the control of someone or something that needed to be appeased, and they developed rituals and ceremonies to appease these unknown entities. In doing this, they named these entities gods, believing that certain behaviors either pleased or angered the gods. Because these societies associated certain behaviors with specific outcomes, they created a belief system that enabled them to function as a group.</p>
                        <p>As higher civilizations evolved, belief systems became more complex. Archeology has provided us with evidence of the religious practices of ancient civilizations (Wack, 1992). The Aztec, Mayan, Incan, and Polynesian cultures each had a religious belief system comprising many gods and goddesses for the same functions. The Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Scandinavian societies believed in a hierarchy of gods as well as individual gods and goddesses. Interestingly, although given different names by different cultures, most of the deities had similar purposes. For example, Zeus was the Greek king of the gods, and Thor was the Norse god of thunder. Both used a thunderbolt as their symbol. Sociologists believe that these religions developed to explain what was then unexplainable. Human beings have a deep need to create order from chaos and to have logical explanations regarding events. Religion explains theologically what objective science cannot.</p>
                        <p>Along with the creation of rites and rituals, religions also developed codes of behaviors, or ethical codes. These codes contribute to the social order. There are rules regarding how to treat members of the family, neighbors, the young, and the old. Many religions have also developed rules regarding marriage, sexual practices, business practices, the ownership of property, and rules of inheritance.</p>
                        <p>The advancement of science certainly has not made belief systems any less important. In fact, the technology explosion has created an even greater need for these systems. Technological advances often place people in situations that justify religious convictions rather than oppose them. Many religions, and particularly Christianity, focus on the will of a supreme being, and technology, for example, is considered a gift that allows healthcare personnel to maintain the life of a loved one. Other religions, such as certain branches of Judaism, focus on free choice or free will, leaving such decisions in the hands of humankind. Genetic testing is an example of this approach. Many religious leaders believe that if genetic testing indicates, for instance, that an infant will be born with a disease such as Tay-Sachs, which causes severe suffering and ultimately death, an abortion may be an acceptable option.</p>
                        <p>Belief systems often help survivors in making decisions and living with them afterward. So far, more questions than answers have emerged from these technological advances. As science explains more and more previously unexplainable phenomena, we need beliefs and values to guide our use of this new knowledge.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Morals</h3>
                        <p>Although the terms morals and ethics are often used interchangeably, ethics usually refers to a standardized code as a guide to behaviors, whereas morals usually refers to an individual's own code for acceptable behavior. Morals arise from an individual's conscience. They act as a guide for individual behavior and are learned through instruction and socialization. You may find, for example, that you and your clients disagree on the acceptability of certain behaviors, such as premarital sex, taking drugs, or gambling. Even in your nursing class, you will probably encounter some disagreements because each of you has developed a personal code that defines acceptable behavior.</p>
                        <h3>Ethical Principles</h3>
                        <p>Ethics is the part of philosophy that deals with the rightness or wrongness of human behavior. It is also concerned with the motives behind behaviors. Bioethics, specifically, is the application of ethics to issues that pertain to life and death. The implication is that judgments can be made about the rightness or goodness of healthcare practices.</p>
                        <p>Ethical codes are based on principles that can be used to judge behavior. Ethical principles assist decision making because they are a standard for measuring actions. They may be the basis for laws, but they themselves are not laws. Laws are rules created by a governing body. Laws can operate because the government has the power to enforce them. They are usually quite specific, as are the punishments for disobeying them. Ethical principles are not confined to specific behaviors. They act as guides for appropriate behaviors. They also take into account the situation in which a decision must be made. You might say that ethical principles speak to the essence or fundamentals of the law, rather than to the exactness of the law (Macklin, 1987). Here is an example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Mrs. Van Gruen, 82 years old, was admitted to the hospital in acute respiratory distress. She was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and soon became septic, developing adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She had a living will, and her attorney was her designated healthcare surrogate. Her competence to make decisions was uncertain because of her illness. The physician presented the situation to the attorney, indicating that without a feeding tube and tracheostomy, Mrs. Van Gruen would die. According to the laws governing living wills and healthcare surrogates, the attorney could have made the decision to withhold all treatments. However, he felt he had an ethical obligation to still discuss the situation with his client. The client requested that the tracheostomy and the feeding tube be inserted, which was done.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>In some situations, two or more principles may conflict with each other. Making a decision under these circumstances is very difficult. We now consider several of the ethical principles that are most important to nursing practice—autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, justice, confidentiality, veracity, and accountability—and then look at some of the ethical dilemmas nurses encounter in clinical practice.</p>
                        <h4>Autonomy</h4>
                        <p>Autonomy is the freedom to make decisions for oneself. This ethical principle requires that nurses respect clients' rights to make their own choices about treatment. Informed consent before treatment, surgery, or participation in research is an example. To be able to make an autonomous choice, individuals need to be informed of the purpose, benefits, and risks of the procedures to which they are agreeing. Nurses accomplish this by providing information and supporting clients' choices.</p>
                        <p>Nurses are often in a position to protect a client's autonomy. They do this by ensuring that others do not interfere with the client's right to proceed with a decision. If a nurse observes that a client has insufficient information to make an appropriate choice, is being forced into a decision, or is unable to understand the consequences of the choice, then the nurse may act as a client advocate to ensure the principle of autonomy.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes nurses have difficulty with the principle of autonomy because it also requires respecting another's choice even if you disagree with it. According to the principle of autonomy, a nurse cannot replace a client's decision with his or her own, even when the nurse honestly believes that the client has made the wrong choice. A nurse can, however, discuss concerns with clients and make sure they have thought about the consequences of the decision they are about to make.</p>
                        <h4>Nonmaleficence</h4>
                        <p>The ethical principle of nonmaleficence requires that no harm be done, either deliberately or unintentionally. This rather complicated word comes from Latin roots:</p>
                        <p>non = not<br>male = bad<br>facere = to do</p>
                        <p>The principle of nonmaleficence also requires that nurses protect from danger individuals who are unable to protect themselves because of their physical or mental condition. An infant, a person under anesthesia, and a person with Alzheimer's disease are examples of people with limited ability to protect themselves. We are ethically obligated to protect our clients when they are unable to protect themselves.</p>
                        <p>This obligation to do no harm extends to the nurse who for some reason is not functioning at an optimal level. For example, a nurse who is impaired by alcohol or drugs is knowingly placing clients at risk. Other nurses who observe such behavior have an ethical obligation to protect the client according to the principle of nonmaleficence.</p>
                        <h4>Beneficence</h4>
                        <p>The word beneficence also comes from Latin roots:</p>
                        <p>bene = well<br>facere = to do</p>
                        <p>The principle of beneficence demands that good be done for the benefit of others. For nurses, this is more than delivering competent physical or technical care. It requires helping clients meet all their needs, whether physical, social, or emotional. Beneficence is caring in the truest sense, and caring fuses thought, feeling, and action—knowing and being truly understanding of the situation and the thoughts and ideas of the individual (Benner & Wrubel, 1989).</p>
                        <p>Sometimes physicians, nurses, and families withhold information from clients for the sake of beneficence. The problem with doing this is that it does not allow competent individuals to make their own decisions based on all available information. In an attempt to be beneficent, the principle of autonomy is violated. This is just one of many examples of the ethical dilemmas encountered in nursing practice. For instance:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Mrs. Gonzalez has just been admitted to the oncology unit with ovarian cancer. She is scheduled to begin chemotherapy treatment. Her two children and her husband have requested that the physician ensure that Mrs. Gonzalez not be told her diagnosis because they feel she would not be able to deal with it. The information is communicated to the nursing staff.</p>
                            <p>After the first treatment, Mrs. Gonzalez becomes very ill. She refuses the next treatment, stating that she didn't feel sick until she came to the hospital. She asks the nurse what could possibly be wrong with her that she needs a medicine that makes her sick when she doesn't feel sick. Only people who get cancer medicine get this sick! Mrs. Gonzalez then asks the nurse, "Do I have cancer?"</p>
                            <p>As the nurse, you understand the order that the client is not to be told her diagnosis. You also understand your role as a patient advocate.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>To whom do you owe your duty—the family or the client?</li>
                                <li>How do you think you may be able to be a client advocate in this situation?</li>
                                <li>What information would you communicate to the family, and how can you assist them in dealing with their mother's concerns?</li>
                            </ol>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Justice</h4>
                        <p>The principle of justice obliges nurses and other healthcare professionals to treat every person equally regardless of gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, disease, or social standing (Edge & Groves, 1994). This principle also applies in the work and educational setting. Everyone should be treated and judged by the same criteria according to this principle. Here is an example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Found on the street by the police, Mr. Johnson was admitted through the emergency room to a medical unit. He was in deplorable condition, wearing dirty, ragged clothes, unshaven, and covered with blood. His diagnosis was chronic alcoholism, complicated by esophageal varices and end-stage liver disease. Several nursing students overheard the staff discussing Mr. Johnson. The essence of the conversation was that no one wanted to care for him because he was dirty, smelly, and brought this condition on himself. The students, upset by what they heard, went to their instructor about the situation. The instructor explained that every individual has a right to good care despite his or her economic or social position. This is the principle of justice.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
                        <p>The principle of confidentiality states that anything said to nurses and other healthcare providers by their clients must be held in the strictest confidence. Exceptions exist only when clients give permission for the release of information or when the law requires the release of specific information. Sometimes, just sharing information without revealing an individual's name can be a breach in confidentiality because the situation and the individual are identifiable. It is important to realize that what seems like a harmless statement can become harmful if other people can piece together bits of information and identify the client.</p>
                        <p>Nurses come into contact with people from different walks of life. When working within communities, people are bound to know people, who know other people, and so on. Individuals have lost families, jobs, and insurance coverage because nurses have shared confidential information and others have acted on that knowledge (AIDS Update Conference, 1995).</p>
                        <p>In today's electronic environment the principle of confidentiality has become a major concern. Many healthcare institutions, insurance companies, and businesses use electronic media to transfer information. These institutions store sensitive and confidential information in computer databases. These databases need to have security safeguards to prevent unauthorized access. Healthcare institutions have addressed the situation through the use of limited access, authorization passwords, and security tracking systems. It is important to remember that even the most secure system developed is vulnerable and can be accessed by an individual who understands the complexities of computer systems.</p>
                        <h4>Veracity</h4>
                        <p>Veracity requires nurses to be truthful. Truth is fundamental to building a trusting relationship. Intentionally deceiving or misleading a client is a violation of this principle. Deliberately omitting a part of the truth is deception and violates the principle of veracity. This principle often creates ethical dilemmas. When is it all right to lie? Some ethicists believe it is never appropriate to deceive another individual. Others think that if another ethical principle overrides veracity, then lying is permissible. Consider this situation:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Ms. Allen has just been told that her father has Alzheimer's disease. The nurse practitioner wants to come into the home to discuss treatment. Ms. Allen refuses, saying that the nurse practitioner should under no circumstances tell her father the diagnosis. She explains to the practitioner that she is sure he will kill himself if he learns that he has Alzheimer's disease. She bases this concern on statements he has made regarding this disease.</p>
                            <p>The nurse practitioner replies that a medication is available that might help her father. However, it is available only through a research study being conducted at a nearby university. To participate in the research, the client must be informed of the purpose of the study, the medication to be given, its side effects, and follow-up procedures. Ms. Allen continues to refuse to allow her father to be told his diagnosis because she is positive he will commit suicide.</p>
                            <p>The nurse practitioner faces a dilemma: does he abide by Ms. Allen's wishes based on the principle of beneficence, or does he abide by the principle of veracity and inform his client of the diagnosis. What would you do?</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Accountability</h4>
                        <p>Accountability means accepting responsibility for one's actions. Nurses are accountable to their clients and to their colleagues. When providing care to clients, nurses are responsible for their own actions, good and not so good. If something was not done, do not chart or tell a colleague that it was. An example of violating accountability is the story of Anna:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Anna was a registered nurse who worked nights on an acute care unit. She was an excellent nurse, but as the acuity of the clients' conditions increased, she was unable to keep up with both clients' needs and the technology, particularly IVs. She began to chart that all the IVs were infusing as they should, even when they were not. Each morning, the day shift would find that the actual infused amount did not agree with what the paperwork showed. One night, Anna allowed an entire liter to be infused into a client with congestive heart failure in 2 hours. When the day staff came on duty, they found the client expired, the bag empty, and the tubing filled with blood. Anna's IV sheet showed 800 mL left in the bag. It was not until a lawsuit was filed that Anna took responsibility for her behavior.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The idea of a standard of care evolves from this principle. Standards of care provide a ruler for measuring nursing actions.</p>
                        <h3>Ethical Codes</h3>
                        <p>A code of ethics is a formal statement of the rules of ethical behavior for a particular group of individuals. A code of ethics (see Chapter 16 and Appendix 1) is one of the hallmarks of a profession. This code makes clear the behavior expected of its members. The Nursing Code of Ethics provides values, standards, and principles to help nursing function as a profession.</p>
                        <p>Ethical codes are dynamic. They reflect the values of the profession and the society for which they were developed. Changes occur as society and technology evolve. For example, years ago no thought was ever given to do not resuscitate (DNR) orders or withholding food and fluids. These things were not issues then, but the technological advances that have made it possible to keep people in a kind of twilight life, comatose and unable to participate in living in any way, have made these very important issues in health care.</p>
                        <p>It is not the purpose of ethical codes to change with every little breeze but to maintain a steady course, evolving as needed, but continuing to emphasize the basic ethical principles. Technology has increased our knowledge and skills, but our ability to make decisions regarding ourselves and those we care for is still guided by the principles of autonomy, maleficence, beneficence, justice, accountability, and veracity.</p>
                        <h3>Ethical Dilemmas</h3>
                        <p>What is a dilemma? The word dilemma is of Greek derivation. A lemma was an animal resembling a ram and having two horns. Thus came the saying "stuck on the horns of a dilemma." The story of Hugo illustrates a hypothetical life-or-death dilemma with a touch of humor:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>One day, Hugo, dressed in a bright red cape, walked through his village into the countryside. The wind caught the corners of the cape, and it was being whipped in all directions. As he walked down the dusty road, Hugo happened to pass by a lemma. Hugo's bright red cape caught the lemma's attention.</p>
                            <p>Lowering its head with its two horns poised in attack position, the animal began to chase poor Hugo down the road. Panting and exhausted, Hugo reached the end of the road to find himself blocked by a huge stone wall. He turned to face the lemma, which was ready to charge. A decision needed to be made, and Hugo's life depended on this decision. If he moved to the left, the lemma would gore his heart. If he moved to the right, the lemma would gore his liver. Alas, no matter what his decision, our friend Hugo would be "stuck on the horns of da lemma."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Like Hugo, nurses are often faced with difficult dilemmas. Also, as Hugo found, an ethical dilemma can be a choice between two unpleasant alternatives.</p>
                        <p>An ethical dilemma occurs when a problem exists that forces a choice between two or more ethical principles. Deciding in favor of one principle will violate the other. Both sides have goodness and badness to them, but neither decision satisfies all the criteria that apply. Ethical dilemmas also have the added burden of emotions. Feelings of anger, frustration, and fear often override rationality in the decision-making process. Consider the case of Mr. Sussman:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Mr. Sussman, 80 years old, was admitted to the neuroscience unit after suffering left hemispheric bleeding. He had total right hemiplegia and was completely nonresponsive, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8. He had been on IV fluids for 4 days, and the question of placing a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for enteral feedings was raised. The elder of the two children asked what the chances of recovery were. The physician explained that Mr. Sussman's current state was probably the best he could attain but that miracles happen every day and stated that tests could help in determining the prognosis. The family asked that these be performed.</p>
                            <p>After the results were in, the physician explained that the prognosis was grave, but that IV fluids were insufficient to sustain life. The PEG tube would be a necessity if the family wished to continue with food and fluids.</p>
                            <p>As the physician went down the hall, the family pulled in the nurse, Gail, who had been with Mr. Sussman during the previous 3 days and asked, "If this were your father, what would you do?" This situation became an ethical dilemma for Gail as well. If you were Gail, what would you say? Depending on your answer, what would be the possible principles that you might violate?</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Ethical dilemmas can occur in any aspect of our lives, personal or professional. Here we focus on the resolution of professional dilemmas. The nursing process provides a helpful mechanism for finding solutions to ethical dilemmas. The first step is assessment, including identification of the problem. The simplest way to do this is to create a statement that summarizes the issue. The remainder of the process evolves from this statement (Box 13-1).</p>
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Ask yourself, am I directly involved in this dilemma? An issue is not an ethical dilemma for nurses unless they are directly involved or have been asked for their opinion about a situation. Some nurses involve themselves in situations when their opinion has not been solicited. This is generally unwarranted unless the issue is a violation of the professional code of ethics.</p>
                        <p>Nurses are frequently in the position of hearing both sides of an ethical dilemma. Often all that is asked for is an empathetic listener. At other times, when guidance is requested, we can help people work through the decision-making process (remember the principle of autonomy).</p>
                        <p>Collecting data from all the decision makers helps in identifying the reasoning process being used by these individuals as they struggle with the issue. The following questions assist in the information-gathering process:</p>

                        <p><strong>What are the medical facts?</strong> Find out how the physicians, physical and occupational therapists, dietitians, and your fellow nurses view the client's condition and treatment options. Speak with the client if possible, and determine his or her understanding of the situation.</p>
                        <p><strong>What are the psychosocial facts?</strong> In what emotional state is the client right now? The client's family? What kind of relationship exists between the client and his or her family? What are the client's living conditions? Who are the individuals who form the client's support system? How are they involved in the client's care? What is the client's ability to make medical decisions about his or her care? Do financial considerations need to be taken into account? What concepts or things does the client value? What does the client's family value? The answers to these questions will give you a better understanding of the situation. You may also find yourself asking more questions to complete the picture.</p>
                        <p>The social facts of a situation also include institutional policies, legal aspects, and economic factors. The personal belief systems of physicians and other healthcare professionals also influence this aspect.</p>
                        <p><strong>What are the client's wishes?</strong> Remember the ethical principle of autonomy. With very few exceptions, if the client is competent, his or her decisions take precedence. Too often, the family's or physician's worldview and belief system overshadow that of the client. Nurses can assist by maintaining the focus on the client.</p>
                        <p>If the client is unable to communicate, try to discover whether the individual has discussed the issue in the past. If the client has completed a living will or designated a healthcare surrogate, this will also help in determining the client's wishes. By interviewing family members, the nurse often can learn about conversations in which the client voiced his or her feelings about treatment decisions. Through guided interviewing, the nurse can encourage the family to tell anecdotes that provide relevant insights into what the client's values and beliefs are.</p>
                        <p><strong>What values are in conflict?</strong> To assess values, begin by listing each person involved in the situation. Then identify the values represented by each person. You can do this by asking questions such as, "What do you feel is the most pressing issue here?" and "Tell me more about your feelings regarding this situation." In some cases, you may find little disagreement among the people involved, just a different way of expressing their beliefs. In others, however, you may discover a serious value conflict.</p>
                        <h3>Planning</h3>
                        <p>For planning to be successful, everyone involved in the decision must be included in the process. According to Thompson and Thompson (1985), there are three very specific but integrated phases to this planning:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Determine the goals of treatment.</strong> Is cure a goal, or is it keeping the client comfortable? Is the goal life at any cost, or is it a peaceful death at home? These goals need to be client focused, centered on reality, and attainable. They should be consistent with current medical treatment and, if possible, be measurable according to an established time frame.</li>
                            <li><strong>Identify the decision makers.</strong> As mentioned earlier, nurses may or may not be decision makers in these health-related ethical dilemmas. It is important to know who the decision makers are and what their belief systems are. When the client is a capable participant, this task is much easier. However, people who are ill are often too exhausted to speak up for themselves or to ensure that their voices are heard. When this happens, the client needs an advocate. Family, friends, spiritual advisers, and nurses often act as advocates for clients. If the client is unable to speak for himself or herself, then someone else must speak for him or her. A family member may need to be designated as the primary decision maker, a role often called the healthcare surrogate.</li>
                            <p>The creation of living wills, establishment of advance directives, and appointment of a healthcare surrogate while a person is still healthy often ease the burden for the decision makers during a later crisis. Clients can exercise autonomy through these mechanisms, even though they may no longer be able to directly communicate their wishes. When these documents are not available, the information gathered during the assessment of social factors helps identify those individuals who may be able to act in the client's best interest.</p>
                            <li><strong>List and rank all the options.</strong> Performing this task involves all the decision makers. It is sometimes helpful to begin with the least desired choice and methodically work toward the preferred treatment choice that is most likely to lead to the desired outcome. Asking all participating parties to discuss what they feel are reasonable outcomes to be attained with the use of available medical treatment often helps in the decision process. By listening to others in a controlled situation, family members and healthcare professionals discover that they actually want the same thing as the client and just had different ideas about how to achieve their goal.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>During the implementation phase, the client or the surrogate (substitute) decision makers and members of the healthcare team reach a mutually acceptable decision. This occurs through open discussion and sometimes negotiation. An example of negotiation follows:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Elena's mother has metastatic ovarian cancer. She and Elena have discussed treatment options. Her physician suggested the use of a new chemotherapeutic agent that has demonstrated success in many cases. But Elena's mother emphatically states that she has had enough and would just like to spend her remaining time doing whatever she chooses. Elena would like her mother to try the drug.</p>
                            <p>To resolve the dilemma, the oncology nurse practitioner and the physician sit down to talk with Elena and her mother. Everyone reviews the facts and expresses their feelings about the situation. Seeing Elena's distress over her decision, Elena's mother says, "OK, I will try the Taxol for 1 month. If there is no improvement after this time, I want to stop all treatment and live out the time I have with my daughter and her family." All agreed that this was a reasonable decision.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The role of the nurse during the implementation phase is to ensure that communication does not break down. Ethical dilemmas are often emotional issues, filled with guilt, sorrow, anger, and other strong emotions. These strong feelings can cause communication failures among decision makers. Remind yourself, "I am here to do what is best for this client."</p>
                        <p>Keep in mind that an ethical dilemma is not always a choice between two attractive alternatives. Many are between two unattractive, even unpleasant choices. Elena's mother's options did not include the choice she really wished for: good health and a long life.</p>
                        <p>Once an agreement is reached, the decision makers must live with it. Sometimes, an agreement is not reached because the parties cannot reconcile their conflicting belief systems or values. At other times, caregivers are unable to recognize the worth of the client's point of view. Occasionally, the client or the surrogate may make a request that is not institutionally or legally possible. In some cases, a different institution or physician may be able to honor the request. In other cases, the client or surrogate may request information from the nurse regarding illegal acts. When this happens, the nurse should sit down with the client and family and ask them to consider the consequences of their proposed actions. It may be necessary to bring other counselors into the discussion (with the client's permission) to negotiate an agreement.</p>
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>As in the nursing process, the purpose of evaluation in resolving ethical dilemmas is to determine whether the desired outcomes have occurred. In the case of Mr. Sussman, some of the questions that could be posed by Gail to the family are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I have noticed the amount of time you have been spending with your father. Have you observed any changes in his condition?"</li>
                            <li>"I see Dr. Washburn spoke to you about the test results and your father's prognosis. How do you feel about the situation?"</li>
                            <li>"Now that Dr. Washburn has spoken to you about your father's condition, have you considered future alternatives?"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Changes in client status, availability of medical treatment, and social facts may call for reevaluation of a situation. The course of treatment may need to be altered. Continued communication and cooperation among the decision makers are essential.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The well-known Dr. Jack Kevorkian (sometimes called Dr. Death" in the press) has raised the consciousness of the American people and the healthcare system about the issues of euthanasia and assisted suicide. Do individuals have the right to consciously end their own lives when they are suffering from terminal conditions? If they are unable to perform the act themselves, should others assist them in ending their lives? Should this be illegal? We do not have answers to these difficult questions, yet clients and their families across the country face these same questions every day.</p>
                        <p>The primary goal of nursing and other healthcare professions is to keep people alive and well or, if we cannot do this, to help them live with their problems and die peacefully. To do this, we struggle to improve our knowledge and skills so that we can care for our clients, provide them with some quality of life, and bring them back to the state known as wellness. The costs involved in achieving this goal can be astronomical. Questions are being raised more and more often about who should receive the benefits of this technology. Other difficult questions, such as who should pay for care when the illness may have been due to poor healthcare practices such as smoking or substance abuse, are also being debated.</p>
                        <h3>Practice Issues Related to Technology</h3>
                        <p>When facing issues of technology, the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence may be in conflict. A specific technology administered with the intention of "doing good" may result in enormous suffering. Causing this type of torment is in direct conflict with the idea of "do no harm" (Burkhardt & Nathaniel, 1998). At times, this is an accepted consequence, such as the use of chemotherapy. However, the ultimate outcome in this case is that recovery is expected. In situations in which little or no improvement is expected, the issue of whether the "good outweighs the bad" prevails. Suffering induced by technology may include physical, spiritual, and emotional components for both the client and the families.</p>
                        <p>Today, many low birth weight infants and infants with birth defects that not so long ago would have been considered incompatible with life are maintained on machines in highly sophisticated neonatal units. This process may keep babies alive only to succumb several months later or leave them with severe chronic disabilities. Children with chronic disabilities require additional medical, educational, and social services. These services are expensive and often require families to travel long distances to obtain them (Urbano, 1992).</p>
                        <p>Genetic diagnosis and gene therapy present new ethical issues for nursing. Genetic diagnosis is a process that involves analyzing an embryo for a genetic disorder. This is usually done before in vitro fertilization with couples who have a high risk of conceiving a child with a genetic disorder. The embryos are tested and only those that are free of genetic flaws are implanted. Genetic screening is used only as a tool to determine whether couples hold the possibility of giving birth to a genetically impaired infant. For example, in older couples it is commonplace to test for Down syndrome. In other cases, say, if a couple has one child with a genetic disorder, genetic specialists test the parents or the fetus for the presence of the gene. This leads to issues pertaining to reproductive rights. It also opens new issues: What is a disability versus a disorder, and who decides this? Is a disability a disease and does it need to be cured or prevented? The technology is also used to determine whether individuals are predisposed to certain diseases, such as breast cancer or Huntington's chorea.</p>
                        <p>Genetic engineering is the ability to change the genetic structure of an organism. Through this process, researchers have created more disease-resistant fruits and vegetables and certain medications, such as insulin. This process theoretically allows for the genetic alteration of embryos, eliminating genetic flaws and creating healthier babies. This technology enables researchers to make a brown-haired individual blonde, to change brown eyes to blue, and make a short person taller. Imagine being able to "engineer" your child. Imagine, as Aldous Huxley did in Brave New World (1932), being able to create a society of perfect individuals: "We also predestine and condition. We decant our babies as socialized human beings, as Alphas or Epsilons, as future sewage workers or future . . . he was going to say future World controllers but correcting himself said future directors of Hatcheries, instead" (p. 12).</p>
                        <p>The ethical implications pertaining to genetic technology are profound. For example, some questions recently raised by the Human Genome Project relate to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fairness in the use of the genetic information</li>
                            <li>Privacy and confidentiality of obtained genetic information</li>
                            <li>Genetic testing of an individual for a specific condition due to family history:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Should testing be performed if no treatment is available?</li>
                                    <li>Should parents have the right to have minors tested for adult-onset diseases?</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The use of gene therapy for genetic enhancement</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Human Genome Project is dedicated to mapping and identifying the genetic composition of humans. Scientists hope to identify and eradicate many of the genetic disorders affecting individuals. Initiated in 1990, the Human Genome Project is a 13-year effort coordinated by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health. The project originally was slated to take 15 years; however, the swift technological advances accelerated the time frame.</p>
                        <p>The project goals are to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Identify all of the genes in human DNA</li>
                            <li>Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical bases that make up human DNA</li>
                            <li>Store this information in databases</li>
                            <li>Develop tools for data analysis</li>
                            <li>Address the ethical, legal, and social issues that may arise from the project (Human Genome Project Information, 2000, p. 1)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Rapid advances in the science of genetics and its applications present new and complex ethical and policy issues for individuals, healthcare personnel, and society. Economics comes into play, because currently only those who can afford the technology have access to it. Efforts need to be directed toward creating standards that identify the uses for genetic data and the protection of human rights and confidentiality. This is truly the new frontier.</p>
                        <p>A primary responsibility of nursing is to help clients and families cope with the purposes, benefits, and limitations of the new technologies. Nurses will need to have knowledge about the new genetic technologies, because they will fill the roles of counselors and advisers in these areas. Many nurses now work in the areas of in vitro fertilization and genetic counseling.</p>
                        <p>Most of this chapter has dealt with client issues, but ethical problems may involve leadership and management issues as well. What do you do about an impaired coworker? Personal loyalties often cause conflict with professional ethics, creating an ethical dilemma. For this reason, most nurse practice acts address this problem today and require the reporting of impaired professionals and providing rehabilitation for them.</p>
                        <p>Other professional dilemmas may involve working with incompetent personnel. This may be frustrating for both staff and management. Regulations created to protect individuals from unjustified loss of position and the enormous amount of paperwork, remediation, and time that must be exercised to terminate an incompetent healthcare worker often make management look the other way. Employing institutions that provide nursing services have an obligation to establish a process for the reporting and handling of practices that jeopardize client safety (American Nurses Association, 1994). The behaviors of incompetent staff place both clients and other staff members in jeopardy, and, eventually, the incompetency may lead to legal action that may have been avoidable if a different approach had been taken.</p>
