                        <p>By now, you have invested considerable time, expense, and emotion in preparing for your new career. Your educational preparation, technical and clinical expertise, interpersonal and management skills, personal interests and needs, and commitment to the nursing profession will all contribute to meeting your career goals. Changes in technology and healthcare reform will continue to affect the way in which nursing care is delivered. However, as these changes eventually work out, we believe that nurses will continue to play a major role in the delivery of health care. Successful nurses view nursing as a lifetime pursuit, and not as an occupational stepping stone. As a professional nurse, you will find that the sky is the limit in terms of the opportunities and challenges.</p>
                        <p>What steps are important in strategizing your career path? This chapter deals with a most important endeavor—finding and keeping your first nursing position. The chapter begins with planning your initial search; developing a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis; searching for available positions; and researching organizations. Also included is a section on writing a résumé and employment-related information about the interview process and selecting the first position.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many students attending college today are adults with family, work, and personal responsibilities. On graduating with an associate degree in nursing, you may still have student loans and continued responsibilities for supporting a family. If this is so, you may be so focused on job security and a steady source of income that the idea of career planning has not even entered your mind. Besides, isn't the idea just to "get the first job"? Not exactly. The idea is to find the job that fits you and that is a good first step on the path to a lifelong career in nursing.</p>
                        <p>Searching for a job is a consideration of not only who will hire you for the first position but also what career path you will pursue. Yes, you do need to prepare for the first job, but in doing so you also need to prepare yourself for your future as a professional nurse. Doing this first will decrease your chances of burnout and dissatisfaction with your chosen profession.</p>
                        <h3>SWOT Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Many students assume that their first position will be as a staff nurse on a medical-surgical floor. They see themselves as "putting in their year" and then moving on to what they really want to do. However, as the healthcare system continues to evolve and reallocate resources, this may no longer be the automatic first step for new graduates. Instead, the new graduate should focus on long-term career goals and the different avenues by which they can be reached.</p>
                        <p>Many times, your past experiences will be an asset in presenting your abilities for a particular position. A SWOT analysis plan, borrowed from the corporate world, can guide you through your own internal strengths and weaknesses and an analysis of external opportunities and threats that may help or hinder your job search and career planning. The SWOT analysis is really an in-depth look at what will make you truly happy in your work. Although you have already made the decision to pursue nursing, knowing your strengths and weaknesses can help you select the work setting that will be personally satisfying (Ellis, 1999). Your SWOT analysis may include these factors (Pratt, 1994):</p>
                        <h4>Strengths</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relevant work experience</li>
                            <li>Advanced education</li>
                            <li>Additional product knowledge</li>
                            <li>Good communications and people skills</li>
                            <li>Computer skills</li>
                            <li>Self-managed learner</li>
                            <li>Flexibility</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Poor communications and people skills</li>
                            <li>Inflexibility</li>
                            <li>Lack of interest in further training</li>
                            <li>Difficulty adapting to change</li>
                            <li>Inability to see health care as a business</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Opportunities</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Expanding markets in health care</li>
                            <li>New applications of technology</li>
                            <li>New products and diversification</li>
                            <li>Increasing at-risk populations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Threats</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increased competition among healthcare facilities</li>
                            <li>Changes in government regulation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Take some time to personalize the preceding SWOT analysis. What are your strengths? What are the things that you are not so good at? What weaknesses do you need to minimize or which strengths do you need to develop as you begin your job search? What opportunities and threats exist in the healthcare community you are considering? Doing a SWOT analysis will help you make an initial assessment of the job market. It can be used again after you narrow down your search for that first nursing position.</p>
                        <h3>Beginning the Search</h3>
                        <p>The saying "Once you have a degree, you can get a job anywhere" is no longer true for many college graduates. As this book goes to press, we are in the beginning of a nationwide nursing shortage that is predicted to last for at least 5 years. However, even with a shortage, hospital mergers, emphasis on increased staff productivity, budget crises, staffing shifts, and changes in job market availability affect the numbers and types of nurses employed in various facilities and agencies. Instead of focusing on long-term job security, the career-secure employee focuses on becoming a career survivalist. A career survivalist focuses on the person, not the position. Consider the following career survivalist strategies (Waymon & Baber, 1999, pp. 10-13):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Be psychologically self-employed.</strong> Your career belongs to you, not to the person who signs your paycheck. Security and advancement on the job are up to you. Security may be elusive, but opportunities for nurses are growing every day.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learn for employability.</strong> Take personal responsibility for your career success. Learn not only for your current position, but also for your next position. Employability in health care today means learning technology tools, job-specific technical skills, and people skills such as the ability to negotiate, coach, and make presentations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plan for your financial future.</strong> Ask yourself, "How can I spend less, earn more, and manage better?" Often people make job decisions based on financial decisions, which makes them feel trapped instead of secure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Develop multiple options.</strong> The career survivalist looks at multiple options constantly. Moving up is only one option. Being aware of emerging trends in nursing, adjacent fields, lateral moves, and special projects presents other options.</li>
                            <li><strong>Build a safety net.</strong> Networking is extremely important to the career survivalist. Joining professional organizations, taking time to build long-term nursing relationships, and getting to know other career survivalists will make your career path more enjoyable and successful.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What do employers think you need to be ready to work for them? Besides passing the NCLEX examination, employers cite the following skills as desirable in job candidates (Shingleton, 1994):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Oral and Written Communication Skills</li>
                            <li>Ability to assume responsibility</li>
                            <li>Interpersonal skills</li>
                            <li>Proficiency in field of study/technical competence</li>
                            <li>Teamwork ability</li>
                            <li>Willingness to work hard</li>
                            <li>Leadership abilities</li>
                            <li>Motivation, initiative, and flexibility</li>
                            <li>Analytical skills</li>
                            <li>Computer knowledge</li>
                            <li>Problem-solving and decision-making abilities</li>
                            <li>Self-discipline</li>
                            <li>Organizational skills</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Active job searches may include looking in a variety of places (Beatty, 1991):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Public employment agencies</li>
                            <li>Private employment agencies</li>
                            <li>Human resource departments</li>
                            <li>Information from friends or relatives</li>
                            <li>Newspapers, professional journals</li>
                            <li>College and university career centers</li>
                            <li>Career/job fairs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Regardless of where you begin your search, explore the market vigorously and thoroughly. Looking only in the classified ads on Sunday morning is a limited search. Instead, speak to everyone you know about your job search. Encourage classmates and colleagues to share contacts with you, and do the same with them. Also, when possible, try to speak directly with the person who is looking for a nurse when you hear of a possible opening. The people in human resources offices (personnel) may reject a candidate on a technicality that a nurse manager would realize does not affect that person's ability to handle the job if he or she is otherwise a good match for the position. For example, experience in day surgery prepares a person to work in other surgery-related settings, but a human resources interviewer may not know this.</p>
                        <p>Try to obtain as much information as you can about the available position. Is there a match between your skills and interests and the position available? Ask yourself whether you are applying for this position because you really want it or just to gain interview experience. Be careful about going through the interview process and receiving job offers only to turn them down. Employers may share information with one another, and you could end up being denied the position you really want.</p>
                        <h3>Researching Your Potential Employer</h3>
                        <p>You have spent time taking a look at yourself and the climate of the healthcare job market. You have narrowed your choices to the organizations that really interest you. Now is the time to find out as much as possible about these organizations.</p>
                        <p>Ownership of the company may be public or private and foreign-owned or Americanowned. The company may be a local, a regional, or a small corporation or a division of a much larger corporation. Depending on the size and ownership of the company, information may be obtained from the public library, chamber of commerce, or government offices. A telephone call or letter to the corporate office or local human resources department may also furnish you with valuable information on organizations of interest (Crowther, 1994). Has the organization recently gone through a merger, a reorganization, or downsizing? Information from current and past employees is valuable and may provide you with more details about whether or not the organization might be suitable for you. Be wary of gossip and half-truths that may emerge however, because they may discourage you from applying to an excellent healthcare facility. In other words, if you hear something negative about an organization, check it out for yourself.</p>
                        <p>You may want to obtain the mission statement of organizations that interest you. The mission statement reflects what the institution sees as important to its public image. A look at the department of nursing philosophy and objectives indicates how the nursing department defines nursing and outlines the objectives for the department; in other words, what the important goals for nursing are. The nursing philosophy and goals should reflect the mission of the organization. Where is nursing administration on the organizational chart of the institution? To whom does the chief nursing administrator report? Although much of this information may not be obtained until an interview, a preview of how the institution views itself and the value it places on nursing will help you to decide if your philosophy of health care and nursing is compatible with that of a particular organization.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">WRITING A RÉSUMÉ</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Your résumé is your self-advertisement and is the first impression the recruiter or your potential employer will have of you. Through the résumé you are selling yourself—your skills, talents, and abilities. You may decide to prepare your own résumé or have it prepared by a professional service. Regardless of who prepares it, the purpose of a résumé is clear: to get a job interview. Many people dislike the idea of writing a résumé. After all, how can you sum up your entire career in a single page? We want to scream out at the printed page, "Hey, I am bigger than that! Look at all I have to offer!" Ultimately, this one-page summary has to work well enough to get you the position you want. Chestnut (1999) summarized résumé writing by stating, "Lighten up. Although a very important piece to the puzzle in your job search, a résumé is not the only ammunition. What's between your ears is what will ultimately lead you to your next career" (p. 28).</p>
                        <h3>Essentials of a Résumé</h3>
                        <p>Résumés most frequently follow one of three formats: chronological order, functional, or a combination. The chronological résumé is the easiest to prepare. This format allows you to document your work history in reverse chronological order, using dates of employment. The chronological résumé frequently includes an objective that indicates the type of work you are seeking. This résumé focuses on what you have done in the past, and not on what you can or feel you will do in the future. It is easy to read and can be prepared so that your work experience relates to your current job objective. The functional résumé starts with a job objective and documents your accomplishments, abilities, and transferable skills under headings such as "leadership skills." Most people prepare a combination résumé including functional and chronological elements by documenting skills and abilities as well as a chronological education and work history (Vogel, 1993; Dadich, 1992; Collins, 1991).</p>
                        <p>Most professional recruiters and placement services agree on the following tips in preparing a résumé (Anderson, 1992; Rodriquez & Robertson, 1992):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Make sure your résumé is readable.</strong> Although most professionals recommend a résumé of no more than two pages, the length does not appear to be as important as the need for the reader to find the critical information easily. Is the type large enough for easy reading? Are paragraphs indented or bullets used to set off information, or does the entire page look like a gray blur? Using bold headings and appropriate spacing can offer relief from lines of gray type, but be careful not to get so carried away with graphics that your résumé becomes a new art form. The paper should be an appropriate color such as cream, white, or off-white. Use easily readable fonts and a laser printer. If a good computer and printer are not available, most printing services prepare résumés at a reasonable cost.</li>
                            <li><strong>Make sure the important facts are easy to spot.</strong> Education, current employment, responsibilities, and facts to support the experience you have gained from previous positions are important. Put the strongest statements at the beginning. Avoid excessive use of the word I. If you are a new nursing graduate and have little or no job experience, list your educational background first. Remember that positions you held before you entered nursing can frequently support experience that will be relevant in your nursing career. Do let your prospective employer know how you can be contacted.</li>
                            <li><strong>Do a spelling and grammar check.</strong> Use simple terms, action verbs, and descriptive words. Check your finished résumé for spelling, style, and grammar errors. If you are not sure how something sounds, get another opinion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Follow the don'ts.</strong> Don't include pictures, fancy binders, or personal references. Don't include salary information or hobbies (unless they have contributed to your work experience). Don't include personal information such as weight, marital status, and number of children. Don't repeat yourself just to make the résumé longer. A good résumé is lean and to the point and focuses on your strengths and accomplishments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>No matter which format you use, it is essential to include the following (Parker, 1989):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A clearly stated job objective</li>
                            <li>Highlighted qualifications</li>
                            <li>Presentation of directly relevant skills experience</li>
                            <li>Chronological work history</li>
                            <li>Listing of relevant education and training</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>How to Begin</h3>
                        <p>Start by writing down every applicable point you can think of in the preceding five categories. Work history is usually the easiest place to begin. Arrange your work history in reverse chronological order, listing your current job first. Account for all your employable years. Short lapses in employment are acceptable, but give a brief explanation for longer periods (e.g., "maternity leave"). Include employer, dates worked (years only, e.g., 1991-1993), city, and state for each employer you list. Briefly describe the duties and responsibilities of each position. Emphasize your accomplishments, any special techniques you learned, or changes you implemented. Use action verbs, such as those listed in Table 14-1, to describe your accomplishments. Also cite any special awards or committee chairmanships. If a previous position was not in the health field, try to relate your duties and accomplishments to the position you are seeking.</p>
                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>Next, focus on your education. Include the name and location of every educational institution you attended, the dates you attended, and the degree, diploma, or certification attained. Start with your most recent degree. Include your license number and state(s) of licensure. If you are awaiting licensure, indicate when you will sit for the NCLEX examination. If you are seeking additional training, such as for IV certification, include only what is relevant to your job objective.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>Your Objective</h3>
                        <p>It is now time to write your job objective. Write a clear, brief job objective. To accomplish this, ask yourself: What do I want to do? For whom or with whom? When? At what level of responsibility? For example (Parker, 1989):</p>
                        <p>What: registered nurse<br>For whom: pediatric patients<br>Where: large metropolitan hospital<br>At what level: staff</p>
                        <p>A new graduate's objective might read: "Position as staff nurse on a pediatric unit" or "Graduate nurse position on a pediatric unit." Do not include phrases such as "advancing to NICU." Employers are trying to fill current openings and do not want be considered a stepping stone in your career.</p>
                        <h3>Skills and Experience</h3>
                        <p>Relevant skills and experience are included in your résumé not to describe your past but to present a "word picture of you in your proposed new job, created out of the best of your past experience" (Parker, 1989, p. 13). Begin by jotting down the major skills required for the position you are seeking. Include five or six major skills such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Administration/management</li>
                            <li>Teamwork/problem solving</li>
                            <li>Patient relations</li>
                            <li>Proficiency in a specialty</li>
                            <li>Technical skills</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What if you were "just a housewife" for many years? First, let's do an attitude adjustment: you were not "just a housewife" but a family manager. Explore your role in work-related terms such as community volunteerism, personal relations, fund-raising, counseling, and teaching. A college career office, women's center, or professional résumé business can offer you assistance with analyzing the skills and talents you shared with your family and community. A student who lacks work experience has options as well. Examples of non-work experience that show marketable skills include (Parker, 1989; Eubanks, 1991):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Working on school paper or yearbook</li>
                            <li>Serving in student government</li>
                            <li>Leadership positions in clubs, bands, church activities</li>
                            <li>Community volunteerism</li>
                            <li>Coaching sports or tutoring in academic areas</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now that you have jotted down everything relevant about yourself, it is time to develop the highlights of your qualifications. This area could also be called the summary of qualifications or just summary. These are immodest one-liners designed to let your prospective employer know that you are qualified and talented and absolutely the best choice for the position. A typical group of highlights might include (Parker, 1989):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relevant experience</li>
                            <li>Formal training and credentials, if relevant</li>
                            <li>Significant accomplishments, very briefly stated</li>
                            <li>One or two outstanding skills or abilities</li>
                            <li>A reference to your values, commitment, or philosophy if appropriate</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A new graduate's highlights could read:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Five years of experience as an LPN in a large nursing home</li>
                            <li>Excellent client/family relationship skills</li>
                            <li>Experience with chronic psychiatric patients</li>
                            <li>Strong teamwork and communication skills</li>
                            <li>Special certification in rehabilitation and reambulation strategies</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Tailor the résumé to the job you are seeking. Include only relevant information, such as internships, summer jobs, intersemester experiences, and volunteer work. Even if your previous experience is not directly related to nursing, your previous work experience can show transferable skills, motivation, and your potential to be a great employee.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of how wonderful you sound on paper, if the paper itself is not presentable your résumé may end up in trashcan. Do let your perspective employer know whether you have an answering machine or fax for leaving messages. A portion of a sample résumé is shown in Figure 14-1.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The most common job search letters are the cover letter, thank-you letter, and acceptance letter. Job search letters should be linked to the SWOT analysis you prepared earlier. Regardless of their specific purpose, letters should follow basic writing principles (Banis, 1994):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>State the purpose of your letter.</li>
                            <li>State the most important items first and support them with facts.</li>
                            <li>Keep the letter organized.</li>
                            <li>Group similar items together in a paragraph, and then organize the paragraphs to flow logically.</li>
                            <li>Business letters are formal, but they can also be personal and warm but professional.</li>
                            <li>Avoid sending the identical "form" letter to everyone. Instead, personalize each letter to fit each individual situation.</li>
                            <li>As you write the letter, keep it work centered and employment centered, not selfcentered.</li>
                            <li>Be direct and brief. Keep your letter to one page.</li>
                            <li>Use the active voice and action verbs with a positive, optimistic tone.</li>
                            <li>If possible, address your letters to a specific individual, using the correct title and business address. Letters addressed to "To Whom It May Concern" do not indicate much research or interest in your prospective employer.</li>
                            <li>A timely (rapid) response demonstrates your knowledge of how to do business.</li>
                            <li>Be honest. Use specific examples and evidence from your experience to support your claims.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
                        <p>You have spent time carefully preparing the résumé that best "sells" you to your prospective employer. What about your cover letter? The cover letter is your introduction. If it is true that first impressions are lasting ones, the cover letter will have a significant impact on your prospective employer. The purposes of the cover letter include (Beatty, 1989):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acting as a transmittal letter for your résumé</li>
                            <li>Presenting you and your credentials to the prospective employer</li>
                            <li>Generating interest in interviewing you</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Regardless of whether your cover letter will first be read by human resources personnel or by the individual nurse manager, the effectiveness of your cover letter cannot be overemphasized. A poor cover letter can eliminate you from the selection process before you even have an opportunity to compete. A sloppy, unorganized cover letter and résumé may suggest that you are sloppy and unorganized at work. A lengthy, wordy cover letter may suggest a verbose, unfocused individual (Beatty, 1991). The cover letter should include the following (Anderson, 1992):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>State your purpose in applying and your interest in a specific position. Identify how you learned about the position.</li>
                            <li>Emphasize your strongest qualifications, those that match the requirements for the position. Provide evidence of experience and accomplishments that relate to the available position and refer to your enclosed résumé.</li>
                            <li>Sell yourself! Convince this employer that you have the qualifications and motivation to perform in this position.</li>
                            <li>Express appreciation to the reader for consideration.</li>
                        </ul>

                                <p>Ms. Joan Smith<br>Human Resources Manager<br>All Care Nursing Center<br>4431 Lakeside Drive<br>Middleton, Indiana 46204</p>
                                <p>Dear Ms. Smith:</p>
                                <p>I am applying for the registered nurse position that was advertised in the Fort Lauderdale News on April 14. The position seems to fit very well with my education, experience, and career interests.</p>
                                <p>Your position requires interest and experience in caring for the elderly and in IV certification. In addition to my clinical experience in the nursing program at Howard Community College, I worked as a certified nursing assistant at St. Mary's Nursing Home 25 hours/week during the 2 years I was enrolled in the Howard Community College nursing program. My responsibilities included assisting the elderly clients with activities of daily living, including special range-of-motion and reambulation exercises. The experience of serving as a team member under the supervision of the registered nurse and physical therapist was invaluable. I am currently enrolled in several continuing education courses at HCC. My enclosed résumé provides more details about my qualifications and education.</p>
                                <p>My background and career goals seem to match your job requirements. I am confident that I can perform the duties of a registered nurse at All Care Nursing Center. I am genuinely interested in pursuing a nursing career in care of the aging. Your agency has an excellent reputation in the community, and your parent company is likewise highly respected.</p>
                                <p>I am requesting a personal interview to discuss the possibilities of employment. I will call you the week of April 21 to request an appointment. Should you need to reach me, please call 123-4567 or email me at dwheatley@bellspot.com. My telephone has an answering machine. I will return your call or email promptly. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to talking with you.</p>
                                <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
                                <p>Delores Wheatley</p>

                        <h3>Thank-You Letter</h3>
                        <p>Thank-you letters are an important but seldom used tool in a job search. You should send a thank-you letter to everyone who has helped in any way in your job search. As stated earlier, promptness is important. Thankyou letters should be sent out within 24 hours to anyone who has interviewed you. The thank-you letter (Banis, 1994, p. 4a) should be used to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Express appreciation</li>
                            <li>Reemphasize your qualifications and the match between your qualifications and the available position</li>
                            <li>Restate your interest in the position</li>
                            <li>Provide any supplemental information not previously stated</li>
                        </ul>

                                <p>Dear Ms. Berrero:</p>
                                <p>Thank you very much for interviewing me yesterday for the registered nurse position at All Care Nursing Center. I enjoyed meeting you and learning more about the role of the registered nurse in longterm care with Jefferson Corporation.</p>
                                <p>My enthusiasm for the position and my interest in working with the elderly are increased as a result of the interview. I feel that my education and experience in long-term care fit with the job requirements. I know that I can make a contribution to the care of the residents and as a nursing team leader over time.</p>
                                <p>I wish to reiterate my strong interest in working with you and your staff. I know that All Care Nursing Center can provide the kind of opportunities I am seeking. Please call me at 123-4567 if I can provide you with any additional information.</p>

                        <h3>Acceptance Letter</h3>
                        <p>Write an acceptance letter to accept an offered position; confirm the terms of employment, such as salary and starting date; and reiterate the employer's decision to hire you. The acceptance letter often follows a telephone conversation in which the terms of employment are discussed. Figure 14-4 is a sample acceptance letter.</p>

                                <p>Dear Ms. Berrero:</p>
                                <p>I am writing to confirm my acceptance of your employment offer of May 1. I am delighted to be joining All Care Nursing Center. I feel confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team, and I appreciate the opportunity you have offered me.</p>
                                <p>As we discussed, I will report to the Personnel Office at 8 a.m. for new employee orientation on May 15. I will have the medical exam, employee, and insurance forms completed when I arrive. I understand that the starting salary will be $23.10/hour with full benefits beginning May 15. Overtime salary in excess of 40 hours/week will be paid if you request overtime hours.</p>
                                <p>I appreciate your confidence in me and look forward to joining your team.</p>

                        <h3>Rejection Letter</h3>
                        <p>Although not as common as the first three job search letters, you should send a rejection letter if you are declining an employment offer. When rejecting an employment offer, indicate that you have given the offer careful consideration but have decided that the position does not fit your career objectives and interests at this time. As with your other letters, thank the employer for his or her consideration and offer. Figure 14-5 is a sample rejection letter.</p>

                                <p>There are many aspects of the position that appeal to me. Jefferson Corporation is an excellent provider of healthcare services throughout this area and nationwide. However, after giving it much thought, I have decided to accept another offer and must therefore decline your offer.</p>
                                <p>Again, thank you for your consideration and the courtesy extended to me. I enjoyed meeting with you and your staff.</p>
                                <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <h3>Using the Internet</h3>
                        <p>It is not uncommon to search the Internet for positions. Numerous sites either post positions or assist potential employees in matching their skills with available employment. More and more corporations are using the Internet to reach wider audiences. If you use the Internet in your search, it is always wise to follow up with a hard copy of your résumé if an address is listed. Mention in your cover letter that you sent your résumé via the Internet and the date you did so. If you are using an Internet-based service, follow up with an email to ensure that your résumé was received.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Initial Interview</h3>
                        <p>Congratulations! Your superb résumé got you (and perhaps 10 others) through the door for an interview. Your first interview may be with the nurse manager, someone in the human resources office, or an interviewer at a job fair or even over the telephone. Regardless of with whom or where you interview, preparation is the key to success.</p>
                        <p>You began the first step in the preparation process with your SWOT analysis. If you did not obtain any of the following information regarding your prospective employer at that time, it is imperative that you do it now:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Key people in the organization</li>
                            <li>Number of clients and employees</li>
                            <li>Types of services provided</li>
                            <li>Reputation in the community</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You also need to review your qualifications for the position. What does your interviewer want to know about you? Consider the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Why should I hire you?</li>
                            <li>What kind of employee will you be?</li>
                            <li>Will you get things done?</li>
                            <li>How much will you cost the company?</li>
                            <li>How long will you stay?</li>
                            <li>What haven't you told us about yourself or your weaknesses?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The exchange of information between you and the interviewer will go more smoothly if you keep the following points in mind when answering questions (Bischof, 1993; Mascolini & Supnick, 1993; Krannich & Krannich, 1993):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be brief. Stop talking when you feel you have said enough.</li>
                            <li>Don't be overly modest, but don't exaggerate.</li>
                            <li>Talk in concrete terms.</li>
                            <li>Be specific. Responses should be in behavioral terms supported by personal experience and specific examples.</li>
                            <li>Do not defend or argue your view.</li>
                            <li>Make connections for the interviewer. Relate your responses to the needs of the individual organization.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Answering Questions</h3>
                        <p>The interviewer may ask background questions, professional questions, and personal questions. If you are especially nervous about interviewing, role-play your interview with a friend or family member acting as the interviewer. Have this person help you evaluate not just what you say, but also how you say it. Voice inflection, eye contact, and friendliness are demonstrations of your enthusiasm for the position (Costlow, 1999).</p>
                        <p>Whatever the questions, know your key points and be able to explain in the interview why the company will be glad they hired you, say, four years from now. Never burn bridges or badmouth the former company before you leave. Personal and professional integrity will follow you from position to position. Many companies count on personal references when hiring, including those of faculty and administrators from your nursing program. When leaving positions you held during school or on graduating from your program, it is wise not to take parting shots at someone. Doing a professional program evaluation is fine, but taking cheap shots at faculty or other employees is unacceptable (Costlow, 1999).</p>
                        <h4>Background Questions</h4>
                        <p>Background questions usually relate to information on your résumé. If you have no nursing experience yet, relate your prior school and work experience and other accomplishments in relevant ways to the position you are seeking without going through your entire autobiography with the interviewer. You may be asked to expand on the information in your résumé about your formal nursing education. Here is your opportunity to relate specific courses or clinical experiences you enjoyed, academic honors, and participation in extracurricular activities or research projects.</p>
                        <h4>Professional Questions</h4>
                        <p>Many recruiters are looking for specifics, especially those related to skills and knowledge needed in the position available. They may start with questions related to your education, career goals, strengths, weaknesses, philosophy of nursing, style, and abilities. Interviewers often open their questioning with words such as "review," "tell me," "explain," and "describe," followed by such phrases as "How did you do it?" or "Why did you do it that way?" (Mascolini & Supnick, 1993). How will you be successful with these types of questions?</p>
                        <p>When answering "what if" questions, it is especially important that you remain specific. Cite your own experiences and relate these behaviors to a demonstrated skill or strength. Examples of questions in this area include the following (Bischof, 1993):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>What is your philosophy of nursing?</strong> This is a frequently asked question, so you may want to think about how you would answer it. Your response should relate to the position you are seeking.</li>
                            <li><strong>What is your greatest weakness? Your greatest strength?</strong> Don't be afraid to present a weakness, but present it to your best advantage, making it sound like a desirable characteristic. Even better, discuss a weakness that is already apparent such as lack of nursing experience, stating that you recognize your lack of nursing experience but that your prior work or management experience has taught you skills that will assist you in this position. These skills might include organization, time management, being part of a team, and communication. If you are asked for both strengths and weaknesses, start with your weakness, and end on a positive note with your strengths. Don't be too modest, but don't exaggerate. Relate your strengths to the prospective position. Skills such as interpersonal relationships, organization, and leadership are usually broad enough to fit most positions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</strong> Most interviewers want to gain insight into your long-term goals, as well as a feel for whether you are likely to use this position as a brief stop on the path to another job. It is helpful for you to have some history regarding the position in question. How long have others usually remained in this position? Your answer should reflect a career plan in tune with the organization's needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>What are your educational goals?</strong> Be honest and specific. Include both professional education such as RN or BSN and continuing education courses. If you want to pursue further education in related areas, such as a foreign language or computers, include this as a goal. Indicate schools to which you have applied or in which you are already enrolled.</li>
                            <li><strong>Describe your leadership style.</strong> Be prepared to discuss your style in terms of how effectively you work with others, and give examples of how you have implemented your leadership in the past.</li>
                            <li><strong>What can you contribute to this position?</strong> Review your SWOT analysis as well as the job description for the position before the interview. Be specific in relating your contributions to the position.</li>
                            <li><strong>What are your salary requirements?</strong> You may be asked about minimum salary range. Try to find out the prospective employer's salary range before this question comes up. Be honest about your expectations, but make it clear that you are willing to negotiate.</li>
                            <li><strong>"What if" questions.</strong> Prospective employers are increasingly using competency-based interview questions to determine people's preparation for a job. There is often no single correct answer to these questions. The interviewer may be assessing your clinical decision-making and leadership skills. Again, be concise, focusing your answer in line with the organizational philosophy and goals. If you do not know the answer, tell the interviewer how you would go about finding the answer. You cannot be expected to have all the answers before you begin a job, but you can be expected to know how to obtain the answers once you are in the position.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Personal Questions</h4>
                        <p>Personal questions deal with your personality and motivation. Common questions include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>How would you describe yourself?</strong> This is a standard question. Most people find it helpful to think about an answer in advance. You can repeat some of what you said in your résumé and cover letter. You do not have to provide an in-depth analysis of your personality. In fact, you should not do this.</li>
                            <li><strong>How would your peers describe you?</strong> Ask them! Again, be brief, describing several strengths. Forget about your weaknesses unless you are asked about them.</li>
                            <li><strong>What would make you happy with this position?</strong> Be prepared to discuss your needs related to your work environment. Do you enjoy self-direction, flexible hours, and strong leadership support? Now is the time to cite specifics related to your ideal work environment.</li>
                            <li><strong>Describe your ideal work environment.</strong> Give this question some thought before the interview. Be specific but realistic. If the norm in your community is two RNs to a floor with LPN and other ancillary support, don't say that you feel a total RN staff is needed for good client care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Describe hobbies, community activities, and recreation.</strong> Again, brevity is important. Many times this question is used to further observe the interviewee's communication and interpersonal skills.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Never pretend to be someone or something other than who or what you are. If doing this is necessary to obtain the position, then the position is not right for you.</p>
                        <h3>Additional Points About the Interview</h3>
                        <p>Federal, state, and local laws govern employment-related questions. Questions asked on the job application and in the interview must be related to the position advertised. Questions or statements that may lead to discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, color, religion, or ethnicity are illegal. If you are asked a question that appears to be illegal, you may wish to take one of several approaches:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You may answer the question, realizing that it is not a job-related question. Make it clear to the interviewer that you will answer the question even though you know it is not job-related.</li>
                            <li>You may refuse to answer. You are within your rights but may be seen as uncooperative or confrontational.</li>
                            <li>Examine the intent of the question and relate it to the job.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Just as important as the verbal exchange of the interview are the nonverbal aspects. These include appearance, handshake, eye contact, posture, and listening skills.</p>
                        <h4>Appearance</h4>
                        <p>Dress in business attire. For women, a skirted suit or tailored jacket dress is appropriate. Men should wear a classic suit, light-colored shirt, and conservative tie. For both men and women, gray or navy is rarely wrong. Shoes should be polished, with appropriate heels. Nails and hair for both men and women should reflect cleanliness, good grooming, and willingness to work. The 2-inch red dagger nails worn on prom night will not support an image of the professional nurse. Paint stains on the hands from a weekend of house maintenance are equally unsuitable for presenting a professional image.</p>
                        <h4>Handshake</h4>
                        <p>Arrive at the interview 10 minutes before your scheduled time (allow yourself a little extra time to find the place if you have not been there before). Introduce yourself courteously to the receptionist. Stand when your name is called, smile, and shake hands firmly. If you perspire easily, wipe your palms just before handshake time.</p>
                        <h4>Eye Contact</h4>
                        <p>During the interview, use the interviewer's title and last name as you speak. Never use the interviewer's first name unless specifically requested to do so. Use good listening skills (all those leadership skills you've just learned). Smile and nod occasionally, making frequent eye contact. Do not fold your arms across your chest, but keep your hands at your sides or in your lap. Pay attention, and sound sure of yourself.</p>
                        <h4>Posture and Listening Skills</h4>
                        <p>Phrase your questions appropriately, and relate them to yourself as a candidate: "What would be my responsibility?" instead of "What are the responsibilities of the job?" Use appropriate grammar and diction. Words like "yeah," "uh-huh," "uh," "you know," or "like" are too casual for an interview.</p>
                        <p>Don't say "I guess" or "I feel" about anything. These words make you sound indecisive and wishy-washy. Remember your action verbs—I analyzed, I organized, I developed. Don't evaluate your achievements as mediocre or unimpressive. (Of course, that walkathon you organized was a huge success!)</p>
                        <h3>Asking Questions</h3>
                        <p>At some point in the interview, you will be asked if you have any questions. Knowing what questions you want to ask is just as important as having prepared answers for the interviewer's questions. The interview is as much a time for you to learn the details of the job as it is for your potential employer to find out about you. You will need to obtain specific information about the job itself, including the type of clients you will be caring for, the people with whom you would be working, the salary and benefits, and your potential employer's expectations of you. Be prepared for the interviewer to say, "Is there anything else I can tell you about the job?" Jot down a few questions on an index card before going for the interview. You may want to ask a few questions based on your research, demonstrating knowledge about and interest in the company. In addition, you may want to ask questions similar to the ones listed next. Above all, be honest and sincere (Bischof, 1993; Bhasin, 1998; Johnson, 1999).</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is this position's key responsibility?</li>
                            <li>What kind of person are you looking for?</li>
                            <li>What are the challenges of the position?</li>
                            <li>Why is this position open?</li>
                            <li>To whom would I report directly?</li>
                            <li>Why did the previous person leave this position?</li>
                            <li>What is the salary for this position?</li>
                            <li>What are the opportunities for advancement?</li>
                            <li>What kind of opportunities are there for continuing education?</li>
                            <li>What are your expectations of me as an employee?</li>
                            <li>How, when, and by whom are evaluations done?</li>
                            <li>What other opportunities for professional growth are available here?</li>
                            <li>How are promotion and advancement handled within the organization?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following are a few additional tips about asking questions during a job interview:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do not begin with questions about vacations, benefits, or sick time. This would leave the impression that these are the most important part of the job to you, not the work itself.</li>
                            <li>Do begin with questions about the employer's expectations of you. This will leave the impression that you want to know how you can contribute to the organization.</li>
                            <li>Be sure you know enough about the position to make a reasonable decision about accepting an offer if one is made.</li>
                            <li>Do ask questions about the organization as a whole. The information is useful to you and demonstrates that you are able to see the big picture.</li>
                            <li>Do bring a list of important points to discuss to help if you are nervous.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>During the interview process, there are a few "red flags" to be alert for (Tyler, 1990):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lots of turnover in the position</li>
                            <li>A newly created position without a clear purpose</li>
                            <li>An organization in transition</li>
                            <li>A position that is not feasible for a new graduate</li>
                            <li>A gut feeling that things are not what they seem</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>After the Interview</h3>
                        <p>If the interviewer does not offer the information, ask about the next step in the process. Thank the interviewer, shake hands, and exit. If the receptionist is still there, you may quickly smile and say thank you and good-bye. Don't linger and chat, and do not forget your follow-up thank-you letter.</p>
                        <h3>The Second Interview</h3>
                        <p>Being invited back for a second interview means that the first interview went well and you made a favorable impression. Second visits may include a tour of the facility and meetings with a higher-level executive or a supervisor in the department in which the job opening exists and perhaps several colleagues. In preparation for the second interview, review the information about the organization and your own strengths. It doesn't hurt to have a few résumés and potential references available. Pointers to make your second visit successful include the following (Muha & Orgiefsky, 1994):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Continue to dress professionally.</li>
                            <li>Be professional and pleasant with everyone, including secretaries and housekeeping and maintenance personnel.</li>
                            <li>Do not smoke.</li>
                            <li>Remember your manners.</li>
                            <li>Avoid controversial topics for small talk.</li>
                            <li>Obtain answers to questions you might have thought of since your first visit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In most instances, the personnel director or nurse manager will let you know how long it will be before you are contacted again. It is appropriate to get this information before you leave the second interview. If you do receive an offer during this visit, graciously say thank you and ask for a little time to consider the offer (even if this is the offer you have anxiously been awaiting).</p>
                        <p>If the organization does not contact you by the expected date, don't panic. It is appropriate to call your contact person and state your continued interest and tactfully express the need to know the status of your application so that you can respond to other deadlines.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">MAKING THE RIGHT CHOICE</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You have interviewed well, and now you have to decide among several job offers. Your choice not only will affect your immediate work but will also influence your future career opportunities. There are several factors to consider.</p>
                        <h3>Job Content</h3>
                        <p>The immediate work you will be doing should be a good match with your skills and interests. Although your work may be personally challenging and satisfying this year, what are the opportunities for growth? How will your desire for continued growth and challenge be satisfied?</p>
                        <h3>Development</h3>
                        <p>You should have learned from your interviews whether the initial training and orientation seem sufficient and well organized. Don't forget to inquire regarding continuing education to keep you current in your field. Is tuition reimbursement available for further education? Is management training provided, or are supervisory skills learned on the job?</p>
                        <h3>Direction</h3>
                        <p>Good supervision and mentors are especially important in your first position. You may be able to judge prospective supervisors throughout the interview process, but you should also try to get a broader view of the overall philosophy of supervision. You may not be working for the same supervisor in a year, but the overall management philosophy is likely to remain consistent.</p>
                        <h3>Work Climate</h3>
                        <p>The day-to-day work climate must make you feel comfortable. Your preference may be formal or casual, structured or unstructured, complex or simple. It is easy to observe the way people dress, the layout of the unit, and lines of communication. It is more difficult to observe company values—factors that will affect your work comfort and satisfaction over the long term. Try to look beyond the work environment to get a feel for values. What is the unwritten message? Is there an open-door policy sending a message that "everyone is equal and important," or does the nurse manager appear too busy to be concerned with the needs of the employees?</p>
                        <h3>Compensation</h3>
                        <p>In evaluating the compensation package, starting salary should be less important than the organization's philosophy on future compensation. What is the potential for salary growth? How are individual increases?</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is often said that finding the first job is the hardest. Many employers prefer to hire seasoned nurses who do not require a long orientation and mentoring. Some require new graduates to do postgraduate internships. Changes in skill mix with the implementation of various types of care delivery influence the market for the professional nurse. The new graduate may need to be armed with a variety of skills such as IV certification, home assessment, advanced rehabilitation skills, and various respiratory modalities to even warrant an initial interview. Keep informed about the demands of the market in your area, and be prepared to be flexible in seeking your first position.</p>
                        <p>Even after all this searching and hard work, you still may not have found the position you want. You may be focusing on work arrangements or benefits rather than on the job description. Your lack of direction may come through in your résumé, cover letter, and personal presentation. You may also have unrealistic expectations for a new graduate or be trying to cut corners, ignoring the basic rules of marketing yourself discussed in this chapter. Go back to your SWOT analysis. Take another look at your résumé and cover letter. Don't be afraid to become more assertive as you start again (Culp, 1999).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Why a section on the "first year"? Don't you just get a nursing license and go to work? Aren't nurses always in demand? You have worked hard to succeed in college—won't those lessons help you to succeed in your new position? Of course they will, but some of the behaviors that were rewarded in school are not rewarded on the job. There are no syllabi, study questions, or extra credit points. Only "A's" are acceptable, and there do not appear to be many completely correct answers. Discovering this has been called "reality shock" (Kramer, 1974), which is discussed elsewhere in this book. Voluminous care plans and meticulous medication cards are out; and multiple responsibilities and thinking on your feet are in. What is the new graduate to do?</p>
                        <p>Your first year will be a transition year. You are no longer a college student, but you are not yet a full-fledged professional. You are the new kid on the block, and people will respond to you differently and judge you differently from when you were a student. To be successful, you have to respond differently. You may be thinking, "Oh, they always need nurses—it doesn't matter." Yes, it does matter. Many of your career opportunities will be influenced by the early impressions you make. The following section addresses what you can do to help ensure first-year success.</p>
                        <h3>Attitude and Expectations</h3>
                        <p>Adopt the right attitudes and adjust your expectations. Now is the time to learn the art of being new. You felt like the most important, special person during the recruitment process. Now, in the real world, neither you nor the position may be as glamorous as you once thought. In addition, although you thought you learned a lot in school, your decisions and daily performance do not always warrant an "A." Above all, people shed the "company manners" that they displayed when you were interviewing, and organizational politics eventually surface. Your leadership skills and commitment to teamwork will get you through this transition period.</p>
                        <h3>Impressions and Relationships</h3>
                        <p>Manage a good impression and build effective relationships. Remember, you are being watched—by peers, subordinates, and superiors. Because you have no track record to fall back on, impressions are magnified. Although every organization is different, most are looking for someone with good judgment, a willingness to learn, a readiness to adapt, and a respect for the expertise of more experienced employees. Most people expect you to "pay your dues" to earn respect from them.</p>
                        <h3>Organizational Savvy</h3>
                        <p>Develop organizational savvy. An important person in this first year is your immediate supervisor. Support this person. Find out what is important to your supervisor and what he or she needs and expects from the team. Become a team player. Present solutions, not problems, as often as you can. You want to be a good leader someday; learn first to be a good follower. Finding a mentor is another important goal of your first year. Mentors are role models and guides who encourage, counsel, teach, and advocate for their mentee. In these relationships, both the mentor and mentee receive support and encouragement (Klein & Dickenson-Hazard, 2000). Mentoring is discussed further in Chapter 16.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The spark that ignites a mentoring relationship may come from either the protégé or the mentor. Protégés often view mentors as fonts of success, a bastion of life skills they wish to learn and emulate. Mentors often see the future that is hidden in another's personality and abilities (Klein & Dickenson-Hazard, pp. 20-21).</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>Skills and Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>Master the skills and knowledge of the position. Technology is constantly changing, and contrary to popular belief, you did not learn everything in school. Be prepared to seek out new knowledge and skills on your own. This may entail extra hours of preparation and study, but who said that learning stopped after graduation (Holton, 1994; Johnson, 1994)?</p>

                        <p>Many of the ideas presented in this chapter will continue to be helpful as you advance in your nursing career. Continuing to develop your leadership and client care skills through practice and further education will be the key to your professional growth. According to a survey by Hospitals and Health Networks (Sherer, 1993), the future looks bright for nursing well into the twenty-first century. Although the delivery of care is expected to continue to move from acute care centers to subacute care centers, long-term care facilities, and the home, the need for the registered nurse to be the care manager and provider of care will continue to advance. "As we move toward the end of the twentieth century, nurses will not just be asked to acclimate to new roles and participate in new movements. They will be encouraged to lead them as well. The benefactors of this newfound leadership will ultimately be patients, better served by nursing's advancement" (Sherer, 1993).</p>

                        <p>Finding your first position is more than being in the right place at the right time. It is a complex combination of learning about yourself and the organizations you are interested in and presenting your strengths and weaknesses in the most positive manner possible. Keeping the first position and using the position to grow and learn are also a planning process. Recognize that the independence and the ability to "do your own thing" that you enjoyed through college may not be the skills you need to keep you in your first position. There is an important lesson to be learned: becoming a team player and being savvy about organizational politics is as important as becoming proficient in nursing skills. Take the first step toward finding a mentor—before you know it you will be one yourself!</p>

                        <p>Paul Delane is interviewing for his first nursing position after obtaining his registered nurse license. He has been interviewed by the nurse recruiter and is now being interviewed by the nurse manager on the pediatric floor. After a few minutes of social conversation, the nurse manager begins to ask some specific nursing-oriented questions: How would you respond if a mother of a seriously ill child asks you if her child will die? What attempts do you make to understand different cultural beliefs and their importance in health care when planning nursing care? How does your philosophy of nursing affect your ability to deliver care to children whose mothers are HIV-positive?</p>
                        <p>Paul is very flustered by these questions and responds with "it depends on the situation," "it depends on the culture," and "I don't ever discriminate."</p>
