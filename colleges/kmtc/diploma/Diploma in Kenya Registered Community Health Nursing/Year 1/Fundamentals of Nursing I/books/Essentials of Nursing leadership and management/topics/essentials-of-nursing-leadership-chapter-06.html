                        <p>Coming onto the unit, Sofia, the evening charge nurse, already knew that a hectic day was in progress. Scattered throughout the unit were clues from the past 8 hours. Two clients on emergency department stretchers were parked outside observation rooms already occupied by clients who had been admitted the previous day in critical condition. Stationed in the middle of the hall was the code cart, with its drawers opened and electrocardiograph paper cascading down its sides. Approaching the nurses' station, Sofia found Daniel buried deep in paperwork. He glanced at her with a face that had exhaustion written all over it. His first words were, Three of your RNs called in sick. I called staffing for additional help, but only one is available. Good luck!"</p>
                        <p>Sofia surveyed the unit, looked at the number of staff members available, and reviewed the client acuity level of the unit. She decided not to let the situation upset her. She would take charge of her own time and reallocate the time of her staff. She began to mentally reorganize her staff and alter the responsibilities of each member. Having taken steps to handle the problem, Sofia felt ready to begin the shift.</p>
                        <p>Business executives, managers, students, and nurses know that time continues to be a valuable resource. Time cannot be saved and used later, so it must be used wisely. As a new nurse, you may at times find yourself sinking in the "quicksand" of a time trap, knowing what needs to be done but just not having the necessary time to do it (Ferrett, 1996). In today's fast-paced healthcare environment, time management skills are critical to a nurse's success. Learning to take charge of your time is the key to time management (Gonzalez, 1996).</p>
                        <p>Many nurses feel as though they never have enough time to accomplish the tasks that need to be completed. Like the White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, they are constantly in a rush against time. Time management is simply organizing and monitoring time so that clientcare tasks can be scheduled and implemented in a timely and organized fashion (Bos & Vaughn, 1998).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>How often do you look at your watch during the day? Do you divide your day into blocks of time? Do you steal a quick glance at the clock when you come home after putting in a full day's work? Do you mentally calculate the amount of time left to complete the day's tasks of grocery shopping, driving in a car pool, making dinner, and leaving again to take a class or attend a meeting? In our society, calendars, clocks, watches, newspapers, television, and radio all remind us of our position in time. Our perception of time is important because it affects our use of time and our response to time (Box 6-1).</p>
                        <p>Computers complete operations in a fraction of a second, and we can measure speeds to the nanosecond. Time clocks that record the minute we enter and leave work are commonplace, and few excuses for being late are really considered acceptable. Timesheets and schedules are part of most healthcare givers' lives. We are expected to follow precisely set schedules and meet deadlines for virtually everything we do, from distributing medications to getting reports done on time. Many agencies produce vast quantities of computergenerated data that can be analyzed to determine the amount of time spent on various activities. It is no wonder some of us seem obsessed with time.</p>
                        <p>Individual personality, culture, and environment all interact to influence our perceptions of time (Matejka & Dunsing, 1988). Each of us has an internal tempo (Chappel, 1970). Some internal tempos are quicker than others. Environment also affects the way we respond to time. A fast-paced environment influences most of us to work at a faster pace, despite our internal tempo. For individuals with a slower tempo, this pace can cause discomfort. If you are a high-achievement-oriented person, you are likely to have already set some career goals for yourself and to have a mental schedule of deadlines for reaching these goals ("go on to complete my BSN in 4 years; an MSN in 6 years").</p>
                        <p>Many healthcare professionals are linear, fast-tempo, achievement-oriented people. Simply working at a fast pace, however, is not necessarily equivalent to achieving a great deal. Much energy can be wasted in rushing around and stirring things up but actually accomplishing very little. The rest of this chapter looks at ways in which you can use your time and energy wisely to accomplish your goals.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">BOX 6-1: TIME PERCEPTION</h4>
                            <p>Webber (1980) has collected a number of interesting tests of people's perception of time. You may want to try several of these:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Do you think of time more as a galloping horseman or a vast motionless ocean?</li>
                                <li>Which of these words best describes time to you: sharp, active, empty, soothing, tense, cold, deep, clear, young, or sad?</li>
                                <li>Is your watch fast or slow? (You can check it with the radio.)</li>
                                <li>Ask a friend to help you with this test. Go into a quiet room without any work, reading material, radio, food, or other distractions. Have your friend call you after 10 to 20 minutes have elapsed. Try to guess how long you were in that room.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Webber test results interpreted.</strong> A person who has a circular concept of time would compare it to a vast, still ocean. A galloping horseman would be characteristic of a linear conception of time, emphasizing speed and motion forward. A fast-tempo, achievement-oriented person would describe time as clear, young, sharp, active, or tense rather than empty, soothing, sad, cold, or deep. These same fast-tempo people are likely to have fast watches and to overestimate the amount of time that they sat in a quiet room (Webber, 1980).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Nurses are the largest group of healthcare professionals. Because of the number of nurses and the shift variations, attention concerning the efficiency and effectiveness of their time management is needed. The effect of rotating shifts has long been a concern in nursing. Nurses who rotate shifts are twice as likely to report medication errors as those who do not rotate. Night-shift staff members and rotating-shift staff members also report getting less sleep, a poorer quality of sleep, greater use of sleep medication, and a problem with nodding off at work or while driving home after work (Sleeping on the job, 1993).</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>A new graduate worked the 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. shift and rotated every third week to the 11 P.M. to 7 a.m. shift in a medical intensive care unit, working 7 days straight before getting 2 days off. It was not difficult to remain awake during the entire shift the first night on duty, but each night thereafter staying awake became increasingly more difficult. After the 2 a.m. vital signs were taken and recorded, the new graduate inevitably fell asleep at the nurses' station. He was so tired that it was necessary to check and recheck client medications and other procedures for fear of making a fatal error. He became so anxious over the possibility of injuring someone that sleep during the day became impossible. Because of his obsession with going over his work, he had difficulty completing tasks and was always behind at the end of the shift (of course, napping didn't help his time management).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A number of studies have examined how nurses use their time, especially nurses in acute-care settings. For example, a study by Arthur Andersen found that only 35 percent of nursing time is spent in direct client care (including care planning, assessment teaching, and technical activities). Documentation accounts for another 20 percent of nursing time. The remainder of time is spent on transporting clients, transaction processing, administrative responsibilities, and hotel services (in Brider, 1992) (Fig. 6-1).</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_25_8d0a0d2b8b6b5731b36fg-93-1.jpg" alt="A sample time log sheet with columns for Date, Time, Activity, and Code, designed to document activities in half-hour intervals throughout a shift." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 6-1 - Time log. (Adapted from Robichaud, A.M. (1986). Time documentation of clinical nurse specialist activities. J Nurs Adm, 16(1), 31-36.)</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Categories may change from study to study, but the amount of time spent on direct client care is usually less than half the workday. As hospitals continue to reengineer, downsize, and cross-train personnel, nurses are finding themselves more involved with tasks that are not client-related, such as quality improvement, developing critical pathways, and so forth. These are added to their already existing client care functions. The result is that in some cases nurses are able to meet only the highest-priority client needs.</p>
                        <p>Any change in the distribution of time spent on various activities can have a considerable impact on client care and on the organization's bottom line. Prescott (1991) offers the following example of this: If more unit management responsibilities could be shifted from nurses to non-nursing personnel, about 48 minutes per nurse shift could be redirected to client care. In a large hospital with 600 fulltime nurses, the result would be an additional 307 hours of direct client care a day. Calculating the results of this timesaving strategy in another way shows an even greater impact: the changes would contribute the equivalent of the work of 48 additional fulltime nurses to direct client care. Many healthcare institutions are considering integrating units with similar patient populations and having them managed by a non-nurse manager, someone with business and management expertise and not necessarily nursing skills. However, as a group, nurses respect managers who have nursing expertise and are able to perform as nurses.</p>

                        <h3>Setting Your Own Goals</h3>
                        <p>It is difficult to decide how to spend your time because there are so many things that need time. A good first step is to take a look at the situation and get an overview. Then ask yourself, "What are my goals?" Goals help clarify what you want and give you energy, direction, and focus. Once you know where you want to go, set priorities. This is not an easy task. Remember Alice's conversation with the Cheshire Cat in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland?</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Would you tell me please, which way I ought to go from here?" asked Alice.</p>
                            <p>"That depends a good deal on where you want to go to," said the Cat.</p>
                            <p>"I don't care where," said Alice.</p>
                            <p>"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>How can you get somewhere if you do not know where you want to go? It is important to explore your personal and career goals. This can help you make decisions about the future. This concept can be applied to day-today activities as well as help in career decisions. Ask yourself questions about what you want to accomplish over a particular time period. Personal development skills include discipline, goal setting, management and organizational skills, self-monitoring, and a positive attitude toward the job (Bos & Vaughn, 1998). Many of the personal management and organizational skills related to the workplace focus on time management and scheduling. Most new nurses have the skills required to perform the job but lack the personal management skills necessary to get the job done, and specifically time management.</p>
                        <p>To help organize your time, you need to set both short- and long-term goals. Short-term goals are those that you wish to accomplish within the near future. Setting up your day in an organized fashion is a short-term goal and so is scheduling a required AIDS course.</p>
                        <p>Long-term goals are those you wish to complete over a long period of time. Advanced education and career goals are examples. A good question to ask yourself is, "What do I see myself doing 5 years from now?" Every choice you make requires a different allocation of time (Moshovitz, 1993).</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Eleanor, a licensed practical nurse returning to school to obtain her associate's degree in nursing, was faced with a multitude of responsibilities. A wife, a mother of two toddlers, and a full-time staff member at a local hospital, Eleanor suddenly found herself in a situation in which there just were not enough hours in a day. She became convinced that becoming a registered nurse was an unobtainable goal. When asked where she wanted to be in 5 years, she answered, At this moment, I think, on an island in Tahiti!"</p>
                            <p>Several of her instructors helped Eleanor develop a time plan. First, she was asked to list what she did each day and how much time each task required. This list included basic childcare, driving children to and from day care, shopping, cooking meals, cleaning, hours spent in the classroom, study hours, work hours, and time devoted to leisure. Once this was established, she was asked which tasks could be allocated to someone else (e.g., her husband), which tasks could be clustered (e.g., cooking for several days at a time), and which tasks could be shared. Eleanor's husband was willing to assist with car pools, grocery shopping, and cleaning. Eleanor had never asked him for help before. Cooking meals was clustered: Eleanor made all the meals in 1 day and then froze and labeled them to be used later. This left time for other activities.</p>
                            <p>Eleanor graduated at the top of her class and has subsequently completed her BSN and become a clinical preceptor for other associate degree students on a pediatric unit in a county hospital. She never did get to Tahiti, though.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Organizing your work can eliminate extra steps or serious delays in completing your work. It can also reduce the amount of time spent doing things that are neither productive nor satisfying. Working on the most difficult tasks when you have the most energy decreases frustration later in the day when you may be more tired and less efficient. To begin managing your time, you need to develop a clearer understanding of how you use your time. Creating a personal time inventory helps you estimate how much time you spend in typical activities. Keeping the inventory for a week gives a fairly accurate estimate of how you spend your time. The inventory also helps identify "time wasters" (Gahar, 2000). To avoid time wasters, take control. It is important to prevent endless activities and other people controlling you. Every day, set priorities to help you meet your goals.</p>

                        <h3>Lists</h3>
                        <p>One of the most useful organizers is the "things to do" list. You can make this list either at the end of every day or at the beginning of each day before you do anything else. Some people say they do it at the end of the day because something always interferes at the beginning of the next day. Do not include routine tasks, because they will make the list too long and you will do them without the extra reminder. If you are a team leader, place the unique tasks of the day on the list: team conference, telephone calls to families, discussion of a new project, or an in-service demonstration on a new piece of equipment. You may also want to arrange these things to do in order of their priority, starting with those that must be done on that day. Ask yourself the following questions regarding the tasks on the list (Moshovitz, 1993):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the relative importance of each of these tasks?</li>
                            <li>How much time will each task require?</li>
                            <li>When must each task be completed?</li>
                            <li>How much time and energy do you have to devote to these tasks?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you find yourself postponing an item for several days, decide whether it should be given top priority the next day or dropped from the list as an unnecessary task.</p>
                        <p>The list itself should be in a user-friendly form: on your electronic organizer, in your pocket, or on a clipboard. Checking the list several times a day quickly becomes a good habit. Computerized calendar-creator programs help in setting priorities and guiding daily activities. These programs can be set to appear on the desktop when you turn on your computer and give an overview of the day, week, or month. This calendar acts as an automated "things to do" list. Your daily things to do list may become your most important time manager. Box 6-2 summarizes ways to determine how to distribute your time.</p>

                        <h3>Tickler Files</h3>
                        <p>Tickler files might be called long-term lists. The basic principle of a tickler file is that you create a system to remind yourself of approaching deadlines and due dates. Today, computerized tickler files can be created by using calendar-creator programs.</p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the semester, students are told the examination dates and when papers will be due. Many students find it helpful to enter the dates on a semester-long calendar so that they can be seen at a glance. Then the students can see when clusters of assignments are due at the same time. This allows for advance planning or perhaps requests to change dates or get extensions.</p>

                        <h3>Schedules and Blocks of Time</h3>
                        <p>Without some type of schedule, you are more likely to drift through a day or bounce from one activity to another in a disorganized fashion. Assignment sheets, worksheets, flow sheets, and critical pathways are all designed to help you plan client care and schedule your time effectively. The critical pathway is a guide to recommended treatments and optimal client outcomes (see Chapter 4). Assignment sheets indicate the clients for whom each staff member is responsible. Worksheets are then created to organize the daily care that must be given to the assigned clients (see Chapters 2 and 4 for examples of worksheets). Flow sheets are lists of items that must be recorded for each client.</p>
                        <p>Effective worksheets and flow sheets schedule and organize the day by providing reminders of various tasks and when they need to be done. The danger in using them, however, is that the more they divide the day into discrete segments, the more they fragment the work and discourage a holistic approach. If a worksheet becomes the focus of attention, the perspective of the whole and of the individuals who are our clients may be lost. Some activities must be done at a certain time. These activities structure the day or week to a great extent, and their timing may be out of your control. However, in every job there are tasks that can be done whenever you want to do them, as long as they are done on time.</p>
                        <p>In certain nursing jobs, reports and presentations are often required. For these activities, you may need to set aside blocks of time during which you can concentrate on the task. Trying to create and complete a report in 5-or 10-minute blocks of time is unrealistic. By the time you reorient yourself to the project, the time allotted is over and nothing has been accomplished. Setting aside large blocks of time to do complex tasks is much more efficient.</p>
                        <p>Consider your energy levels when beginning a big task. Start when levels are high and not at, say, 4:00 in the afternoon if that is when you find yourself winding down. For example, if you are a morning person, plan your demanding work in the morning. If you get energy spurts later in the morning or early afternoon, plan to work on larger or heavier tasks at that time. Nursing shifts may be designed in 8-, 10-, or 12-hour blocks. Many nurses working the night shifts (11 p.m. to 7 a.m., or 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) find they have more energy a little later into their shift rather than at the beginning, whereas nurses working the day shifts (7 a.m. to 3 P.M.; 7 A.M. to 7 p.m.) find they have the most energy at the beginning of their shift. Also, learn to delegate tasks that do not require professional nursing skills.</p>
                        <p>Some people go to work early to have a block of uninterrupted time. Others take work home with them for the same reason. This extends the workday and cuts into leisure time. The higher your stress level, the less effective you will be on the job-so don't bring your work home with you. You need some time off to recharge your batteries (Turkington, 1996).</p>

                        <h3>Filing Systems</h3>
                        <p>Filing systems are helpful to keep track of important papers. Every professional needs to maintain copies of licenses, certifications, and continuing-education credits as well as current information about their specialty area. Keeping these organized in an easily retrievable system saves time and energy when you need to refer to them. Using color-coded folders is often helpful. Each color holds documents that are related to one another. For example, all continuing-education credits might be placed in a blue folder, anything pertaining to licensure in a yellow folder, and so on.</p>

                <section id="setting-limits" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-6">
                    <h2 id="section-heading-6" class="section-heading">

                        <span class="heading-text">SETTING LIMITS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>To set limits, it is necessary first to identify your objectives and arrange the actions needed to meet them in order of their priority (Haynes, 1991). It is also important to stick to these objectives, which can require considerable determination.</p>
                        <h3>Saying No</h3>
                        <p>Saying no to low-priority demands on your time is an important but difficult part of setting limits. Assertiveness and determination are necessary for effective time management. Learn to tactfully say no at least once a day (Hammerschmidt & Meador, 1993).</p>
                        <p>Is it possible to say no to your supervisor or manager? It may not seem so at first, but actually many requests are negotiable. Requests sometimes are in conflict with career goals. Rather than sit on a committee in which you have no interest, respectfully decline and volunteer for one that holds promise for you as well as meets the needs of your unit.</p>
                        <p>Can you refuse an assignment? Your manager may ask you to work overtime or to come in on your scheduled day off, but you can refuse. You may not refuse to care for a group of clients or take a report because you think the assignment is too difficult or unsafe. You may, however, discuss the situation with your supervisor and together work out alternatives. You can also confront the issue of understaffing by filing an unsafe staffing complaint (see Appendix 4). Failure to accept an assignment may result in accusations of abandonment.</p>
                        <p>Some people have difficulty saying no. Ambition keeps some people from declining any opportunity, no matter how overloaded they are. Many individuals are afraid of displeasing others and therefore feel obligated to continuously take on all forms of additional assignments. Still others have such a great need to be needed that they continually give of themselves, not only to clients but also to their coworkers and supervisors. They fail to stop and replenish themselves and become exhausted. Remember, no one can be all things to all people at all times without creating serious guilt, anger, bitterness, and disillusionment. "Anyone who says it's possible has never tried it" (Turkington, 1996, p. 9).</p>
                        <h3>Eliminating Unnecessary Work</h3>
                        <p>Some work has become so deeply embedded in our routines that it appears essential, although it is really unnecessary. Some nursing routines fall into this category. Taking vital signs, baths, linen changes, dressing changes, irrigations, and similar basic tasks are more often done according to schedule rather than according to client need, which may be much more or much less often than the routine specifies. Some of these tasks may be appropriately delegated to others.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If clients are ambulatory, bed linens may not need to be changed daily. Incontinent and diaphoretic clients need to have fresh linens more frequently. Not all clients need a complete bed bath every day. Elderly clients have dry, fragile skin; giving them good mouth, facial, and perineal care may be all that is required on certain days. This should be included in the client's care plan.</li>
                            <li>Much paperwork is duplicative, and some is altogether unnecessary. For example, is it necessary to chart nursing interventions in two or three places on the client record? The use of charting by exception, flow sheets, and computerized records are attempts to eliminate some of these problems.</li>
                            <li>Socialization in the workplace is an important aspect in maintaining interpersonal relationships. When there is a social component to interactions in a group, the result is usually positive. However, too much socialization can reduce productivity in the workplace, so judgment must be used in deciding when socializing is interfering with work.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You may create additional work for yourself without realizing it. How often do you walk back down the hall to obtain equipment when it all could have been gathered at one time? How many times do you walk to a client's room instead of using the intercom, only to find that you need to go back to where you were to get what the client needs? Is the staff providing personal care to clients who are well enough to meet some of these needs themselves?</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Many tasks cannot be eliminated or delegated, but they can be done more efficiently. There are many sayings in time management that reflect the principle of streamlining work. "Work smarter, not harder" is a favorite one that should appeal to nurses facing increasing demands on time. "Never handle a piece of paper more than once" is a more specific one, reflecting the need to avoid procrastination in your work. "A stitch in time saves nine" reflects the degree to which preventive action saves time in the long run.</p>
                        <p>Several methods of working smarter and not harder are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gathering materials, such as bed linens, for all of your clients at one time. As you go to each room, leave the linen so that it will be there when you need it.</li>
                            <li>While giving a bed bath or providing other personal care, perform some of the aspects of the physical assessment, such as taking vital signs, skin assessment, and parts of the neurological and musculoskeletal assessment. Prevention is always a good idea.</li>
                            <li>If a client does not "look right," do not ignore your instincts. The client is probably having a problem.</li>
                            <li>If you are not sure about a treatment or medication, ask before you proceed. It is usually less time-consuming to prevent a problem than it is to resolve one.</li>
                            <li>When you set aside time to do a specific task that has a high priority, stick to your schedule and complete it.</li>
                            <li>Do not allow interruptions while you are completing paperwork, such as transcribing orders.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What else can you do to streamline your work? A few general suggestions follow, but the first one, a time log, can assist you in developing others unique to your particular job. If you complete the log correctly, a few surprises about how you really spend your time are almost guaranteed.</p>
                        <h3>Keeping a Time Log</h3>
                        <p>Our perception of time is elastic. People do not accurately estimate the time they spend on any particular task, so we cannot rely on our memories for accurate information about how we spend our time. The time log is an objective source of information. Most people spend a much smaller amount of their time on productive activities than they estimate. Once you see how large amounts of your time are spent, you will be able to eliminate or reduce the time spent on nonproductive or minimally productive activities (Drucker, 1967; Robichaud, 1986). For example, many nurses spend a great deal of time searching for or waiting for missing medications, equipment, or supplies. Before beginning client care, assemble all the equipment and supplies you will need, and check the client's medication drawer against the medication administration record so that you can order anything that is missing before you begin.</p>
                        <h3>Reducing Interruptions</h3>
                        <p>Everyone experiences interruptions. Some of these are welcome and necessary, but too many interfere with your work. Interruptions must be kept to a minimum or eliminated if possible. Closing the door to a client's room may reduce interruptions. You may have to ask visitors to wait a few minutes before you can answer their questions, although you must remain sensitive to their needs and return to them as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing wrong with asking a colleague who wants your assistance to wait a few minutes if you are engaged in another activity. Interruptions that occur when you are trying to pour medications or make calculations can cause errors. Physicians and other professionals often request nursing attention when nurses are involved with client care tasks. Find out if a nonlicensed person may be of assistance. If not, ask the physician to wait, stating that you will be more than glad to help as soon as you complete what you are doing. Be courteous, but be firm; you are busy also.</p>
                        <h3>Categorizing Activities</h3>
                        <p>Clustering certain activities helps eliminate the feeling of bouncing from one unrelated task to another. It also makes your caregiving more holistic. You may, for example, find that documentation takes less time if you do it while you are still with the client or immediately after seeing a client. The information is still fresh in your mind, and you do not have to rely on notes or recall. Many healthcare institutions have switched to computerized charting, with the computers placed at the bedside. This set-up assists in documenting care and interventions while the nurse is still with the client. Also, try to follow a task through to completion before beginning another.</p>
                        <h3>Finding the Fastest Way</h3>
                        <p>Many time-consuming tasks can be made more efficient through the use of automation. Narcotic delivery systems that deliver the correct dose and electronically record the dose, the name of the client, and the name of the healthcare personnel removing the medication are being used in many institutions. This system saves staff time in documentation and in performing a narcotic count at the end of each shift (Meyer, 1992).</p>
                        <p>Efficient systems do not have to be complex. Using a preprinted color-coded sticker system helps to identify clients who must be without food or fluids (NPO) for tests or surgery, those who require 24-hour urine collections, or those who are having special cultures done. The information need not be written or entered repeatedly if stickers are used.</p>
                        <h3>Automating Repetitive Tasks</h3>
                        <p>Developing techniques for repetitive tasks is similar to finding the fastest method, but it focuses on specific tasks that are repeated again and again, such as client teaching.</p>
                        <p>Many clients come to the hospital or ambulatory center for surgery or invasive diagnostic tests for same-day treatment. This does not give nurses much teaching time. Using videotapes and pamphlets as teaching aids can reduce the time needed to share the information, allowing the nurse to be available to answer individual questions and create individual adaptations. Many facilities are using these techniques for cardiac rehabilitation, preoperative teaching, and infant-care instruction.</p>

                        <p>Time can be our best friend or our worst enemy, depending on our perspective and how we manage it. It is important to identify how you feel about time and to assess your own time management skills. Nursing requires that we perform numerous activities within what often seems to be a very short period of time. Knowing this can create stress. Learn to delegate. Learn to say, "I would really like to help you; can it wait until I finish this?" Learn to say no. Most of all, learn how to make the most of your day. Finally, remember that 8 hours should be designated as sleep time and several more as personal or leisure ("time off") time.</p>

                        <p>Antonio was recently hired as a team leader for a busy cardiac step-down unit. Nursing responsibilities of the team leader, in addition to client care, include meeting daily with team members, reviewing all admissions and discharges for acuity and length of stay, and documentation of all clients who exceeded length of stay and the reasons. At the end of each month, the team leaders are required to meet with unit managers to review the client care load and team member performance. This is the last week of the month, and Antonio has a meeting with the unit manager at the end of the week. He is 2 weeks behind on staff evaluations and documentation of clients who exceeded length of stay. He is becoming very stressed over his team leader responsibilities.</p>
