                        <p>"All the results of good nursing, as detailed in these notes, may be spoiled or utterly negated by one defect, viz.: in petty management, or in other words, by not knowing how to manage. . . . How few men, or even women, understand, either in great or in little things, . . . know how to carry out a 'charge.' To be 'in charge' is certainly not only to carry out the proper measure yourself but to see that every one else does so too; to see that no one either willfully or ignorantly thwarts or prevents such measures. It is neither to do everything yourself nor to appoint a number of people to each duty, but to ensure that each does that duty to which he is appointed" (Nightingale, 1859, pp. 20, 24).</p>
                        <p>Although Florence Nightingale wrote these words in the 1800s, they are still true today. Major changes in our healthcare system are occurring as administrators in all types of agencies try to find the correct balance between "lean and mean" efficiency and high-quality care (Sharp, 1994, p. 32). These efforts affect the way nursing care is delivered. The search for ways to provide safe, effective health care without spending too much money has led to the creation of new models for managing nursing care.</p>
                        <p>This chapter will assist you in understanding and developing your role in the management of client care. The chapter begins by considering the economic context in which health care is provided. A review of the past, present, and future models for managing nursing care is presented next. This includes the traditional models of total care, primary care, functional care, and team care. The contemporary use of case management, the multidisciplinary team approach, product line management, and differentiated practice complete this section. This is followed by a discussion of the ways in which the quality of the care given is monitored and evaluated.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In the past, the centerpiece of our healthcare system was the hospital. However, with the movement to shorten the length of hospital stay to save money, attention has turned to providing care in the home and in community-based health centers. For many years, decisions about care were based primarily on providing the best-quality care, whatever the cost. As the economic support for health care is challenged, however, healthcare providers are pressured to seek methods of care delivery that achieve quality outcomes at lower cost.</p>
                        <p>More changes in the way health care is delivered and paid for are anticipated. Lean, flexible, highly productive workforces, better management of clients identified as high risk or high utilization, and satisfied consumers will be the key to healthcare success in the future. The associate degree nurse will assume a significant role in providing direct client care now and in the future (Curtin, 1994; AONE, 1994).</p>
                        <p>Porter O'Grady (1999) has identified five specific forces driving the changes in health care:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The deinstitutionalization of health care.</strong> Instead of the client coming to the hospital building for a variety of services, health care has moved into smaller, communitybased units of services, providing greater accessibility to the population. The future will provide higher levels of technology, faster patient turnover, and continued reduced lengths of stay.</li>
                            <li><strong>Population-specific healthcare services.</strong> Instead of organizing health care around diagnoses, services will be organized around specific populations. The better the match between service areas and population needs, the more cost effective the service will become. Women's health centers, rehabilitation services, and behavioral health units are examples of populationspecific services currently being offered.</li>
                            <li><strong>The integration of all healthcare services.</strong> Consolidation of services and reorganization of departments are not new to health care. Over the past decade, much experimentation with new models of service delivery has occurred. Some models have been successful, and others have been dismal failures. "Nurses will continue to find themselves moved, shifted, consolidated, linked, and integrated as well as reduced, laid off, and restaffed in ways that challenge the conditions they are accustomed to" (Porter O'Grady, 1999, p. 26).</li>
                            <li><strong>Subscriber-based payment models.</strong> The fee-for-service payment system has been replaced by a variety of prepayment, discounted, and packaged health care service systems. With these packages comes the change in focus from just treating illness to maintaining health. As the number of models increase, the function of the nurse will change. The nurse will no longer be able to perform any clinical activity without consideration of a cost, outcome, and direct impact on the client's health.</li>
                            <li><strong>The impact of information technology.</strong> The information infrastructure is the glue holding all these pieces together. Linking financial, clinical, and demographic information to provide outcome information is invaluable in today's healthcare setting. As the Internet continues to expand, how clients and providers relate to each other will continue to grow and develop. Timelessness, seamlessness, and flexibility will become the buzzwords of health care in the future.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The real challenge for every nurse will be the willingness to acknowledge the demand for change and the courage to ask specific questions related to its application and implication for clinical practice (Porter O'Grady, 1999, p. 28).</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">TRADITIONAL MODELS OF CARE DELIVERY</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Most of us have heard the phrase "what goes around comes around." The traditional models of care delivery were replaced in the late 1990s with the more contemporary models discussed in the next section. The acute nursing shortage expected for the twenty-first century is causing health care agencies to reevaluate the implementation of the traditional models.</p>
                        <h3>Total Care</h3>
                        <p>The total care, or case, method was one of the earliest models of nursing care delivery. One nurse assumes total responsibility for the planning and delivery of care to a particular client or group of clients. This method may be used today in community health nursing, in private duty, in intensive care and isolation units, and in making assignments for students in nursing school. The client may have different nurses within a 24-hour period, but each nurse provides all of the care needed for the time period assigned. The case method is considered a precursor of primary nursing. Although the method has the advantage of being extremely client focused, it is not considered the most efficient use of staff and is not used in the majority of healthcare settings today.</p>
                        <h3>Functional</h3>
                        <p>The functional method of care delivery grew out of the 1950s emphasis on an assemblyline style of management that focuses on division of labor specifics and tasks that need to be completed. The nurse manager is responsible for making work assignments. Roles such as those of the medication nurse and treatment nurse are part of the functional delivery approach. Job descriptions, procedures, policies, and lines of communication are clearly defined. The functional model is generally considered efficient, economical, and productive. The disadvantage is that this model leads to fragmentation of care because the client receives care from several different types of nursing personnel. In addition, the emotional needs of both the staff members and the client are overlooked in the interest of time management and task completion (Loveridge & Cummings, 1996).</p>
                        <h3>Team</h3>
                        <p>In the later 1950s and in the 1960s, the emphasis moved from a task focus to group dynamics and promotion of job satisfaction. In response to the fragmentation of the functional method and the continued scarcity of registered nurses after World War II, the team method was developed. Each team consists of a mix of staff members, such as a registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse, and a nursing assistant. The team is responsible for providing care to a group of assigned clients during the shift. The team leader, usually the registered nurse, is responsible for making assignments for the team based on the team members' abilities and the needs of the clients. Compared to the functional method, the team method emphasizes holistic care and increases client and employee satisfaction. The team method is a time-consuming, expensive delivery system and may cause undue workload stress for the team leader (Loveridge & Cummings, 1996).</p>
                        <h3>Primary Care</h3>
                        <p>Primary nursing became popular in the 1960s and 1970s as nurses voiced concern over the fragmentation of care provided to their clients. In this model, a registered nurse is assigned care of a client for 24 hours a day for the client's entire hospital stay, including discharge planning. This registered nurse is responsible for developing the care plan and managing the associate nurses and other staff members who provide additional care for the client. Primary nursing decreases the number of persons who have contact with each client and usually increases accountability and client satisfaction. However, primary nursing severely limits the number of clients each nurse can serve and can place the client in jeopardy if the primary nurse is not capable of meeting the client's needs (Loveridge & Cummings, 1996).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As healthcare administrators search for the model of care delivery that will ensure quality, promote client and staff satisfaction, and contain costs, the R words appear: restructuring and redesign. Among the newer (or reemerging) models are case management, clientfocused care with cross-training, product line management, and differentiated practice.</p>
                        <h3>Case Management</h3>
                        <p>The term case management is used to describe a variety of healthcare delivery systems in acute, long-term, and community settings. Case management is not a new concept. Public health programs have used case management to provide care since the early 1900s. When mental health services moved out of institutions into the community in the 1960s, case management programs became important to psychiatric-mental health nursing as well (Lyon, 1993).</p>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association (ANA) defines case management as "provision of quality care along a continuum, decreased fragmentation of care across many settings, enhancement of the quality of life, and cost containment" (ANA, 1988). The process of case management is easily placed within the framework of the nursing process (Table 5-1).</p>

                        <p>According to Newell (1996), the primary functions of case managers include:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Negotiation services and/or treatments.</strong> Obtaining maximum-quality services at an acceptable cost (e.g., negotiate registered nurse hourly rates for home care services, obtain prices for equipment such as a wheelchair).</li>
                            <li><strong>Communication.</strong> Communicating with service providers, clients, families, and information systems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coordination of care.</strong> Overseeing services and resources to avoid duplication and breakdowns in quality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinical expertise.</strong> Technical knowledge of disease processes and interventions to assess, plan, and evaluate client services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Holistic approach.</strong> The ability to understand human beings’ biologic, social, and behavioral needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethics have caring.</strong> A focus on advocacy, honesty, and understanding in dealing with clients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coaching.</strong> An important skill that affects all of the preceding functions, allowing the case manager to be successful in working with clients, families, staff, and physicians.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nursing care management is designed to decrease fragmentation of care, use of hospitalization, and cost through better coordination and monitoring of client care. Effective nursing case management can improve the quality of services, the quality of life for clients, and the functioning of the interdisciplinary team.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Case management systems must act like human beings that are well functioning: they are focused on the task at hand, interact without duplicity, they learn and respond to new situations and information, they are honest and forthright in communicating with all parties. Well-functioning case managers and case management systems may not always do everything right, but they should strive to do the right thing, thus affecting others in the system to also act with integrity. (Newell, 1996)</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Nursing care management is a system for delivering nursing care that is based on the philosophy of case management. The goals of nursing care management are as follows (Girard, 1994):</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Outcomes based on standards of care.</strong> Evaluation of the quality of nursing practice is based on desired measurable outcomes and accepted practices of the nursing profession.</li>
                            <li><strong>Well-coordinated continuity of care through collaborative practice.</strong> All providers of services work together to plan services and meet client needs. Effective collaboration requires that providers also work together to meet each other's needs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Efficient use of resources to reduce wasted time, energy, and materials.</strong> Continued monitoring of material and personnel resources can eliminate duplication of steps and services, resulting in increased efficiency and job satisfaction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Timely discharge within prospective payment guidelines.</strong> The grouping of medical conditions into categories that have allowable lengths of stay and payment schedules designated by Medicare has been in effect since the 1980s. Enabling clients to be discharged safely within the designated length of stay is an ongoing challenge for the nursing care manager.</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional development and satisfaction.</strong> Through coordination of services and collaboration with providers, family, and clients, use of the case management model can enhance clients' quality of life (Christensen & Bender, 1994).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Although many different healthcare personnel claim to have in-depth knowledge of client and family care needs, understanding of organizational and financial services, and community resources, the registered nurse is ideally suited to serve as care manager. Nursing has traditionally considered the client from a total-systems perspective of person, environment, and health with a focus on the multidisciplinary efforts needed to optimize care for the individual. Nurses, accustomed to focusing on a holistic approach to nursing care, are best able to use a whole-system approach to care delivery rather than a partsoriented approach (Newell, 1996).</p>
                        <p>The case management system of care assists clients in learning to cope with the challenges of their illness. Case management services can be delivered in a variety of settings. External case management involves activities that are external to provider organizations. For example, case managers may work with victims of catastrophic motor vehicle accidents, workers' compensation cases, major medical insurance cases, and individual clients with complex chronic conditions. Internal case managers provide services "within the walls" of institutions or provider organizations. Internal case managers work in acute care, subacute care, rehabilitation, long-term care, home care, and managed-care organizations (Newell, 1996).</p>

                             <h4>Case Management Example</h4>
                            <p>Maria is a 71-year-old Salvadoran-American woman with a history of childhood rheumatic heart disease. She has given birth to four children, the last one when Maria was 41. During that pregnancy, she spent the last trimester on bed rest. She continued to complain of fatigue, shortness of breath, and swelling in her feet and ankles after her last child was born. Four years later, she had a mitral commissurotomy to open the calcified mitral valve.</p>
                            <p>Since then, she has complained of the same symptoms. She has been unable to walk up the flight of stairs in her two-story home. Maria and her husband depend on his small pension and social security for their living expenses. Their home is paid for, and the children are always "sending gifts," but money is limited. The couple joined a Medicare HMO (health maintenance organization) to cover the cost of drugs and to avoid having to carry a supplemental policy to augment traditional Medicare coverage.</p>
                            <p>As Maria's condition deteriorated, she experienced liver enlargement, sleep apnea, and petechiae on her face. She was very depressed regarding her continued illness. The HMO physician tried to talk Maria into a mitral valve replacement. She stated emphatically, "I will never go through what I did when I had that surgery, so don't even mention it!" The physician asked the nurse case manager to see Maria. The nurse case manager met with Maria and her husband in their home. She observed that, although the house appeared clean, Maria complained that she is unable to keep house like she used to and feels useless as a wife and mother. The case manager helped Maria and her husband evaluate their options for treatment of Maria's illness. She made several visits to their home and, after forming a positive relationship with them, began to discuss the potential benefits of surgery and the possibility of improving Maria's quality of life. Maria finally consented to having a cardiac catheterization, which showed that both the mitral and tricuspid valves were leaking. She agreed to surgery, which was successful. The case manager continues to call Maria on a monthly basis to monitor her progress. Maria said recently, "I owe my new life to my wonderful nurse."</p>

                        <h3>Client-Focused Care</h3>
                        <p>In the client-focused care model, services and staff are organized around client needs, rather than the other way around. Traditionally, hospitals have been organized by departments to which the client is brought for services. In the client-focused care model, the services are brought to the client (Greenberg, 1994). Clients with similar needs are placed on the same nursing units, with ancillary and support services present on the unit.</p>
                        <p>The traditional boundaries between disciplines are blurred. Although licensed members of the team retain their professional expertise and function within state and national practice acts and accrediting agency requirements, members of the team share all nonregulated tasks. Members of disciplines such as nursing, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy are unit based. They receive additional training so that they can provide services across disciplinary lines. Their combined functions may range from clinical to managerial responsibilities and may be of higher, lower, or parallel levels when compared to their original functions. In addition, new allpurpose "client care technicians" or "unlicensed assistive personnel" roles are usually created. These new workers perform tasks such as meal delivery, cleaning and maintenance of rooms, and assisting clients with comfort needs. Under the supervision of licensed personnel, patient care technicians may also perform skilled tasks that are not restricted by various practice acts, such as insertion of indwelling urinary catheters or simple dressing changes (Flarey, 1995; Christensen & Bender, 1994).</p>
                        <p>Response to this new model of care delivery has been mixed. Some nursing administrators say that staff dissatisfaction and stress have increased, whereas others report favorable client experiences and staff satisfaction (Christensen & Bender, 1994). Since its inception in 1989, the use of the client-focused care model has increased, but the need for further research on its effectiveness continues (Clouten & Weber, 1994). The following is a client-focused care example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                             <h4>Client-Focused Care Example</h4>
                            <p>Esperanza has been the nurse manager on a 50-bed medical-surgical unit for 5 years. Since the advent of the prospective payment system, the reimbursement for care has been limited. Patients come in sicker and go home more quickly. Esperanza just left a management meeting in which the CEO informed them that nursing costs make up over half of the hospital's total budget. To cut costs and maximize effectiveness, the nurse managers must decrease the number of nurses on each shift, making sure that registered nurses do only those tasks that require a registered nurse. A consultant will be brought in to implement a new system called client-focused care.</p>
                            <p>Each unit formed a committee of management, staff nurses, and nursing assistants to meet with the consultant. In addition, representatives of other services, such as rehabilitation services, respiratory care, pharmacy, and housekeeping, were included. The consultant made clear that the decisions made would be what worked for this organization, and not a blueprint from another organization.</p>
                            <p>The committees met weekly. Specific indirect and direct client care activities that could be delegated to nonlicensed personnel in accordance with the state Nurse Practice Act were identified. It was decided that there would be two levels of clinical assistants. Job descriptions and work standards were developed for each level. Training workshops were developed, and a skill competency workshop was required for all new personnel. The hospital worked in conjunction with the local community college to offer certificates for the two clinical assistant levels. By the end of the program, 9.6 full-time registered nurse positions were converted into 15.6 clinical assistant positions. The hospital predicted savings in recruitment, orientation, and training costs as well as increased job satisfaction for all participants. Esperanza felt that "only time will tell if the program works for both the staff and the clients."</p>

                        <h3>Product Line Management</h3>
                        <p>Product line management is used in business to create a center to plan, manage, and market a specific product within the larger company. In healthcare delivery, use of this system results in a new organizational structure in which components of various clinical services or departments are merged to create a distinct "product line," such as drug abuse treatment, women's health care, or pediatric care. For example, the orthopedic product line would include nursing care, therapies, technician services, orthotic and prosthetic devices, and educational programs. In this type of delivery system, a product line manager directs these operations. Unlike traditional systems in which the registered nurse was the manager, the product line manager may be a member of a discipline other than nursing. In some instances, the manager may not even have a related healthcare background (Christensen & Bender, 1994, p. 68).</p>
                        <p>The non-nurse manager may have a great deal of business and financial background and makes purely business decisions regarding client care. Unfortunately, the non-nurse manager may have difficulty focusing on client and family needs that are incongruent with business decisions.</p>
                        <h3>Differentiated Practice</h3>
                        <p>Differentiated practice is the structuring of nursing roles and functions based on the individual's education, experience, and competence. For example, a nurse with an associate degree would care for clients in the hospital setting under the supervision of a nurse manager, whereas the nurse with a baccalaureate degree would plan the client's care in the home. As health care continues to evolve, the need to provide nurses with differentiated scopes of nursing practice is even greater (AONE, 1994).</p>
                        <p>Informally, differentiated practice among registered nurses exists in almost every setting. It occurs each time a nurse manager plans staff assignments according to the knowledge, competence, and licensure of the staff members involved, for example. Other members of the healthcare team and even clients develop a "sixth sense" about the abilities of the nurses with whom they interact (McClure, 1991).</p>
                        <p>The controversy over registered nurse licensure has raged within the profession since 1965, when the American Nurses Association endorsed the concept of two levels of educational preparation and licensure. Thirty years later, the organization is still fighting the idea that "a nurse is a nurse is a nurse." Regardless of educational preparation or background, nurses are often used interchangeably in the workplace. The result is that they are not used in a cost-effective manner, and many are not challenged to reach their full potential.</p>
                        <p>The rationale for implementing differentiated nursing practice is both professional and economic. Professionally, differentiated practice for the registered nurse may lead to increased satisfaction and improved client care. Used effectively, differentiated practice models also ensure efficient use of nursing resources (Vena & Oldaker, 1994; Koerner et al., 1995; Ray & Hardin, 1995; Allender, Egan, & Newman, 1995).</p>
                        <p>Several models of differentiated practice have been developed. The following is one such model (AONE, 1994) (see Table 5-1):</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Associate degree nurse.</strong> The associate nurse is responsible for the shift of service, with a strong emphasis on meeting the physiological and comfort needs of the client assigned by the primary nurse. The associate nurse role is to implement nursing care plans developed by the nurse clinician and primary nurse.</li>
                            <li><strong>Baccalaureate degree nurse or primary nurse.</strong> The primary nurse's responsibility extends from admission to discharge, focusing on coordination of medical and nursing orders, client education, and a well-planned, timely discharge. The primary nurse must be able to match client needs with staff abilities using an interdisciplinary team approach.</li>
                            <li><strong>Master's degree nurse.</strong> This advanced practice role may include the advanced registered nurse practitioner (ARNP), advanced practice nurse (APN), and certified nurse midwife (CNM). The advanced practice nurse assumes the role of case manager and client advocate. The role of the advanced nurse practitioner extends beyond the acute care setting into multiple healthcare arenas.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As you can see, various healthcare delivery models have surfaced in an attempt to streamline processes, reduce costs of health care, and ensure quality service. Whether an institution uses a traditional model of care delivery or moves to one of the more contemporary models discussed, most agencies have implemented tools for tracking outcomes. These tools are called structured care methodologies (SCMs) and include guidelines, critical pathways, algorithms, protocols, standards of care, and order sets.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Guidelines.</strong> Guidelines first appeared in the 1980s as statements to assist healthcare providers and clients in making appropriate healthcare decisions. Guidelines are based on current research guidelines and are often developed by experts in the field. The use of guidelines is seen as a way to decrease variations in practice.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protocols.</strong> Protocols are specific, formal documents that outline how a procedure or intervention should be conducted. Protocols have been used for many years in research and specialty areas but have moved into the general healthcare arena as a way to standardized approaches to achieve desired outcomes. An example seen in many facilities today is chest pain protocols.</li>
                            <li><strong>Algorithms.</strong> Algorithms are systematic procedures that follow a logical progression based on additional information or client responses to treatment. They were originally developed in the mathematics area and are frequently seen in emergency medical services. Advanced cardiac life support algorithms are now widely used in healthcare agencies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Standards of care.</strong> Standards of care are often discipline related and help to operationalize patient care processes and provide a baseline for quality care. Lawyers often refer to the discipline's standards of care in evaluating whether a client has received appropriate services.</li>
                            <li><strong>Critical (or clinical) pathways.</strong> Critical pathways were first used in manufacturing during the late 1950s and appeared in health care in the 1980s. A critical pathway is a "multidisciplinary map" that outlines the expected course of treatment for clients with similar diagnoses. This standardized "map" is designed to describe the course of events that lead to successful client outcome within the diagnosis-related group (DRG)-defined time frame. For the client with an uncomplicated myocardial infarction (MI), a proposed course of events leading to successful client outcomes within the 4-day DRG-defined time frame might be as follows (Doenges, Moorhouse, & Geissler, 1997):
                                <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                    <li>State that chest pain is relieved.</li>
                                    <li>Have resolution of ST and T wave changes and a pulse oximeter reading of greater than 90%; have clear breath sounds.</li>
                                    <li>Ambulate in the hall without experiencing extreme fatigue or chest pain.</li>
                                    <li>Verbalize feelings about having an MI and future fears; identify effective coping strategies.</li>
                                    <li>Ventricular dysfunction, dysrhythmia, or crackles.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Critical pathways are clinical protocols involving all disciplines. They are designed for tracking a planned clinical course for clients based on average and expected lengths of stay. Financial outcomes can be evaluated from critical pathways by assessing any variances from the proposed length of stay. The agency can then focus on problems within the system that extend the length of stay or drive up costs because of overutilization or repetition of services.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Mr. J. was admitted to the telemetry unit with a diagnosis of MI. He had no previous history of heart disease and no other complicating factors such as diabetes, hypertension, or elevated cholesterol levels. His DRG prescribed length of stay was 4 days. He had an uneventful hospitalization for the first 2 days. On the third day, he complained of pain in the left calf. The calf was slightly reddened and warm to the touch. This condition was diagnosed as thrombophlebitis, which increased his length of hospitalization. A review of the events leading up to the complaints of calf pain by the case manager indicated that, although the physician ordered compression stockings for Mr. J., they never arrived and no one followed through on the order. The variances related to his proposed length of stay were discussed with the team providing care, and measures were instituted to make sure that this oversight did not occur again.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Critical pathways provide a framework for communication and documentation of care. They are also excellent teaching tools through which staff members from various disciplines can learn about the expected care of given client populations and an institution's practice patterns. Critical pathways can be used by an institution to evaluate the cost of care for different client populations (Capuano, 1995; Crummer & Carter, 1993; Lynam, 1994; Flarey, 1995).</p>
                        <p>Most institutions have adopted a chronological, diagrammatic format for presenting a critical pathway. Time frames may range from daily (day 1, day 2, day 3) to hourly, depending on client needs. Key elements of the critical pathway include discharge planning, patient education, consultations, activities, nutrition, medications, diagnostic tests, and treatment (Crummer & Carter, 1993). Table 5-2 is an example of a critical pathway. Although originally developed for use in acute care institutions, critical pathways can be developed for home care and long-term care settings as well.</p>
                        <p>The client's nurse is usually responsible for monitoring and recording any deviations from the critical pathway. When deviations occur, the reasons are discussed with all members of the healthcare team, and the appropriate changes in care are made. The nurse must also identify general trends in client outcomes and develop plans to improve the quality of care to reduce the number of deviations in critical pathways. Through this close monitoring, the healthcare team can avoid last-minute surprises that may delay client discharge and can more effectively predict lengths of stay.</p>
                        <p>SCMs may be used alone or together. A client who is admitted for a myocardial infarction may have care planned using a critical pathway for his acute MI, a heparin protocol, and a dysrhythmia algorithm. In addition, the nurses may refer to the standards of care in developing a traditional nursing care plan.</p>
                        <p>SCMs can improve physiologic, psychological, and financial outcomes. Services and interventions are sequenced to provide safe and effective outcomes in a designated time period and with most effective use of resources. They also give an interdisciplinary perspective that is not found in the traditional nursing care plan. Computer programs allow healthcare personnel to track variances (differences from the identified standard) and use these variances in planning quality-improvement activities.</p>
                        <p>The use of structured care methodologies does not take the place of the expert clinical judgment of the registered nurse. The fundamental purpose of the SCM is to assist healthcare providers in implementing practices identified with good clinical judgment, research-based interventions, and improved client outcomes. Data from SCMs allow comparisons of outcomes, development of research-based decisions, identification of high-risk patients, and identification of issues and problems before they escalate into pending "disasters." Do not be afraid to learn and understand the different SCMs. They can be invaluable tools to your already expert nursing knowledge. Table 5-2 reviews the uses of SCMs.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 1951, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) was established. The focus of its evaluation at that time was on structural measures of quality, the physical plant, number of client beds per nurse, credentialing of service providers, and other standards for each department. Since that time, this system of evaluation has given way to a more process- and outcome-focused model: continuous quality improvement (CQI). Today, the Joint Commission accredits more than 19,000 healthcare organizations. JCAHO-accredited agencies are measured against national standards set by healthcare professionals. Hospitals, healthcare networks, long-term care facilities, ambulatory care centers, home health agencies, behavioral health care facilities, and clinical laboratories are among the organizations seeking JCAHO accreditation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>ASPECTS OF HEALTH CARE TO EVALUATE</h3>
                        <p>Three different aspects of health care can be evaluated in a quality improvement program: the structure within which the care is given, the process of giving that care, and the outcome of that care. To be comprehensive, an evaluation program must include all three aspects of health care (Brook, Davis, & Kamberg, 1980; Donabedian, 1969, 1977, 1987).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Structure</h4>
                        <p>Structure refers to the setting in which the care is given and the resources that are available. It is the easiest of the three aspects to measure and yet is still overlooked in some evaluation procedures. The following is a list of some of the structural aspects of a healthcare organization that can be evaluated:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Facilities, including comfort, convenience of layout, accessibility of support services, safety</li>
                            <li>Equipment, including adequate supplies, state-of-the-art equipment and staff ability to use it</li>
                            <li>Staff, including credentials, experience, absenteeism, turnover rate, staff-client ratios</li>
                            <li>Finances, including salaries, adequacy, sources</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>None of these structural factors alone can guarantee that good care will be given, but they can make good care more likely. High nurse-client ratios and low staff absenteeism rates, for example, are structural factors generally associated with quality nursing care (Chance, 1980).</p>
                        <p>A common pitfall in evaluating structural factors, however, has been to neglect the other two aspects, process and outcome. The following example illustrates the problems that occur when only structure is evaluated:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>A hospital measured the quality of nursing care given in its eight-bed critical care unit by comparing its staffing ratio with the standard ratio of one nurse to two clients. The inadequacy of this structural measure became apparent during a period when the unit had six (out of a total of eight) clients who each required the care of one nurse. Under the standard that was set, only four nurses were on duty, which created a severe staff shortage because seven nurses were actually needed to provide adequate care.</p>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <h4>Process</h4>
                        <p>Process refers to the activities carried out by the healthcare providers. It includes psychosocial interventions, such as teaching and counseling, as well as physical care measures.</p>
                        <p>There are several ways to collect process data. The most direct way is by observation of caregiving activities. Another is self-report of the caregiver. A third source of data is the chart or record that is kept, called an audit.</p>
                        <p>Whichever source of data is used, some set of objectives is needed as a standard against which to compare the activities. This set of objectives can be very specific, such as listing all the steps in a catheterization procedure, or it can be a very general list of objectives, such as "offer information on breast-feeding to all expectant parents" or "conduct weekly staff meetings."</p>
                        
                        <h4>Outcome</h4>
                        <p>An outcome is the result of the activities in which the healthcare providers have been involved. Outcome measures evaluate the effectiveness of these nursing activities by answering such questions as: Did the patient recover? Is the family more independent now? Has team functioning improved?</p>
                        <p>These questions are very general and reflect overall goals of healthcare providers and the organizations in which they work. The outcome questions asked during an actual evaluation should be far more specific and should measure observable behavior, such as the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Client:</strong> Wound healed; blood pressure within normal limits; infection absent</li>
                            <li><strong>Family:</strong> Increased time between visits to the emergency department; applied for food stamps</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can see that some of these outcomes, such as blood pressure or time between emergency department visits, are easier to measure than are other, equally important outcomes, such as increased satisfaction or changes in attitude. Although these less tangible outcomes cannot be measured as precisely, it is still important to include them. Omitting them may imply that they are not important (Lynch, 1978).</p>
                        <p>A major problem in using and interpreting outcome measures in evaluation is that outcomes are influenced by many factors. For example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>The outcome of client teaching done by a nurse on a home visit is affected by the client's interest and ability to learn, the quality of the teaching materials, the presence or absence of family support, the information given by other caregivers (which may conflict), and the environment in which the teaching is done. If the teaching is successful, can the nurse be given full credit for the success? If it is not successful, who has failed?</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>You can see that it would be necessary to evaluate the process as well as the outcome to determine why an intervention such as client teaching succeeds or fails. A comprehensive evaluation includes all three aspects: structure, process, and outcome.</p>
                        
                        <h3>CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT</h3>
                        <p>The current focus of the JCAHO is on quality improvement as well as those activities that ensure quality. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is a process of identifying areas of concern (indicators), collecting data on these indicators on an ongoing basis, analyzing and evaluating the data, and implementing needed changes. When the indicator no longer is a concern, another indicator is selected. Common indicators include the number of falls, medication errors, and infection rates. Indicators can be identified by the accrediting agency and/or by the facility itself. Data can be collected by observations, questionnaires, audits, and chart reviews. The CQI process focuses on the idea that improvement is continuous and ongoing. The purpose of CQI is to continuously improve the capability of everyone involved in providing care, including the organization itself, to provide the highest-quality healthcare.</p>
                        <p>Employees are empowered to make decisions to improve quality. Education, training, participation at all levels, and empowerment of staff members are keys to CQI success. Improvements are accomplished through the use of quality improvement teams. Their purpose is to identify processes that may be too costly or ineffective, in order to change them. With these supporting data, decisions can be made regarding changes needed to improve quality. These teams comprise representatives from every area involved in the process under study.</p>
                        <p>CQI relies on collecting information and analyzing it. You may think this is the responsibility of the "number crunchers," not the nurses. In the CQI framework, however, data collection becomes everyone's responsibility. You may be asked to brainstorm your ideas with other nurses or members of the interdisciplinary team, complete surveys or check sheets, or even keep a time log of your daily activities for a week or longer. Collecting comprehensive, accurate, and representative data is the first step in revisiting the process. How do you actually administer medications to a group of clients? What steps are involved? Are the medications always available at the right time and in the right dose, or do you have to wait for the pharmacy to bring them to the floor? Is the pharmacy technician delayed by emergency orders that must be processed? Looking at the entire process and actually mapping it out on paper in the form of a flowchart may be part of the CQI process for your organization (Fig. 5-1).</p>
                        
                        <h3>QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AT THE UNIT LEVEL</h3>
                        <p>In this section, we consider how the process of quality improvement works at the unit level, where nursing is often the central focus. For the sake of simplicity, we focus almost exclusively on the effect of nursing on client care, although it is generally recommended that quality improvement be interdisciplinary for maximum effectiveness. As a staff member, you will be expected to participate in the quality improvement initiatives for your unit.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Once the policies and procedures for implementing quality improvement projects are defined at the organizational level, much of the responsibility for carrying them out may be delegated to staff members of each unit. At the unit level, the first step is to assign responsibility to various staff members. All staff members may be brought together to act as a quality circle, or a representative group may be appointed to a committee to implement quality improvement activities in consultation with the rest of the nursing staff. It is preferable to have as high a level of staff participation as possible, including representation from all three shifts in an inpatient setting.</p>
                        <p>Once staff members understand the purpose of quality improvement, they can begin to identify areas for study. Staff members may use their own judgment about which areas are in greatest need of evaluation, or they may conduct preliminary surveys to determine the most problem-prone areas. Some guidance from the nurse manager may be needed to select a priority area and to prevent avoidance of a difficult problem or one that is hard to define.</p>
                        <p>Some broad examples of areas for study might include the highest risk clients, the most common client problems, or the source of a high number of incident reports (Elrod, 1991). Other, more selectively focused examples might be physical restraint use, dysphagia, ventilator-assisted breathing, respiratory treatments, preoperative teaching, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive clients, or urinary incontinence. Each of these defines the scope of the problem to be evaluated (Duquette, 1991).</p>
                        <p>Once the scope is defined, the problem itself is further analyzed in terms of its important aspects, the generally accepted standards of care for these aspects, indicators (evidence) that these standards have been met, and the criteria (threshold) for determining whether they were met (Table 5-3). For example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Let's say that one area chosen for study by an outpatient clinic staff is patient teaching with newly diagnosed hypertensive clients. Three important aspects of this area of care would be teaching the client about the disease process, about lifestyle modifications, and about pharmacological treatment (Johannsen, 1993). In regard to one of these, lifestyle modification, the standard of care would state, "the client will receive information about exercise, dietary modifications, smoking, alcohol use, and stress reduction." Indicators for the dietary modification portion would be that the client can describe the recommended modifications, modifies the diet as recommended, and maintains weight within 10% of ideal weight. A criterion or threshold for this last indicator would be that at least 50% of clients would achieve this level within 6 months of the original recommendation (see Table 5-3).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A standard of nursing practice describes what nurses do for or with clients and their families, whereas a nursing standard of care describes the kind of care clients can expect and receive from nurses (JCAHO, 1994).</p>
                        <p>An indicator is an objective, measurable variable of care. The listed indicators are those variables on which data will be collected in a quality-improvement project. If data are to be collected on a continuing basis, the process is usually referred to as monitoring. The criteria, or threshold, set a predetermined level of the indicator that will be considered an acceptable level of care (Betta, 1992). For some indicators, such as documenting patient response to a blood infusion, a 100% level of achievement is expected. In other cases, such as weight reduction or smoking cessation, a 75% level of achievement would be considered excellent.</p>
                        <p>Once these variables are well defined, a plan for data collection is devised. Usually, a worksheet is designed to facilitate data collection. For example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                             <p>A form (Fig. 5-2) could be devised to list each newly diagnosed hypertensive client, the client's weight at diagnosis, ideal weight, and weight at subsequent clinic visits. A final column for noting whether clients were within 10% of ideal weight could be added to indicate how many met the criteria after 6 months.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>After data are collected, the staff reviews the findings and evaluates the degree to which the criteria were met. For example, if only 25% of the newly diagnosed hypertensive clients were within 10% of their ideal weight in 6 months, the clinic staff might decide to offer weight reduction classes or a support group. They might also decide to invite the clinic psychologist and nutritionist to participate in the group.</p>

                            <p>Dingman, S., Williams, M., Fosbinder, D., & Warnick, M. (1999). Implementing a caring model to improve patient satisfaction. J Nurs Adm, 29(12), pp. 30-37.</p>
                            <p>Patient satisfaction is an important indicator of quality in healthcare institutions. Acknowledging the importance of nurse caring behaviors and the impact of these behaviors on patient satisfaction is beginning to become important. In this study, the following five nursing caring behaviors were identified: (1) introduce yourself to patients and explain your role in their care that day; (2) call the patient by his or her preferred name; (3) sit at the patient's bedside for at least 5 minutes per shift to plan and review the patient's care; (4) use a handshake or a touch on the arm; (5) use the mission, vision, and values statements in planning your care. Patients were interviewed shortly after discharge, prior to staff receiving a caring-based inservice, and after the in-service. The nurse/ patient satisfaction attributes measured were (1) overall nursing care; (2) staff showed concern; (3) nurses anticipated needs; (4) nurses explained procedures; (5) nurses demonstrated skill in providing care; (6) nurses helped calm fears; (7) staff communicated effectively; (8) nurses/staff responded to requests. There were significant differences in the changes in satisfaction during the 6 months after the intervention (caring in-services). This study supported the hypothesis that nurse caring behaviors affect the patient's perception of caring and patient satisfaction.</p>
                            <p>What caring behaviors can you identify as indicators to be used in a patient-satisfaction questionnaire? How would you present this idea to the CQI committee?</p>

As a result, the clinic staff might decide to continue the group but to work on making it even more effective and perhaps seeking other avenues to help the other 50% of the clients who had not met their weight reduction goals.</p>

                        <p>Pressure from the JCAHO, consumers of health care, healthcare payers, and healthcare providers has caused the shift in focus in the healthcare system to issues of cost and quality. Experts tell us that quality promotes decreased costs and increased satisfaction. This should be viewed as an opportunity for nursing to increase professionalism and empower nurses to organize and manage client care so that it is safe, efficient, and of the highest quality.</p>
