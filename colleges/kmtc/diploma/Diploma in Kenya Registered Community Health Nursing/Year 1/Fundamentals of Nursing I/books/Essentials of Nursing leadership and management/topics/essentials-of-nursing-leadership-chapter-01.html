                        <p>Nurses work alongside a great number of other professional and nonprofessional personnel: physicians, therapists, social workers, psychologists, technicians, aides, unit managers, and housekeepers, to name just a few. Some of these people are highly skilled and others are not. Many nurses are also expected to manage staffs that include a wide variety of personnel.</p>
                        <p>The study of leadership and management is essentially the study of how to work with other people. In this chapter, we define leadership and management and the differences between the two. We then discuss the qualities and behaviors that make effective nurse leaders and managers; these qualities and behaviors are the keys to effective leadership and management.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Leadership Defined</h3>
                        <p>The essence of leadership is the ability to influence other people. Stephen R. Covey, author of several popular books on leadership, says that a leader "enables people to work more effectively together in a state of interdependence" (1992, p. 267). Bryman (1999) found three elements in most definitions of leadership: influence, groups, and goal. In other words, leadership involves influencing other people, usually in some type of group, to work toward the achievement of the group's goals. In addition, leaders help others develop "a sense of what is important ... a sense of direction and of purpose" (p. 26). Effective nurse leaders are those who inspire others to work together in pursuit of a shared goal. This goal may be providing excellent patient care, designing a cost-saving procedure, or challenging the ethics of a new policy.</p>

                        <h3>Management Defined</h3>
                        <p>There are two schools of thought about what management is. In 1916, Henri Fayol defined management as planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling the work of a given set of employees (Wren, 1972). This definition has influenced thinking in management, including nursing management, for years. However, Mintzberg (1989) says that Fayol's list of management functions does not really describe what managers do. Instead, the manager's function is to do whatever is necessary to make sure that employees do their work and do it well. This includes interpersonal, informational, and decisional actions. We consider Mintzberg's list of management functions in more detail in the section on effective nursing management.</p>
                        <p>Effective managers, according to Covey, are able to elicit from each employee "his or her deepest commitment, continued loyalty, finest creativity, consistent excellent productivity, and maximum potential contribution toward ... continuous improvement of process, product, and service" (1992, p. 276). Translated into terms that are more relevant to nursing, the effective nurse manager is responsible for ensuring not only that patient care is given but also that it is given in the most effective and efficient manner possible.</p>

                        <h3>Are You Ready to Be a Leader or Manager?</h3>
                        <p>You may be thinking, "I'm just beginning my career in nursing. How can you expect me to be a leader or manager?" This is an important question. It is true that new graduates should not be given managerial responsibility under most circumstances. New nurses need time to develop their own clinical skills and are not ready to supervise others. The breadth and depth of their experience are insufficient for the fulfillment of a managerial role right after graduation.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, new graduates can function as leaders within their new nursing roles. Consider the following example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Billie Blair Thomas is a new staff nurse at Green Valley Nursing Home. After orientation, she was assigned to a very active rehabilitation unit with high admission and discharge rates. Billie noticed that the assignment of resident admissions and discharges was rather haphazard. Anyone who was "free" at the moment was directed to handle them. Sometimes, unlicensed assistive personnel were assigned to these tasks. Billie felt that using aides was inappropriate because they have no training in discharge planning and their assessment skills are usually quite limited.</p>
                            <p>Billie thought there was a better way to handle admissions and discharges but was not sure that she should mention it because she was so new. "Maybe they've already thought of this," she said to a former classmate. "It's such an obvious solution." They began to talk about what they had learned in their leadership course before graduation. "I just keep hearing our instructor saying, 'There's only one manager, but anyone can be a leader if they act on their good ideas.'"</p>
                            <p>"If you want to be a leader, you have to act on your idea," her friend said.</p>
                            <p>"Maybe I will," Billie replied.</p>
                            <p>Billie decided to speak with her nurse manager, an experienced rehab nurse who seemed not only approachable but also open to new ideas. "I have been so busy getting our new computer system in place before the surveyors come that I wasn't paying attention to that," the nurse manager told her. "I'm really happy you brought it to my attention."</p>
                            <p>Billie's nurse manager raised the issue at the next executive meeting, giving credit to Billie for having brought it to her attention. The other nurse managers had the same response. "We were so focused on the new computer system that we overlooked that. We need to take care of this situation as soon as possible. That Billie Blair Thomas has leadership potential."</p>
                        </aside>

                        <h3>Comparison of Leadership and Management</h3>
                        <p>The terms leadership and management are often confused, although the differences between them are straightforward. Managers have formal authority to direct the work of a given set of employees and are formally responsible for the quality of that work and what it costs to do it. Neither of these is necessary to be a leader. On the other hand, to be an effective manager, you do need to be a good leader (Table 1-1).</p>

                        <p>Leadership is an essential part of effective management, but the reverse is not true: you do not have to be a manager to be a leader. You can be the youngest, newest, or even the least experienced nurse and yet still have opportunities to be a leader, as Billie Blair Thomas did. These opportunities will increase as your experience increases, and so will your readiness to assume managerial responsibility.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Leadership Theories</h3>
                        <p>There are many different theories about how a person becomes a leader and what type of leader is most effective. Although much research has been done on this subject, no theory has yet emerged as the clear winner. The result is that we do not yet have the single best answer to the question: what makes a person a leader? The reason for this may be that different qualities and behaviors are most important in different situations faced by leaders. In nursing, for example, some situations require quick thinking and fast action. Others require some time to figure out the best solution to a complicated problem. Different leadership qualities and behaviors are needed in these two different situations.</p>
                        <p>Let's look now at some of the best-known leadership theories and the many qualities and behaviors that have been identified as those of the effective nurse leader (Pavitt, 1999; Tappen, 2001).</p>
                        
                        <h4>Trait Theories</h4>
                        <p>At one time or another, you've probably heard someone say, "Leaders are born, not made." This saying claims that some of us are born with the qualities required of a leader, but others of us are not. Many disagree with this idea, pointing out that, although leadership may come more easily to some of us than to others, every one of us can be a leader if we develop the necessary knowledge and skill.</p>
                        <p>Many research studies have been done in an attempt to identify the qualities, or traits, that distinguish a leader from a nonleader. The traits most often identified are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Intelligence</li>
                            <li>Initiative</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other qualities that are frequently cited as leadership traits are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Excellent interpersonal skills</li>
                            <li>High self-esteem</li>
                            <li>Creativity</li>
                            <li>Willingness to take risks</li>
                            <li>Ability to tolerate the consequences of taking risks</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Behavioral Theories</h4>
                        <p>The trait theories were concerned with what a leader is; the behavior theories are concerned with what the leader does. One of the most influential of these behavioral theories is concerned with leadership style (White & Lippitt, 1960) (Table 1-2). The three styles are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Authoritarian leadership</strong> (also called autocratic, directive, controlling). The authoritarian leader gives orders, makes decisions for the group as a whole, and bears most of the responsibility for the outcomes. For example, when a decision needs to be made, an authoritarian leader would say, "I've given this a great deal of thought and decided that this is the way we're going to solve our problem." Although this is an efficient way to run things, it usually stifles creativity and may inhibit motivation. Authoritarian leadership may be either punitive or benign.</li>
                            <li><strong>Democratic</strong> (also called participative). In contrast to the authoritarian leader, the democratic leader shares the planning, decision making, and responsibility for outcomes with other members of the group. Although this is often a less efficient way to run things, it is more flexible and more likely to foster motivation and creativity. Democratic leadership is characterized by guidance rather than control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Laissez-faire leadership</strong> (also called permissive, nondirective). The laissez-faire ("let it alone") leader does very little planning or decision making and fails to encourage others to participate, either. In fact, laissezfaire leadership is really a lack of leadership. For example, when a decision needs to be made, a laissez-faire leader may postpone making the decision or never make the decision at all. The laissez-faire leader often leaves people feeling confused and frustrated because there is no goal, no guidance, and no direction. Some mature individuals enjoy laissez-faire leadership because they need little guidance. Most people, however, flounder under this kind of leadership.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pavitt summed up the difference between these three styles nicely: a democratic leader attempts to move the group toward its goals, an autocratic leader attempts to move the group toward the leader's goals, and a laissezfaire leader makes no attempt to move the group (Pavitt, 1999, p. 330ff).</p>

                        <h4>Task-Relationship</h4>
                        <p>Another important distinction in leadership style is the one between a task focus and a relationship focus (Blake, Mouton, & Tapper, 1981). Some leaders emphasize the tasks (e.g., keeping the nursing station neat, getting charting done) and fail to realize that interpersonal relationships (e.g., attitude of physicians toward nursing staff, treating housekeeping staff with respect) have considerable impact on the morale and productivity of employees. Others focus on the interpersonal aspects and ignore the quality of the job being done as long as people get along with each other. The most effective leader is able to balance the two, making sure to attend to both the task and the relationship aspects of working together.</p>

                        <h4>Situational Theories</h4>
                        <p>A more complex set of theories has evolved since the introduction of the trait and behavioral theories. Adaptability is the key to the situational approach (McNichol, 2000). Instead of assuming that one particular approach works in all situations, situational theories recognize the complexity of work situations and encourage the leader to consider a number of factors when deciding what action to take.</p>
                        <p>The following is an illustration of how just one factor can affect people's response to an organizational change:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Two nurse managers were talking before the nursing administration council meeting began. "How did your staff react to the new 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. times for the day tour?" Jennifer Chinn asked her friend Esther Cabriollo.</p>
                            <p>"They love it," said Esther.</p>
                            <p>"Really?" said Jennifer. "My staff is so upset. They said it was an inhuman schedule and that they have to be at work before the birds get up in the morning. You should hear their complaints."</p>
                            <p>"Most of my staff think it's just the opposite," said Esther. "Many have young children. With this new schedule, their spouses can take the children to school in the morning, and they can be home in time to meet the school bus. They said it's the most humane change the administration has ever made."</p>
                            <p>"That explains it," said Jennifer. "Most of my staff have older children who have a lot of activities in the evening, and they're all having trouble getting up an hour earlier in the morning. Their situation is entirely different."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Every situation is different. A change that is welcomed by one group of people may be hated by another group. One of the most important of these situational factors is the type of organization in which the leader works (discussed in Chapter 7). Situational theories emphasize the importance of understanding all the factors that affect a particular group of people in a particular environment, including the type of leadership approach that is being used.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Transformational Leadership</h4>
                        <p>Although the situational theories were a step in the right direction in terms of recognizing how complex the process of influencing others really is, there was still a sense that something was missing. Meaning, inspiration, and vision had not been given enough attention in the earlier theories (Tappen, 2001). Although these are not the only factors involved in transformational leadership theory, they are the outstanding features of this theory.</p>
                        <p>According to the transformational theory of leadership, people need a sense of mission that goes beyond good interpersonal relationships or the appropriate reward for a job well done (Bass, 1993). This is especially true in nursing. Caring for people, sick or well, is the goal of our profession, not manufacturing widgets. Most of us chose nursing to do something for the good of humankind. This is our vision: one goal of nursing leadership is to guide us toward achievement of that vision.</p>
                        <p>Transformational leaders can describe this goal of nursing in a manner that is so meaningful and exciting that it inspires commitment in the people with whom they work (Trofino, 1995). If successful, the goals of the leader and staff will "become fused, creating unity, wholeness, and a collective purpose" (Barker, 1992, p. 42).</p>

                        <p>Effective leadership is defined as the accomplishment of the goals shared by leader and followers. Integrity, courage, initiative, energy, optimism, perseverance, balance, the ability to handle stress, and self-awareness are qualities of effective leaders in nursing (Fig. 1-1).</p>

                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Integrity.</strong> Integrity is expected of healthcare professionals. Our clients, colleagues, and employers all expect nurses to be honest, law-abiding, and trustworthy. Adherence to both a code of personal ethics and a code of professional ethics (see the American Nurses Association Code for Nurses in Appendix 1) is expected of every nurse. Would-be leaders who do not exhibit these characteristics cannot expect them of their followers either.</li>
                            <li><strong>Courage.</strong> Sometimes, being a leader means taking some risks. In the story of Billie Blair Thomas, for example, Billie needed some courage to speak to her nurse manager about a problem she had observed.</li>
                            <li><strong>Initiative.</strong> Good ideas are not enough. To be a leader, you must act on those good ideas. This requires initiative on your part.</li>
                            <li><strong>Energy.</strong> Leadership also requires energy. Both leadership and management are hard but satisfying work that requires effort on your part. Of course, it is also important that you use your energy wisely.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimism.</strong> When the work is difficult and one crisis seems to follow another in rapid succession, it is easy to become discouraged. However, it is important not to let discouragement keep you and your coworkers from seeking ways to resolve your difficulties. In fact, the ability to see a problem as an opportunity is part of the optimism that makes a person an effective leader. Like energy, optimism is "catching." An optimistic leader can remotivate a discouraged group. Holman (1995) calls this being a winner instead of a whiner (see Table 1-3).</li>
                            <li><strong>Perseverance.</strong> Perseverance is a closely related characteristic of effective leaders. Effective leaders do not give up easily. Instead, they persevere, continuing their efforts when others are tempted to give up the struggle. This perseverance often pays off.</li>
                            <li><strong>Balance.</strong> In our effort to become the best nurses we can be, we may forget that other aspects of life are equally important. As important as our clients and colleagues are to us, family and friends are important too. Although school and work are meaningful activities, cultural, social, recreational, and spiritual activities also have meaning. The most effective leaders have found a balance between work and play in their lives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ability to Handle Stress.</strong> There is some stress in almost every job. Coping with stress in as positive and healthy a manner as possible helps you conserve your energy and be a model for others. We talk more about maintaining balance and handling stress in Chapter 10.</li>
                            <li><strong>Self-Awareness.</strong> Knowing, understanding, and accepting yourself as a thinking, feeling human being who interacts with other thinking, feeling people is a very important leadership quality. People who do not understand themselves are limited in their ability to understand the motivations of other people. They are also far more likely to fool themselves than are people who are self-aware. For example, it is much easier to be fair with a coworker you like than with one you do not like. Recognizing that you like some people better than others is the first step in preventing unfair treatment based on your own personal likes and dislikes.</li>

                        <p>As mentioned earlier, leadership requires action. The effective leader not only takes action but also chooses the action carefully. Important leadership behaviors include thinking critically, solving problems, respecting people, communicating skillfully, setting specific goals and communicating a vision for the future, and developing oneself and others.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Thinking Critically.</strong> Critical thinking is reflective, reasoned analysis that focuses on thinking before deciding what to believe or do (Miller & Malcolm, 1990). The essence of critical thinking is questioning and analyzing ideas, suggestions, habits, routines, common practices, and policies before deciding to accept or reject them. To avoid falling prey to the assumptions and biases of oneself and others, ask yourself frequently, "Why do I believe that . . .?" (Ulrich & Glendon, 1999).</li>
                            <li><strong>Solving Problems.</strong> Client problems, paperwork problems, staff problems: these and others occur frequently and need to be solved. The effective leader helps people to identify problems and to work through the problem-solving process to find a reasonable solution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Respecting the Individual.</strong> Although we all have much in common as thinking, feeling human beings, each of us has different wants and needs and has had different life experiences. For example, some people really value the psychological rewards of helping others, and other people are more concerned about earning a decent salary. There is nothing wrong with either of these points of view; they are simply different. The effective leader recognizes these differences in people and helps them find the rewards in their work that mean the most to them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Listening to Others and Communicating Skillfully.</strong> The only way to find out people's individual wants and needs is to watch what they do and to listen to what they tell you. It is amazing how often leaders fail simply because they did not listen to what other people were trying to tell them.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We have separated listening from communicating with other people just to emphasize that communication involves both giving and receiving information, not just giving out information. Skillful communication includes the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Encouraging the Exchange of Information.</strong> Many misunderstandings and mistakes occur because people failed to share enough information with each other. The leader's role is to make sure that the channels of communication remain open and that people use them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Providing Feedback.</strong> Everyone needs some information about the effectiveness of his or her performance. Frequent feedback, both positive and negative, is needed so that people can continually improve their performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Some nurse leaders find it difficult to give negative feedback, fearing that they will upset the other person. How else can a person know where improvement is needed? Negative feedback can be given in a manner that is neither hurtful nor resented by the individual receiving it. In fact, it is often appreciated.</p>
                        <p>Other nurse leaders forget to give positive feedback, assuming that coworkers will know when they are doing a good job. This is a mistake; everyone appreciates positive feedback. In fact, for some people, it is the most important reward they get from their jobs.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Setting Specific Goals and Communicating a Vision for the Future.</strong> Just as each one of us is unique in terms of our experiences, needs, and wants, we are also likely to have unique goals for ourselves. An important leadership task is to find the common thread in all of those goals and to help the group reach a consensus about its goals. This may require considerable discussion before it is achieved.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The effective leader also has a vision for the future. Communicating this vision to the group and involving everyone in working toward that vision create the inspiration that keeps people going when things become difficult. Even better, involving people in creating the vision is not only more satisfying for employees but also has the potential for the most creative and innovative outcomes (Kerfott, 2000). It is this vision that helps make our work meaningful.</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Developing Oneself and Others.</strong> Learning does not end with leaving school. In fact, experienced nurses will tell you that school is just the beginning, that it only prepares you to continue learning throughout your career. As new and better ways to care for clients are discovered, it is your responsibility as a professional to critically analyze these new approaches and decide whether they would be better for your clients than current approaches to care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Effective leaders not only continue to learn but also encourage others to do the same. Sometimes leaders function as teachers. At other times, their role is primarily to encourage and guide others to seek more knowledge. Observant, reflective, analytical practitioners know that learning takes place every day if one is open to it (Kaagan, 1999).</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Management Theories</h3>
                        <p>Although there are many management theories, it is most important to be familiar with the two major but opposing schools of thought in management: the human relations approach to management and scientific management. As you will see, one emphasizes the relationship aspects of managing people, and the other emphasizes the task aspects of management.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Scientific Management</h4>
                        <p>Frederick Taylor is usually credited with the development of the scientific management approach (Lee, 1980; Locke, 1982). Almost 100 years ago, Taylor argued that most jobs could be done more efficiently if they were thoroughly analyzed. Workers could work more efficiently given a properly designed task and sufficient incentive to get the work done. For example, Taylor encouraged paying people "by the piece," that is, by the number of "widgets" made (in health care, the equivalent would be by the number of clients bathed or fed), rather than by the number of hours worked. This would be an incentive to get the most work done in the least amount of time, Taylor said.</p>
                        <p>The work itself was also analyzed to improve efficiency. In health care, for example, there has been a lot of discussion about the time it takes to bring patients to x-ray or therapy versus bringing the x-ray or therapist to the patient. The current emphasis on eliminating excess staff and increasing the productivity of remaining employees is based on the same kind of thinking.</p>
                        <p>Nurse managers who use the principles of scientific management emphasize the task aspects of providing health care. They pay particular attention to the type of treatments and procedures done on the unit, the equipment needed to provide this care efficiently, and strategies that would facilitate efficient accomplishment of these tasks. These nurse managers keep careful records of the amount of work accomplished and reward those who accomplish the most.</p>

                        <h4>Human Relations-Oriented Management</h4>
                        <p>McGregor's theory X and theory Y are a good example of the difference between scientific management and human relations-oriented management. Theory X, says McGregor (1960), reflects a common attitude among managers that most people really do not want to work very hard and that the manager's job is to make sure that they do work hard. According to theory X, a manager needs to employ strict rules, constant supervision, and the threat of punishment (reprimands, withheld raises, and threats of job loss) to create industrious, conscientious workers.</p>
                        <p>Theory Y, which McGregor prefers, is the opposite viewpoint. Theory Y managers believe that the work itself can be motivating and that people will work hard if their managers provide an atmosphere in which employees are supported and encouraged to do so. A theory Y manager emphasizes guidance rather than control, development rather than close supervision, and reward rather than punishment (Fig. 1-2).</p>

Theory Y (right) shows a manager guiding supported and encouraged workers, with an upward arrow." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>A human relations-oriented nurse manager is concerned with keeping employee morale as high as possible, assuming that satisfied, motivated employees will do the best work. Employees' attitudes, opinions, hopes, and fears are important to this type of nurse manager. Considerable effort is expended to work out conflicts and promote mutual understanding among the staff to provide an atmosphere in which people can do their best work.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The effective nurse manager possesses a combination of qualities: leadership, clinical expertise, and business sense. None of these alone is enough; it is the combination that prepares an individual for the complex task of managing a group or team of healthcare providers. Let's look at each of these briefly:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Leadership.</strong> All of the people skills of the leader are essential to the effective manager. They are the core skills needed to function as a manager.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clinical Expertise.</strong> It is very difficult to either help others develop their skills or evaluate how well they have done this without possessing clinical expertise oneself. It probably is not necessary (or even possible) to know everything every other professional on the team knows, but it is important to be able to assess the effectiveness of their work in terms of patient outcomes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Business Sense.</strong> Nurse managers also need to be concerned with the "bottom line," that is, with the cost of providing the care that is given, especially in comparison with the benefit received from that care. In other words, nurse managers need to be able to analyze how much is spent to provide a given amount of client care and how effective that client care has been. This is a very complex task and requires knowledge of budgeting, staffing, and measurement of patient outcomes, much of which is beyond the scope of this textbook.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is some controversy over the amount of clinical expertise versus business sense that is needed to be an effective nurse manager. Some argue that a person can be a "generic" manager, that the job of managing people is the same no matter what tasks they perform. Others argue that the manager must understand the tasks better than anyone else in the work group. Our position is that both are needed, along with excellent leadership skills.</p>

                        <p>Mintzberg's list, mentioned earlier, provides us with a useful outline of managerial roles and responsibilities. As you will recall, Mintzberg (1989) divides the manager's activities into three categories: interpersonal, informational, and decisional. We will use these categories but have taken some liberties with them, rearranging them a little and adding some activities suggested by other authors (Dunham-Taylor, 1995; Montebello, 1994), and by our own observations of nurse managers (Fig. 1-3).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h4>Interpersonal</h4>
                        <p>The interpersonal area is one in which leaders and managers have similar responsibilities. However, the manager has some additional responsibilities that are seldom given to leaders. The following are additional interpersonal skills that nurse managers need:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Networking.</strong> The position of nurse managers in the hierarchy provides them with many opportunities to develop positive working relationships with other disciplines, departments, and units within the organization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conflict Negotiation and Resolution.</strong> Managers often find themselves occupied with resolving conflicts between employees, between clients and staff members, and between staff members and administration.</li>
                            <li><strong>Employee Development.</strong> Providing for the continuing learning and upgrading of the skills of employees is a managerial responsibility that overlaps with managers' informational responsibilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rewards and Punishments.</strong> Managers are in a position to provide both tangible (e.g., salary increases, time off) and intangible (e.g., praise, recognition) rewards as well as punishments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Decisional</h4>
                        <p>Nurse managers are also responsible for making a number of often difficult decisions:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Employee Evaluation.</strong> Managers are responsible for conducting formal performance appraisals of their staff members.</li>
                            <li><strong>Resource Allocation.</strong> In decentralized organizations, nurse managers are often given a set amount of money for running their units or departments and must allocate these resources wisely, especially when they are very limited.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hiring and Firing Employees.</strong> Most nurse managers participate in or carry out themselves the hiring and firing for their units or departments.</li>
                            <li><strong>Planning for the Future.</strong> Even though the day-to-day operation of most units is a sufficiently complex and time-consuming responsibility, nurse managers must also look forward and prepare themselves and their units for future changes in budgets, organizational priorities, and patient populations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Job Analysis and Redesign.</strong> In a time of extreme cost consciousness, nurse managers are frequently being called on to analyze and redesign the work of their units or departments to make them as efficient and cost effective as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Informational</h4>
                        <p>Nurse managers often find themselves in positions within the organizational hierarchy in which they acquire much information that is not available to their staff. They also have much information about the work group that is not readily available to the administration, placing them in a strategic position within the information web of any organization. The effective manager uses this position for the benefit of both the staff and the organization. The following are some examples:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Spokesperson.</strong> Managers often speak for administration when relaying information to their staff members. Likewise, they often speak for staff members when relaying information to administration. In addition, they frequently represent their work group or department at various meetings and discussions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Monitoring.</strong> Nurse managers monitor the activities of their units or work groups. This may include the number of clients seen, average length of stay, infection rates, and so forth. They also monitor the staff (e.g., absentee rates, tardiness, unproductive time) and the budget (e.g., money spent, money left to spend in comparison with money needed to operate the unit).</li>
                            <li><strong>Dissemination.</strong> Nurse managers share information with their clients, staff members, and employers. This information may be related to the results of their monitoring efforts, new developments in health care, policy changes, and so forth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As you can see, nurse managers have very complex, responsible positions within healthcare organizations. Ineffective managers may do harm to their employees and to the organization, but effective managers can help their staff members grow and develop as healthcare professionals while providing the highest quality care to their clients.</p>

                        <p>Joe Garcia has been an operating room nurse for 5 years. He was often on call on Saturday and Sunday, but he enjoyed his work and knew that he would not be called unless he was really needed. When a large healthcare corporation bought the hospital he worked for, Joe was initially pleased because he thought that this would increase his opportunities for advancement.</p>
                        <p>A multicar accident on a nearby interstate highway occurred on the second weekend after the hospital had been purchased. Most of the accident victims were taken to the city-owned hospital, but two were brought to the emergency room of the hospital where Joe worked. One was critically injured; the other had minor cuts and bruises. Joe was called in to prepare for emergency surgery. When he arrived, he was told that the patient had died.</p>
                        <p>As usual, Joe requested payment for the time spent traveling to and from the hospital on the emergency call. Joe was not paid for this time on his next paycheck. When he asked about it, his nurse manager told him that he would not be paid because he did not do any work. "That's not fair," he said, "I'm going to speak with the director about this."</p>
                        <p>"The last person who complained to the director was fired," the nurse manager warned him.</p>
                        <p>"I can't believe that," said Joe. "The director has always been fair with all of us."</p>
                        <p>"No more," replied the nurse manager. "The director has been replaced. This is no longer the fair, employee-centered organization we used to work for. With this new management, your protest, however justified it is, will be criticized and you might be punished. The choice is up to you."</p>
                        <p>Joe decided that he did not want to work in such an institution. With his 5 years of operating room experience, he quickly found another operating room position in an organization that operated under a more humanistically oriented approach to management.</p>
