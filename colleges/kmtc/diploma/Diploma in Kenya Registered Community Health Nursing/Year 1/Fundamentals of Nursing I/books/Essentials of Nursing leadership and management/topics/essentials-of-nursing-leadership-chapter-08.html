                <section id="introduction" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-2">
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Each of us brings different experiences, beliefs, values, and habits with us to work. These differences are a natural part of our being unique individuals and members of different segments of our society. Various pressures and demands in the workplace also generate problems and conflicts among people at work. Any or all of these can interfere with our ability to work together. Consider the following example, which is the first of three used to illustrate how to deal with problems and conflicts.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4>Case 1: Team A and Team B</h4>
                            <p>Team A has stopped talking to Team B. If several members of Team A are out sick, no one on Team B will help Team A with their work. Likewise, Team A members will not take telephone messages for anyone on Team B. Instead, they ask the person to call back later. When members of the two teams pass each other in the hall, they either glare at each other or turn away to avoid eye contact. Arguments erupt when members of the two teams need the same computer terminal or another piece of equipment at the same time.</p>
                            <p>When a Team A nurse reached for the pulse oximeter at the same moment as a Team B nurse did, the second nurse said, "You've been using that all morning."</p>
                            <p>"I've got a lot of patients to monitor," was the response.</p>
                            <p>"Oh, you think you're the only one with work to do?"</p>
                            <p>"We take good care of our patients."</p>
                            <p>"Are you saying we don't?"</p>
                            <p>The nurses fell silent when the nurse manager entered the room.</p>
                            <p>"Is something the matter?" she asked. Both nurses shook their heads and left quickly.</p>
                            <p>"I'm not sure what's going on here," the nurse manager thought to herself, "but something's wrong, and I need to find out what it is right away."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>We will return to this case later when we discuss workplace problems and conflicts, their sources, and how to resolve them.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">CONFLICT</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Conflicts can arise whenever two or more people disagree on an issue (Vayrynen, 1991). Small or large, they seem to be a daily occurrence in the life of a nurse manager (McElhaney, 1996), and they can interfere with getting the work done, as you saw in Case 1.</p>
                        <p>The potentially harmful effects of unresolved conflict should not be underestimated. Serious conflicts can be very stressful for the people involved. Stress symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, anxiety, sleep disorders, withdrawal, or other interpersonal relationship problems can occur (Ehrlich, 1995). Anger, even violence, can erupt in the workplace if conflicts are not resolved satisfactorily.</p>
                        <p>Conflict also has a positive side. In the process of learning how to manage conflict, people can develop more open, cooperative ways of working together (Tjosvold & Tjosvold, 1995). They can begin to see each other as people with similar needs, concerns, and dreams instead of as competitors or blocks in the way of progress. Our goal, then, in dealing with conflict is to create an environment in which conflicts are dealt with in a cooperative and constructive manner, rather than in a competitive and destructive manner.</p>
                        <h3>SOURCES OF CONFLICT</h3>
                        <p>Why do conflicts occur? Health care brings people of different ages, genders, income levels, statuses, ethnic groups, educational levels, lifestyles, and professions together for the purpose of restoring or maintaining people's health. Differences of opinion over how to best accomplish this goal are a normal part of working with people of various skill levels and backgrounds (Wenckus, 1995). The workplace itself can also be a generator of conflict (Box 8-1). Let's look at some of the most common reasons why conflict occurs.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">BOX 8-1: POTENTIAL CONFLICT GENERATORS</h4>

                        <h4>Tension Between Groups</h4>
                        <p>An increase in tension between or among various groups of people within the workplace has been the subject of much interest in the media. Union-management conflicts regularly occur in some workplaces. Gender-based conflicts, including equal pay for women and sexual harassment issues, are other examples (Ehrlich, 1995).</p>
                        <h4>Increased Workload</h4>
                        <p>Emphasis on cost containment has resulted in increased pressure to get as much work as possible out of each employee, and sometimes more work than a person can reasonably do in a day (Trossman, 1999). This leaves many healthcare workers feeling that their employers are taking advantage of them (Ketter, 1994) and causes conflict if they believe others are not working as hard as they are.</p>
                        <h4>Multiple Role Demands</h4>
                        <p>Inappropriate task assignments (e.g., asking nurses to clean floors as well as care for their clients), often the result of cost-containment efforts, can lead to disagreements about who does what task and who is responsible for the outcome.</p>
                        <h4>Threats to Professional Identity and Territory</h4>
                        <p>When role boundaries are blurred (sometimes even erased), professional identities are threatened, and people may react in defense of them. Who, for example, is supposed to teach the discharged client about taking medication at home-the pharmacist, physician, nurse, or all three? If all three do this, who does what part of the teaching?</p>
                        <h4>Threats to Safety and Security</h4>
                        <p>When roles are blurred, cost constraints are emphasized, and staff members face layoffs, individuals' economic security is threatened. This can be a source of considerable stress and tension (Qureshi, 1996).</p>
                        <h4>Scarce Resources</h4>
                        <p>Inadequate money for pay raises, equipment, supplies, or additional help can increase competition between or among departments and individuals as they scramble to get their share of the little there is to distribute.</p>
                        <h4>Cultural Differences</h4>
                        <p>Different beliefs about how hard a person should work, what constitutes work or productivity, and even what it means to arrive at work "on time" can lead to problems if they are not reconciled.</p>
                        <h4>Invasion of Personal Space</h4>
                        <p>Crowded conditions and the constant interactions that occur at a busy nurses' station can increase interpersonal tension and lead to battles over precious work space (McElhaney, 1996).</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Conflicts can occur at any level and involve any number of people, including your boss, subordinates, or peers (Sanon-Rollins, 2000). On the individual level, they can occur between two people working together on a team, between two people in different departments, or even between a staff member and a client or family member. On the group level, conflict can occur between two teams (as in Case 1), two departments, or two different professional groups (e.g., nurses and social workers over who is responsible for discharge planning). On the organizational level, conflicts can occur between two organizations (e.g., when two home health agencies compete for a contract with a large hospital). Our focus in this chapter is primarily on the first two levels, between or among individuals or between groups of people within a healthcare organization.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Win, Lose, or Draw?</h3>
                        <p>Some people think about problems and conflicts that occur at work in the same way as they think about a football game or tennis match: unless the score is tied at the end of the game, someone has to win and someone has to lose. There are some problems with this comparison to sports competition. First, our aim is to work together more effectively, not to defeat the other party. Second, the people who lose are likely to feel bad about losing (Gottlieb & Healy, 1990). As a result, they may spend their time and energy preparing to win the next round, rather than on their work. Third, a tie (neither side wins or loses) may be just a stalemate; no one has won or lost, but the problem is also still there.</p>
                        <p>So the answer to the question "Win, lose, or draw?" is "none of the above." Instead, try to resolve the problem or conflict whenever possible. When differences and disagreements first arise, problem solving may be sufficient. If the situation has already developed into a full-blown conflict, however, negotiation of a settlement may be necessary.</p>
                        <h3>Problem Resolution</h3>
                        <p>The use of the problem-solving process in patient care should be familiar to you by now. The same approach can be used when staff problems occur. The goal in problem solving is to be as creative as possible in finding a solution to a given problem (Gottlieb & Healy, 1990). The process itself, illustrated in Fig. 8-1, includes identifying the issue or problem, generating possible solutions, evaluating the suggested solutions, choosing what appears to be the best solution, implementing that solution, evaluating the degree to which the problem has been resolved, and, finally, concluding either that the problem is resolved or that it will be necessary to repeat the process to find a better solution.</p>

                        <h4>Identify the Problem or Issue</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes, it is easy to identify the real issue or problem. At other times, however, some discussion and exploration of the issues are necessary before the real problem emerges. "It would be nice," say Browne and Kelley, "if what other people were really saying was always obvious, if all their essential thoughts were clearly labeled for us . . . and if all knowledgeable people agreed about answers to important questions" (1994, p. 5). Of course, this is not what usually happens. People are often vague about what their real concern is, and sometimes they are genuinely uncertain about what the real problem is. Emotional involvement may further cloud the issue. All of this needs to be sorted out so that the problem is clearly identified and a solution can be sought.</p>
                        <h4>Generate Possible Solutions</h4>
                        <p>Here creativity is especially important. If you are guiding people through this process, try to discourage them from using old solutions for new problems. It is natural for people to try to repeat something that worked well for them in the past, but solutions that were previously successful may not work in the future (Walsh, 1996).</p>
                        <h4>Evaluate Suggested Solutions</h4>
                        <p>An open-minded, objective evaluation of each suggestion is needed, but accomplishing this is not always easy. When a group problem solves, it is sometimes difficult to separate the suggestion from its source. For example, on an interdisciplinary team, the status of the person who made the suggestion may influence whether the suggestion is judged to be useful. Whose solution is most likely to be the best one-the physician's or the UAPs' (unlicensed assistive personnel)? That depends. The suggestion should be judged on its merits, not its source.</p>
                        <h4>Choose the Best Solution</h4>
                        <p>Which of the suggested solutions is most likely to work? A combination of suggestions is often the best solution.</p>
                        <h4>Implement the Solution Chosen</h4>
                        <p>The true test of any suggested solution is how well it actually works. Once a solution has been implemented, it is important to give it time to work. Impatience sometimes leads to premature abandonment of a good solution.</p>
                        <h4>Is the Problem Resolved?</h4>
                        <p>Not every problem is resolved successfully on the first attempt. If the problem has not been resolved, the process needs to be resumed with even greater attention to what the real problem is and how it can be successfully resolved.</p>
                        <p>Let's consider a situation in which problem solving was helpful:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4>Case 2: The Vacation</h4>
                            <p>Francine Deloitte has been a unit secretary for 10 years. She is prompt, efficient, accurate, courteous, flexible, and productiveeverything a nurse manager could ask for in a unit secretary. When nursing staff members are very busy, she distributes afternoon snacks or sits with a family for a few minutes until a nurse is available. There is only one issue on which Ms. Deloitte is insistent and stubborn: taking her 2-week vacation over the Christmas and New Year holidays. This is forbidden by hospital policy, but every nurse manager has allowed her to do this because it is the only special request she ever makes and because it is the only time she visits her family during the year.</p>
                            <p>A recent reorganization of the administrative structure had eliminated several layers of nursing managers and supervisors. Each remaining nurse manager was given responsibility for two or three units. The new nurse manager for Ms. Deloitte's unit refused to grant her request for vacation time at the end of December. "I can't show favoritism," she explained. "No one else is allowed to take vacation time at the end of December." Assuming that she could have the time off as usual, Francine had already purchased a nonrefundable ticket for her visit home. When her request was denied, she threatened to quit. On hearing this, one of the nurses on Francine's unit confronted the new nurse manager saying, "You can't do this, we are going to lose the best unit secretary we ever had if you do."</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager asked Ms. Deloitte to meet with her to discuss the problem. The following is a summary of the problem solving they did:</p>
                            <p><strong>The Issue.</strong> Ms. Deloitte wanted to take her vacation at the end of December through early January. Assuming this was all right, she had purchased nonrefundable tickets. The policy forbids vacations from December 20 to January 5. The former nurse manager had not enforced this policy with Ms. Deloitte, but the new nurse manager wanted to enforce the policy with everyone, including Ms. Deloitte.</p>
                            <p><strong>Possible Solutions.</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Ms. Deloitte resigns.</li>
                                <li>Fire Ms. Deloitte.</li>
                                <li>Allow Ms. Deloitte to take her vacation as planned.</li>
                                <li>Allow everyone to take vacations between December 20 and January 5 if requested.</li>
                                <li>Allow no one to take a vacation between December 20 and January 5.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><strong>Evaluate Suggested Solutions.</strong> Ms. Deloitte preferred solutions 3 and 4. The new nurse manager preferred 5. Neither wanted 1 or 2. They could agree only that none of the solutions satisfied both of them, so they decided to try again.</p>
                            <p><strong>Second List of Possible Solutions.</strong></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Reimburse Ms. Deloitte for the cost of the tickets.</li>
                                <li>Allow Ms. Deloitte one last vacation between December 20 and January 5.</li>
                                <li>Allow Ms. Deloitte to take her vacation over Thanksgiving instead.</li>
                                <li>Allow Ms. Deloitte to begin her vacation on December 26 so that she would work on Christmas Day but not on New Year's Day.</li>
                                <li>Allow Ms. Deloitte to begin her vacation earlier in December so that she could return in time to work on New Year's Day.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p><strong>Choose the Best Solution.</strong> As they discussed the alternatives, Ms. Deloitte said that she could change the days of her flight without a penalty. The nurse manager said that she would allow solution 5 on the second list if Ms. Deloitte understood that she could not take vacation time between December 20 and January 5 in the future. Ms. Deloitte agreed to this.</p>
                            <p><strong>Implement the Solution.</strong> Ms. Deloitte returned on December 30 and worked both New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.</p>
                            <p><strong>Evaluate the Solution.</strong> The rest of the staff members had been watching the situation very carefully. Most felt that the solution finally agreed on had been fair to them as well as to Ms. Deloitte. Ms. Deloitte felt she had been treated honestly and fairly. The nurse manager believed they had found a solution that was fair to Ms. Deloitte but still reinforced her determination to enforce the vacation policy.</p>
                            <p><strong>Resolved or Resume Problem Solving?</strong> Ms. Deloitte, staff members, and the nurse manager all felt that the problem had been solved.</p>

                        <h3>Negotiating an Agreement Informally</h3>
                        <p>When a problem has grown too big, too complex, or too heated, a more elaborate process may be required to resolve it. On evaluating Case 1, the nurse manager decided that the tensions between Team A and Team B had become so great that negotiation would be necessary.</p>
                        <p>The process of negotiation is a complex one that requires much careful thought beforehand and an equal amount of skill in its implementation (Box 8-2). The following is an outline of the most essential aspects of negotiation using Case 1 to illustrate how it can be done.</p>

                            <p><strong>Agree on the resolution of the conflict.</strong></p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Scope the Situation</h4>
                        <p>To be successful, it is important to thoroughly understand the entire situation. Walker and Harris (1995, p. 42) suggest asking yourself the following three questions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>What am I trying to achieve?</strong> The nurse manager in Case 1 is concerned about the tensions between Team A and Team B. She wants the members of these two teams to be able to work together in a cooperative manner, which they are not doing at the present time.</li>
                            <li><strong>What is the environment in which I am operating?</strong> The members of Teams A and B were openly hostile to each other. The overall climate of the organization, however, was a benign one. The nurse manager knew that teamwork was encouraged and that her actions to resolve the conflict would be supported by administration.</li>
                            <li><strong>What problems am I likely to encounter?</strong> The nurse manager knew that she had allowed the problem to go on too long. Even physicians, social workers, and visitors to the unit were getting caught up in the conflict. Team members were actively trying to get other staff to take sides, making clear they felt that "if you are not with us, you are against us." This made people from other departments very uncomfortable because they had to work with both teams. The nurse manager knew that resolution of the conflict would be a relief to many people.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>It is important to ask one additional question in preparation for negotiations:</p>
                        <ol start="4">
                            <li><strong>What does the other side want?</strong> In this situation, the nurse manager was not certain what either team really wanted. She realized that she needed this information before she could begin to negotiate.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Set the Stage</h4>
                        <p>When a conflict such as the one between Teams A and B has gone on for some time, the opposing sides are often unwilling to meet to discuss the problem. If this occurs, it may be necessary to confront them with direct statements designed to open communications between the two sides and challenge them to seek resolution of the situation. At the same time, it is important to avoid any implication of blame, because this provokes defensiveness rather than willingness to change.</p>
                        <p>To confront Teams A and B with their behavior toward one another, the nurse manager called them together at the end of the day shift. "I am very concerned about what I have been observing lately," she told them. "It appears to me that instead of working together, our two teams are working against each other." She continued with some examples of what she had observed, taking care not to mention individual names and not blaming anyone for the problem. She was also prepared to take responsibility for having allowed the situation to deteriorate before taking this much-needed action.</p>
                        <h4>Conduct the Negotiation</h4>
                        <p>As indicated earlier, conducting a negotiation requires a great deal of skill. Many conflicts become very emotional. Past experience may affect feelings about a current conflict. You or another individual involved in the conflict may be holding a grudge against someone who caused problems in the past (Barnes, 1998). Painful memories of unresolved previous conflicts may cause difficulty in making a clear-headed appraisal of the current situation. Recognizing the effect of these emotions is essential to negotiating effectively (Barnes, 1998). When faced with a highly emotional situation, do not respond with even more emotion. Instead, find out why emotions are so high and refocus the discussion on the issues (Shapiro & Jankowski, 1998). Without effective leadership to prevent personal attacks, confrontation and negotiation can actually worsen the situation. With effective leadership, the conflict may be resolved.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Set Ground Rules.</strong> Members of Teams A and B began flinging accusations at each other as soon as the nurse manager made her statement. The nurse manager stopped this quickly and said, "First, we need to set some ground rules for this discussion. Everyone will get a chance to speak, but not all at once. Please speak for yourself, not for others. And please do not make personal remarks or criticize your coworkers. We are here to resolve this problem, not to make it worse." She had to remind the group of these ground rules several times during the meeting. Teaching others how to negotiate often creates a more collaborative environment in which the negotiation will take place (Schwartz & Pogge, 2000).</li>
                            <li><strong>Clarification of the Problem.</strong> The nurse manager wrote a list of problems raised by team members on the board in the conference room. As the list grew longer, she asked the group, "What do you see here? What is the real problem?" The group remained silent. Finally, someone in the back of the room said, "We don't have enough people, equipment, or supplies to get the work done." The rest of the group nodded in agreement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Opening Move.</strong> Once the problem is clarified, it is time to obtain everyone's agreement to discuss the matter and seek a way to resolve the conflict. In more formal negotiations, you may make a statement about what you wish to achieve. For example, if you are negotiating a salary increase, you might begin by saying, "I am requesting a 10 percent increase for the following reasons. . . ." Of course, your employer will probably make a counteroffer, such as, "The best I can do is 3 percent." These are the opening moves of a negotiation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Continue the Negotiations.</strong> The discussion should continue in an open, nonhostile manner. Each side's concerns may be further explained and elaborated. Additional offers and counteroffers are common. As the discussion continues, it is usually helpful to emphasize areas of agreement as well as disagreement so that both parties are encouraged to continue the negotiations (Tappen, 2001).</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>Agree on a Resolution of the Conflict</h4>
                        <p>After much testing for agreement, elaboration of each side's positions and concerns, and making offers and counteroffers, the people involved should finally reach an agreement.</p>
                        <p>The nurse manager of Teams A and B led them through a discussion of their concerns related to working with severely limited resources. The teams soon realized that they had a common concern and that they might be able to help each other rather than compete with each other. The nurse manager agreed to become more proactive in seeking more resources for the unit. "We can simultaneously seek new resources and develop creative ways to use the resources we already have," she told the teams. Relationships between members of Team A and Team B improved remarkably after this meeting. They learned that they could accomplish more by working together than they had ever achieved separately.</p>

                        <h3>Formal Negotiation: Collective Bargaining</h3>
                        <p>There are many varieties of formal negotiations, from real estate transactions to international peace treaty negotiations. One of the more formal negotiation processes of special interest to nurses is collective bargaining. Collective bargaining is a formal negotiation, a process that is governed by law and contracts (called collective bargaining agreements).</p>
                        <p>Collective bargaining involves a formal procedure governed by labor laws such as the National Labor Relations Act. Nonprofit healthcare organizations were added to the organizations covered by these laws in 1974. Once a union or professional organization has been designated as the official bargaining agent for a group of nurses, a contract defining such important matters as salary increases, benefits, time off, unfair treatment, and promotion of professional practice is drawn up. This contract then governs employee-management relations within the organization.</p>
                        <p>Case 3 is an example of how collective bargaining agreements can influence the outcome of a conflict between management and staff in a healthcare organization.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4>Case 3: Collective Bargaining</h4>
                            <p>The chief executive officer (CEO) of a large home health agency in a southwestern resort area called a general staff meeting. She reported that the agency had grown rapidly and was now the largest in the area. "Much of our success is due to the professionalism and commitment of our staff members," she said. "With growth come some problems, however. The most serious problem is the fluctuation in patient census. Our census peaks in the winter months when seasonal visitors are here and troughs in the summer. In the past, when we were a small agency, we all took our vacations during the slow season. This made it possible to continue to pay everyone his or her full salary all year. However, with the pressures to reduce costs and the large number of staff members we now have, we cannot continue to do this. We are very concerned about maintaining the high quality of patient care currently provided, but we have calculated that we need to reduce staff by 30 percent over the summer in order to survive financially."</p>
                            <p>The CEO then invited comments from the staff members. The majority of the nurses said they wanted and needed to work full-time all year. Most supported families and had to have a steady income all year. "My rent does not go down in the summer," said one. "Neither does my mortgage or the grocery bill," said another. A small number said that they would be happy to work part-time in the summer if they could be guaranteed full-time employment from October through May. "We have friends who would love this work schedule," they added.</p>
                            <p>"That's not fair," protested the nurses who needed to work full-time all year. "You can't replace us with part-time staff." The discussion grew louder and the participants more agitated. The meeting ended without a solution to the problem. Although the CEO promised to consider all points of view before making a decision, the nurses left the meeting feeling very confused and concerned about the security of their future income. Some grumbled that they probably should begin looking for new positions "before the ax falls."</p>
                            <p>The next day, the CEO received a telephone call from the nurses' union representatives. "If what I heard about the meeting yesterday is correct," said the representative, "your plan is in violation of our collective bargaining contract." The CEO reviewed the contract and found that the representative was correct. A new solution to the financial problems caused by the seasonal fluctuations in inpatient census would have to be found.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>A collective bargaining contract is a legal document that governs the relationship between management and staff represented by the union (which, for nurses, may be the nurses' association or another healthcare workers' union). The contract may cover some or all of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Economic issues:</strong> salaries, shift differentials, length of the workday, overtime, holidays, sick leave, breaks, health insurance, pensions, severance pay.</li>
                            <li><strong>Management issues:</strong> promotions, layoffs, transfers, reprimands, hiring and firing procedures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Practice issues:</strong> adequate staffing, standards of care, code of ethics, other quality-of-care issues, staff development opportunities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Concerns over issues such as restructuring and lower levels of RN staffing have increased interest in unionization recently (Murray, 1999).</p>
                        <h4>The Pros and Cons of Collective Bargaining</h4>
                        <p>Some nurses think that it is unprofessional to belong to a union. Others point out that physicians and teachers are also union members and that the protection of a union outweighs the downside. There is no simple answer to this question.</p>
                        <p>Probably the greatest advantage of collective bargaining is protection of the right to fair treatment and the availability of a grievance procedure that specifies both the employee's and the employer's rights and responsibilities if a disagreement arises that cannot be settled informally. The greatest disadvantage of using collective bargaining as a way to deal with conflict is that it clearly separates management-level people from stafflevel people, treating them as opposing parties rather than as people who are trying to work together to provide an essential service to their clients, which is our ultimate goal in dealing with problems and conflicts in the workplace.</p>

                        <p>A not-for-profit hospice center in a small community received a generous gift from the grateful family of a client who had died recently. The family asked only that the money be "put to the best use possible."</p>
                        <p>Everyone in this small facility had an opinion about the best use for the money. The administrator wanted to renovate their old, run-down headquarters. The financial officer wanted to put the money in the bank "for a rainy day." The chaplain wanted to add a small chapel to the building. The nurses wanted to create a food bank to help the poorest of their clients. The social workers wanted to buy a van to transport clients to healthcare providers. The staff agreed that all the ideas had merit, that all of the needs identified were important ones. Unfortunately, there was only enough money to meet one of them.</p>
                        <p>The more the staff members discussed how to use this gift, the more insistent each group became that their idea was best. At their last meeting, it was evident that some were becoming frustrated and others were becoming angry. It was rumored that a shouting match between the administrator and the financial officer had occurred.</p>

                            <li>In your analysis of this situation, identify the sources of the conflict that is developing within this facility.</li>
                            <li>What kind of leadership actions are needed to prevent the escalation of this conflict?</li>
                            <li>If the conflict does escalate, how could it be resolved?</li>
                            <li>Which idea do you think has the most merit?</li>
                            <li>Why did you select the one you did?</li>
                            <li>Try role-playing a negotiation among the administrator, the financial officer, the chaplain, a representative of the nursing staff, and a representative of the social work staff. Can you suggest a creative solution?</li>
