                        <p>For many of us, our jobs are a source of income and identity as well as where we spend a great deal of our waking hours. Unfortunately, jobs—while they help us pay for the things we need—can often be a source of ill health and unhappiness. While we have decreased problems with safety and physical working conditions such as hazardous toxins, cleanliness, noise, and cigarette smoke, complaints of job-related stress, have skyrocketed in recent years (Rosenthal, M., 1999, p. 19).</p>
                        <p>Many people are concerned about the amount of stress that they face in our fast-paced world and its effect on health and well-being. In fact, an entire periodical, Work & Stress, is devoted to the subject. Although many sources of stress are not new to the workplace, the decade of the 1990s added new stressors that are of particular concern for the new millennium (Table 10-1). Although most people report job satisfaction, only 10% of workers feel no stress in the workplace (Hall, C., & Lynn, G., 1999, p. 1B.) Consider the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>More people have heart attacks on Monday morning as they prepare to go to work than on any other day.</li>
                            <li>Stress in the workplace is increasing. One in four people between 25 and 44 suffers from stress-induced anxiety (Denene, 1998, p. 22).</li>
                            <li>Two-thirds of all office visits to physicians are the result of stress.</li>
                            <li>Stress plays a role in the two major killers of adults: heart disease and cancer.</li>
                            <li>Job stress is so prevalent that Objective 6.11 of Healthy People 2000 is to "increase to at least 40% the proportion of worksites employing 50 or more people that provide programs to reduce employee stress" (Wolinski, 1993, p. 721; USDHHS, 1991).</li>
                            <li>Stress-related problems are becoming the biggest reason for disability claims, costing the economy $200 billion in work-related missed days, injuries, lost productivity, and other medical claims (Deneen, 1998, p. 22).</li>

                        <h3>Effects of Stress</h3>
                        <p>Hans Selye first explored the concept of stress in the 1930s. He defined stress as the nonspecific response of the body to any demands made on it. His description of the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) has had an enormous influence on our present-day notions about stress and its effect on humans. The GAS consists of three stages: (1) alarm—when the body awakens to the stressor and there is a slight change below the normal level of resistance; (2) resistance—the body adjusts to the stressor and tries to restore balance; (3) exhaustion—as the stressor continues, the body energy falls below the normal level of resistance and illness may occur (1956). Most people think of stress as work pressure, rushhour traffic, or sick children. These are triggers to the stress response, the actual body reaction to the daily factors mentioned. As identified by Selye, stress is the fight-or-flight response in the body, caused by adrenaline and other stress hormones, causing the physiologic changes we learned in nursing school, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, faster breathing, dilated pupils, increased blood sugar, and dry mouth.</p>
                        <p>Currently, stress is assessed on three levels: environmental, psychological, and biologic. External factors (e.g., high unemployment rates) that make people more or less susceptible to disease are viewed as environmental stressors. On the psychological level, the individual's perception and evaluation of a situation influence the stress response, whereas the activation of the body on a physiological level is the biologic perspective on stress. Working together, these three factors influence our responses to stress (Cohn, Kessler, & Gordon, 1995).</p>
                        <p>Epidemiological research has shown that long-term stress contributes to cardiovascular disease, hypertension, ulcers, substance abuse, immune system disorders, emotional disturbances, and job-related injuries (Crawford, 1993; Lusk, 1993). Table 10-2 lists the most common physical and psychological signs of stress (Martin, 1993; Goliszek, 1992).</p>
                        <h3>Responses to Stress</h3>
                        <p>Some people manage potentially stressful events more effectively than others (Crawford, 1993; Teague, 1992). Perceptions of events and the subsequent stress responses vary considerably from one person to another. A patient crisis that you consider stressful, for example, may not seem stressful at all to a coworker. The following is an example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>A new graduate was employed on a busy telemetry floor. Often, when clients were admitted, they were in acute distress with shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and chest pain. Family members were distraught and anxious. Each time the new graduate had to admit a client, she experienced a "sick-to-her-stomach" feeling, tightness in the chest and throat, and difficulty concentrating. She was afraid that she would miss something important and that the client would die during the admission. The more experienced nurses seemed to handle each admission with ease, even when the client's physical condition was severely compromised.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>You have probably thought, "Nothing can be more stressful than going to school. I can't wait to go to work and not have to study for tests, go to the clinical agency for my assignment, do client care plans, and so forth." In most associate degree programs, students are assigned to care for one to three clients a day, working up to six or seven clients under a preceptor's supervision by the end of their program. Compare this with your "next clinical rotation," your first real job as a nurse. You may work 7 to 10 days in a row on 8 - to 12 hour shifts, caring for 10 or more clients. You may also have to supervise several technicians or licensed practical nurses. These drastic changes from school to employment cause many to experience what is called reality shock (Kramer, 1981; Kraeger & Walker, 1993).</p>
                        <p>Today's healthcare system has adopted the corporate mindset. Both the new graduate and the seasoned professional will continue to experience redesigning, changing staffing models, complex documentation requirements, and the expectation that work does not end when the employee goes home (Trossman, 1999). Most agencies expect new graduates to come to the work setting able to organize their work, set priorities, and provide leadership to ancillary personnel. New graduates often say, "I had no idea that nursing would be this demanding." Even though your program of study is designed to help you prepare for the demands of the work setting, you will still need to continue to learn on the job. In fact, experienced nurses will tell you that what you learned in school is only the beginning; it provides you with the fundamental knowledge and skills needed to continue to grow and develop as you practice nursing in various capacities and work settings. Graduation signals not the end of learning but the beginning of your journey toward becoming an expert nurse (Benner, 1984).</p>
                        <p>Well-supervised orientation programs are very helpful for newly licensed nurses. Many facilities provide an 8 - to 12 -week preceptor program. Unfortunately, this program is sometimes at the graduate's expense. Although the new graduate works side by side with an experienced nurse, employers sometimes consider this a pre-employment period for which they provide opportunities for further learning but no salary. The advantage of orientation programs is that they assist the new nurse in the transition from school to the work environment, thus buffering the stressors that can lead to reality shock.</p>
                        <p>The first few weeks on a new job are the "honeymoon" phase. The new employee is excited and enthusiastic about the new position. Coworkers usually go out of their way to make the new person feel welcome and overlook any problems that arise. Everything seems rosy. Unfortunately, honeymoons do not last forever.</p>
                        <p>The new graduate is soon expected to behave just like everyone else and discovers that expectations for a professional employed in an organization are quite different from expectations for a student in school. Those behaviors that brought rewards in school are not necessarily valued by the organization. In fact, some of them are criticized. The new graduate who is not prepared for this change feels confused, shocked, angry, and disillusioned. The tension of the situation can become almost unbearable if it is not resolved.</p>
                        <h3>Differences in Expectations</h3>
                        <p>The enthusiasm and eagerness of the first new job quickly disappear as reality sets in. Regardless of the career one chooses, there is no perfect job. The problem begins when reality and expectations collide. To cope with reality, we must recognize several facts of work life (Goliszek, 1992, pp. 36, 46):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Expectations are usually distortions of reality. Unless we accept this and react positively, we will go through life experiencing disappointment. As a student you had only two or three patients to care for, and you are very surprised to hear your first full day off orientation that you have five patients. Although you did hear the nurses talking about their caseload while you were a student, you expected to continue to have two or three patients for at least the next 4 months.</li>
                            <li>To some extent, you need to fit yourself into your work, not fit the work to suit your needs or demands. Having a positive attitude helps to maintain flexibility and a sense of humor. Your first position is at a physician's office. He is about ready to retire, and his patient load is dwindling. You wanted to apply for a position in acute care, but you have a very active social life and did not want to work weekends.</li>
                            <li>Regardless of the job, the way you perceive events on the job will influence how you feel about your work. Your mental attitude will affect whether work is a pleasant or unpleasant experience. Health care is not easy. Sick people can be cranky and demanding. Healthcare agencies continue to want to do more with less. How you perceive your contribution to the healthcare system will definitely influence your reality.</li>
                            <li>Feelings of helplessness and powerlessness at work cause frustration and unrelieved job stress. If you go to work every day feeling that you do not make a difference, it is time to reevaluate your position and your goals.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>What are these differences in expectations? Kramer (1981), who studied reality shock for many years, found a number of them, which are listed in Table 10-3.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Ideally, health care should be comprehensive. Not only should it meet all of a client's needs, but also it should be delivered in a way that considers the client as a whole person, a member of a particular family that has certain unique characteristics and needs, and a member of a particular community. Most healthcare professionals, however, are not employed to provide comprehensive, holistic care. Instead, they are asked to give medications, provide counseling, make home visits, or prepare someone for surgery, but rarely to do all these things. These tasks are divided among different people, each a specialist, for the sake of efficiency rather than continuity or effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>When efficiency is the goal, the speed and amount of work done are rewarded rather than the quality of the work. This also creates a conflict for the new graduate, who was allowed to take as much time as needed to provide good care while in school.</p>
                        <p>Expectations are also communicated in different ways. In school, an effort is made to provide explicit directions so that students know what they are expected to accomplish. In many work settings, however, instructions on the job are brief, and many expectations are left unspoken. New graduates who are not aware of these expectations may find that they have unknowingly left tasks undone or are considered inept by coworkers. The following is an example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Brenda, a new graduate, was assigned to give medications to all the clients cared for by the team. Because this was a fairly light assignment, the graduate spent some time looking up the medications and explaining their actions to the clients receiving them. Brenda also straightened up the medicine room and filled out the order forms, which she thought would please the task-oriented team leader.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the day, Brenda reported these activities with some satisfaction to the team leader. She expected the team leader to be pleased with the way the time had been used. Instead, the team leader looked annoyed and told her that whoever passes out medications always does the blood pressures too and that the other nurse on the team, who had a heavier assignment, had to do them. Also, because supplies were always ordered on Fridays for the weekend, it would have to be done again tomorrow, so Brenda had in fact wasted her time.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Additional Pressures on the New Graduate</h3>
                        <p>The first job a person takes after finishing school is often thought of as a proving ground where newly gained knowledge and skills are tested. Many set up mental tests for themselves that they feel must be passed before they can be confident of their ability to function. Passing these self-tests also confirms achievement of identity as a practitioner rather than a student.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, new graduates are undergoing testing by their coworkers, who are also interested in finding out whether the new graduate can handle the job. The new graduate is entering a new group, and the group will decide whether to accept this new member. This testing is somewhat like hazing of freshmen entering high school or college. It is usually reasonable, but sometimes new graduates are given tasks that they are not ready to handle. If this happens, Kramer (1981) recommends that new graduates refuse to take the test rather than fail it. Another opportunity for proving themselves will soon come along.</p>
                        <p>The discrepancies in role expectations and the need for a feeling of competency are the top two concerns of new graduates, according to most surveys. Next in order of concern are the system that must be dealt with, one's selfconcept, and the type of feedback that is given (or not given). Additional problems, such as dealing with resistant staff members, cultural differences, and age differences, may also occur. Before considering ways to resolve these problems, we look at some less successful ways of coping with these problems.</p>
                        <p><strong>Abandon professional goals.</strong> When faced with reality shock, some new graduates abandon their professional goals and adopt the organization's operative goals as their own. This eliminates their conflict but leaves them less effective caregivers. It also puts the needs of the organization before their needs or the needs of the client and reinforces operative goals that might better be challenged and changed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Give up professional ideals.</strong> Others give up their professional ideals but do not adopt the organization's goals or any others to replace them. This has a deadening effect; they become automatons, believing in nothing related to their work except doing what is necessary to earn a day's pay.</p>
                        <p><strong>Leave the profession.</strong> Those who do not give up their professional ideals try to find an organization that will support them. Unfortunately, a significant proportion of those who do not want to give up their professional ideals escape these conflicts by leaving their jobs and abandoning their profession. Kramer and Schmalenberg (1993) believe that there would be fewer shortages of nurses if more healthcare organizations met these ideals.</p>
                        <p><strong>Develop a professional identity.</strong> Opportunities to challenge one's competence and develop an identity as a professional can begin in school. Success in meeting these challenges can immunize the new graduate against the loss of confidence that accompanies reality shock.</p>
                        <p><strong>Learn about the organization.</strong> The new graduate who understands how organizations operate will not be as shocked as the naive individual. When you begin a new job, it is important to learn as much as you can about the organization and how it really operates. This not only saves you some nasty surprises but also gives you some ideas about how to work within the system and how to make the system work for you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Use your energy wisely.</strong> Keep in mind that much energy goes into learning a new job. You may see many things that you think need to be changed, but you need to recognize that to implement change also takes time and energy on your part. It is a good idea to make a list of these things so that you do not forget them later when you have become socialized into the system and have some time and energy to invest in change.</p>
                        <p><strong>Communicate effectively.</strong> Deal with the problems that can arise with coworkers. The same interpersonal skills you use in communicating with patients can be effective in dealing with your coworkers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Seek feedback often and persistently.</strong> Seeking feedback not only provides you with needed information but also pushes the people you work with to be more specific about their expectations of you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Develop a support network.</strong> Identifying colleagues who have also held onto their professional ideals and sharing not only your problems but also the work of improving the organization with them are a helpful cushion against reality shock. Their recognition of your work can keep you going when rewards from the organization are meager. A support network is a source of strength when resisting pressure to give up professional ideals and a source of power when attempting to bring about change. Developing your skills can help to prevent the problems of reality shock. Begin early in your career to protect yourself against reality shock.</p>
                        <p><strong>Find a mentor.</strong> A mentor is someone more experienced within or outside the organization that provides career development behaviors, such as coaching, sponsoring advancement, providing challenging assignments, protecting protégés from adversity, and promoting positive visibility. Mentors provide guidance to the new graduate as he or she changes from student to professional nurse. Mentors can also fulfill psychosocial roles, such as personal support, friendship, acceptance, role modeling, and counseling. Many organizations have preceptors for the new employee. In many instances, the preceptor will become your mentor. However, the mentor role is much more encompassing than the preceptor role. The mentor relationship is a voluntary one and is built on mutual respect and development of the mentee. Table 10-4 identifies responsibilities of the mentor and mentee in this relationship (Scheetz, 2000; Simonetti & Ariss, 1999).</p>

                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>The ultimate result of unmediated job stress is burnout. The term burnout became a favorite buzzword of the 1980s and continues to be part of today's vocabulary. Herbert Freudenberger formally identified it as a leadership concern in 1974. The literature on job stress and burnout continues to grow as new books, articles, workshops, and videotapes appear regularly. A useful definition of burnout is the "progressive deterioration in work and other performance resulting from increasing difficulties in coping with high and continuing levels of job-related stress and professional frustration" (Paine, 1984, p. 1).</p>
                        <p>Much of the burnout experienced by nurses has been attributed to the frustration that arises because care cannot be delivered in the ideal manner they learned in school. For those whose greatest satisfaction comes from caring for clients, anything that interferes with providing the highest quality care causes work stress. The often unrealistic and sometimes sexist image of nurses in the media, to which we all are exposed, adds to this frustration. Neither the school ideal nor the media image is realistic, but either may make nurses feel dissatisfied with themselves and their jobs, keeping stress levels high (Corley, Farley, Geddes, Goodloe, & Green, 1994; Fielding & Weaver, 1994; Grant, 1993; Kovner, Hendrickson, Knickman, & Finkler, 1994; Malkin, 1993; Nakata & Saylor, 1994; Skubak, Earls, & Botos, 1994).</p>

                            <p>Sharon had wanted to be a nurse for as long as she could remember. She married early, had three children, and put her dreams of being a nurse on hold. Now her children are grown, and she finally realized her dream by graduating last year from the local community college with a nursing degree. However, she has been feeling overwhelmed at work, critical of coworkers and patients, and argumentative with supervisors. She is having difficulty adapting to the restructuring changes at her hospital and goes home angry and frustrated every day. She cannot stop working for financial reasons but is seriously thinking of quitting nursing and taking some computer classes. "I'm tired of dealing with people. Maybe machines will be more friendly and predictable." Sharon is experiencing burnout.</p>

                        <p>Goliszek (1992) has identified four stages of the burnout syndrome:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>High expectations and idealism.</strong> At the first stage, the individual is enthusiastic, dedicated, and committed to the job and exhibits a high energy level and positive attitude.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pessimism and early job dissatisfaction.</strong> In the second stage, frustration, disillusionment, or boredom with the job develops, and the individual begins to exhibit the physical and psychological symptoms of stress.</li>
                            <li><strong>Withdrawal and isolation.</strong> As the individual moves into the third stage, anger, hostility, and negativism are exhibited. The physical and psychological stress symptoms worsen. Through stage three, simple changes in job goals, attitudes, and behaviors may reverse the burnout process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Irreversible detachment and loss of interest.</strong> As the physical and emotional stress symptoms become severe, the individual exhibits low self-esteem, chronic absenteeism, cynicism, and total negativism. Once the individual has moved into this stage and remained there for any length of time, burnout is inevitable. Regardless of the cause, experiencing burnout leaves an individual emotionally and physically exhausted.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Stressors Leading to Burnout</h3>
                        <h4>Personal Factors</h4>
                        <p>Some of the personal factors influencing job stress and burnout are age, sex, number of children, education, experience, and favored coping style. For example, the fact that many nurses are single parents raising families alone adds to the demands of already difficult days at work. Married nurses may have the additional stress of dual-career homes, causing even more stress in coordinating work and vacation schedules as well as day care problems. Baby boomers are finding they need to care for elderly parents along with their children (DeFrank & Ivancevich, 1998). Competitive, impatient, and hostile personality traits have also been associated with emotional exhaustion and subsequent burnout (Borman, 1993).</p>
                        <h4>Job Stress</h4>
                        <p>Researchers have identified five sources of job stress that can lead to burnout (Carr & Kazanowski, 1994; Crawford, 1993; Duquette, Sandhu, & Beaudet, 1994):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Intrinsic factors:</strong> Characteristics of the job itself, such as the multiple aspects of complex client care that many nurses provide.</li>
                            <li><strong>Organizational structure:</strong> Characteristics of the organization in which you work, such as limited financial resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reward system:</strong> The way in which employees are rewarded or punished, particularly if these are obviously unfair.</li>
                            <li><strong>Human resources system:</strong> In particular, the number and availability of opportunities for staff development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> The way in which managers relate to their staff, particularly if they are unrealistic, uncaring, or unfair.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Work Environments</h4>
                        <p>Recent studies indicate that different demands are placed on nurses in different work environments. For example, the strict boundaries and bureaucratic organization of acute care and inpatient long-term care facilities can be stressful for those who have difficulty with a great deal of structure. On the other hand, the ambiguity, autonomy, and flexibility of community-based practice can be uncomfortable for those who need structure and clearly defined work expectations (Borman, 1993). Staff shortages, cost cutting, and the push to work faster with fewer resources—regardless of the work environment—are being felt by all nurses. Another major source of burnout in the work environment is the feeling that complaints and suggestions often fall on deaf ears (Macready, 1998). Workplace issues are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11.</p>
                        <h4>Human Service Occupations</h4>
                        <p>People who work in human service organizations consistently report lower levels of job satisfaction than do people working in other types of organizations. Much of the stress experienced by nurses is related to the nature of their work: continued intensive, intimate contact with people who often have serious and sometimes fatal physical, mental, emotional, or social problems. Efforts to save clients or help them achieve a peaceful ending to their lives are not always successful. Despite our best efforts, many of our clients get worse, not better. Some return to their destructive behaviors; others do not recover but die. The continued loss of clients alone can lead to burnout (Tappen, 1995). Even exposure to medicinal and antiseptic substances, unpleasant sights, and high noise levels can cause stress for some people. Healthcare providers experiencing burnout may become cynical and even hostile toward their coworkers and colleagues (Carr & Kazanowski, 1994; Dionne-Proulx & Pepin, 1993; Goodell & Van Ess Coeling, 1994; Stechmiller & Yarandi, 1993; Tumulty, Jernigan, & Kohut, 1994).</p>
                        <p>In some instances, human service professionals also experience lower pay, longer hours, and more extensive regulation than do professionals in other fields. Inadequate advancement opportunities for women and minorities in lower-status, lower-paid positions are apparent in many healthcare areas.</p>
                        <h4>Conflicting Demands</h4>
                        <p>Meeting work-related responsibilities and maintaining a family and personal life can increase stress when there is insufficient time or energy for all of these. As mentioned in the section on personal factors, both the single parent and the married one are at risk because of the conflicting demands of their personal and work lives. The perception of balance in one's life is a personal one. There appear to be some differences in the way that men and women find a comfortable balance. Men often define themselves in terms of their separateness and their career progress; women are more likely to define themselves through attachment and connections with other people. Women who try to focus on occupational achievement and pursue personal attachments at the same time are likely to experience conflict in both their work and personal lives. In addition, society evaluates the behaviors of working adult men and women differently. "When a man disrupts work for his family, he is considered a good family man, while a woman disrupting work for family risks having her professional commitment questioned" (Borman, 1993, p. 1).</p>
                        <h4>Technology</h4>
                        <p>Decisions related to changes in technology are often made without input from employees. These same employees are then required to adapt and cope with the changes. How many of the following changes have you had to adapt to in the not so distant past: e-mail, voice mail, fax machines, computerized charting, desktop computers, cellular phones? Often employees feel that their role has become secondary to technology (DeFrank & Ivancevich, 1998).</p>
                        <h4>Lack of Balance in Life</h4>
                        <p>When personal interests and satisfactions are limited to work, a person is more susceptible to burnout; trouble at work becomes trouble with that individual's whole life. A job can become the center of someone's world, and that world can become very small. Two ways out of this are to set limits on the commitment to work and to expand the number of satisfying activities and relationships outside of work. Many people in the helping professions have difficulty setting limits on their commitment. This is fine if they enjoy working extra hours and taking calls at night and on weekends, but if it exhausts them, then they need to stop doing it or risk serious burnout. For example, when you are asked to work another double shift or the third weekend in a row, you can say no. At the same time as you are setting limits at work, you can expand your outside activities so that you live in a large world in which a blow to one part can be cushioned by support from other parts. If you are the team leader or nurse manager, you also need to recognize and accept staff members' need to do this as well. Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Do I exercise at least three times weekly?</li>
                            <li>Do I have several close friends that I see regularly?</li>
                            <li>Do I have a plan for my life and career that I have told someone about?</li>
                            <li>Do I have strong spiritual values that I carry out in practice regularly?</li>
                            <li>Do I have some strong personal interests that I regularly enjoy?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Studies have shown that the two best indicators of customer satisfaction were related to employee satisfaction and employee work-life balance. Well-rounded employees have a different perspective on life and are perceived by employers as more trustworthy and more grounded in reality. Ultimately, you do not have to give up your personal life to excel in your professional life (Farren, 1999, p. 36).</p>
                        <h3>Consequences</h3>
                        <p>You can see that certain combinations of personal and organizational factors can increase the likelihood of burnout. Finding the right fit between your own preferences and the characteristics of the organization you work for can be keys to preventing burnout. Health care demands adaptable, innovative, competent employees who care about their clients, desire to continue learning, and try to remain productive despite constant challenges. Unfortunately, these are the same individuals who are prone to burnout if preventive action is not taken (Lickman, Simms, & Greene, 1993; McGee-Cooper, 1993).</p>
                        <p>Burnout has financial, physical, emotional, and social implications for the professional, the clients, and the organization. Burnout can happen to anyone, not just to people with a history of emotional problems. In fact, it is not considered an emotional disturbance in the sense that depression is but, instead, a reaction to sustained organizational stressors (Duquette, Sandhu, & Beaudet, 1994).</p>
                        <h3>A Buffer Against Burnout</h3>
                        <p>The idea that personal hardiness provides a buffer against burnout has been explored in recent years. Hardiness includes the following:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>A sense of personal control rather than powerlessness</li>
                            <li>Commitment to work and life's activities, rather than alienation</li>
                            <li>Seeing both life's demands and change as challenges, rather than as threats</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The hardiness that comes from having this perspective leads to the use of adaptive coping responses, such as optimism, effective use of support systems, and healthy lifestyle habits (Duquette, Sandhu, & Beaudet, 1994; Nowak & Pentkowski, 1994).</p>

                        <p>Although we cannot always control the demands placed on us, we can learn to manage our reactions to them and to make healthy lifestyle choices that better prepare us to meet demands.</p>
                        <h3>ABCs of Stress Management</h3>
                        <p>Frances Johnston (1994, pp. 5-6) suggests using the ABCs of stress management (awareness, belief, and commitment) to have as constructive a response to stress as possible (Box 10-1). Let's look at these ABCs in a little more detail.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">BOX 10-1: ABCs OF STRESS MANAGEMENT</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Acquire</strong> awareness of your own responses to stress and the consequences of too much stress.</li>
                                <li><strong>Believe</strong> that you can change your perspective and your behavior.</li>
                                <li><strong>Commit</strong> yourself to taking action to prevent conflicts that cause stress, to learning techniques that help you cope in situations over which you have no control, and to understanding that you can choose how to react in stressful situations.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Awareness</h4>
                        <p>How do you know that you are under stress and may be beginning to burn out? The key is being honest with yourself. Asking yourself the questions in Box 10-2 and answering them honestly are one way to assess your personal risk. To further analyze your responses to stress, you may also want to answer the questions in Box 10-3. The answers to these questions require some thought. You do not have to share your answers with others unless you want to, but you do need to be completely honest with yourself when you answer them or the exercise will not be worth the time spent on it. Try to determine the sources of your stress (Goliszek, 1992, p. 13):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is it the time of day when you are doing the activity?</li>
                            <li>Is it the reason that you are doing the activity?</li>
                            <li>Is it the way in which you are doing the activity?</li>
                            <li>Is it the amount of time you need to do the activity?</li>

                        <h4>Belief</h4>
                        <p>Now that you have done the "A" part of stress management, you are ready to move on to "B," which is belief in yourself. Your relationship with your inner self may be the most important relationship of all. Building your self-image and self-esteem will enable you to block out negativism (Davidhizar, 1994). You must also believe that your destiny is not inevitable but that change is possible. Be honest with yourself. Truly value your life. Ask yourself, "If I could live one more month, what would I do?"—and start doing it (Johnston, 1994)!</p>
                        <h4>Commitment</h4>
                        <p>As you move forward to step "C," you will need to make a commitment to continuing to work on stress recognition and reduction. Once you have recognized the warning signs of stress and impending burnout and have gained some insight into your personal needs and reactions to stress, it is time to find the stress management techniques that are right for you.</p>
                        <p>The stress management techniques in the next section are divided into physical and mental health management for ease in reading and remembering them. However, bear in mind that this is really an artificial division and that mind and body interact continuously. Stress affects both mind and body, and we need to care for both if we are to be successful in managing stress and preventing burnout.</p>
                        <h3>Physical Health Management</h3>
                        <p>Nurses spend much of their time teaching their clients the basics of keeping themselves healthy. However, many fail to apply these principles in their own lives. We review some of the most important aspects of health promotion and stress reduction in this section: deep breathing, good posture, rest, relaxation, proper nutrition, and exercise (Davidhizar, 1994; Posen, 2000; Wolinski, 1993).</p>
                        <h4>Deep Breathing</h4>
                        <p>Most of the time people use only 45% of their lung capacity when they breathe. Remember all the times when you have instructed your clients to "take a few deep breaths"? Practice taking a few slow, deep, "belly" breaths. When faced with a stressful situation, people often hold their breath for a few seconds. This reduces the amount of oxygen delivered to the brain and causes them to feel more anxious. Anxiety can lead to faulty reasoning and a feeling of losing control. Often you can calm yourself by taking a few deep breaths. Try it right now. Don't you feel better already?</p>
                        <h4>Good Posture</h4>
                        <p>A common response to pressure is to slump down into your chair, tensing your upper torso and abdominal muscles. Again, this restricts blood flow and the amount of oxygen reaching your brain. Instead of slumping, imagine a hook on top of your head pulling up your spine, relax your abdomen, and look up. Now, shrug your shoulders a few times to loosen the muscles and picture a sunny day at the beach or a walk in the woods. Do you feel more relaxed?</p>
                        <h4>Rest</h4>
                        <p>Sleep needs are different for each of us. Find out how much sleep you need and work on arranging your activities so that you get enough sleep. If it is impossible to get enough sleep on a given day, perhaps a short nap or just closing your eyes for a few minutes will help. Irregular sleep cycles over the long term can be unhealthy and increase stress. Power naps of 5 to 20 minutes can be rejuvenating.</p>
                        <h4>Relaxation and Time-Outs</h4>
                        <p>Many people have found that relaxation with guided imagery or other forms of meditation decreases both the physiological and psychological impact of chronic stress. Guided imagery has been used in competitions for many years. Research studies have shown that creation of a mental image of the desired results enhances our ability to reach the goal. Positive behavior or goal attainment is enhanced even more if you imagine the details of the process of achieving your desired outcome (Vines, 1994). Box 10-4 lists useful relaxation techniques.</p>
                        <p>Imagine taking the NCLEX examination. You sit down at the computer, take a few deep breaths, and begin. Visualize yourself reading the questions, smiling as you identify the correct answer, and hitting the Enter key after recording your answer. You complete the examination, feeling confident that you were successful. A week later, you go to your mailbox and find a letter waiting for you: "Congratulations, you have passed the test and are now a licensed registered nurse." You imagine telling your family and friends. What an exciting moment!</p>
                        <p>Taking breaks and time-outs during the day for a short walk or a refreshment (not caffeine) break or just to daydream can help destress you during the day. Just as we have circadian rhythms during the night, we have ultradian rhythms during the day. These cycles are peaks of energy with troughs of low energy. Watching for these low energy cycles and taking breaks at that time will help to keeping stress from building up.</p>

                        <h4>Proper Nutrition</h4>
                        <p>New research results endorsing the benefits of healthful eating habits seem to appear almost daily. Although the various authorities may prescribe somewhat different regimens, ultimately it appears that too little or too much of any nutrient can be harmful. Many people do not realize that simply decreasing or discontinuing caffeine can help decrease a stress reaction in the body. Some general guidelines for good nutrition are included in Box 10-5.</p>
                        <h4>Exercise</h4>
                        <p>Regular aerobic exercise for 20 minutes three times a week is recommended for most people. The exercise may be walking, swimming, jogging, bicycling, stair-stepping, or lowimpact aerobics. Whichever you choose, work at a pace that is comfortable for you and increase it gradually as you become conditioned. Don't overdo it. The experience should leave you feeling invigorated, not exhausted.</p>
                        <p>The physiological benefits of exercise are well known. Exercise may not eliminate the stressors in our lives, but it is an important element in a healthy lifestyle. Exercise has been shown to improve people's mood and to induce a state of relaxation through the reduction of physiological tension. Regular exercise decreases the energy from the fight-or-flight response discussed in the beginning of this chapter.</p>
                        <p>Exercise can also be a useful distraction, allowing time to regroup before entering a stressful situation again (Long & Flood, 1993). It is important to choose an exercise that you enjoy doing and that fits into your lifestyle. Perhaps you could walk to work every day or pedal an exercise bicycle during your favorite television program. It is not necessary to join an expensive club or to buy elaborate equipment or clothing to begin an exercise program. It is necessary to get up and get moving, however.</p>
                        <p>Some people recommend an organized exercise program to obtain the most benefit. For some, however, the cost or time required may actually contribute to their stress. For others, the organized program is an excellent motivator. Find out what works for you.</p>
                        <p>Keep your exercise plan reasonable. Plan for the long haul, not just until you get past your next performance evaluation or lose that extra 5 pounds.</p>

                        <h3>Mental Health Management</h3>
                        <p>Mental health management begins with taking responsibility for your own thoughts and attitudes. Do not allow self-defeating thoughts to dominate your thinking. You may have to remind yourself to stop thinking that you have to be perfect all the time. You may also have to adjust your expectations and become more realistic. Do you always have to be in control? Does everything have to be perfect? Do you have a difficult time delegating? Are you constantly frustrated because of the way you perceive situations? If you are answering yes to many of these questions, you may be setting yourself up for failure, resentment, low self-esteem, and burnout. Give yourself positive strokes, even if no one else does (Davidhizar, 1994; Posen, 2000; Wolinski, 1993).</p>
                        <h4>Realistic Expectations</h4>
                        <p>One of the most common stressors in life is having unrealistic expectations. Expecting family members, coworkers, and your employer to be perfect and meet your every demand on your time schedule is setting yourself up for undue stress.</p>
                        <h4>Reframing</h4>
                        <p>Reframing is looking at a situation from many different ways. When we reframe stressful situations, they often become less stressful or at least more understandable. If we have an extremely heavy workday and we think it is because the nurse manager has it "in for us," the day becomes much more stressful than if we realize that, unfortunately, today we are short-staffed but staffing is usually okay most of the time.</p>
                        <h4>Humor</h4>
                        <p>Laughter relieves tension. Humor is a wonderful way to reduce stress both for yourself and your patients. Remember, though, that humor is very individual, and what may be funny to you may be hurtful to your patient or coworker.</p>
                        <h4>Social Support</h4>
                        <p>Much research has been done to show that the presence of social support and the quality of relationships can significantly influence how quickly we become ill and how quickly we recover. A sense of belonging and community, an environment in which we can share our feelings without fear of condemnation or ridicule, helps us maintain our well-being. Having friends with whom to share hopes, dreams, fears, and concerns and to laugh and cry with is paramount to our mental health and stress management. In the work environment, coworkers who are trusted and respected become part of our social support systems (Wolinski, 1993). Box 10-6 lists some additional tips for coping with work stress.</p>
                        <p>Nurses are professional caregivers. Many years ago, Carl Rogers (1977) said that you cannot care for others until you have taken care of yourself. The word selfish may bring to mind someone who is greedy, self-centered, and egotistical, but to take care of yourself, you have to be creatively selfish. Learn to nurture yourself so that you will be better able to nurture others.</p>
                        <p>Stress reduction, relaxation techniques, exercise, and good nutrition are all helpful in keeping energy levels high. However, although they can prepare people to cope with the stresses of a job, they are not solutions to the conflicts that lead to reality shock and burnout. It is more effective to resolve the problem than to treat the symptoms (Lee & Ashforth, 1993). Box 10-7 lists keys to physical and mental health management.</p>

                        <p>You already know that the work of nursing is not easy and may sometimes be very stressful. Yet nursing is also a profession filled with much personal and professional satisfaction. Periodically ask yourself the questions designed to help you assess your stress level and risk for burnout and review the stress management techniques described in this chapter.</p>
                        <p>There is no one right way to manage stress and avoid burnout. Rather, by managing small segments of each day, you will learn to identify and manage your stress. This chapter contains many reminders to help you de-stress during the day (Box 10-8). You can also help your colleagues do the same. If you find yourself in danger of job burnout during your career, you will have learned how to bring yourself back to a healthy, balanced position.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, we can't live in a problemfree world, but we can learn how to handle stress. Using the suggestions in this chapter, you will be able to adopt a healthier personal and professional lifestyle.</p>

                                <li><strong>Express yourself!</strong> Communicate your feelings and emotions to friends and colleagues to avoid isolation and share perspectives. Sometimes another opinion helps you see the situation in a different light.</li>
                                <li><strong>Take time off.</strong> Taking breaks, or doing something unrelated to work, will help you feel refreshed as you begin work again.</li>
                                <li><strong>Understand your individual energy patterns.</strong> Are you a morning or an afternoon person? Schedule stressful duties during times when you are most energetic.</li>
                                <li><strong>Do one stressful activity at a time.</strong> Although this may take advanced planning, avoiding more than one stressful situation at a time will make you feel more in control and satisfied with your accomplishments.</li>
                                <li><strong>Exercise!</strong> Physical exercise builds physical and emotional resilience. Don't put physical activities on the back burner as you get busy.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tackle big projects one piece at a time.</strong> Having control of one part of a project at a time will help you to avoid feeling overwhelmed and out of control.</li>
                                <li><strong>Delegate if possible.</strong> If you can delegate and share in problem solving—do it! Not only will your load be lighter, but others will be able to participate in decision making.</li>
                                <li><strong>It's okay to say no.</strong> Don't take on every extra assignment or special project.</li>
                                <li><strong>Be work-smart.</strong> Improve your work skills with new technologies and ideas. Take advantage of additional job training.</li>
                                <li><strong>Relax.</strong> Find time each day to consciously relax and reflect on the positive energies you need to cope with stressful situations more readily.</li>

                            <p>In this qualitative study, data were gathered from first-person accounts of professionals who successfully recovered from burnout. In this study, successful recovery was defined as being in a job situation considered satisfactory by the subject and with the subject having no desire to change jobs. Subjects had to have taken 1 month or more sick leave because of work stress or burnout, had to have solved the related problems within the last 4 years, be human service workers, and be available for interviews. Twenty subjects were recruited and interviewed from the Province of Quebec in Canada. Grounded theory was selected as the framework. The unstructured interviews were conducted by the same person and lasted an average of 90 minutes each. Results of the recovery stages were: (1) A sequence of stages: (a) admitting the problem, (b) distancing from work, (c) restoring health, (d) questioning values, (e) exploring work possibilities, (f) making a break, making a change; the second aspect of the recovery process (2) was the coping strategies: (a) seeking reassurance, (b) understanding causes, (c) finding support.</p>
                            <p>This study provides an interesting framework for the general stages and specific coping strategies associated with burnout.

                        <p>Shawna, the "new kid on the block," has been working from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on an infectious disease floor since obtaining her RN license 4 months ago. Most of the staff she works with have been there since the unit opened 5 years ago. On a typical day, the staffing consists of a nurse manager, two RNs, an LPN, and one technician for approximately 40 clients. The majority of the clients are HIV-positive with multisystem failure. Many are severely debilitated and need help with their activities of daily living. Although the staff members encourage family members and loved ones to help, most of them are unavailable because they work during the day. Several days a week, the nursing students from Shawna's community college program are assigned to the floor.</p>
                        <p>Tina, the nurse manager, does not participate in any direct client care, saying that she is "too busy at the desk." Laverne, the other RN, says the unit depresses her and that she has requested a transfer to pediatrics. Lynn, the LPN, wants to "give meds" because she is "sick of the clients' constant whining," and Sheila, the technician, is "just plain exhausted." Lately, Shawna has noticed that the other staff members seem to avoid the nursing students and reply to their questions with terse, short answers. Shawna is feeling alone and overwhelmed and goes home at night worrying about the clients, who need more care and attention. She is afraid to ask Tina for more help because she doesn't want to be seen as incompetent or a complainer. When she confided in Lynn about her concerns, Lynn replied, "Get real—no one here cares about the clients or us. All they care about is the bottom line! Why did a smart girl like you choose nursing in the first place?"</p>
