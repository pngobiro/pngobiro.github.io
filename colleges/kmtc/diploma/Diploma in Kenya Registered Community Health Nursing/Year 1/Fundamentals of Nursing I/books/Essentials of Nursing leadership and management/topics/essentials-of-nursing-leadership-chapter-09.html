                        <p>When asked the theme of a recent nursing management conference, a top nursing executive thought for a moment and then replied, "Change, change, and more change." Change seems to be occurring at a more rapid pace than ever before in the workplace. People working today can expect to make as many as 7 to 10 major job changes in their lifetime. Compare this to the experiences of their parents who, on average, made only one or two major job changes in their lives (Dent, 1995). In this chapter, we discuss the process of change, how people respond to change, and how leaders and managers can influence change.</p>

                        <h3>A Natural Phenomenon</h3>
                        <p>Change is a naturally occurring phenomenon, simply a part of living. Every day, we have new experiences, meet new people, learn something new. We grow up, leave home, graduate from college, begin a new career, perhaps begin a new family. Some of these changes are milestones in our lives, ones we have prepared for and anticipated for some time. Others are entirely unexpected—sometimes welcome and sometimes not. Many are exciting, leading us to new opportunities and challenges. When these changes occur too rapidly or demand too much of us, however, they can make us very uncomfortable.</p>
                        <h3>Macro and Micro Change</h3>
                        <p>The "ever-whirling wheel of change" (Dent, 1995, p. 287) in health care seems to spin faster every year. Cost containment, managed care, Medicare and Medicaid reform, work redesign, restructuring, and downsizing are major concerns (Aiken, 1995). The changes sweeping through our healthcare system affect clients and caregivers alike. These changes in the healthcare system are macro-level (large-scale) changes that affect virtually every healthcare facility: changes in the way client care is delivered, reduction in the number of staff members employed, restrictions on spending, and so forth. These macro-level changes are discussed in more detail in other chapters of this book.</p>
                        <p>Change anywhere in a system creates "ripples throughout the system" (Parker & Gadbois, 2000, p. 472). Every change that occurs at this macro level filters down to the micro (small-scale) level, to our teams and to us as individuals. For better or worse, nurses, their colleagues in other disciplines, and their clients are participants in these changes. This micro level of change is the primary focus of this chapter.</p>

                        <p>Lewin's (1951) model of change is one of the most frequently used and easily understood approaches to planning and implementing change in organizations. Many people have added their own elaborations to this model, but its basic ideas remain the same. The basic elements of Lewin's change model are unfreezing, change, and refreezing. Let's assume that a work situation is basically stable before change is introduced. Although some changes occur naturally, people are generally accustomed to each other, have a routine for doing their work, and are pretty confident that they know what to expect and how to deal with whatever problems may arise in the course of a day. Farrell and Broude (1987) call this the "comfort zone." A change of any magnitude is likely to move people out of this comfort zone into discomfort. Lewin calls this movement unfreezing (Fig. 9-1).</p>

                            <p>Many healthcare institutions have offered nurses the choice of weekday or weekend work on day, evening, or night shifts. Given these choices, nurses with young children are likely to find their "comfort zone" on weekday evening or night shifts. Imagine the discomfort they would experience if confronted with a change to alternate weekends or day shifts on call.</p>
                            <p>Announcement of such a change would rapidly unfreeze their usual routine and move them into the discomfort zone, the change phase.</p>
                            <p>They might have to find a new babysitter or begin a search for a new child care center that is open on weekends. An alternative would be the establishment of a child care center where they work. Another alternative would be to find a new position that allows greater choice of working hours.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Whatever alternative they chose, the nurses would be challenged to find a solution that allows them to move into a new comfort zone. To do this, they would have to find a consistent, dependable source of child care suited to their new schedule and to the needs of their children—in other words, a way to refreeze their situation and move into a new comfort zone. If the nurses do not find a satisfactory alternative, they could remain in an unsettled state, in the discomfort zone, caught in a conflict between their professional and personal responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>As this example illustrates, even a small change can be very disruptive to the people involved in it. In the next section, we consider the many reasons that change is unsettling and why people resist it.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>People resist change for a variety of reasons, which vary from person to person and situation to situation. For example, you may find that one client care technician is delighted with an increase in responsibility and another one is upset about being given the same increase in responsibility. Some are ready to risk change, and others seem to prefer maintaining the status quo (Hansten & Washburn, 1999). You may also find that one change in routine provokes a storm of protest, whereas another change is hardly noticed. Let's see why this is true.</p>
                        <h3>Sources of Resistance</h3>
                        <p>Resistance to change comes from three major sources: technical concerns, psychosocial needs, and threats to a person's position and power (Araujo Group, no date).</p>
                        <h4>Technical Concerns</h4>
                        <p>Some resistance to change is based on concerns about whether the proposed change itself is a good idea. In some cases, these concerns are justified.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>The Professional Practice Committee of a small hospital suggested replacing a commercial mouthwash with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water to save money. A staff nurse objected to this proposed change, saying that she had read a research study several years ago that found peroxide solutions to be an irritant to the oral mucosa (Tombes & Gallucci, 1993).</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, the chairperson of the Professional Practice Committee recognized that this objection was based on technical concerns and requested that a more thorough study of the research literature be done before instituting the change. "From now on," she told the staff nurse, "we will investigate the implications of a proposed change more thoroughly before recommending it. Thank you."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4>Psychosocial Needs</h4>
                        <p>According to Maslow (1970), human beings have a hierarchy of needs, from basic physiological needs for oxygen, fluids, and nutrients to the higher-order needs for belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization (Fig. 9-2). Maslow observed that the more basic needs (those lower on the hierarchy) must be at least partially met before a person is motivated to seek fulfillment of the higher-order needs.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_25_8d0a0d2b8b6b5731b36fg-129-1.jpg" alt="A pyramid diagram of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, starting from the lowest level: Physiological needs, Safety and security, Love and belonging, Esteem, and Self-actualization at the highest level, with examples for each." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 9-2 • Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Source: Based on Maslow, A.H. (1970). Motivation and Personality. New York: Harper & Row.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Change can make it more difficult for a person to meet any or all of these physiological and psychosocial needs. For example, if a massive downsizing occurs and a person's job is eliminated, fulfillment of virtually all of these levels of needs may be threatened, from having enough money to pay for food and shelter to opportunities to fulfill one's career potential.</p>
                        <p>In other cases, the threat is subtler and may be harder for the leader or manager to anticipate. For example, an institution-wide evaluation of the effectiveness of the advanced practice role would be a great threat to a staff nurse who is working toward accomplishment of a lifelong dream of becoming an advanced practice nurse in oncology. In contrast, it would have little impact on nursing aides unless further action was taken. A staff reorganization that involves reassigning aides to different units, however, would threaten the belonging needs of an aide who has very close friends on his or her unit but few friends outside work.</p>
                        <h4>Position and Power</h4>
                        <p>Status, power, and influence, once gained within an organization, are hard to give up. This applies to people anywhere in the organization, not just those at the top.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>A clerk in the surgical suite had been preparing the operating room schedule for many years. Although his supervisor really had the authority to revise the schedule, she rarely did so because the clerk was skillful in preparing realistic schedules that balanced the needs and desires of various parties, including some very demanding surgeons.</p>
                            <p>When the operating room supervisor was transferred to another facility, her replacement decided that she had to review the schedules before they were posted because they were ultimately her responsibility. The clerk became defensive. He tried to avoid the supervisor and posted the schedules without her approval whenever he could. This surprised the new supervisor. She had heard how skillful the clerk was and did not think that her review of the schedules would be threatening. She had not realized the importance of this task to the clerk.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The opportunity to tell others when and where they could operate had given this clerk a feeling of power and importance. The supervisor's insistence on reviewing his work had reduced the importance of his position.</p>
                        <p>What seemed to the new supervisor to be a very small change in routine had provoked surprisingly strong resistance because it threatened the clerk's position and power within the organization.</p>
                        <p>As you learned in Chapter 7 on power and organizations, empowerment is a source of motivation and satisfaction for most people. Although change can empower people, it can also threaten their sense of empowerment, especially when they feel that the change was imposed on them and that they had no choice in the matter.</p>
                        <h3>Recognizing Resistance</h3>
                        <p>It is easy to recognize resistance to a change when it is expressed directly. When a person says to you, "That's not a very good idea," "I'll quit if you reassign me to the night shift," or "There's no way I'm going to do that," there is no doubt that you are encountering resistance. When resistance is less direct, however, it can be difficult to recognize unless you know what to look for.</p>
                        <p>Resistance may be active or passive (Heller, 1998). Active resistance can take the form of attacks or outright refusals to comply, such as the statements in the previous paragraph, writing "killer" memos that destroy the idea or the person who suggested it, quoting existing rules that make the change difficult or impossible to implement, or organizing resistance to the change (encouraging others to resist). Passive approaches use avoidance: canceling appointments to discuss implementation of the change, being "too busy" to make the change, refusing to commit to changing or agreeing to it but doing nothing to change, and simply ignoring the entire process as much as possible (Table 9-1). Once resistance has been recognized, action can be taken to lower or even eliminate it.</p>

                        <h3>Lowering Resistance</h3>
                        <p>A great deal can be done to lower people's resistance to change. Strategies fall into four categories: information dissemination, disconfirmation of currently held beliefs, provision of psychological safety, and by command (Tappen, 2001).</p>
                        <h4>Information Dissemination</h4>
                        <p>Much resistance is simply the result of misunderstandings about a proposed change. Sharing information about the proposed change can be done on a one-to-one basis, in group meetings, or through written materials distributed to everyone involved using print or electronic means.</p>
                        <h4>Disconfirmation of Currently Held Beliefs</h4>
                        <p>Leaders often can take action that provides a catalyst for change (Lichiello & Madden, 1996). For example, simply providing information is often persuasive enough to lower resistance to change when people are reluctant to give up their current beliefs, opinions, or comfortable routines. When this happens, providing evidence that what people are doing or believing is inadequate, incorrect, or inefficient can increase their willingness to change.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Jolene was a little nervous when it was her turn to present information on a new enteral feeding procedure to the Clinical Practice Committee. Committee members were very demanding: they wanted clear, research-based information presented in a concise manner. Opinions, generalities, and vague references ("Somebody told me . . .") were not acceptable. She had prepared thoroughly and even practiced her presentation at home until she could speak without referring to her notes.</p>
                            <p>The presentation went well. Committee members commented on the thoroughness of her presentation and the quality of the information presented. To her disappointment, however, no action was taken on her proposal to adopt the new procedure. Returning to her unit, she shared her disappointment with the nurse manager. Together, they reviewed the presentation using Lewin's approach to bringing about change as a guide.</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager agreed that Jolene had thoroughly reviewed the information on enteral feeding. The problem, she explained, was that Jolene had not attended to the need to unfreeze a situation to lower resistance to change. As they talked, Jolene realized that she had not put any emphasis on the high risk of contamination and resulting gastrointestinal disturbances of the procedure currently in use. In other words, members of the committee were still feeling comfortable with the current procedure because she had not emphasized the risk involved in failing to change it.</p>
                            <p>At the next meeting, Jolene presented additional information on the risks associated with the current enteral feeding procedures. This disconfirming evidence was persuasive. The committee accepted her proposal to adopt the new, lower-risk procedure.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Without the addition of the disconfirming evidence that Jolene presented at the second meeting, it is likely that her proposed change in procedure would never have been implemented. The inertia (tendency to remain in the same state rather than to move toward change) exhibited by the Clinical Practice Committee is not unusual (Pearcey & Draper, 1996).</p>
                        <h4>Psychological Safety</h4>
                        <p>When a proposed change threatens the basic human needs of individuals or groups of individuals in some way, resistance can be lowered by reducing that threat, leaving people feeling more comfortable about the proposed change. Although each situation poses different kinds of threats and requires different actions to reduce these threats, the following is a list of common strategies that help increase psychological safety and reduce resistance to change:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Point out the similarities between the old and new procedures.</li>
                            <li>Express approval of people's concern for providing the best care possible.</li>
                            <li>Recognize the competence and skill of the people involved.</li>
                            <li>Provide assurance (if possible) that no one will lose his or her position because of the change.</li>
                            <li>Suggest ways in which the change can provide new opportunities and challenges (that is, new ways to increase self-esteem and self-actualization).</li>
                            <li>Express your valuing of each individual's and group's contributions in general and to the proposed change.</li>
                            <li>Ensure involvement of as many people as possible in both the design of the change and the implementation (Hastings & Waltz, 1995).</li>
                            <li>Provide opportunities for people to express their feelings and ask questions about the proposed change.</li>
                            <li>Allow time for practice and learning of any new procedures, if possible, before a change is implemented.</li>
                            <li>Provide a climate of acceptance in which some mistakes can be made without negative consequences for individuals.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When all the preceding are done within a climate of trust and acceptance of each other's differences, changes are far easier to implement.</p>
                        <h4>Command</h4>
                        <p>An entirely different approach to change can be used. People in authority within an organization can simply require people to make a change in what they are doing or can reassign people to new positions (Porter O'Grady, 1996). This is effective in many situations but may not work well if there are ways for people to resist:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When passive resistance can undermine the change.</li>
                            <li>When high motivational levels are necessary to make the change successful.</li>
                            <li>If people can refuse to obey the order without negative consequences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Communicating a sense of urgency and necessity regarding the change to be made will reinforce the use of authority (Kotter, 1999).</p>
                        <p>The following is an example of an unsuccessful attempt to bring about change by command:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>A new and still insecure nurse manager believed that her staff members were taking advantage of her inexperience by taking more than the two 15-minute coffee breaks allowed during an 8-hour shift. She decided that staff members would have to sign in and out for their coffee breaks as well as for their 30-minute meal break.</p>
                            <p>The staff members were outraged by this change. Most had been taking less than two 15-minute coffee breaks and 30 minutes for meals because of the heavy client care demands of the unit.</p>
                            <p>Staff members refused to sign the "coffee break sheet." When asked why they hadn't signed it, they replied "I forgot," "I couldn't find it," or "I was called away before I had a chance." This organized passive resistance was sufficient to overcome the nurse manager's authority. The nurse manager decided that the "coffee break sheet" had been a mistake, removed it from the bulletin board, and never spoke of it again.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>For people in authority, acting by command often seems to be the easiest way to bring about change: just tell people what to do and don't listen to any arguments about it. There is risk in this approach, however. High levels of involvement in planning the change may slow down the process of implementation (and sometimes results in a standoff and no change), but it usually produces a high level of commitment to the change once it is accepted (Conger, Spreitzer, & Lawler, 1999). Even when staff members do not resist authority-based change, overuse of commands can lead to staff members who are passive, dependent, unmotivated, and unempowered. Providing high-quality patient care requires staff members who are active, motivated, and highly committed to their work, just the opposite of the results of authority-based change.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Given the current climate of "change, change, and more change," even new graduates find themselves given responsibility for bringing about change. Some examples of the kinds of changes that you might be asked to assist in implementing are the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Revising old procedures or adding new technical procedures.</li>
                            <li>Devising new ways to record, store, and retrieve patient data.</li>
                            <li>Developing new policies for staff evaluation and promotion.</li>
                            <li>Participating in quality improvement projects.</li>
                            <li>Preparing for accreditation visits and inspections.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now that you understand how change can affect people and have learned some ways to lower their resistance to change, we can discuss taking a leadership role in successful implementation of change.</p>
                        <p>The entire process of bringing about change can be divided into four phases: designing the change itself, deciding how to implement the change, the actual implementation of the change, and following through to ensure that the change has been integrated into the regular operation of the facility (Fig. 9-3).</p>

                        </figure>
                        <h3>Designing the Change</h3>
                        <p>The first step in bringing about change is to carefully craft the change itself. It cannot be assumed that every change is for the better. Some changes fail because they are poorly conceived in the first place.</p>
                        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the purpose of this change? What are we trying to accomplish?</li>
                            <li>Is the change necessary?</li>
                            <li>Is the change technically correct?</li>
                            <li>Will this work?</li>
                            <li>Is there a better way to do this?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Planning the Implementation</h3>
                        <p>The next step is to prepare a careful plan to implement the change. All the information presented previously about sources of resistance and ways to overcome that resistance should be taken into consideration when deciding how to implement a change.</p>
                        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Why might people resist this change?</li>
                            <li>Would their resistance be justified?</li>
                            <li>What can be done to prevent or overcome this resistance?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The context in which the change will take place is another factor to consider when assessing resistance to change (Lichiello & Madden, 1996). This includes the amount of change occurring at the same time, the organizational climate, and the environment in which the organization exists. For example, in some situations there may be external pressure to change because of the competitive nature of the healthcare market in a particular community. In other situations, government regulations may make it difficult to bring about a desired change.</p>
                        <p>Almost everything that you have learned about effective leadership is useful in planning the implementation of change: motivating people, involving people in decisions that affect them, dealing with conflict, eliciting cooperation, providing coordination, and fostering teamwork. All of these should be taken into consideration in formulating a plan for implementation of a proposed change and then acted on in the next step: implementing the change.</p>
                        <h3>Implementing the Change</h3>
                        <p>Now, finally, you are ready to make the change that has been so carefully planned. In addition to the strategies to lower resistance, increasing motivation, and helping people work well together, consider the following factors related to change.</p>
                        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the magnitude of this change? Is this a major change that affects almost everything people do, or is it a minor one with little impact on what people do every day?</li>
                            <li>What is the complexity of this change? Is this a difficult change to make? Does it require much new knowledge or skill, or both? How long will it take for people to acquire the necessary knowledge and skill?</li>
                            <li>What is the pace of the change? How urgent is this change? Can it be done gradually or must it be implemented all at once?</li>
                            <li>What is the current stress level of the people involved in this change? Is this the only change that is taking place, or is it just one of many changes taking place? How stressful are these changes? How can you help people keep their stress levels within tolerable bounds?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As indicated earlier, some discomfort is likely to occur with almost any change, but it is important to keep it within tolerable limits.</p>
                        <h3>Integrating the Change</h3>
                        <p>Don't forget this last step. After the change has been made, it is important to make sure that everyone has moved into a new "comfort zone."</p>
                        <p>Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the change well integrated into everyday operations?</li>
                            <li>Are people comfortable with it now?</li>
                            <li>Is it well accepted? If not, why not? What can be done to increase acceptance? Is there any residual resistance that could still undermine full integration of the change? If there is, how can this resistance be overcome?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As Kotter noted, change "sticks" when, instead of being the new way to do something, it becomes "the way we always do things around here" (1999, p. 18).</p>

                        <p>A large healthcare corporation recently purchased a small (50-bed) rural nursing home. A new director of nursing was brought in to replace the former one, who had retired after 30 years at this facility.</p>
                        <p>The new director addressed the staff members at the reception held to welcome him. "My philosophy is that you cannot manage anything that you haven't measured. Everyone tells me that you have all been doing an excellent job here.</p>
                        <p>With my measurement approach, we will be able to analyze everything you do and become more efficient than ever."</p>
                        <p>The nursing staff members soon found out what the new director meant by his "measurement" approach. Every bath, episode of incontinence care, feeding of a resident, or trip off the unit had to be counted, and the amount of time each activity required had to be recorded. Nurse managers were required to review these data with staff members every week, questioning any time that was not accounted for. Time spent talking with families or consulting with other staff members was considered time wasted unless the staff member could justify the "interruption" in his or her work.</p>
                        <p>No one complained openly about the change, but absenteeism rates increased rapidly. Personal day and vacation time requests soared. Staff members nearing retirement crowded the tiny personnel office, overwhelming the single staff member with their requests to "tell me how soon I can retire on full benefits." The director of nursing found that shortage of staff was becoming a serious problem and that few new applications were coming in, despite the fact that this rural area offered few good job opportunities.</p>

                            <li>What could the director of nursing do to increase acceptance of this change? What could the nurse managers and staff nurses do?</li>
