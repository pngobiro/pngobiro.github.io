                        <p>The subjects of this chapter-organizations, power, and empowerment-are not as remote from a nurse's everyday experience as you may first think. Consider the following scenarios, which are analyzed later in the chapter:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4>Scenario 1</h4>
                            <p>In school, Hazel Rivera had always received high praise for the quality of her nursing care plans. "Thorough, comprehensive, systematic, holistic-beautiful!" was the comment she received on the last one she wrote before graduation.</p>
                            <p>Now Hazel is a staff nurse on a busy orthopedic surgery unit. Although her time to write comprehensive care plans during the day is limited, Hazel often stays after work to complete them. Her friend Carla refuses to stay late with her. "If I can't complete my work during the shift, then they have given me too much to do," she explains.</p>
                            <p>At the end of their 3-month probationary period, Hazel and Carla received written evaluations of their progress and comments about their value to the organization. To Hazel's surprise, her friend Carla received a higher rating than she did. What happened?</p>
                        </aside>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4>Scenario 2</h4>
                            <p>The nursing staff of the critical care department of a large urban hospital formed a research utilization group about a year ago. They had made a number of changes in their practice based on reviews of the research on several different procedures and were quite pleased with the results.</p>
                            <p>"Let's look at the bigger picture next month," their nurse manager suggested at one of their meetings. "This time, let's look at the research on different models of client care. We might get some good ideas for our unit." The staff nurses agreed. It would be a nice change to look at the way they organized client care in their department.</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager found a wealth of information on different models for organizing nursing care. One research study about a model for caring for the chronically critically ill (Rudy et al., 1995) particularly interested them because they had had many clients in that category.</p>
                            <p>Several nurses volunteered to form an ad hoc committee to design a similar unit for the chronically critically ill within their critical care department. When the plan was presented, both the nurse manager and the staff thought it was excellent. The nurse manager offered to present the plan to the vice president for nursing. The staff eagerly awaited the vice president's response.</p>
                            <p>The nurse manager returned with discouraging news. The vice president did not support their concept and said that, although they were free to continue developing the idea, they should not assume that it would ever be implemented. What happened?</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Were the disappointments experienced by Hazel Rivera and the critical care department staff predictable? Could they have been avoided? Without a basic understanding of the organizations within which we work and of the part that power plays in the decision-making processes that occur within healthcare institutions, we are doomed to be continually surprised by the responses to our well-intentioned efforts. As you read this chapter, you will learn why Hazel Rivera and the critical care department staff were disappointed.</p>
                        <p>We begin by looking at some of the characteristics of the organizations in which nurses work and how these organizations operate. Then we zero in on the subject of power within organizations: what it is, how one obtains it, and how nurses can be empowered.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>One of the attractive features of nursing as a career is the wide variety of settings in which nurses can work. From rural migrant health clinics to organ transplant units, nurses' skills are needed wherever there are concerns about people's health. Relationships with clients may extend for months or years, as they do in school health or in nursing homes, or they may be brief and never repeated, as often happens in doctors' offices, clinics, and emergency departments.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Healthcare Organizations</h3>
                        <p>Although some nurses work as independent practitioners, as consultants, or in the corporate world, the majority are employed by healthcare organizations. These organizations can be classified into three types on the basis of their sponsorship and financing:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Private not-for-profit.</strong> Many healthcare organizations were founded by civic, charitable, or religious groups. Some have been in existence for generations. Many of our hospitals, long-term care facilities, home care services, and community agencies began this way.</li>
                            <li><strong>Publicly supported.</strong> Government-operated service organizations range from county public health departments to complex medical centers, such as those operated by the Veterans Administration, a federal agency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Private for-profit.</strong> Increasing numbers of healthcare organizations are operated for profit like any other business. These include large hospital and nursing home chains; health maintenance organizations (HMOs); and many free-standing centers that provide special services, such as surgical and diagnostic centers.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The differences between these categories have become blurred in recent years for a number of reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>All compete for clients, especially for clients with healthcare insurance or the ability to pay their own healthcare bills.</li>
                            <li>All are feeling the effect of cost constraints.</li>
                            <li>All may provide services that are eligible for government reimbursement, particularly Medicaid and Medicare funding, if they meet government standards.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Organizational Climates</h3>
                        <p>The size and complexity of many healthcare organizations make them difficult to understand. One way to begin to develop an understanding is to find a colorful image or metaphor that sums up their characteristics in a few well-chosen words. Morgan (1997) suggests using animals or other familiar images to describe an organization. For example, an aggressive organization that crushes its competitors could be likened to a bull elephant, whereas a timid organization in danger of being crushed by that bull elephant could be described as a mouse. In the same way, an organization adrift without a clear idea of its future could be described as a "rudderless boat on a stormy sea," whereas an organization with its sights set clearly on exterminating its competition could be described as a "guided missile."</p>
                        <p>Organizations differ a great deal. Some are very traditional, preserving their customary ways of doing things even when these processes no longer work well. Others are very progressive, eternally chasing the newest management fad or buying the very latest high-tech equipment. Some seem to be warm, friendly, and open to new people and new ideas. Others are cold, defensive, and indifferent or even hostile to the outside world (Tappen, 2001). These very different organizational climates have a considerable effect on the employees and the people served by the organization. The climate shapes people's behavior, especially their responses to each other, a very important factor in health care.</p>
                        <p>To find out what the climate of an organization is when you are seeking a new position or trying to familiarize yourself with your new workplace, you can ask several people who work there or have considerable familiarity with the organization to describe it in just a few words. Once you have grasped the totality of an organization in terms of its overall climate, you are ready to analyze it in a little more detail. This involves identification of the organization's goals, structure, and processes.</p>
                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                        <p>Try answering this true-or-false question:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>Question:</strong> The primary goal of any healthcare organization is to keep people healthy, restore them to health, or assist them in dying as comfortably as possible. True or false?</p>
                            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> False. The previous statement is only partially correct. Most healthcare organizations have several goals, some more immediately apparent than others.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>What other goals could a healthcare organization possibly have? The following are some examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Survival.</strong> Organizations have to maintain their own existence, a goal that is threatened when, for example, the organization fails to meet the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations’ standards or is unable to collect money owed by its clients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Growth.</strong> The chief executive officers (CEOs) of many organizations also want to help their organizations grow by expanding into new territories, adding new services, and bringing in new clients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Profit.</strong> For-profit organizations are expected to return some profit to their owners. Not-for-profit organizations have to be able to pay their bills and to avoid getting into too much debt. Even this is sometimes difficult for an organization.</li>
                            <li><strong>Status.</strong> The leaders or owners of many healthcare organizations also want to be known as the best in their field, for example, by having the best open-heart surgeon, having "top-notch" nurses, or providing the most attractive patient rooms and views in town.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dominance.</strong> Some organizations also want to drive others out of the healthcare business or gobble them up, surpassing the goal of survival and moving toward dominance of a particular market by driving out the competition.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These additional goals are not as often discussed in public as the first, more lofty statement of goals in our true-or-false test. However, they still drive the organization, especially the way the organization handles its finances and treats its employees.</p>
                        <p>These goals may have profound effects on every one of the organization's employees, nurses included. For an example, let's return to the story of Hazel Rivera. Why did she receive a less favorable rating than her friend Carla?</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>After comparing ratings with her friend Carla, Hazel scheduled another meeting with her nurse manager to discuss her evaluation. The nurse manager explained the rating: Hazel's care plans were very well done, and she genuinely appreciated Hazel's efforts to make them so. The problem was that Hazel had to be paid overtime for this work according to the union contract, and this had reduced the amount of overtime pay the nurse manager had available when the patient care load was especially high. "The corporation is very strict about staying within the budget," she said. "In fact, my rating is higher when I don't use up all of the budgeted overtime hours."</p>
                            <p>When Hazel asked what she could do to improve her rating, the nurse manager offered to help her streamline the care plans and manage her time better so that the care plans could be done during her shift.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Structure</h3>
                        <h4>The Traditional Approach</h4>
                        <p>Virtually all healthcare organizations have a hierarchical structure of some kind (see Box 7-1). In a traditional hierarchical structure, employees are ranked from the top to the bottom as if they were on the various steps of a ladder (Fig. 7-1). The number of people on the bottom rungs of the ladder is almost always much greater than the number at the top. The president or CEO is usually at the top of this ladder; the maintenance crew is usually at the bottom. Nurses fall somewhere in the middle of most healthcare organizations, higher than the cleaning people, aides, and technicians but lower than physicians and administrators.</p>
                        <p>The people at the top of the ladder have authority to issue orders, spend the organization's money, and hire and fire people. Much of this authority is delegated to people below them, but they retain the right to reverse a decision or regain control of these activities whenever they deem it necessary.</p>
                        <p>The people at the bottom have little authority and usually no part in deciding how money is spent or who will be hired or fired but are responsible for carrying out the directions from people above them on the ladder. The people at the bottom are not entirely without power or the ability to influence people higher up on the ladder, however. Without the people at the bottom of the ladder, the organization could not function. If there was no one at the bottom, the work of the organization would not get done. The people at the top depend on the people lower on the ladder to get most of the work done.</p>
                        <h4>More Innovative Approaches</h4>
                        <p>There is much interest in restructuring organizations, not only to save money but also to make the best use of a healthcare organization's most valuable resource, its people. This begins with hiring the right people. It also involves providing them with the resources they need to function and the kind of leadership that can inspire the staff and unleash their creativity (Rosen, 1996).</p>
                        <p>Increasingly, people recognize that organizations need to be not only efficient but also adaptable and innovative. Organizations need to be prepared for uncertainty, for rapid changes in their environment, and for rapid, creative responses to these challenges. In addition, they need to provide an internal climate that not only allows but also motivates employees to work to the best of their ability. They need to stop thinking, to paraphrase Parker and Gadbois, of the managers as the brains of the organization and employees as the muscle (2000, p. 428).</p>
                        <p>More innovative organizations have adapted a more organic structure that is looser, more flexible, and less centralized than the traditional hierarchical structure. In these organically structured organizations, decisions are made by the people who will implement them, not by their bosses or by their bosses' boss.</p>
                        <p>The organic network emphasizes increased flexibility of the organizational structure, decentralized decision making, and autonomy for working groups or teams. Once rigid department or unit structures are reorganized into autonomous teams made up of professionals from different departments and disciplines, each team is given a specific task or function to carry out (e.g., a hospital infection control team, a child protection team in a community agency). These teams are responsible for their own self-correction and selfcontrol, although they may also have a designated leader. Together, team members make decisions about work assignments and how to deal with any problems that arise. In other words, the teams supervise and manage themselves.</p>
                        <p>Supervisors, administrators, and support staff have different functions in an organic network. Instead of spending their time observing and controlling other people's work, they become planners and resource people. They are responsible for providing the conditions required for the optimal functioning of the teams and are expected to ensure that the support, information, materials, and budgeted funds needed to do the job well are available to the teams. They also provide more coordination between the teams so that the teams are cooperating rather than blocking each other, working toward congruent goals, and not duplicating effort.</p>
                        <p>Very large organizations can also be separated into functional divisions that operate as though they were smaller, independent organizations. This reduces complexity and allows each division to be better integrated when the integration of the organization as a whole becomes virtually impossible because of its great size, complexity, and diversity. However, communication among divisions can become more difficult. This is a downside of organic structure. If not done well, there is a potential for creating chaos and confusion instead of creativity (Senge et al., 1999).</p>
                        <p>Organic networks have been compared to spider plants with their central cluster and offshoots (Morgan, 1997). Each cluster could represent a discipline (e.g., nursing, social work, occupational therapy) or a service (e.g., psychiatry, orthopedics). For example, Figure 7-2 shows an organic network for a wellness center. Each cluster represents a separate set of services. A client might use just one or all of them in developing a personal plan for wellness. Staff members may move from one cluster to another, or the entire configuration of interconnected clusters may be reorganized as the organization shapes and is shaped by the environment.</p>

                             <h4 class="callout-title">BOX 7-1: WHAT IS A BUREAUCRACY?</h4>
                            <p>Although it seems as if everyone complains about "the bureaucracy," not everyone is clear about what a bureaucracy really is. Max Weber defined a bureaucratic organization as having the following characteristics:</p>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li><strong>Division of Labor:</strong> Specific parts of the job to be done are assigned to different individuals or groups. For example, nurses, physicians, therapists, dietitians, and social workers all provide portions of the health care needed by an individual patient.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hierarchy:</strong> All employees are organized and ranked according to their degree of authority within the organization. For example, administrators and directors are at the top of most hospital hierarchies, whereas aides and maintenance workers are at the bottom.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rules and Regulations:</strong> Acceptable and unacceptable behavior and the proper way to carry out various tasks are defined, often in writing. For example, procedure books, policy manuals, bylaws, statements, and memos prescribe many types of behavior, from acceptable isolation techniques to vacation policies.</li>
                                <li><strong>Emphasis on Technical Competence:</strong> People with certain skills and knowledge are hired to carry out specific parts of the total work of the organization. For example, a community mental health center will have psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and nurses to provide different kinds of therapies and clerical staff to do the typing and filing.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Some degree of bureaucracy is characteristic of the formal operation of virtually every organization, even the most deliberately informal, because it promotes smooth operations within a large and complex group of people.</p>

                        <h3>Processes</h3>
                        <p>In much the same way that organizations have some publicly announced goals as well as less publicized ones, they also have formal processes for getting things done and informal ways to get around the formal processes (Perrow, 1969). The formal processes are the written policies and procedures that virtually all healthcare organizations have. The informal processes are neither written nor discussed most of the time. They exist in virtually all organizations as a kind of "shadow" organization that is harder to see but equally important to recognize and understand (Purser & Cabana, 1999). The informal process often is much simpler and faster than the formal one. Because the informal ways of getting things done are seldom discussed (and certainly not a part of your new employees' orientation), it may take some time for you to figure out what they are and how to use them. Once you are aware of the existence of these informal processes, they may be easier for you to identify. The following is an example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Jocylene noticed that Harold seemed to get stat laboratory results back on his patients faster than she did. Although the results she requested came back quickly, the turnaround time for Harold's clients seemed almost instantaneous. At lunch one day, Jocylene asked Harold why that happened.</p>
                            <p>"That's easy," he said. "The people in our lab feel unappreciated. I always tell them how helpful they are. Also, if you call and let them know that the specimens are coming, they will get to them faster. They can't monitor their e-mail constantly."</p>
                            <p>Harold has just explained an informal process to Jocylene.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Sometimes, the informal processes are more hidden or people are unwilling to discuss them. However, careful observation of the most experienced, "system-wise" individuals in your organization will eventually reveal them to you. This will help you get things done as efficiently as they do.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Although the leadership and management techniques discussed so far will help you to achieve your goals, there are times when these attempts to influence others are overpowered by other forces or individuals. Where does this power come from? Who has it? Who does not?</p>
                        <p>In the earlier section on hierarchy, it was noted that, although people at the top of the hierarchy have most of the authority in the organization, they do not have all of the power. In fact, the people at the bottom of the hierarchy also have some sources of power. In this section, we explain how this can be true. First, we define power and then we consider the sources of power available to people on the lower rungs of the ladder.</p>
                        <h3>Definition</h3>
                        <p>Power is the ability to influence other people despite resistance on the part of the other person. Power may be actual or potential, intended or unintended (Lukes, 1986). It may also be used for good or for evil, for serious purposes or for selfish ones.</p>
                        <h3>Sources</h3>
                        <p>There are many sources of power. Some of them are readily available to nurses, but some of them are not. The following is a list derived primarily from the work of French as well as Raven and Etzioni (Barraclough & Stewart, 1992).</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Authority:</strong> The power granted to an individual or a group by virtue of position (within the organizational hierarchy, for example).</li>
                            <li><strong>Reward:</strong> The promise of money, goods, services, recognition, or other benefits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Expertise:</strong> The special knowledge an individual is believed to possess. As Sir Francis Bacon said long ago, "Knowledge is power" (Bacon, 1597, quoted in Fitton, 1997, p. 150).</li>
                            <li><strong>Coercion:</strong> The threat of pain or of harm, which may be physical, economic, or psychological.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let's look at various groups of people in a healthcare organization in terms of the types of power that may be available to them:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li><strong>Managers</strong> are able to reward people with salary increases, promotions, and recognition. They can also cause economic or psychological pain for the people who work for them, particularly through their authority to evaluate and fire people.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patients</strong> at first appear to be relatively powerless in a healthcare organization. However, if patients refused to use the services of a particular organization, that organization would eventually cease to exist. Patients reward healthcare workers by praising them to their supervisors. They can also cause discomfort by complaining about them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nurses</strong> have expertise power and authority over licensed practical nurses, aides, and other personnel by virtue of their position in the hierarchy. They are critical to the operation of most healthcare organizations and could cause considerable trouble if they refused to work, another source of power.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assistants and technicians</strong> may appear to be relatively powerless because of their low position in the hierarchy. Imagine, however, how the work of the organization (e.g., hospital, nursing home) would be impeded if all the nursing aides failed to appear one morning.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Fralic (2000) offers a good example of the power of information that nurses have:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Florence Nightingale showed very graphically in the 1800s that wherever her nurses were, far fewer died, and wherever they were not, far more died.</p>
                            <p>Think of the power of that information. Immediately people were saying, "What would you like, Miss Nightingale? Would you like more money? Would you like a school of nursing? What else can we do for you?" She had solid data, she knew how to collect it, and she knew how to interpret and distribute it in terms of things that people valued (p. 340).</p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <span class="heading-text">EMPOWERING NURSES</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In this last section, we look at several ways in which nurses, either individually or collectively, can maximize their power and increase their feelings of empowerment, both individually and as a group.</p>
                        <p>First, however, we should distinguish between the concepts of power and empowerment. Power is the actual or potential ability to "recognize one's will even against the resistance of others," according to Max Weber (quoted in Mondros & Wilson, 1994, p. 5). Empowerment refers to a psychological state, a feeling of competence, control, and entitlement. Given these definitions, it is possible to be powerful and yet not feel empowered. The reverse is also true: people can feel empowered and yet not have maximized their power (Mondros & Wilson, 1994). So, although the terms power and empowerment are closely related, power refers to action, and empowerment refers to feelings. Both are of interest to nursing leaders and managers.</p>
                        <p>Nurses, like most people, want to have some power and to feel empowered (Mondros & Wilson, 1994). They want to be heard, to be recognized, to be valued, and to be respected. They do not want to feel unimportant or insignificant to society or to the organization in which they work.</p>
                        <h3>Professional Organizations</h3>
                        <p>Although we address the purpose of the American Nurses Association and other professional organizations in Chapter 16, here we look at them specifically in terms of how they can empower nurses.</p>
                        <p>Our collective voice, expressed through these organizations, is often stronger and more easily heard than is one individual's voice. By joining together in professional organizations, nurses can be heard and their value recognized. The power base of our professional organizations is derived from the number of nurses who are members and from their expertise in health matters. Why there is power in numbers may need some further explanation. Large numbers of active, informed members of an organization represent large numbers of potential voters to state and national legislators, most of whom wish to be remembered favorably in forthcoming elections. Large groups of people also have a louder voice: they can write more letters, speak to more friends and family members, make more telephone calls, and generally attract more attention than small groups can.</p>
                        <p>Professional organizations can empower nurses in a number of ways. The first is collegiality-an opportunity to work with one's peers on issues of importance to the profession. The second is commitment to improving the health and well-being of the people served by the profession. The third is representation in state legislatures and in Congress when issues of importance to nursing arise. The fourth is through representation during collective bargaining, the protection of nurses' rights and privileges as employed professionals. The fifth is enhancement of competence through publications and continuing education. The sixth is recognition through certification programs, awards, and use of the media.</p>
                        <h3>Collective Bargaining</h3>
                        <p>Collective bargaining also uses the power of numbers, in this case for the purpose of equalizing the power of employees and employer to improve working conditions (Tappen, 2001). As indicated earlier, when people join together for a common cause, they are often more powerful than when they attempt to bring about change individually. Large numbers of people have the potential to cause more psychological or economic pain (coercive power) than an individual can. For example, the resignation of one nursing assistant or even one nurse may cause a temporary problem but is usually resolved fairly quickly by hiring another individual. If 50 or 100 aides or nurses resign, however, the organization can be virtually paralyzed and will have much more difficulty replacing these essential workers. Collective bargaining takes advantage of this power in numbers.</p>
                        <p>An effective collective-bargaining contract can provide considerable protection to employees. However, the downside of collective bargaining (as with most uses of coercive power) is the tendency to encourage conflict rather than cooperation between employees and managers. Many nurses are also concerned about the effect that going out on strike might have on their clients' welfare and on their own economic security. Most administrators and managers prefer to operate within a union-free environment (Hannigan, 1998).</p>
                        <h3>Participation in Decision Making</h3>
                        <p>Actions can also be taken by managers and higher level administrators within an organization to increase the empowerment of the nursing staff. The amount of power available to or exercised by a given group (e.g., nurses) within an organization can vary considerably from one organization to the next. Three sources of power are particularly important in healthcare organizations: resources (the money, materials, and human help needed to accomplish the work), support (authority to take action without having to get permission), and information (e.g., about the organization's goals and activities of other departments). In addition, nurses also need access to opportunities: opportunities to be involved in decision making, to be involved in vital functions of the organization, and to grow professionally and to move up the organizational ladder (Sabiston & Laschinger, 1995). Without these, employees cannot be empowered (Bradford & Cohen, 1998).</p>
                        <h3>Shared Governance</h3>
                        <p>Genuine sharing of decision making is difficult to accomplish, partly because managers are reluctant to relinquish control or to trust their staff members to make wise decisions. However, genuine empowerment of the nursing staff cannot occur without this sharing. For example, if staff members cannot control the budget for their unit, they really cannot implement a decision to replace aides with registered nurses without approval from higherlevel management. If they want increased autonomy in decision making about the care of individual clients, they cannot do so if opposition by another group, such as the physicians, is given greater credence by the organization's administration.</p>
                        <p>Let's return to the example of the staff of the critical care department (Scenario 2). Why did the vice president for nursing tell the nurse manager that the plan would not be implemented?</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Actually, the vice president for nursing thought that the plan had some merit. He believed that the proposal to implement a nurse-managed model of care for the chronically critically ill could save a little money, provide a high quality of client care, and result in increased nursing staff satisfaction. However, the critical care department was the centerpiece of the hospital's agreement with a nearby medical school. Under this agreement, the medical school provided the services of highly skilled intensivists in return for the learning opportunities afforded their students. In its present form, the nurses' plan would not allow sufficient autonomy for the medical students, a situation that would not be acceptable to the medical school. The vice president knew that the board of trustees of the hospital believed their affiliation with the medical school brought a great deal of prestige to the organization and that they would not allow anything to interfere with this relationship.</p>
                            <p>"If shared governance were in place here, I think that we could implement this or a similar model of care," he told the nurse manager.</p>
                            <p>"How would that work?" she asked.</p>
                            <p>"If we had shared governance, the nursing practice council would review the plan and, if they approved it, forward it to a similar medical council. Then committees from both councils would get together and work out a way for this to benefit everyone. It wouldn't necessarily be easy to do, but it could be done if we had real collegiality between the professions. I have been working toward this model but haven't convinced the rest of the administration to put it into practice as yet. Perhaps we could bring this up at the next nursing executive council meeting. I think it is time that I shared my ideas on this subject with the rest of the nursing staff."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>In this case, the goals and processes existing at the time the nurses developed their proposal did not support their idea. However, they could see a way for it to be accomplished in the future. Implementation of real shared governance would make it possible for the critical care nurses to accomplish their goal. Shared governance is a term used to describe formal ways in which access to these sources of power and opportunity is made available to staff nurses. Under shared governance, staff nurses are included in the highest levels of decision making within the nursing department through representation on various councils that govern practice and management issues. These councils set the standard for staffing, promotion, and so forth. Under shared governance, staff nurses are also involved in decisions that affect their particular unit (Westrope, Vaughn, Bott, & Taunton, 1995).</p>
                        <h3>Enhancing Expertise</h3>
                        <p>Most healthcare professionals, including nurses, are empowered to some degree by their own professional knowledge and competence. There are a number of ways in which this competence can be enhanced, thereby increasing your own sense of empowerment (Fig. 7-3):</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_25_8d0a0d2b8b6b5731b36fg-110-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating how to increase expert power, showing a central nurse figure surrounded by actions like: attending conferences, participating in research, returning to school, observing experienced nurses, and reading journals." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 7-3 - How to increase your expert power.</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Active participation in interdisciplinary team conferences and patient-centered conferences on your unit</li>
                            <li>Attendance at continuing education offerings selected to enhance your expertise</li>
                            <li>Attendance at local, regional, and national conferences sponsored by relevant nursing and specialty organizations</li>
                            <li>Reading journals and books in your specialty area</li>
                            <li>Participating in nursing research projects related to your clinical specialty area</li>
                            <li>Discussing with colleagues in nursing and other disciplines how to handle a difficult clinical situation</li>
                            <li>Observing the practice of experienced nurses</li>
                            <li>Returning to school to earn a bachelor's and higher degrees in nursing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can probably think of more ideas, but this list at least gives you an idea of what you can do to enhance your expertise.</p>
                        <p>The second part of the effort to increase your feeling of empowerment through enhancing expertise is to share the knowledge and experience you have gained with other people. This means not only using your knowledge to improve your own practice but also communicating what you have learned to your colleagues in nursing and in other healthcare professions. It also means letting your supervisors know that you have enhanced your professional competence. You can share your knowledge with your clients, empowering them as well. You may even reach the point at which you have learned more about a particular subject than most nurses have and want to write about it for publication.</p>

                        <p>Tanya Washington will finish her associate's degree nursing program in 6 weeks. Her preferred clinical area is parent-child nursing, and she hopes to become a pediatric nurse practitioner one day.</p>
                        <p>Tanya has received two job offers, both from urban hospitals with large pediatric populations. Several of her friends are already employed by these facilities, so she asked them for their impressions.</p>
                        <p>"Central Hospital is a good place to work," said one friend. "It is a dynamic, growing institution, always on the cutting edge of change. Any new idea that seems promising, Central is the first to try it. It's an exciting place to work."</p>
                        <p>"City Hospital is also a good place to work," said her other friend, "It is a strong, stable institution where traditions are valued. Any new idea must be carefully evaluated before it is adapted. It's been a pleasure to work there."</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>How would the organizational climate of each hospital affect a new graduate?</li>
