                        <p>In good weather, Herbert usually played basketball with his kids after dinner. Yesterday, however, he told them he was too tired. This evening, he said the same thing. When they urged him to play anyway, he snapped at them and told them to leave him alone.</p>
                        <p>"Herbert!" his wife exclaimed, "Why did you do that?"</p>
                        <p>"I don't know," he responded. "I'm just so uptight these days. My annual review was supposed to be today, but my nurse manager was out sick. I have no idea what she is going to say. I can't think about anything else."</p>
                        <p>If Herbert's nurse manager had been providing informal feedback to staff on a regular basis, Herbert would have known where he stood. He would have had a good idea about what his strengths and weaknesses were and would not be afraid of an unpleasant surprise during the review. He would also be looking forward to the opportunity to review his accomplishments and make plans for further developing his skills with his manager. He still would have been disappointed that she was unavailable, but he would not have been so distressed by it.</p>
                        <p>The process of giving and receiving evaluative feedback is an essential leadership responsibility. Done well, it is very helpful. Done poorly, as in Herbert's case, it can be stressful, even injurious. In this chapter, we consider the do's and don'ts of giving and receiving feedback, how to share constructive positive and negative evaluative comments with your coworkers, and how to respond constructively when you are on the receiving end of such comments.</p>

                            <li>Reinforces constructive behavior. Positive feedback lets people know which behaviors are the most productive and encourages continuation of these behaviors.</li>
                            <li>Discourages unproductive behavior. Correction of inappropriate actions begins with provision of negative feedback.</li>
                            <li>Provides recognition. The power of praise (positive feedback) in motivating people to work even harder is often underestimated (Glaser, 1994).</li>
                            <li>Develops employee skills. Feedback helps people to identify their strengths and weaknesses and guides them in seeking opportunities to further develop their strengths and manage their weaknesses (Rosen, 1996).</li>

                        <p>Done well, evaluative feedback can reinforce motivation, strengthen teamwork, and improve the quality of care given. When poorly done, evaluation can reinforce poor work habits, increase insecurity, and destroy motivation and morale (Table 3-1).</p>
                        <p>Evaluation involves making judgments and communicating these judgments to others. People make judgments all the time about all types of things. Many times, these judgments are based on opinions, preferences, and inaccurate or partial information.</p>
                        <p>Subjective, biased judgments offered as objective feedback have given evaluation a bad name. Poorly communicated feedback has an equally negative effect. You will find that many people who are threatened by evaluation have been recipients of subjective, biased, or poorly communicated evaluations in the past.</p>
                        <p>Evaluative feedback is most effective when it is given immediately, frequently, and privately. To be constructive, it must be objective, based on observed behavior, and skillfully communicated. The feedback message should include the reasons that a behavior has been judged good or poor. If the message is negative, it should be nonthreatening and include suggestions and support for change and improvement (Box 3-1).</p>

                        <h3>Provide Both Positive and Negative Feedback</h3>
                        <p>Leaders and managers often neglect to provide positive feedback. If questioned, people who do not give positive feedback often respond, "If I don't say anything, that means everything is okay." Unfortunately, they do not realize that some people assume that everything is not okay when they receive no feedback. Others assume that no one is aware of how much effort has gone into their work unless it is acknowledged with positive feedback.</p>
                        <p>Most people want to do their work well. They also want to know that their efforts are recognized and appreciated. Kron (1981) calls positive feedback a "psychological paycheck." She points out that it is almost as important to people as their actual paychecks. It is a real pleasure, not only for staff members but also for their leaders and managers, to be able to share the satisfaction of a job well done with someone else. Good leaders and managers can derive a great deal of satisfaction from the accomplishments of their staff (Watson & Harris, 1999).</p>
                        <p>Some say that nurses do not do enough to support each other as colleagues and that they avoid sharing direct feedback with coworkers (DeMarco, 1998). Whether that is true or not, giving positive feedback is an important way to support your colleagues and reinforce instructive behavior.</p>
                        <p>Providing negative feedback is just as necessary as positive feedback but probably more difficult to do well. Too often, negative feedback is critical rather than constructive.</p>
                        <p>Simply telling someone that something has gone wrong or could have been done better is easier than making the feedback a learning experience for the receiver by suggesting ways to make the needed changes or by working together to develop a strategy for improvement. It is also easier to make broad, critical comments (e.g., "You're too slow") than it is to describe the specific behavior that needs improvement (e.g., "Waiting in Mr. D.'s room while he brushes his teeth takes up too much of your time") and then add a suggestion for change (e.g., "You could get your bath supplies together while he finishes").</p>
                        <p>Providing no negative feedback at all is the easiest but least effective solution to the problem of being too critical. Unsatisfactory work must be acknowledged and discussed with the people involved. Too many managers are "wishy washy, not wanting to hurt people's feelings" (Watson & Harris, 1999, p. 172). Tolerating poor work encourages its continuation and undermines the motivation of the whole team.</p>

                        <h3>Give Immediate Feedback</h3>
                        <p>The most helpful feedback, positive or negative, is given as soon as possible after the behavior has occurred. There are several reasons for this. Immediate feedback is more meaningful to the person receiving it. Also, if feedback is delayed too long, the person may have forgotten the incident altogether or assumed that your silence indicated approval.</p>
                        <p>Problems that are ignored often get worse. At the same time, a lot of frustration and anger can build up in the leader and others affected by the problems. When feedback is given as soon as possible, there is no time for this buildup.</p>

                        <h3>Provide Frequent Feedback</h3>
                        <p>Feedback should be not only immediate but also frequent. Frequent constructive feedback keeps motivation and awareness levels high and avoids the possibility that problems will grow larger and more serious before they are confronted. It also becomes easier with practice. If giving and receiving feedback are a frequent and integral part of team functioning, feedback will be easier to give and it will be less threatening to most people. It becomes an ordinary, everyday occurrence, one that happens spontaneously and is familiar to everyone on the team.</p>

                        <h3>Give Negative Feedback Privately</h3>
                        <p>Giving negative feedback privately rather than in front of others prevents embarrassment. It also avoids the possibility that those who overhear the discussion may misunderstand it and draw erroneous conclusions from it. One management authority suggests that a manager should praise staff in public but punish (correct) them in private (Matejka, Ashworth, & Dodd-McCue, 1986).</p>

                        <h3>Be Objective</h3>
                        <p>Being objective when giving feedback to others can be very difficult. First, people should be evaluated on the basis of job expectations and the results of their efforts (Fonville, Killian, & Tranberger, 1998). They should not be compared, favorably or unfavorably, with other staff members (Gellerman & Hodgson, 1988).</p>
                        <p>Another way to increase objectivity is to always give a reason that you have judged a behavior as good or poor. Be sure you consider the effect or outcome of the behavior in forming your conclusion. Reasons should be given for both positive and negative messages. For example, if you tell a coworker, "That was a good patient interview," you have told that person nothing except that the interview pleased you. However, when you add to the message, ". . . because you asked many openended questions that encouraged the client to explore personal feelings," you have identified the specific behavior that made your evaluation positive and reinforced this specific behavior.</p>
                        <p>Finally, use broad and generally accepted standards for making judgments as much as possible, rather than basing evaluation on your personal likes and dislikes. Objectivity can be increased by using standards that reflect the consensus of the team, the organization, the community, or the nursing profession. Formal evaluation should always be based on agreed-on, written standards of what is acceptable behavior. Informal evaluation, however, is based on unwritten standards. If these unwritten standards are based on personal preferences, the evaluation will be highly subjective. The following are some examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A team leader who describes a female social worker as having a professional appearance because she wears dark suits instead of bright dresses to work is using a personal standard to evaluate that social worker.</li>
                            <li>A supervisor who asks an employee to stop wearing jewelry that could get caught in the equipment used at work is applying a standard for safety in making the evaluative statement.</li>
                            <li>A nursing home administrator who insists that staff members include every resident in the weekly birthday party game is applying a narrower and more personal standard than the administrator who insists that staff members offer every resident the opportunity to participate in social activities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Base Feedback on Observable Behavior</h3>
                        <p>An evaluative statement should describe observed behavior, and not personality traits or attitudes that involve interpretation of behavior. The observation is much more likely to be factual and accurate than is the interpretation. It is also less likely to evoke a defensive response. For example, saying, "You were impatient with Mrs. G. today" is an interpretive comment. Saying, "You interrupted Mrs. G. before she finished explaining her problem" is based on observable behavior. The second statement is more specific and may be more accurate, because the caregiver may have been trying to redirect the conversation to more immediate concerns rather than feeling impatient. The latter statement is also more likely to evoke an explanation than a defensive response.</p>

                        <h3>Accept Feedback in Return</h3>
                        <p>An evaluative statement is a form of confrontation. Any message that contains a statement about the behavior of a staff member is confronting that staff member with his or her behavior. The leader who gives evaluative feedback needs to be prepared to receive feedback in return and to engage in active listening. Active listening is especially important because the person receiving the evaluation may respond by disagreeing and with high emotion. The following is an example of what may happen:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>You point out to Mr. S. that his patients need to be monitored more frequently. Mr. S. emotionally responds that he is doing everything possible for the patients and does not have a free moment all day for one extra thing. In fact, Mr. S. tells you, he never even takes a lunch break and goes home exhausted. Active listening and problem solving with this coworker aimed at relieving his overloaded time schedule are a must in this situation.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>When you give negative feedback, allow time for the individuals to express their feelings and for problem solving to find ways to improve a situation. This is particularly important if the problem has been ignored long enough to become serious (Box 3-2).</p>

                        <h3>Include Suggestions for Change</h3>
                        <p>When you give feedback that indicates that some kind of change in behavior is needed, it is helpful to suggest alternative behaviors. This is easier to do when the change is a simple one.</p>
                        <p>When complex change is needed (as with Mr. S.), you may find that the person is aware of the problem but does not know how to solve it. In such a case, oversimplified solutions are inappropriate, but an offer to engage in searching for the solution is appropriate. A willingness to listen to the other person's side of the story and assist in finding a solution indicates that your purpose is to help rather than just to criticize the individual.</p>

                        <h3>Communicate in a Nonthreatening Manner</h3>
                        <p>Threatening messages reduce motivation and inhibit learning by diverting people's energies into activities aimed at reducing the threat. Although a small degree of anxiety may increase learning, too much fear immobilizes people. The ultimate purpose for providing informal evaluation is, after all, to improve the function of the team and its individual members.</p>
                        <p>Negative feedback may contain hints of dire consequences, probably in the mistaken belief that it will increase the person's motivation to change. The following are some common examples:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"You're not going to last long if you keep doing that."</li>
                            <li>"People who want to do well here make sure their assignments are done on time."</li>
                            <li>"Don't argue with the doctors; they'll report you to the nursing office."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When a person's behavior actually does threaten his or her job security, a formal evaluation stating this fact directly and specifying needed changes is appropriate.</p>
                        <p>You may have assumed that people in the ranks above you (e.g., manager, head nurse, supervisor, director) could not be threatened by feedback from you. This is not true. They are all human and as susceptible to feeling threatened as you are. You need to follow the same guidelines in giving feedback to people above you in the organization as you do with people below you in the hierarchy.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is equally as important to be able to accept constructive criticism as it is to provide it (Kelly & Aiken, 1999). The purposes for seeking feedback are the same as those for giving it to others. The criteria for evaluating the feedback you receive are also the same.</p>
                        <h3>When Is Evaluative Feedback Needed?</h3>
                        <p>There are a number of different situations in which you need to seek feedback (Box 3-3). For example, you may find yourself in a work situation in which you receive very little feedback, or you may be getting only positive and no negative comments (or vice versa).</p>
                         <aside class="callout note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">BOX 3-3: SITUATIONS IN WHICH YOU SHOULD ASK FOR FEEDBACK</h4>
                            <ul class="enhanced-list">
                                <li>When you do not know how well you are doing</li>
                                <li>When you receive only positive comments</li>
                                <li>When you receive only negative comments</li>
                                <li>When you believe that your accomplishments have not been recognized</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        <p>You also need to look for feedback when you feel uncertain about how well you are doing or whether you have correctly interpreted the expectations of the job. The following are examples of these situations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You have been told that good client care is the highest priority but feel totally frustrated by never having enough staff members to give good care.</li>
                            <li>You thought you were expected to do case finding and health teaching in your community but receive the most recognition for the number of home visits made and the completeness of your records.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Another instance in which you should request feedback is when you feel that your needs for recognition and job satisfaction have not been met adequately.</p>
                        <p>Requests for feedback should be made in the form of "I" messages. If you have received only negative comments, ask, "In what ways have I done well?" If you receive only positive comments, you can ask, "In what areas do I need to improve?" Or, if you are seeking feedback from a client, you could ask, "How can I be of more help to you?"</p>
                        <h3>Responding to Evaluative Feedback</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes, it is appropriate to critically analyze the feedback you are getting. If the feedback seems totally negative or you feel threatened by receiving it, ask for further explanation. You may have misunderstood what the person meant to say.</p>
                        <p>It is hard to avoid responding defensively to negative feedback that is subjective or laced with threats and blame. If you are the recipient of such a poorly done evaluation, however, it may help both you and your supervisor to try to guide the discussion into more constructive areas. You can ask for reasons why the evaluation was negative, on what standard it is based or what the person's expectations were, and what the person suggests as alternative behavior.</p>
                        <p>When the feedback is positive but nonspecific, you may also want to ask for some clarification so that you can learn what that person's expectations really are. Do not hesitate to seek that psychological paycheck. Tell other people about your successes-most are happy to share the satisfaction of a successful outcome or positive development in a client's care.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Performance appraisal is the formal evaluation of an employee by a superior, usually a manager or supervisor. The employee's behavior is compared with a standard describing how the employee is expected to perform. Employees need to know what has to be done, how much has to be done, and when it has to be done (Hansen, 1986). The standards that provide this information are often written in the form of objectives. Actual performance should be evaluated, not good intentions.</p>
                        <h3>Procedure</h3>
                        <p>In the ideal situation, the performance appraisal begins when the employee is hired. Based on the written job description, the employee and manager discuss performance expectations and then write a set of objectives that they think the employee can reasonably accomplish within a given time. The objectives should be written as a level of performance that demonstrates that some learning, refinement of skill, or advancement toward some long-range objective has taken place. The following are examples of objectives a new staff nurse could accomplish in the first 6 months of employment:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Complete the staff nurse orientation program successfully.</li>
                            <li>Master the basic skills necessary to function as a staff nurse on the assigned unit.</li>
                            <li>Supervise the unlicensed assistive personnel (UAPs) assigned to his or her patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Six months later, the staff nurse and nurse manager sit down again and evaluate the staff nurse's performance in terms of the previously set goals. The evaluation should be based on both the staff nurse's self-evaluation and the nurse manager's observation of specific behaviors. New objectives for the next 6 months and plans for achieving them may be agreed on at the time of the appraisal or at a separate meeting (Beer, 1981). A copy of the performance appraisal and the new goals must be available to employees so that they can refer back to them and check on their progress.</p>
                        <p>It is important to set aside adequate time for feedback and goal-setting processes. Both the staff nurse and the nurse manager bring data for use at this session. These data should include a self-evaluation by the staff nurse and observations by the evaluator of the employee's activities and their outcomes. Data may also be obtained from peers and clients. Some organizations use surveys for getting this information from clients.</p>
                        <p>Most of the guidelines for providing informal evaluative feedback discussed earlier apply to the conduct of performance appraisals. Although not as frequent or immediate as informal feedback, formal evaluation should be just as objective, private, nonthreatening, skillfully communicated, and growth promoting.</p>
                        <h3>Standards for Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Unfortunately, many organizations' employee evaluation procedures are far from ideal. Their procedures may be inconsistent, subjective, and even unknown to the employee in some cases. The following is a list of standards for a fair and objective employee evaluation procedure that you can to use to judge your employer's procedures:</p>
                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li>Standards are clear, objective, and known in advance.</li>
                            <li>Criteria for pay raises and promotions are clearly spelled out and uniformly applied.</li>
                            <li>Conditions under which employment may be terminated are known.</li>
                            <li>Appraisals are part of the employee's permanent record and have space for employee comments.</li>
                            <li>Employees may inspect their own personnel file.</li>
                            <li>Employees may request and be given a reasonable explanation of any rating and may appeal the rating if they do not agree with it.</li>
                            <li>Employees are given a reasonable amount of time to correct any serious deficiencies before other action is taken, unless the safety of self or others is immediately threatened.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In some organizations, collective bargaining agreements are used to enforce adherence to fair and objective performance appraisals. However, collective bargaining agreements may emphasize seniority (length of service) over merit, a situation that does not promote growth and change.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Peer review is the evaluation of an individual's practice by his or her colleagues (peers) who have similar education, experience, and occupational status. Its purpose is to provide the individual with feedback from those who are best acquainted with the requirements and demands of that individual's position. Peer review should be directed to both actions (process) and the outcomes of actions.</p>
                        <p>On an informal basis, professionals frequently observe and judge their colleagues' performance. Many feel uncomfortable about telling others what they think of their performance, however, so they don't share their thoughts with the individual practitioner unless informal feedback is shared regularly or a formal system of peer review is established.</p>
                        <p>Whenever staff members meet to audit records or otherwise evaluate the quality of care they have given, they are engaging in a kind of peer review. Formal peer review programs are often one of the last formal evaluation procedures to be implemented in a healthcare organization.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Fundamentals of Peer Review</h3>
                        <p>There are a number of possible variations in the peer review process. The observations may be shared only with the person being reviewed, with the person's supervisor, or with a review committee. The evaluation report may be written by the reviewer, or it may come from the review committee. The use of a committee defeats the purpose of peer review if the committee members are not truly peers of the individual being reviewed.</p>

                        <h3>A Comprehensive Peer Review System</h3>
                        <p>Peer review systems can simply be informal feedback regularly shared among colleagues, or they may be comprehensive systems that are fully integrated into the formal evaluation structure of a healthcare organization. When a peer review system is fully integrated, the evaluative feedback from one's peers is joined with the performance appraisals done by the nurse manager, and both are used to determine pay raises and promotions for individual staff nurses. This is a far more collegial approach than the hierarchical one typically used, in which employees are evaluated only by their manager.</p>
                        <p>A comprehensive peer review system begins with the development of job descriptions (Figs. 3-1 and 3-2) and performance standards (Fig. 3-3) for each level within the nursing staff. When you compare Figures 3-1, 3-2, and 3-3, you will see that the job description is a very general statement, whereas the standards are specific behaviors that can be observed and recorded.</p>

                        <p>In some organizations, the standards may be considered the minimal qualifications for each level. In this case, additional activities and professional development are expected before promotion to the next level. The candidate for promotion to an advanced-level position prepares a promotion portfolio for review (Schultz, 1993). The promotion portfolio may include a self-assessment, peer reviews, patient surveys, a management performance appraisal, and evidence of professional growth. Evidence of professional growth can be based on participation in the quality improvement program, evaluation of a new product or procedure, serving as a translator or disaster volunteer, making postdischarge visits to clients from the unit, or taking courses related to nursing.</p>
                        <p>In a participative environment, the standards are developed by committees having representatives from different units and from each staff level, from the new staff nurse to top-level management.</p>
                        <p>Writing useful job descriptions and measurable standards of performance is an arduous but rewarding task. It requires clarification and explication of the work nurses actually do that go beyond the usual generalizations about what nursing is and what nurses do. Under effective group leadership and with strong administrative support for this process, it can be a challenging and stimulating experience. Without their support and guidance, however, the committee work can be frustrating when the group gets bogged down in details and disagreements.</p>

                        <p>When the job descriptions and performance standards for each level have been developed and agreed on, a procedure for their use must also be worked out. This can be done in several ways. In some organizations, an evaluation form that lists the performance standards can be completed by one or two colleagues selected by the individual staff member. The information from these forms is then used along with the nurse manager's evaluation to determine pay raises and promotions in some organizations. In others, the evaluation from one's peers is used for counseling purposes only and is not taken into consideration in determining pay raises or promotions. This second approach provides useful feedback but weakens the impact of peer review.</p>
                        <p>A different approach is the use of a professional practice committee. The committee, comprising colleagues selected by the nursing staff, reviews the peer evaluation forms and makes its recommendations to the director of nursing or vice president for client care services, who then makes the final decision regarding the appropriate rewards (raises, promotions, commendations) or penalties (demotion, transfer, termination of employment).</p>

                        <p>A comprehensive evaluation system can be an effective mechanism both for increasing the quality of care by improving staff skills and morale and for reducing the costs of providing that care by increasing staff productivity. Constructive feedback demands objectivity and fairness in dealing with each other and leadership on the part of both staff members and management. Done well, it can provide many opportunities for increased professionalism and learning as well as ensure appropriate rewards for high performance levels and professionalism on the job.</p>
