                        <p>In its history, the nursing profession has had many great leaders. From these, we have chosen just five who not only demonstrate the strengths of our historic leaders but also reflect some of the most important issues that the profession has had to face over the last 100 years or so. Each of these leaders initiated change within the social environment of her time using the theories of change and conflict resolution discussed earlier in the text.</p>
                        <p>Florence Nightingale is probably the best known of the five. She is considered the founder of modern nursing. Nightingale changed the care of soldiers in the military, hospital record keeping, the status of nurses, and even the profession itself. Her concepts of nursing care became the basis of modern theory development in nursing. Lillian Wald, founder of the Henry Street Settlement, is a role model for contemporary community health nursing. Ms. Wald developed a model for bringing health care to the people. Her social conscience and determination to make changes in health care have been a model for the modern-day healthcare revolution. Margaret Sanger, a political activist like the others, is best known for her courageous fight to make birth control information available to everyone who needed or wanted it. Her fight to make Congress aware of the plight of children in the labor force is less well known but led to important changes in the child labor laws. Sanger was perhaps the first nurse lobbyist. Adelaide Nutting is probably the best known example of the early leaders in nursing education in the United States. Virginia Henderson, the last nursing leader discussed in this chapter, represents an example of the "twentieth century Florence Nightingale." Henderson wrote the nursing textbook used by nurse educators throughout the country for most of the twentieth century.</p>
                        <p>As you read this chapter, you will see how each of these famous women exemplifies leadership in the nursing profession. Many of their characteristics—intelligence, courage, and foresight—are the same ones needed in today's nursing leaders.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Florence Nightingale was born in the city for which she was named, Florence, Italy, on May 12, 1820. She was the second daughter of William and Frances Nightingale. Her father was a well-educated, wealthy man who put considerable effort into the education of his two daughters (Donahue, 1985). Florence Nightingale learned French, German, and Italian in addition to her native English. Mr. Nightingale personally instructed her in mathematics, classical art, and literature. The family made extended visits to London every year, which provided opportunities for contact with people in the highest social circles. These contacts were very valuable to Ms. Nightingale in later years.</p>
                        <p>Despite her family's ability to shelter her from the meaner side of life, Nightingale had always shown an interest in the welfare of those less fortunate than herself. It seems that she was never quite content with herself, as she was described as a "sensitive, introspective, and somewhat morbid child" (Schuyler, 1992). She was driven to improve herself and the world around her. When she expressed an interest in becoming a nurse, her parents objected strenuously. They wanted her to assume the traditional role of well-to-do women of the time: marry, have children, and take her "rightful" place in society.</p>
                        <h3>Becoming a Nurse</h3>
                        <p>In the fall of 1847, Nightingale left England for a tour of Europe with family friends. In Italy, she entered a convent for a retreat. This strengthened her religious beliefs, although she never converted from the Church of England to Catholicism. After this retreat, she felt that she had been called by God to help others. This experience made her more determined than ever to pursue nursing.</p>
                        <p>In 1851, Nightingale insisted on going to Kaiserswerth in Germany to obtain training in nursing. Her family gave her their permission on the condition that no one would know where she was. When she returned from Kaiserswerth, she began to work on her plan to make an impact in the healthcare field.</p>
                        <p>Nightingale soon left for France to work with several Catholic nursing sisters. While in France, she received an offer from the committee that regulated the Establishment for Gentlewomen During Illness, a nursing home in London for governesses who became ill. She was appointed superintendent of the home and soon had it well organized, although she did have some difficulties with the committee.</p>
                        <p>Because of her knowledge of hospitals, Nightingale was often consulted by social reformers and by physicians who also recognized the need for this new type of nurse. Nightingale was offered a position as superintendent of nurses at King's College Hospital, but her family objected so strongly that she remained at home instead, until she went to the Crimea.</p>
                        <h3>The Need for Reform</h3>
                        <p>Fortunately for Nightingale, it was fashionable to become involved in the reform of medical and social institutions in the middle of the nineteenth century. After completing the reorganization of the nursing home, she began visiting hospitals and collecting information about nurses' working conditions. In the course of doing this, she realized that to improve nurses' working conditions, she would first have to improve the nurses.</p>
                        <p>Up to this time, the guiding principle of nursing had revolved around charity. Nursing services in Europe were provided primarily by the family or by members of religious orders. These Catholic organizations experienced a decline during the Reformation, when the government closed churches and monasteries. Hospitals were no longer run for charitable reasons but because of social necessity.</p>
                        <p>Nursing lost its social standing when the religious orders declined. Nurses were no longer recruited from the respectable classes but from the lower classes of society. Women who needed to earn their keep entered domestic service, and nursing was considered a form of domestic service. Other women who could no longer earn a living by gambling or selling themselves also turned to nursing. Many came from the criminal classes. They lacked the spirit of self-sacrifice found in the religious orders, and they often abused clients. Many consoled themselves with alcohol and snuff.</p>
                        <p>The duties of a nurse in those days were to take care of the physical needs of clients and to make sure they were reasonably clean. The conditions under which they had to accomplish this were less than ideal. Hospitals were dirty and unventilated. They were contaminated with infection and actually spread diseases instead of preventing them. The same bedsheets were used for several clients. The nurses dealt with people suffering from unrelenting pain, hemorrhage, infections, and gangrene (Kalisch & Kalisch, 1986).</p>
                        <p>To accomplish the needed reforms, Nightingale realized that she had to recruit her nurses from higher strata of society, as had been done in the past, and then educate them well. She concluded that this could be accomplished only by organizing a school to prepare reliable, qualified nurses.</p>
                        <h3>The Crimean War</h3>
                        <p>A letter written by war correspondent W.H. Russell comparing the nursing care in the British army unfavorably with that given to the French army created a tremendous stir in England. There was demand for change. In response, the secretary of war, Sir Sidney Herbert, commissioned Nightingale to go to the Crimea (a peninsula in southeastern Ukraine) to investigate conditions there and make improvements.</p>
                        <p>On October 21, 1854, Nightingale left for the Crimea with a group of nurses on the steamer Vectis (Griffith & Griffith, 1965). They found a disaster when they arrived. The hospital that had been built to accommodate 1700 soldiers was filled with over 3000 wounded and critically ill men. There were no plumbing or sewage disposal facilities. The mattresses, walls, and floors were wet with human waste. Rats, lice, and maggots thrived in this filthy environment (Kalisch & Kalisch, 1986).</p>
                        <p>The nurses went right to work. They set up a kitchen, rented a house and converted it into a laundry, and hired soldiers' wives to do the laundry. Money was difficult to obtain, so Nightingale used the Times relief fund and her own personal funds to purchase medical supplies, food, and equipment. After the hospital had been cleaned and organized, she began to set up social services for the soldiers.</p>
                        <p>Nightingale rarely slept. She spent hours giving nursing care, wrote letters to families, prepared requests for more supplies, and reported back to London on the conditions that she had found and improved. At night, she made rounds accompanied by an 11-yearold boy who held her lamp when she sat by a dying soldier or assisted during emergency surgery. This is how she earned the title "The Lady with the Lamp" from the poet Longfellow (1868).</p>
                        <p>Despite their strenuous efforts and enormous accomplishments, the physicians and army officers resented the nurses. They regarded these nurses as intruders who interfered with their work and undermined their authority. There was also some conflict between Nightingale and Dr. John Hall, the chief of the medical staff. At one time, after Dr. Hall had been awarded the K.C.B. (Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath), Nightingale sarcastically referred to him as "Dr. Hall, K.C.B., Knight of the Crimean Burial Grounds." When Nightingale contracted Crimean fever, Hall used this as an excuse to send her back to England. However, Nightingale thwarted his resistance and eventually won over the medical staff by creating an operating room and supplying the instruments with her own resources. Although she returned to duty, she never fully recovered from the fever. She returned to England in 1865 a national heroine but remained a semi-invalid for the rest of her life.</p>
                        <h3>A School for Nurses</h3>
                        <p>After her return from the Crimea, Nightingale pursued two goals: reform of military health care and establishment of an official training school for nurses. The British public contributed more than $220,000 to the Nightingale Fund for the purpose of establishing the school.</p>
                        <p>Although opposed by most of the physicians in Britain, Nightingale continued her efforts, and the Nightingale Training School for Nurses opened in 1860. The school was an independent educational institution financed by the Nightingale Fund. Fifteen probationers were admitted to the first class. Their training lasted 1 year.</p>
                        <p>Although Nightingale was not an instructor at the school, she was consulted about all of the details of student selection, instruction, and organization. Her book Notes on Nursing: What It Is and What It Is Not established the fundamental principles of nursing. The following is an example of her writing:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><strong>On What Nursing Ought To Do</strong></p>
                            <p>I use the word nursing for want of a better. It has been limited to signify little more than the administration of medicines and the application of poultices. It ought to signify the proper use of air, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet and the proper selection and administration of diet—all at the least expense of vital power to the patient. (Nightingale, 1859)</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>This book was one of the first nursing textbooks and is still widely quoted today. Many nursing theorists have used Nightingale's thoughts as a basis for constructing their view of nursing.</p>
                        <p>The basic principles on which the Nightingale school was founded are the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Nurses should be technically trained in schools organized for that purpose.</li>
                            <li>Nurses should come from homes that are of good moral standing.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Nightingale believed that schools of nursing must be independent institutions and that women who were selected to attend the schools should be from the higher levels of society. Many of Nightingale's beliefs about nursing education are still applicable today, particularly those involved with the progress of students, the use of diaries kept by students, and the need for integrating theory into clinical practice (Roberts, 1937).</p>
                        <p>The Nightingale school served as a model for nursing education. Its graduates were sought after worldwide. Many established other schools and became matrons (superintendents) in hospitals in other parts of England, the Commonwealth, and the United States. However, very few schools were able to remain financially independent of the hospitals, and therefore they lost much of their autonomy. This was in contradiction to Nightingale's philosophy that the training schools were educational institutions, not part of any service agency.</p>
                        <h3>Healthcare Reform</h3>
                        <p>Nightingale's second goal was the improvement of military health care. As a result of her documentation of the conditions in the Crimea and the nurses' efforts to improve them, reforms were undertaken. Her work marked the beginning of modern military nursing.</p>
                        <p>Nightingale's statistics were so accurate and clearly reported that she was elected a member of the British Statistical Society, the first woman to hold this position. At their conference in 1860, she presented a paper entitled, "Miss Nightingale's Scheme for Uniform Hospital Statistics." Before this paper was written, each hospital had used its own names and classification systems for diseases.</p>
                        <p>Nightingale's continuous efforts to study and improve health care made her an expert in her day. Her opinions on these subjects were constantly solicited. This led to another publication, Notes on Hospitals.</p>
                        <p>For more than 40 years, Nightingale played an influential part in most of the important healthcare reforms of her time. At the turn of the twentieth century, however, her energies had waned, and she spent most of the next 10 years confined to her home on South Street. She died in her sleep on August 13, 1910.</p>
                        <h3>Nightingale's Contributions</h3>
                        <p>Nightingale is believed to have been in error in only two areas. The first is that she did not believe in or appreciate the significance of the germ theory of infection, although her insistence on fresh air, physical hygiene, and environmental cleanliness certainly did a great deal to decrease the transmission of infectious diseases. Second, she did not support a central registry or testing for nurses similar to what was in place for physicians. She was convinced that this would undermine the profession and that a letter of recommendation from the school matron was sufficient to attest to the skill and character of the nurse.</p>
                        <p>Florence Nightingale was a woman of vision and determination. Her strong belief in herself and her abilities allowed her to pursue and achieve her goals. She was a political activist and a revolutionary in her time. Her accomplishments went beyond the scope of nursing and nursing education, penetrating into all aspects of healthcare and social reform.</p>
                        <p>Although many memorials have been established in honor of Florence Nightingale, it is the legacy she has left to all of us who followed in her footsteps that perpetuates her name. Through today's nurses, Nightingale's spirit and determination remain alive. She has handed her lamp to each of us, and we have become the keepers of the lamp.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">LILLIAN WALD</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Born in 1897, Lillian Wald moved from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Rochester, New York, where she spent most of her childhood. She received her education at Miss Crittenden's English and French Boarding and Day School for Young Ladies and Little Girls. Her relatives were physicians and had a tremendous influence on her. They encouraged her to choose nursing as a career.</p>
                        <p>Wald attended the New York Hospital School of Nursing. After graduation, she worked as a nurse in the New York Juvenile Asylum. She felt a need for more medically oriented knowledge, so she entered Women's Medical College in New York.</p>
                        <h3>Turning Point</h3>
                        <p>During this time, Wald and a colleague, Mary Brewster, were asked to go to New York's Lower East Side to give a lecture to immigrant mothers on care of the sick. They were shocked by what they discovered there.</p>
                        <p>While showing a group of mothers how to make a bed, a child came up to Wald and asked for help. The boy took her to a squalid tenement apartment where nine poorly nourished people were living in two rooms. A woman lay on a bed. Although she was seriously ill, it was apparent that no one had attended to her needs for several days (Kalisch & Kalisch, 1986). Miss Crittenden's School had not prepared Wald for this, but she went right to work anyway. She bathed the woman, washed and changed the bedclothes, sent for a physician, and cleaned the room.</p>
                        <p>This incident was a turning point in her life. Wald left medical school and began a career as an advocate and helper of the poor and sick, joined by her friend Mary Brewster. They soon found that there were thousands of cases similar to the first, in just one small neighborhood.</p>
                        <h3>The Visiting Nurses</h3>
                        <p>Wald and Brewster established a settlement house in 1893 in a rented tenement apartment in a poor section of New York's Lower East Side. To be closer to their clients, they gave up their comfortable living quarters and moved into a smaller, upper-floor apartment there.</p>
                        <p>It did not take long for the women to build up a nursing practice. At first, they had to seek out the sick, but within weeks calls came to them by the hundreds. The people of the neighborhood trusted them and relied on them for help. Gradually, they also developed a reputation among the physicians and hospitals in the area, and requests to see clients came from these sources as well.</p>
                        <p>Lillian Wald and her nursing colleagues brought basic nursing care to the people in their home environments. These nurses were independent practitioners who made their own decisions and followed up on their own assessments of families' needs. Like Nightingale, they were very aware of the effect of the environment on the health of their clients and worked hard to improve their surroundings.</p>
                        <p>Wald was convinced that many illnesses resulted from causes outside individual control and that treatment needed to be holistic. She claimed that she chose the title public health nurse to emphasize the value of the nurse whose work was built on an understanding of the social and economic problems that inevitably accompanied the clients' ills (Bueheler-Wilkerson, 1993).</p>
                        <p>Because she had the freedom to explore alternatives for care during numerous births, illnesses, and deaths, Wald began to organize an impressive group of offerings, ranging from private relief to services from the medical establishment. She developed cooperative relationships with various organizations, which allowed her access to goods and jobs for her clients. News of her successes spread. Private physicians sought her out and referred their clients to her for service.</p>
                        <h3>The Henry Street Settlement House</h3>
                        <p>Within 2 years, the nurses had outgrown their original quarters. They needed larger facilities and more nurses. With the help of Jacob Schiff, a banker and philanthropist, they moved to a larger building at 265 Henry Street. This became known as the Henry Street Settlement House (Mayer, 1994). Nine graduate nurses moved in soon after.</p>
                        <p>By 1909, the Henry Street Settlement House had grown into a well-organized social services system with many departments. The staff included 37 nurses, 5 of whom were managers, and other men and women involved in carrying out the many activities of the settlement house.</p>
                        <h3>Other Accomplishments</h3>
                        <p>Wald is also credited with the development of school health nursing. Health conditions were so bad in the New York City schools that 15 to 20 children per school were sent home every day. These ill children were returned to school by their parents in the same condition. As a result, illnesses spread from child to child. Ringworm, scabies, and pediculosis were common.</p>
                        <p>To prove her point about the value of community health nurses, Wald set up an experiment using one nurse for 1 month in one school. During that time, the number of children dismissed from classes dropped from more than 10,000 to 1100. The New York Board of Health was so impressed that they hired nurses to continue the original nurse's work. Wald's nurses treated illnesses, explained the modes of transmission, and explained the reasons that some children had to be excluded from class and why others did not. The nurses also followed up on the children at home to prevent the recurrence of illnesses.</p>
                        <p>Wald was also responsible for organizing the Children's Bureau, the Nursing Service Division of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and the Town and Country Nursing Service of the American Red Cross. Her dreams of expanding public health nursing, obtaining insurance coverage for home-based preventive care, and developing a national health nursing service have not become a reality. However, in view of today's healthcare demands, she was a visionary who believed that health care belongs in the community and that nurses have a vital role to play in community-based care. She died in 1940 and is remembered as one of the foremost leaders in public health nursing.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">MARGARET SANGER</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Margaret Higgins was born in Corning, New York, on September 14, 1879. After recovering from tuberculosis, which she contracted while caring for her mother, she attended nursing school at the White Plains Hospital School of Nursing. In her autobiography, she described the school as rigid and at times inhuman; perhaps this gives us an indication of where her future interests would take her (Sanger, 1938). During her affiliation at the Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital, she met William Sanger. They married and moved to a suburb of New York, where she stayed at home to raise their three children.</p>
                        <h3>Labor Reformer</h3>
                        <p>Sanger was very concerned about the working conditions faced by people living in poverty. Many workers were paid barely enough to buy food for themselves and their families. At that time, the income for a family with two working parents was about $12 to $14 a week. If only the father worked, earnings dropped to $8 a week. Obviously, when only the mother worked, the family income was even lower. A portion of this income was paid back to the company as rent for company housing. Food was often purchased through a company store, and very little was left for other expenses, including health care.</p>
                        <p>A major strike of industrial workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, marked the beginning of Sanger's career as an advocate and social reformer. The workers had attempted a strike for better conditions before but conceded because of threatening starvation. If the workers went on strike, there was no money for food. Strike sympathizers in New York offered to help the workers and to take the children from Lawrence into their homes. Because of her interest in the situation of the underpaid workers and her involvement with New York laborers, Sanger was asked to assist in the evacuation of children from the unsettled and sometimes violent conditions in Lawrence. Following an outbreak of serious rioting, she was called to Washington to testify before the House Committee on Rules about the condition of the children. She testified that the children were poorly nourished, ill, ragged, and living in worse conditions than those seen in impoverished city slums.</p>
                        <p>Two months later, the owners of the mills sat down to talk with the workers and gave in to their demands. Sanger's interventions on behalf of the children had brought the workers' plight to the attention of the public and the people in Washington.</p>
                        <h3>A New Concern for Sanger</h3>
                        <p>In the spring of 1912, Sanger returned to work as a public health nurse. She was assigned to maternity cases on New York City's Lower East Side. One case she encountered became a turning point in her life. Sanger was caring for a 28-year-old mother of three children who had attempted to self-abort. This woman and her husband were already struggling to feed and clothe the children they had and could not afford any more. After 3 weeks, the woman had regained her health. However, during the physician's final visit to her home, he told the young woman that she had been lucky to survive this time but that if she tried to self-abort again, she would not need his services but those of a funeral director. The young woman pleaded with him for a way to prevent another pregnancy. The doctor replied, "Tell your husband to sleep on the roof" (Sanger, 1938). The young woman turned then to Sanger, who remained silent.</p>
                        <p>Three months later, Sanger was called to the same home. This time, the woman was in a coma and died within minutes of Sanger's arrival. At that moment, Sanger dedicated herself to learning about and disseminating information about birth control.</p>
                        <h3>Contraception Reform</h3>
                        <p>This task turned out to be far more difficult than Margaret Sanger had expected. The Comstock Act of 1873 classified birth control information as obscene. Unrewarding research at the Boston Public Library, the Library of Congress, and the New York Academy of Medicine only heightened her frustration. Very little information about birth control was available anywhere in the United States at that time.</p>
                        <p>But contraception was widely practiced in many European countries, so Sanger went to Europe. She studied methods of birth control in France, and when she returned to the United States, she began to publish a journal called The Woman Rebel. This journal carried articles about contraception, family planning, and other matters related to women's rights.</p>
                        <p>The first birth control clinic in the United States opened at 46 Amboy Street in Brooklyn in 1916. Sanger operated the clinic with her sister, Ethel Byrne, and another nurse, Fania Mindell. On the first day, more than 150 women asked them for help. Everything went smoothly until a policewoman masquerading as a client arrested the three women and recorded the names of all the by-now-frightened clients. To bring attention to their plight and to the closing of the clinic, Sanger refused to ride in the police wagon. Instead, she walked the mile to the courthouse.</p>
                        <p>Several weeks later, Sanger returned to a courthouse overflowing with friends and supporters to face the charges that had been filed against her. The public found it difficult to believe that this attractive mother, flanked by her two sons, was either demented or oversexed, as her adversaries had claimed. She did not deny the charges of disseminating birth control information, but she did challenge the law that made this information illegal. Because she refused to abide by that law, the judge sentenced her to 30 days in the workhouse.</p>
                        <p>After completing her 30 days, Sanger continued her work for many years. She solicited the support of wealthy women and used their help to gain financial backing to continue her fight. She delivered talks and organized meetings. In 1921, she organized the Birth Control Conference in New York (Kalisch & Kalisch, 1986). In 1928, she established the National Committee on Federal Legislation for Birth Control, which eventually became the Planned Parenthood Foundation. Sanger was also an accomplished author, writing What Every Girl Should Know, What Every Mother Should Know, and Motherhood in Bondage.</p>
                        <p>Conservative religious and political groups were the most vocal in their opposition to Sanger's work. In the end, however, Sanger won. Planned Parenthood is a thriving organization, and birth control information is available to anyone who seeks it, although some groups oppose its availability on religious or political grounds.</p>
                        <p>Sanger could fairly be labeled an early example of the liberated woman. She was independent and assertive during a time when it was considered "politically incorrect" for a woman to behave in such a manner. Perhaps her most important contributions to the community at large were her tenacity and her ability to bring to society's attention the needs of the poor, and not just the favored few who had sufficient money. As a nurse, she represented that part of caring that operates in the political arena to bring about change to improve people's health and save lives.</p>

                    <h2 id="section-heading-6" class="section-heading">

                        <span class="heading-text">ADELAIDE NUTTING</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Adelaide Nutting was born on November 1, 1858, in Frost Village, Quebec, Canada. She was the first graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. During her student days, the journal Trained Nurse offered a 10-dollar prize for an essay on a typhoid fever case. Nutting submitted her essay and won the prize. Her essay was printed in the March 1910 issue, but that was just the beginning for this dynamic nurse leader.</p>
                        <p>Nutting was a close friend of Isabel Hampton, the director of the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, which Nutting attended. When Hampton resigned her position, Nutting, in 1894, became the superintendent of nurses and the principal of the School of Nursing at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
                        <h3>Nursing Education</h3>
                        <p>Nutting established the 3-year, 8-hour/day program that became the prototype for diploma school education in nursing. She later came to believe that more background in the basic sciences was a necessity and developed a 6-month course that also became a model for other schools. Although associated with a hospital school of nursing, Nutting was convinced that nursing education would advance only if the profession developed more autonomy. Like Nightingale, Nutting believed that schools of nursing should be independent of hospital control or ownership.</p>
                        <h3>Higher Education</h3>
                        <p>Nutting is probably best known for her work in the creation of the Department of Nursing and Health at Teachers College of Columbia University. After leaving Johns Hopkins in 1907 to take the first chair in nursing at Columbia University, she became the first professor of nursing in the world. She held this position until 1925, when she was succeeded by a former student and colleague, Isabel Stewart.</p>
                        <h3>Other Interests</h3>
                        <p>Nutting was interested in many aspects of nursing. In 1918, she approached the Rockefeller Foundation to request funds for her alma mater, Johns Hopkins. During the interview, she stressed the need for improvement in the education of public health nurses. This meeting led to the formation of a blue-ribbon committee that studied the situation and released a report that emphasized the need for university education of nurses.</p>
                        <p>Nutting also recognized the importance of cultivating benefactors for nursing. For example, she became very close to Frances Payne Bolton, a wealthy and influential citizen of Cleveland, Ohio. She convinced Bolton to fund an Army Nurse Training School at a time when women were being trained as aides rather than as professional nurses. Nutting opposed their training as aides, because she believed that soldiers with war wounds needed professionals to care for them. The three major nursing organizations of the time supported the establishment of the school, but the U.S. War Department rejected the idea. In response, Frances Payne Bolton went to Washington to persuade the War Department to prepare the women as nurses. The Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, is named after this supporter of nursing.</p>
                        <p>Nutting was committed to the promotion of nursing and nursing education. She was in the forefront of educational reform, first by establishing standards of diploma education and later by supporting the move to the university setting. One of her greatest achievements was improvement in the preparation of teachers of nursing. She realized early that the quality of nurses is greatly influenced by the quality of the teachers of nursing students.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Background</h3>
                        <p>Virginia Henderson was born November 30, 1897, in Kansas City, Missouri. She attended the U.S. Army School of Nursing during World War I. Her mentor was Annie Goodrich, head of the army school. Goodrich later became the first dean of the Yale School of Nursing. After the war, she continued her nursing career in public health in New York City and Washington, D.C.</p>
                        <p>Henderson decided to enter the realm of nursing education and took her first faculty position at the Norfolk Virginia Protestant Hospital School of Nursing. In 1929, she returned to New York and enrolled in Columbia Teacher's College to further her nursing education. Here she earned her B.A. and M.A. degrees. In 1934, she joined the faculty of Columbia Teacher's College. She taught nursing at Columbia from 1934 to 1948.</p>
                        <p>In 1953, she joined the faculty of the Yale School of Nursing in New Haven, Connecticut, as a research associate and spent the last four decades of her life at this renowned institution of higher learning. While at Yale, she began a 19-year project to review nursing literature, and at Yale she published the four-volume Nursing Studies Index, which indexed the English-language nursing literature from 1900 through 1960.</p>
                        <h3>Contributions to Twentieth Century Nursing</h3>
                        <p>Virginia Henderson pioneered the work that is the essence of modern nursing. Her most important writing, Principles and Practice of Nursing, is considered the twentieth century's equivalent to Nightingale's Notes on Nursing. Nightingale emphasized nature as the primary healer. With the advent of antibiotic therapy and other technological advances, Nightingale's work became dated (www.unc.edu/ehallora/ henderson.htm, 2000).</p>
                        <p>In her textbook revision in 1955, Henderson first offered her description of nursing: "I say that the nurse does for others what they would do for themselves if they had the strength, the will and the knowledge. But I go on to say that the nurse makes the patient independent of him or her as soon as possible" (Henderson, 1955). Henderson wrote three editions of this textbook. Unlike other nursing textbooks, this one emphasized the importance of nursing research, and not just routine nursing techniques. Nurse educators continued using the book throughout most of the twentieth century.</p>
                        <p>As a nursing professional, Henderson actively participated in nursing organizations. She founded the Interagency Council on Information Resources for Nursing. She was a member of the American Nurses Association and acted as a consultant to the National Library of Medicine and the American Journal of Nursing Company. Henderson received many awards for her work and efforts to increase the status of the nursing profession. The Sigma Theta Tau International Nurses Honor Society named its library in honor of her outstanding contributions to nursing.</p>
                        <p>Henderson believed that nursing complemented the patient by giving him or her what was needed in "will or strength" to perform the daily activities and carry out the physician's treatment. She believed strongly in "getting inside the skin" of her patients as a way of knowing what he or she needed. As she said, "The nurse is temporarily the consciousness of the unconscious, the love of life for the suicidal, the leg of the amputee, the eyes of the newly blind, a means of locomotion for the infant and the knowledge and confidence of the new mother" (Henderson, 1955).</p>
                        <p>Henderson's beginnings were in public health, and this contributed to her definition of nursing. Because of this background, Henderson was a proponent of publicly financed, universally accessible health care services. Understanding that nurses maintained roots in the communities where they lived, she believed that nursing belonged in the forefront of health care reform. She also believed that nurses should take this opportunity to advance the profession by becoming leaders in developing plans for implementing accessible health care.</p>
                        <p>Today Virginia Henderson is recognized as the "First Lady of Nursing" and is thought by many to be the most important nursing figure in the twentieth century. Her colleagues refer to her as the "the twentieth century Florence Nightingale" (http://www.ualberta.ca/~jmorris /nt/henderson.htm, 2000). She represents the essence and the spirit of nursing in the twentieth century to all of us.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Men in nursing are not unique to the latter part of the twentieth century. Early Egyptian priests practiced nursing. The priests who served the goddess Sekhmet held high social rank. The first nursing school in the world started in India in about 250 B.C., and only men were considered "pure enough" for admission.</p>
                        <p>During the Byzantine Empire, nursing was practiced primarily by men and was a separate profession (Kalisch & Kalisch, 1995). In every plague that swept through Europe, men risked their lives to provide nursing care. In 300 A.D. the Parabolani, a group of men, started a hospital to care for victims of the Black Plague. Two hundred years later, St. Benedict founded the Benedictine Nursing Order (Kalisch & Kalisch, 1995). Throughout the Middle Ages military, religious, and lay orders of men continued to provide nursing care.</p>
                        <p>Before the Civil War, male and female slaves were identified as "nurses." During the Civil War, the Union used mainly female nurse volunteers, although some men also filled this responsibility. Walt Whitman, for example, served as a volunteer nurse in the Union Army. The Confederate Army took a more formal stand and identified 30 men in each regiment to serve as military nurses. Charged with this responsibility, these men tended to the ill on the battlefields (Clay, 1928). During this war, more men died than in any other war in U.S. history.</p>
                        <p>The Alexian Brothers, named after St. Alexis, a fifth century nurse, were first organized in the 1300s to provide nursing care to those afflicted with the Black Death. In 1863, the Alexian Brothers opened their first hospital in this country to educate men as nurses. The Mills School for Nursing and St. Vincent's School for men were organized in New York in 1888. At that time, men did not attend female nursing schools.</p>
                        <p>Nursing continued to develop as a predominantly female profession, excluding men from entering into schools of nursing and its professional organization. The Nurses Associated Alumnae of the United States and Canada held its first annual meeting in Baltimore in 1897. This organization developed into the American Nurses Association in 1911, and continued to exclude men until 1930. One of the early accomplishments of the organization was to prevent men from practicing as nurses in the military.</p>
                        <p>The Army Nurse Corps, created in 1901, barred men from serving as nurses (Kalisch & Kalisch, 1996). The U.S. military changed from predominantly male nurses to female. At the conclusion of the Korean War, the armed services permitted men to serve as military nurses (Brown, 1942).</p>
                        <p>Once men entered the military as nurses, their numbers increased in civilian nursing as well. Nursing schools admitted men into the classroom. The numbers of men in nursing gradually increased. Today, although still a comparatively small group, the number of men pursing nursing careers continues to rise. Men are attaining graduate degrees and specialty certifications in the profession. The face of nursing is changing as men continue to enhance the profession by resuming their historical role as caring, nurturing nurses.</p>

                        <p>As nursing moves forward in the twenty-first century, the need for courageous and innovative nurse leaders is greater than ever. Society's demand for high-quality health care at an affordable cost is a contemporary force for change. Nursing has become as diversified as the populations we serve. We began in hospitals, moved to the community, moved back into the hospitals, and are now seeing a move back to the community. Men were the earliest nurses, then left the profession, and have now returned, bringing with them new ideas and leadership abilities. We will be the Nightingales, Walds, Sangers, Nuttings, and Hendersons of the future; the creativity and dedication of these nurses are part of all of us.</p>
