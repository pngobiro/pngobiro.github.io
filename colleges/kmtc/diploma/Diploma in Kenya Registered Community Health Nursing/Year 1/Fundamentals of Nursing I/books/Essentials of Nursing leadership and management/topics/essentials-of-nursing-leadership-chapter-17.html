                <section id="introduction" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-2">
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The following story is one version of how health care may be delivered in the future:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Arriving at the surgical center of the future, a robotic nurse greets the client and instructs him or her to proceed to the walk-up window, which resembles a present-day automatic teller machine. The LCD screen instructs the client to place the appropriate health insurance card into the slot. A computerized voice offers the client several selections:</p>
                            <p>"Press 1 if you are having surgery. Press 2 if you are having diagnostic tests. Press 3 if you are here to have a postoperative evaluation. Press 4 if you need further assistance. A qualified healthcare person will be with you shortly."</p>
                            <p>The voice continues to direct the client, who requires surgery, to choose the appropriate surgical procedure from those listed across the computer screen. After the procedure is verified and approved, the client receives directions from the electronic voice:</p>
                            <p>"You may now enter through the double doors to your right. The doors will open automatically. Please step carefully onto the moving platform. The platform is traveling at the same speed as the treatment vehicle. Kindly enter the first treatment vehicle as it approaches. Place the second finger of your left hand into the yellow circle for a blood test. A blood pressure cuff will encircle your left upper arm. Do not pull on the bar or belts. The safety bars and seat belts will lock automatically as the back of your vehicle reclines and the footrest rises to the forward position. Your vital signs and other appropriate information will be monitored by highly sophisticated computer technology throughout your entire stay with us.</p>
                            <p>"As you pass through Station 1, please place your right arm through the designated opening for the placement of your intravenous line. An automated sensor robot will insert this. Through the use of infrared sensors and sonography, the sensor robot locates an appropriate vessel with greater skill than a human nurse. You may feel a slight burning at this time. Do not pull your arm away. We repeat, do not pull your arm away.</p>
                            <p>"You are now approaching Station 2. Please place your right hand through the designated opening to receive the appropriate medication. The computerized vehicle in which you are traveling has automatically calculated the accurate dosage of medication based on your body weight and metabolism. The medication you will receive has been determined by an analysis of your blood drawn at Station 1. This eliminates any possibility of human error. However, if at any time you feel any itching, tingling, or tightness in your throat or have difficulty breathing, please press the red button on the left side of your vehicle. Our computers will automatically institute emergency measures for your health and safety. This action precludes the possible delays that can occur in the human decisionmaking process.</p>
                            <p>"You have reached Station 3, your assigned surgical suite. Please observe the screen in front of the vehicle. Meet your surgeon, Dr. I.M. Yourfuture, from Houston, Texas. Through the use of computer technology and robotics, she will perform seven of these procedures simultaneously in different geographic locations. Anesthesia will be administered through the mask moving toward your face. Please remain still while the robot arm securely fastens the straps around your neck. Take several slow, deep breaths when the blue light on the console begins to flash. Your anesthetic dose has been predetermined through a highly sophisticated mathematical formula. Pleasant dreams. We hope you enjoy your surgery while at 21st Century Surgical Center, saving healthcare dollars for a better tomorrow."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Compare the experience of the 21st Century Surgical Center to this alternative view of the future of health care:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Arriving at the New Age Health Center, the client walks into a central atrium, is offered a cool drink, and is encouraged to "choose a comfortable seat in the center, where you can enjoy the musical fountain or meditate in one of our quiet corners, whichever you prefer." After relaxing for a while in the atrium, the client walks down the hall to the consultation rooms. The client notices that one of the center's animal healers (a big, friendly Labrador) has joined him and is accompanying him down the hall.</p>
                            <p>Guides along the walkway ask the client whether he knows the way or if he would like some assistance in choosing a healer to consult. "I'm feeling very stressed at work lately," answers the client. "Having trouble sleeping, which is unusual for me."</p>
                            <p>"We have several ways to approach your concerns," says the guide. "You could try our stressreducing exercise path, our yoga path, the medicinal consultation, the sleep consultation, or all four if you'd like. We have also added a Shaman to our group of alternative healers.</p>
                            <p>Although a licensed physician, he spent several years on the Hopi Indian reservation working with their Medicine Man."</p>
                            <p>"I already have a good exercise program and prefer not to use medicinal therapies unless they're necessary, so I think I'll try that sleep consultation. I really need to get more sleep than I have lately."</p>
                            <p>The guide nods and directs the client toward the sleep center. "Ralph (the Labrador) would be happy to go with you, if you'd like." Ralph wags his tail in agreement.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the consultation, the client walks to the door with his sleep tapes and a video explaining how to use them with the same directions given by the sleep consultant. His sleep consultant bids him "a good night's rest tonight," and Ralph walks him back to the atrium, leaving him with a quiet "woof."</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>What is your preferred view of future healthcare delivery? Do you prefer the high-tech approach of the 21st Century Surgical Center or the high-touch approach of the New Age Health Center? Which would your clients choose? Is there a way to combine the best of both approaches? Which one do you think will prevail in the future?</p>
                        <p>We don't know for sure how health care will be delivered in the future or what nurses' roles will be in the healthcare system of the future. However, we can look at the current trends in our society, their effect on today's healthcare system, and what they may tell us about the future. By doing this, we may find some clues to the future of health care and of the nursing profession.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A number of general trends in our society appear to be influencing the direction of health care. Among the most important of these are the effects of technology, the survival of greater numbers of people with high-risk conditions, gene therapies, and an increasing tendency to evaluate worth in economic terms.</p>
                        <h3>Effects of Technology</h3>
                        <p>On the whole, Americans value innovation, invention, and aggressive approaches to solving problems, all in the name of progress, efficiency, and productivity (Postman, 1992). In seconds, computers can complete highly complex calculations that would take days or weeks if done by hand. Sophisticated monitors, microsurgery, laser technology, cellular phones, satellite positioning, space exploration, and a whole wonderful array of technical advances have made it possible to do things faster, cheaper, and more accurately.</p>
                        <p>Yet, there may be some disadvantages to all this progress. One of the major concerns about the increasing influence (if not dominance) of technology on our lives is that it may be destructive and dehumanizing. Technological progress may come at a high price, especially to our increasingly stressed natural environment. It may also cause us to neglect the emotional and spiritual aspects of the human experience.</p>
                        <p>Postman (1992), for example, has commented on the "chilling" use of computerrelated metaphors to describe human behavior, especially thinking. He uses the story of the introduction of the stethoscope to illustrate how a piece of equipment can come between the client and the physician. Before the stethoscope was developed, a physician had to place his or her ear right on the client's chest or depend on the client's description of symptoms to understand the problem. When stethoscopes became available, this was no longer necessary.</p>
                        <p>Although a stethoscope hardly seems like a major barrier between client and caregiver, consider adding x-rays, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography to the list. An x-ray or scan can be diagnosed via modem and computer screen by a practitioner hundreds or thousands of miles away. We now have the ability to "view the insides" of the individual, allowing physicians and nurses to identify not just structures but also function. This has changed the focus from attempting to understand the client's response to the problem to just finding the cause and fixing it. The importance of the client's experience seems to diminish each time another piece of equipment is put into use. Each device or instrument is thought to supply more "objective" information than the words of the client or the eyes, ears, and hands of the caregiver can supply.</p>
                        <p>Today, we even have computerized client interviews, which can be used in place of taking a client history. Specialists can direct surgery across the globe. Before long, it may be possible to monitor our clients without seeing or touching them at all.</p>
                        <p>Home pregnancy tests, personal HIV testing kits, and kits to test stools for occult blood are already available to the consumer. Personal computers allow individuals to gain access to medical information previously known only by physicians and other healthcare providers. As the technology improves, the consumer will have the ability to purchase tools that allow self-diagnosis. As we move into the future, this will probably change the physician's role to that of counselor, along with diagnosis. This counseling will most likely include an interpretation of the home diagnostic testing.</p>
                        <p>Contrast this highly technological scenario with the philosophy that caring is an essential element of health care. Watson (1988) states that knowing, being with, doing for, and enabling the individual should be part of any encounter with a healthcare professional. In a machine-oriented healthcare environment, talking with a client and family could become superfluous. In a caring environment, it would be a priority (Locsin, 1995). The scenarios at the beginning of the chapter illustrate the differences between these two concepts.</p>
                        <p>Clients define quality of nursing care as a combination of technical competence and caring behaviors. Although clients want the healthcare provider to listen and provide the personal touch, they expect the use of technology. Many clients feel that if the healthcare provider does not perform a scan or the newest laser procedure, they are not receiving quality health care. This creates a dilemma for the healthcare provider. However, even in this time of confusion and change in health care, nurses can retain their commitment to caring and quality of care for the clients we serve. Miller (1996, p. 32) suggests ways to keep caring in nursing practice Box (17-1).</p>
                        <h3>Survival of Vulnerable Individuals</h3>
                        <p>From high-risk newborns to accident victims to the critically ill elderly, advances in health care have made it possible for many to survive who would not have survived in years past. The result is that we have both very high expectations of our healthcare system and larger numbers of people in need of care, especially of rehabilitation, long-term care, and home health care. The "baby boomers" are entering their fifties. As they move into their later years, their need for health care will increase. Increasing life expectancy, increasing numbers of individuals with chronic problems, and increasing diversity of the older population will challenge our present system (Roy, 2000: U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). Continued advances in technology will not only provide more options but also keep people alive longer. A great deal of concern has been expressed that the current healthcare system is not equipped to respond to these demands.</p>
                        <p>The belief that everyone has a right to the best possible health care, no matter how much it costs, has been weakened by this concern that our resources are limited and could be exhausted unless some restraints are put into place (Drew, 1990).</p>
                        <h3>Emphasis on Economics</h3>
                        <p>We anticipate having not only more people to care for but also a bigger bill for the new technologies, which are very costly (McClure, 2000). Concern about cost has led us on a quest for the highest level of efficiency possible in the delivery of health care. The result is a whole range of changes designed to minimize the time and money spent on a patient and to maximize the profit gained. The danger is that this may result in a serious decline in the quality of health care and eventually pose a threat to the health of the population, especially the most vulnerable members of our society (Ritzer, 1993).</p>
                        <p>The April 8, 1996, issue of Business Week identified a number of large employers, such as Xerox, USAIR, GTE, and Marriott, that had been instrumental in pushing for lower health costs. By the end of 1995, corporations had convinced 71 percent of their employees to move into less costly managed care plans (Magnusson, 1996, p. 104). In the past, patients, insurers, and the government were unlikely to question a medical decision or the cost of implementing that decision. Today, the final decision may rest with a representative of an insurance company or HMO who does not even have a healthcare background, unless the client is able to pay out of his or her own pocket.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, the decision is made primarily on the basis of cost rather than the need of the client, and accusations of unnecessary harm and even death resulting from cost-based decisions have been made. There is some evidence that healthcare consumers are beginning to rebel against these cost-driven decisions, in some cases by taking the issue to the courts (Felsenthal, 1996). In addition, some states are adopting laws to better define a client's rights in cases in which needed care is not made available. In the next section, we describe some of these changes in more detail.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>What has been the response to these attempts to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of health care? Leah Curtin (1996, p. 7) has described the response eloquently:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>A coward dies a thousand deaths, a brave man dies but once . . . but once is enough. So goes the new twist on an old proverb. It is particularly apropos today when fear rules—if not the land, then at least the health care system and almost all of the 10 million people it employs. Administrators fear loss of influence, status, and income. Physicians fear loss of autonomy, control, and income. Nurses fear loss of professional standing, job, and income. And just about everyone with two live brain cells and a functioning conscience fears for the safety of patient care.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>It is important that we clearly separate fact from fiction as we respond to the current trends in health care. Let's begin with some background information.</p>
                        <h3>Historical Perspective</h3>
                        <p>Before 1965, the year Medicare was enacted, nurse vacancy rates in hospitals ran between 20 and 25 percent. Once Medicare was enacted, hospitals were able to shift much of the cost of nursing salaries onto Medicare, and the nursing shortages decreased.</p>
                        <p>When the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) were introduced in the 1980s, the number of hospital admissions and average length of stay were reduced. Clients admitted to hospitals were more acutely ill and were discharged more quickly (the "quicker and sicker" movement). At this time, hospitals realized that the registered nurse was best able to provide the care needed to move these clients safely and quickly through the hospital stay. Although hospitals began questioning physicians about their practice patterns, the use of registered nurses to provide most of the client care was not questioned. However, in the 1990s, hospitals were unable to shift costs any further, managed care became far more popular, and uncertainty over healthcare reform lingered in the air (Buerhaus, 1995, p. 10), raising questions about the role of nurses and other healthcare professionals in the healthcare system of the future.</p>
                        <p>Today, Medicare and Medicaid absorb roughly 18 percent of the federal budget every year. At the end of 1995, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the accumulated federal deficit to be $3617 trillion. Another 16 percent of the federal budget has to be used to pay the interest on this debt. It is projected that by the year 2005, the federal deficit will be close to $6757 trillion. Healthcare costs are projected to reach $16 trillion by the year 2030 (Buerhaus, 1996b, p. 15; Richards, 1996, p. 13). With the demand for health care increasing, the federal budget deficit growing, and public support for decreasing the debt ongoing, cost-containment measures in health care are certain to continue.</p>
                        <h3>Managed Care</h3>
                        <p>Managed care is "a coordinated approach to providing necessary health services with an ultimate goal of low-cost, quality care" (Richards, 1996, p. 13). The most common type of managed-care organization is the health maintenance organization, or HMO. Physicians are also organizing groups to offer managed care through preferred provider organizations (PPOs).</p>
                        <p>Consumers in a managed-care system select a primary care physician provider from an approved list. Each provider is paid a predetermined (capitation) rate for each client, usually on a monthly basis. The primary care physician is seen as the "gatekeeper" because the client cannot consult specialists without a referral from the primary care physician. Using out-of-plan providers is not allowed in many plans. If out-of-plan providers are allowed, the client is often charged the full cost or a large part of the cost of services for this referral.</p>
                        <p>The theory behind managed care is that stressing preventive health care, including yearly physicals, immunizations, and health education, is an effective way to avoid illness and future hospitalizations, thereby reducing costs (Richards, 1996, p. 13). Eight of the nine leading causes of death in the United States can be reduced by attention to lifestyle changes: smoking, lack of exercise, unsafe sex, unsafe driving, and poor diets (Hays, 2000 ). If clients do become ill, the physicians within the plan are often given powerful incentives to control costs (Buerhaus, 1996a, p. 21) by limiting the number of diagnostic tests done, for example, or by avoiding a hospital stay altogether if possible. "Consumers are angry and suspicious and many healthcare providers, nurses among them, are frustrated and disillusional" (Roy, 2000, p. 122).</p>
                        <p>Criticism of the way in which managed-care plans operate has been considerable. The concerns include physician gag rules (the inability of the physician to disclose restrictions or options for the client), overly short maternity hospital stays, qualifications of providers, difficult access to specialists, and the influence of financial incentives given to physicians to reduce costs. In addition, many critics fear that Medicaid, often considered the last resort for people who are unable to pay for their own health care, will be threatened and that many parts of the country, such as rural areas, may not be well served under managed care (Pierce & Luikart, 1996, p. 28; Rovner, 1996, p. 1).</p>
                        <p>Proponents of managed-care organizations respond by stating that the criticism is mostly from physician specialists and medical societies who are unhappy with losing their piece of the healthcare pie (Grimaldi, 1996, p. 12). Balancing the need to control costs while meeting the call for high-quality care is the primary leadership challenge for healthcare providers entering the twenty-first century (Hays, 2000).</p>
                        <h3>Subacute Care</h3>
                        <p>Another way to reduce cost is to shift people out of expensive acute care hospitals as quickly as possible into less costly settings, such as subacute care units. Subacute units can offer round-the-clock nursing care to stable clients with a variety of diagnoses. Subacute care may be offered in a variety of settings; freestanding skilled nursing facilities, hospital-based skilled nursing units, swing bed units, and rehabilitation hospitals or units can all be used for subacute care.</p>
                        <p>Many subacute care providers have developed programs for specific populations, such as people in need of wound care, oncology treatment, or rehabilitation. Nurses skilled in these areas can significantly decrease the cost of providing care. Many believe that the subacute setting will continue to grow as a viable alternative to more costly acute care (Masso, 1995). Associate-degree-prepared nurses are in great demand in subacute units. Their expertise in the essentials of nursing care for the relatively stable client will assist the managed-care provider in offering cost-effective, quality care (Browne & Biancolillo, 1996, p. 23).</p>
                        <h3>Community-Based Care</h3>
                        <p>Another alternative to the acute care setting is to provide care in ambulatory settings and in the home. Many types of surgery can be done on an outpatient basis, and many therapies once considered too complex to do at home (intravenous therapies and dialysis, for example) are now being done safely and effectively in clients' homes. Specialization common in acute facilities is emerging in home care: wound care, dialysis care, perinatal and congestive heart failure management are a few examples (McClure, 2000). Buerhaus (1996a, p. 14) lists characteristics of the past and future healthcare delivery systems (Table 17-1).</p>
                        <h3>Changing Healthcare Institutions</h3>
                        <p>You are probably well aware that many changes have occurred in healthcare institutions recently and that much of the change has been in response to pressure to restrain spending for health care. Employers who pay their workers' health insurance costs, insurance companies themselves, and state and federal agencies have all contributed to this pressure.</p>
                        <p>Healthcare institutions have been forced to make a number of changes designed to keep costs under control. It is still not clear whether they will be successful in their attempts to provide quality care while holding down costs (Curtin, 1994). Healthcare institutions have been busy reengineering, restructuring, and redesigning jobs. Let's define each of these terms first.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reengineering</strong> involves changing the processes by which things are accomplished. The use of critical pathways in directing client care is a form of reengineering. The term reengineering often is used erroneously for what is actually restructuring. <strong>Restructuring</strong> alters the architecture of the organization. Promoters of restructuring usually suggest fewer managerial levels, decentralization, and allowing first-line caregivers to make more decisions. <strong>Job redesign</strong> is focused on who does what and how the work can be accomplished more efficiently. Cross-training is frequently used to accomplish this (Curtin, 1994).</p>
                        <p>In an effort to maximize service with the least number of staff members possible, many hospitals have undertaken cross-training. This often involves training healthcare professionals from other disciplines to perform some nursing functions, such as dispensing medications or starting IV lines. At the same time, nurses are being taught the skills of other healthcare providers, such as doing electrocardiograms or basic laboratory tests.</p>
                        <p>As you can see, cross-training is part of a movement away from having many different specialists and toward making everyone more of a generalist. Many healthcare professionals have concerns about these efforts to change the way in which care is given and by whom (Strasen, 1994). In fact, when faced with these changes, some staff have exhibited anger, foot-dragging, and active resistance (del Bueno, 1995), which has created morale problems in some institutions. It also presents a problem for the new graduate who needs assistance in adapting to the new working environment.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">EFFECT ON NURSING</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The profession of nursing has evolved along with the healthcare system. One of the few things we can say for certain is that it will continue to evolve:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Looking back through the cloudy lenses of time, we see the nurse as the comforter and assistant to the physician healer. She took our temperature, measured our pulse, read our blood pressure, held our hands—and, in places like emergency rooms and far-off battlefields, got her hands bloody as she nursed. That nurse, though nobly remembered, is far removed from today's reality. (Alliance for Health Care Reform, 1996, p. 1)</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>In 1995, the Pew Health Professions Commission predicted that there could be a surplus of 200,000 to 300,000 nurses as acute care hospitals downsize, close, and consolidate. They predicted that registered nurses would move into different settings to provide health care. Members of the commission suggested that nursing education programs reduce the size of their basic programs and increase the number of master's degree-level nurse practitioner programs. The Pew Commission discussed the possibility of consolidating allied health professional roles into one multiskilled provider (Pew Health Professions Commission, 1995).</p>
                        <p>Indeed, the past decade saw pronounced changes in the organization and delivery of health care, many related to the Pew Commission suggestions. Several common elements were identified in both North America and Europe: (a) decentralization of allied health departments such as physical therapy; (b) cross-training of workers with varying education and expertise to assume tasks traditionally outside their scope of work and historically nursing responsibilities; (c) movement of ancillary personnel, such as housekeeping, to patient units; (d) the team concept, in which workers can do interchangeable tasks and therefore be substituted for each other; (e) skill mix reductions with a decreasing percentage of RNs on patient units (Aiken, Clarke, & Sloan, 2000). Today, the greatest impact to nursing appears to be in the following areas.</p>
                        <h3>Elimination of Positions</h3>
                        <p>Forced to contain costs, hospitals have merged departments and units. This elimination of services has also resulted in the loss of nursing positions. Nurse managers may be responsible for two or three units instead of just one. Staffing levels were reduced to the minimum necessary to provide safe care. These practices continue to result in too few nurses for too many clients, often causing stress for the staff (Curtin, 1994).</p>
                        <h3>Changes in Practice Environment</h3>
                        <p>The changes in skill mix have been viewed as a method of relieving RNs from non-nursing duties. In reality, this strategy decreases RN staffing. Nurses remain responsible for supervising the decentralized staff, a task that is extremely time-consuming and raises concerns for patient safety.</p>
                        <p>Despite increasing patient acuity during the last decade, the proportion of RN positions essentially has not changed. Nurses over the past decade have accounted for 24 percent of the personnel positions in acute care hospitals. LPN positions have decreased by 2 percent. As early as 1990, nurses voiced their concerns about safety for patient care related to inadequate RN-to-patient ratios. In 1999, California became the first state to mandate minimum nurse-to-patient ratios. Nurses across the country continue to oppose the emphasis on reductions in nurse staffing and skill mix (Aiken, Clarke, & Sloan, 2000).</p>
                        <h3>Nursing Shortage</h3>
                        <p>In 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted that by 2006 job opportunities for RNs and LPNs will increase by 21 percent. This is compared to a nationwide increase of 14 percent for other jobs. The demand for RNs will exceed supply by 250,000 full-time equivalents (FTEs). As the twenty-first century begins, an increase of 125 percent more RNs over the currently employed number is needed in longterm care institutions (Mailey et al., 2000, p. 482). Among the origins of the nursing shortage are: (a) steep population growths in some areas, (b) aging of the nursing profession's "baby boomers," (c) fewer students electing to study nursing as a profession, and (d) reduction of available nurses with needed skills and expertise for current society (Blouin & Brent, 2000, p. 293).</p>
                        <p>Ensuring a sufficient RN workforce is not as simple as "a nurse is a nurse is a nurse" mentality. The question becomes which types of RNs, based on educational achievement and experience, will be needed. The National Advisory Council on Nurse Education has recommended that at least two-thirds of the basic nurse workforce hold BSN degrees by 2010, with a projected deficit of more than 200,000 BSN nurses. Entry-level baccalaureate enrollments and RN-BSN completion enrollments are dropping. Approximately 15 percent of associate's-degree nurses nationwide eventually pursue the BSN (Rapson & Rice, 1999, p. 5; Blouin & Brent, 2000, p. 293).</p>
                        <h3>Changes in Organizational Climate</h3>
                        <p>In 1998, 20 magnet hospitals and two major teaching hospitals were surveyed related to changes in organizational climate. These hospitals were identified as "better" hospitals in terms of nursing practice environments and patient outcomes. A significant decrease in dimensions of satisfaction was noted for each individual hospital. The major categories of practice declines included: (a) resource adequacy; (b) nurse manager ability; (c) regard for nursing, including both nursing staff and nursing administration; and (d) other issues related to nursing control, power, and decision making (Aiken, Clarke, & Sloan, 2000).</p>
                        <h3>Preventing Patient Care Errors</h3>
                        <p>Current studies reveal that healthcare errors kill 44,000-98,000 persons each year. This is more deaths than occur from AIDS, traffic accidents, or breast cancer. Agencies will be developing policies and procedures to monitor healthcare errors more closely. The committee that prepared the report on deaths from healthcare errors for the Institute of Medicine indicated that the majority of errors result from basic flaws in healthcare organization. As a member of the healthcare team, you have a responsibility to identify system and personnel issues that may potentially cause patient care errors (Blouin & Brent, 2000).</p>
                        <h3>Emphasis on Outcomes</h3>
                        <p>Healthcare agencies are being challenged by consumers, insurance companies, legislators, and other stakeholders to provide objective measures of the quality of health care provided. Outcomes measurement is required by most accrediting organizations as a method of evaluating quality and help from objective evidence about the results of the healthcare process. Many outcomes measures currently are used to evaluate health care, but few of them represent nursing's specific and unique contribution to patient care.</p>
                        <p>Outcomes measurement is the process of collecting and analyzing data using predetermined outcomes indicators for the purposes of making decisions about health care. Each specific indicator must be operationally defined very precisely so that all professionals are consistent in data collection and analysis.</p>
                        <p>To address this issue, the American Nurses Association (ANA) instituted the Nursing Care Report Card for Acute Care in which ten specific quality indicators of nursing were developed and defined. The ANA felt that these indicators had a strong connection to quality nursing care. Table 17-2 outlines the indicators and their operational definitions (ANA, 2000).</p>
                        <p>You may be thinking that collecting "numbers" is too time-consuming for you, the new staff nurse, and certainly does not rank high on your list of priority nursing activities. However, without evidence that nursing is having an impact on the quality of care, decisions will be made in health care that may be detrimental to patients and to the nursing profession. Being able to link these outcomes to staffing levels is only one way in which nursing can impact health and institutional policies. As a staff nurse, your ability to focus on evidence-based practice instead of just tasks is of the utmost importance.</p>

                            <p>The contribution that nursing makes to health care is well known, but has not been clearly demonstrated. Little objective evidence presently exists establishing linkages between nursing and health outcomes. Most of present day nursing care is still based on intuition or trial and error practices. Although it presents challenges, and sometimes confusion and chaos, the profession of nursing must join its medical colleagues in the routine investigation of its practices for the purpose of generating EVIDENCE.</p>

                        <h3>Changing Competencies</h3>
                        <p>The dissatisfaction with organizational climate may be related to the lack of preparation of nurse leaders to assume the challenges of the twenty-first century. Competencies identified by nurse managers as essential for the workplace of the future include (Rapson & Rice, 1999; Byers, 2000):</p>

                        <h3>Responding to the Changes in the Healthcare System</h3>
                        <p>As we move into the new millennium, it is time to take stock of what nurses do, what they can do, and what they should do. Hopefully, lessons learned from the old challenges of the 20th century will assist us in providing more effective nursing practice, education, research, and administration in the 21st century. (Coughlin, 2000, p. 403; Blouin & Brent, 2000, p. 293).</p>
                        <p>Following are some suggestions for dealing with the ongoing changes in health care. They are based on a set of "rules for successful redesign" developed by Porter-O'Grady (1996).</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Remember that everyone is affected in some way by these changes. No one is exempt. Don't be like the proverbial ostrich that buries its head in the sand. Look up; look around at what's happening, and prepare to respond effectively.</li>
                            <li>Watch for clues that indicate what trends are occurring. Use your own insight and experience to analyze these trends. Listen to what others are saying, especially the leaders of the profession, and read the news reports and professional literature to keep abreast of what is expected to happen.</li>
                            <li>Follow your vision. What is it about nursing that is especially important to you? What are your values? Hold on to what is most meaningful, and continue to work toward accomplishing your vision.</li>
                            <li>Empower yourself and others. Actually, as Porter-O'Grady (1996, p. 50) notes, there is "precious little real empowerment" of employees in most healthcare organizations. (Some of the suggestions in Chapter 7 on power and organizations may help you develop your own sense of empowerment.)</li>
                            <li>Understand how your own goals fit with your employer's goals. Your personal goals and vision for nursing may or may not agree with your employer's. It is important that you recognize whatever differences exist and decide how you can reconcile them, if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Look past today. When changes come at you fast and furiously, it is very difficult to step back and evaluate the effect of those changes and to decide how to respond to them. You need to keep in mind your own long-term career plan and to evaluate how you can accomplish your goals in a changing environment.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Although some of these changes may be disturbing, there are positive aspects to what is happening in health care. These changes provide an opportunity for nursing to emerge as a positive force in the midst of a revolution. Nursing offers caring in a system that appears to have forgotten its importance to people and their well-being.</p>

                        <p>Future trends in the twenty-first century include (O'Leary & O'Leary, 1999; Coughlin, 2000; Hayes, 2000):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Increasing pressure from consumers for quality healthcare services</li>
                            <li>Continuing decrease in inpatient care and greater need for outpatient care</li>
                            <li>Focus on family responsibilities, such as wellness, health promotion, safety, self-care management, advanced directives</li>
                            <li>Hospital profitability will continue to drive success</li>
                            <li>Demand for innovative nurse leadership with an ability to manage in the political arena</li>
                            <li>Tracking of outcomes and profitability within case management models</li>
                            <li>Mentoring and role modeling will increase</li>
                            <li>Collaborative partnerships between physicians and nurses will emerge</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>What does all this mean to the graduate nurse entering the healthcare system? Healthcare institutions will expect new nurses to be flexible and use skills that may not have been included in their basic education. Graduate nurses will need to be open to learning new information and developing different skills. You should consider your future education plans. The demands on the new graduate will be greater, and client outcomes will be observed more closely. Nurses will also find opportunities in a variety of health settings, particularly in the community (Lescavage, 1995).</p>
                        <p>Earlier chapters discussed client care management techniques, communication skills, and teamwork. Now is the time to put all these ideas together and develop your leadership role in the working environment. If you maintain a positive attitude as you gain experience, you will become more comfortable in this challenging environment.</p>
                        <p>This is the time for nursing to demonstrate what it has to offer. Consider these changes to be positive, and realize that to gain satisfaction from your chosen profession, you must be proactive within it. Anticipate the future with excitement and remember that "a nurse is never finished" (Nightingale, 1859).</p>
