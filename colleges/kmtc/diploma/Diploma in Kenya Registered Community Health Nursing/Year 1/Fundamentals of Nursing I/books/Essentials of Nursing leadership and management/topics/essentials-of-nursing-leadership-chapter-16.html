                        <p>What image comes to mind when the word "nurse" is mentioned? Why do most nurses continue to feel unappreciated by the public, physicians, administration, and their coworkers? Why is it still so difficult to define what nursing really is?</p>
                        <p>Lack of a clear definition of the profession, control of nursing by institutions and physicians, the role of American women in society, and the failure by nurses to take control of their own profession have all influenced nursing as it developed in the United States. Many of these influences continue today, as nursing moves toward the achievement of a clearer identity and acceptance as a true profession.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">THE PUBLIC'S IMAGE OF NURSING</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>More than 25 years ago, Beletz (1974) wrote that society perceived nurses in sex-linked, task-oriented terms: "a female who performs unpleasant technical jobs and functions as an assistant to the physician" (p. 432). Although television programs and advertisements featuring nurses are more realistic than they were a decade ago, nurses are still depicted as handmaidens who carry out physician orders. Nurses' contributions to health care as independent decision makers are often underestimated and unrecognized by the public.</p>
                        <h3>COMMUNICATING NURSING'S ROLE</h3>
                        <p>The TriCouncil (a joint effort of several professional nursing organizations) organized a campaign in 1993 designed specifically to communicate the significant contributions of nurses. Three areas in particular were emphasized:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Nurses as resource people available to interpret technical health information for consumers</li>
                            <li>Nurses as healthcare coordinators who assist consumers in identifying and using appropriate healthcare services</li>
                            <li>Nurses as expert practitioners in the provision of health care (Swirsky, 1993)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Collectively, nurses have more potential power and influence than they currently exhibit. To be able to use this power, nurses need to become more aware of it and more skilled in its use. To improve their confidence, Hess (1993) suggests that nurses think of themselves as "special agents" who have the following responsibilities:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Carry your license.</strong> The strongest legitimate power that nurses have is the exclusive license to provide the kind of care that the public sees as vitally important. This license provides nurses with intimate access to those entrusted to their care. Your license should also be advertised in the professional appearance that you maintain. Although you may believe that people should not be judged by their appearance, they often are. Think, for example, of how you would feel at a restaurant if the person serving you had dirty hair or fingernails.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use your special training and experience.</strong> Only nurses know what they know. No one else in health care has their broad, specialized education and skills. Be both self-confident and respectful of others when sharing your knowledge and skills with them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Become a double agent.</strong> Use your personal knowledge and experience to form professional and personal coalitions, both at work and elsewhere.</li>
                            <li><strong>Network and empower your colleagues.</strong> Extend your knowledge of caring to other nurses. Nurses can help each other increase their skills and advance their careers. Empowerment is defined as "the enabling of people and groups of people to act and make decisions where an equitable distribution of power exists" (Mason, Backer, & Georges, 1993). Focusing on consensus building and group decision making will assist nurses in becoming empowered.</li>
                            <li><strong>Eliminate the enemy within.</strong> The greatest enemy is the colleague with self-defeating thoughts and behaviors. Mobilize yourself and others to positively plan for change. Destructive attitudes, criticism, and manipulation of others do not foster a spirit of group collectivity and equality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on operations.</strong> No matter what level you are, participate. Instead of focusing on the problem, become part of the solution. For example, be a positive infiltrator of relevant hospital committees and professional associations.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Registered nurses (RNs) comprise the largest segment of the healthcare workforce. There are more than 2.5 million licensed RNs, and approximately 2 million are employed in the profession (American Nurses Association, 2000a). The future of nursing depends on nurses' ability to organize as a group, recognize and accept their differences, and develop the skills necessary to negotiate and manage within the changing healthcare system. A summary of recent demographics for registered nurses in the United States is included in Table 16-1.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Definitions from Nursing Leaders</h3>
                        <p>The changes that have occurred in nursing are reflected in the definitions of nursing that have been developed since the time of Florence Nightingale.</p>
                        <h4>1859: Nightingale</h4>
                        <p>Nightingale defined the goal of nursing as putting the client "in the best possible condition for nature to act upon him" (Nightingale, 1959, p. 79)</p>
                        <h4>1950: Henderson</h4>
                        <p>Virginia Henderson focused her definition on the uniqueness of nursing: "The unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health or its recovery (or to peaceful death) that he would perform unaided if he had the necessary strength, will or knowledge. And to do this in such a way as to help him gain independence as rapidly as possible" (Henderson, 1966, p. 21).</p>
                        <h4>1963: Rogers</h4>
                        <p>Martha Rogers defined nursing practice as "the process by which this body of knowledge, nursing science, is used for the purpose of assisting human beings to achieve maximum health within the potential of each person" (Rogers, 1988, p. 100). Rogers emphasized that nursing is concerned with all people, only a segment of whom are ill.</p>
                        <h4>1980: American Nurses Association</h4>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association (ANA) published a social policy statement on the nature and scope of nursing practice (Fig. 16-1). The ANA House of Delegates periodically reviews the Code of Ethics and makes recommendations for changes. The statement was intended to promote unity and allow members of the profession to develop a common approach to practice. The issues addressed in the ANA's social policy statement (1995) include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>The social context of nursing.</strong> Nursing is a part of our society and should be seen as serving the interests of society. Nursing plays an integral part in identifying the current social concerns and influencing the direction of health care. Nursing practice continues to be health oriented and is concerned with identifying the working relationships necessary to carry out these health-oriented responsibilities.</li>
                            <li><strong>The nature and scope of nursing practice.</strong> The ANA defined nursing as "the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to actual or potential health problems" (1980, p. 9). This definition was later altered to include the four essential features of contemporary nursing practice listed under the third bulleted item in Figure 16-1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Specialization in nursing practice.</strong> Specialization in nursing practice began to appear in the 1950s, and by 1980, it was firmly entrenched. Specialists in nursing practice hold graduate degrees in advanced clinical practice and are eligible to obtain certification in their specialty. The graduate nurse just entering practice is expected to have certain minimum competencies; the specialist is expected to be an expert.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regulation of nursing practice.</strong> Nurses are legally accountable for their actions as defined by statutes and regulations within state nurse practice acts. The nursing profession also regulates itself through the Code for Nurses (see Appendix 1) and the Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice (see Appendix 2). In addition, credentialing examinations provide opportunities for nurses to document other expertise.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For example, a nurse may become a certified medical-surgical or home health nurse through the ANA's credentialing examinations.</p>
                        <p>As technology continues to advance, nurses will need to redefine their roles clearly to healthcare providers and to the public. The old idea that "a nurse is a nurse is a nurse" does not ensure the level of expertise and safety necessary today.</p>

                        <p>There is probably more agreement on what a profession is than about what occupations qualify as professions. The term professional is used in describing college professors, rock stars, and athletes, all with very different occupations. Several scholars have tried to identify the benchmarks of a profession (Box 16-1).</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>Many nursing experts talk about the "art and science of nursing." Martha Rogers (1988), for example, saw nursing as a science developed through scientific research and analysis and enhanced by the imagination and creativity used by nurses in applying this knowledge to client care. Can this unique service to humanity be defined as a profession? How similar is nursing to the more traditional professions of medicine, law, and the ministry? We will look at each of these characteristics of a profession in terms of the degree to which nursing has met them.</p>
                        <h3>Systematic Body of Knowledge</h3>
                        <p>Does nursing have its own unique, systematic body of knowledge? Those who say no to this question argue that nursing has borrowed from other disciplines, such as the social sciences, biologic sciences, and medicine. These same critics believe that knowledge from these other disciplines, technical skills, intuition, and experience have been combined to become what we call nursing knowledge. Many disciplines use knowledge from other professions. Physicists use knowledge from mathematics, and pharmacists rely on their background in chemistry. Those who say yes argue that nursing theorists and nursing researchers have identified and described a unique body of knowledge. As the results of their work are used in practice, the unique body of knowledge will become more widely recognized.</p>
                        <h3>Mastery of Knowledge and an Ability to Problem Solve</h3>
                        <p>In a true profession, members use their knowledge in a systematic, rational way. The nursing profession uses its knowledge through application of the nursing process to clinical situations. The nursing process is a systematic, problem-solving approach that involves assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, emphasis has also been placed on the use of critical thinking. According to Paul (1993, p. 21), critical thinking is purposeful thinking in which the individual systematically and habitually does the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Imposes the criteria of solid reasoning such as precision, relevance, depth, and accuracy</li>
                            <li>Becomes aware of all assumptions and points of view in an argument</li>
                            <li>Continually assesses the process of thinking</li>
                            <li>Determines strengths and limitations and implications of the thinking</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Critical thinking is an important aspect of the nursing process because the nurse must continually analyze assumptions, weigh evidence, discriminate between possible choices, evaluate conclusions, and verify beliefs, actions, and conclusions.</p>
                        <h3>Specialized Formal Education</h3>
                        <p>One of the biggest threats to the recognition of nursing as a profession is the multiple ways in which a person can pursue preparation to become a registered nurse. As far back as 1965, the ANA published a paper recommending the following:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The education for all of those who are licensed to practice nursing should take place in institutions of higher education; minimum preparation for beginning professional nursing practice should be a baccalaureate degree; minimum preparation for beginning technical nursing practice should be an associate degree in nursing; education for assistants in health service occupations should be short, intensive preservice programs in vocational education rather than on-the-job training (p. 107).</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Similar recommendations continue to emanate from the ANA. In 1978, the ANA House of Delegates adopted a resolution that "by 1985, the minimum preparation for entry into professional nursing practice would be the baccalaureate in nursing and ANA would work with state nurses associations to identify and define two categories of nursing practice by 1980 "(ANA, 1987). This deadline was not met.</p>
                        <p>In 1984, the ANA established a goal for implementation of baccalaureate education by 1995 (ANA Cabinet on Nursing Education, 1983). This deadline has also not been met. As of this writing, graduates from all types of nursing programs—diploma, associate's degree, and baccalaureate degree—are still taking the same licensure examination, and associate's degree graduates make up the largest number entering nursing each year.</p>
                        <p>In addition, many nurses who return to a university for an advanced degree are still encouraged by employers and even by fellow nurses to obtain a baccalaureate or master's degree in a field other than nursing. This is not a common practice in other professions. In fact, the ANA has also issued a statement about this practice:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Requirement of the baccalaureate for entry into professional practice, of advanced learning [master's degree] for specialty practice, administration, and teaching, and of doctoral education that includes focus on research capabilities emerges as necessary to fulfillment of nursing's social responsibility. (1980, p. 22)</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3>Unique, Distinct Role and Autonomy</h3>
                        <p>Are nurses independent and autonomous in their implementation of nursing actions? In some institutions, nursing practice is heavily controlled by medicine or health service administration. A physician must still make simple decisions, such as whether a client can get out of bed to sit in a chair or go to the bathroom. Even in situations in which nurses are allowed to make independent decisions, the protocols may be written and approved by physicians or healthcare administrators. However, in many areas of the country, nursing practice has progressed in the development of a distinct, autonomous role and independent decision making.</p>
                        <h3>Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics</h3>
                        <p>The ANA has provided the nursing profession with Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice (see Appendix 2). Standards of practice have been developed for all areas of nursing for use by nurses, students, faculty, healthcare providers, consumers, and healthcare policy makers.</p>
                        <p>The Code for Nurses, a code of ethics also written by members of the ANA (1985), serves to inform both nurses and consumers of the nursing profession's acceptance of the trust and responsibility given to it by society. It also provides a mechanism for self-regulation within the profession. Members of the ANA review the Code for Nurses on a regular basis and suggest and vote on revisions. In the United States, each state is responsible for having a nurse practice act that defines requirements for licensure, endorsement, exemptions, and revocation of licenses. The practice act establishes a board of nursing and outlines the board's responsibilities. Practice acts usually contain a definition of nursing and penalties for practicing nursing without a license as well. Collectively, the individual boards of nursing compose the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.</p>
                        <h3>Professional Accountability</h3>
                        <p>Graduates of nursing programs become licensed when they have successfully completed the NCLEX examination. To be eligible to sit for the NCLEX examination, students must be graduates of a state-approved school of nursing. This license is the legal document provided by the state to certify that the person named on the license has met the minimum standards for practice.</p>
                        <p>In the past, the NCLEX examination was given on the same day, at the same time, twice a year throughout the United States. However, with the computerized adaptive testing (CAT) used now, students may apply to sit for the examination within weeks of graduation from an approved nursing program by making individual appointments at testing centers approved by their state board of nursing.</p>
                        <p>The NCLEX examination is based on the ANA Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice. The nursing behaviors tested are categorized within the nursing process: assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. Nurses licensed to practice in one state may request permission to practice in another state. This procedure is called endorsement and indicates that the state will accept the registered professional for licensure without additional requirements.</p>
                        <p>Unless a license is revoked for inappropriate behavior, licensure is permanent. Registration is usually renewed every 1 to 2 years by payment of fees to the state or states in which you desire to remain registered. Some states also require evidence of participation in continuing education for license renewal. The National Council for State Boards is currently looking into the possibility of multistate licensure. As the nursing shortage grows, the need for nurses to be mobile from state to state will increase.</p>
                        <p>Nurses with licenses from other countries must apply through the state's board of nursing for review of their credentials before receiving permission to take the NCLEX examination. Often, nurses who were educated in countries other than the United States have to return to an approved nursing program to complete additional nursing courses before receiving permission to take the examination.</p>
                        <p>The board of nursing is formed for the protection of the public, not for the protection of the licensed practitioner. Licensed nurses are responsible for providing safe and competent care. Nurses may be held legally liable for malpractice or for negligence as a result of unsafe or incompetent practice. State boards of nursing review all charges of misconduct and recommend disciplinary actions.</p>
                        <h3>Commitment to the Community</h3>
                        <p>Commitment to the community and altruism (service to others) have been apparent since the early days of nursing. Other professions such as law and medicine have had the same commitment to the community and have received generous economic rewards for their services. These rewards have ensured the attractiveness of their professions to new generations of potential professionals. Unfortunately, when nurses seek pay increases, employers frequently accuse them of lacking altruism and a commitment to serve. It is important to separate these two issues. Competitive salaries and fair working conditions are not incongruent with commitment and service to the community. In fact, they increase the profession's ability to attract the best and the brightest students.</p>
                        <p>Some practitioners view nursing as a job instead of a career. Nurses who lack a lifelong commitment to nursing may never consider themselves members of a professional group.</p>
                        <h3>Professional Culture</h3>
                        <p>Professional organizations have several functions that contribute to the creation of a professional culture. These include establishing and enforcing the profession's code of ethics, development of standards of practice, and continuing education of members of the profession. In addition, professional organizations may represent their members in collective bargaining, in establishment of national policies affecting the profession, and in protecting the membership's general welfare and providing service to the community.</p>
                        <p>There are more than 50 professional nursing organizations. Many are related to specialty areas, such as maternal/child health, community health, critical care, or rehabilitation. Others serve a special purpose, as does Sigma Theta Tau, nursing's national honor society, or the Transcultural Nursing Society. The ANA publishes an updated list of these organizations each April in the American Journal of Nursing. The ANA and the National League for Nursing, the two largest professional organizations, are discussed in the next section.</p>
                        <p>In what other ways can nursing promote its professional culture? The current emphasis on caring and feminist ideology may assist nursing in defining the characteristics of the professional culture. The focus of feminist theory in nursing is the promotion of an atmosphere of mutual respect, trust, and community. Shared leadership, cooperation, and group process are emphasized (Mason, Backer, & Georges, 1993).</p>
                        <p>Along with a renewed emphasis on feminism, nursing literature is experiencing a renewed interest in caring. Although caring has been viewed as central to nursing, human care and caring are now defined as a personal, social, moral, and spiritual engagement of the nurse with other humans (Moccia, 1993).</p>
                        <p>Finally, becoming involved in role modeling, mentoring, emotional support, and sharing of the powerful lived experiences of nursing is an example of the means by which we can promote our professional culture.</p>
                        <h3>Professional Organizations</h3>
                        <h4>American Nurses Association</h4>
                        <p>In 1896, delegates from 10 nursing schools' alumnae associations met to organize a national professional association for nurses. The constitution and bylaws were completed in 1907, and the Nurses Associated Alumnae of the United States and Canada was born. The name was changed in 1911 to the American Nurses Association (ANA), which in 1982 became a federation of constituent state nurses associations.</p>
                        <p>The purposes of the ANA are to:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Work for the improvement of health standards and the availability of healthcare services for all people.</li>
                            <li>Foster high standards for nursing.</li>
                            <li>Stimulate and promote the professional development of nurses, and advance their economic and general welfare.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These purposes, reviewed in each biennial meeting by the House of Delegates, are unrestricted by consideration of age, color, creed, disability, gender, health status, lifestyle, nationality, religion, race, or sexual orientation (ANA, 2000). ANA's bylaws list 16 functions, which can be found in Figure 16-2.</p>

                        <p>Although more than 2 million people are members of the nursing profession in the United States, only about ten percent of the nation's registered nurses are members of their professional organization. The many different subgroups and numerous specialty-nursing organizations contribute to this fragmentation, which makes presenting a united front from which to bargain for nursing difficult. As the ANA works on the goal of preparing nurses during the twenty-first century, it is important that nurses work together in their efforts to identify and promote their unique, autonomous role within the healthcare system.</p>
                        <p>Many advantages are available to nurses who join the ANA. Membership offers benefits such as informative publications, group life and health insurance, malpractice insurance, and continuing education courses. The ANA also helps state nurses associations to support their members on workplace and client care issues such as salaries, working conditions, and staffing.</p>
                        <p>As the major voice of nursing, the ANA lobbies the government to influence laws that affect the practice of nursing and the safety of consumers. The power of the ANA was apparent when nurses lobbied against the American Medical Association's (AMA) proposal to create a new category of healthcare worker, the registered care technician, as an answer to the 1980s nursing shortage. The registered care technician category was never established, despite the AMA's vigorous support. The ANA currently is lobbying hard in Washington with their proposal titled Achieving access for all Americans: A proposal from the American Nurses Association for Health Coverage 2000 (ANA, 2000b).</p>
                        <p>The ANA frequently publishes position statements outlining where the organization stands on a particular topic that is important to the health and welfare of the public and/or the nurse. Table 16-2 summarizes some of the current position statements available from the ANA, which can easily be accessed on the American Nurses Association Website or are available by mail on request.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the ANA offers certification in various specialty areas. Certification is a formal, voluntary process by which the professional demonstrates knowledge of and expertise in a specific area of practice. It is a way to establish the nurse's expertise beyond the basic requirements for licensure and is an important part of peer recognition for nurses. In many areas, certification entitles the nurse to salary increases and position advancement. Some specialty nursing organizations also have certification programs.</p>

                        <h4>National League for Nursing</h4>
                        <p>Another large nursing organization is the National League for Nursing (NLN). Unlike the ANA, NLN membership is open to other health professionals and interested consumers, not just nurses. Over 1500 nursing schools and healthcare agencies and more than 5000 nurses, educators, administrators, consumers, and students are members of the NLN (NLN, 2000).</p>
                        <p>The NLN participates in accreditation of nursing programs, test services, research, and publication. It also lobbies actively for nursing issues and is currently working cooperatively with the ANA and other nursing organizations on healthcare reform. To do such things more effectively, the ANA, NLN, American Association of Colleges of Nursing, and American Organization of Nurse Executives have formed a coalition called the TriCouncil for the purpose of dealing with issues that are important to all nurses.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>As the controversy regarding whether nursing is or is not a profession continues, so does the controversy over the amount and type of education that should be required for entry into the profession. Today, there are more than 1600 basic programs that prepare beginning registered nurses (NLN, 2000a). In 2000 students enrolled in programs for their initial nursing education were: 32 percent in associate's degree programs, 31 percent in baccalaureate programs, and 27 percent in diploma programs (NLN, 2000b). Although the majority of nurses begin their career with an associate's degree or diploma in nursing, many nurses continue their education and eventually obtain a BSN or higher degree in nursing.</p>
                        <h3>Practical Nursing Programs</h3>
                        <p>Practical nurses (LPNs or LVNs) are licensed separately and are not considered professional nurses (although they are sometimes called "nurses" in long-term care facilities). Their training is usually 9 months to 1 year in length, after which they are eligible to take the NCLEX-PN examination.</p>
                        <p>Many practical nurses find employment in long-term care facilities or private-duty home care. In any setting, they are expected to work under the supervision of a registered nurse. Increasing numbers of practical nurses are returning to community colleges to attend LPN-to-RN programs to obtain an associate's degree and become eligible to take the NCLEX examination for registered nurses. It is important that the professional nurse identify himself or herself as the "registered nurse" to assist the consumer in understanding that "a nurse is not a nurse is not a nurse."</p>
                        <h3>Diploma Programs</h3>
                        <p>Diploma nursing programs have existed in the United States since the late 1800s, when nursing education began as apprenticeship training in hospitals. The number of diploma programs has gradually declined, so that today there are less than 160 in the United States. The programs are clustered in the northeast, and half the remaining states have none at all (ANA, 1992).</p>
                        <p>In the past, students in diploma programs were the primary workforce of the hospital. Most of the instructors were either graduates of the same program or members of the hospital's medical staff. Although they were well versed in nursing or medical skills, they were not necessarily well prepared to teach nursing theory and had no background in other important elements of a professional education: language, mathematics, psychology, sociology, microbiology, and so forth.</p>
                        <p>Diploma programs have continued to be valuable to hospitals because they generate a pool of new graduates who are easily assimilated into their existing nursing staff. Many have aligned themselves with local colleges or universities so that their students can obtain the necessary general education requirements and earn either an associate's or baccalaureate degree on completion of the program.</p>
                        <h3>Associate's Degree Programs</h3>
                        <p>Mildred Montag first proposed the establishment of nursing programs in community colleges in 1951. Her doctoral dissertation, "The Education of Nursing Technicians," proposed an approach that would produce nurses more quickly than the 3-year diploma or 4- to 5-year baccalaureate programs of that time. The graduates would be "technical nurses" who worked at the bedside. They would have less autonomy than the baccalaureate graduate but more than the LPN.</p>
                        <p>Montag envisioned the associate's degree as a terminal degree that students could complete in 2 years and then enter the job market. Approximately half of the coursework would be related to nursing, and the other half would be related to general education courses.</p>
                        <p>Associate's degree nursing programs grew rapidly. However, some of Montag's original concepts have been abandoned. The degree is no longer considered a terminal one but a step toward a baccalaureate degree. Many of the programs also have had difficulty meeting the NLN's recommendation of a maximum of 72 credit hours in the nursing program.</p>
                        <p>Fueled by the high birth rates of the 1940s (the early "baby boomers"), the community college movement of the 1960s flourished, and their nursing programs flourished along with them. Community colleges promoted equal opportunity, flexible schedules, and improved accessibility to higher education. Married women, men, minorities, and students seeking career changes who were attracted to the associate's degree programs in nursing were quite different from the traditional 18- to 25-year-old white women who constituted the majority of nursing students until then.</p>
                        <p>There are more than 800 associate's degree programs in the United States today, and the number continues to increase. The NLN (1999a) has developed a set of competencies for graduates of associate's degree programs in nursing (see Appendix 3). Although these competencies define the associate's degree nurse as a manager of care, additional guidance should be provided for the associate's degree nurse to function in the manager role.</p>
                        <p>Clearly, the questions regarding entry into practice have not yet been resolved. Differentiation among the various educational levels for licensure is still an issue of debate.</p>
                        <h3>Baccalaureate Degree Programs</h3>
                        <p>Nursing leaders in the early 1900s felt strongly that nursing education should move from the hospitals into the universities with other professional programs. By this time, nursing education had become firmly entrenched within hospitals, despite Nightingale's early opposition to such an arrangement. Universities at first were reluctant to accept nursing as a profession worthy of a university education. However, as nursing leaders such as Nutting continued to press for an equal place in the university, the barriers slowly crumbled, and nursing is now an accepted member of the university community.</p>
                        <p>Nursing's leaders have continued to emphasize the importance of a solid foundation in science and the humanities as a prerequisite to learning nursing. The debate about the differences between levels of nursing education continues today, 35 years after the ANA's initial position paper recommending baccalaureate education as entry into practice.</p>
                        <p>Baccalaureate programs today provide nursing education for beginning (generic) students and for registered nurses who have associate's degrees or diplomas and wish to earn the BSN (Bachelor of Science in nursing) degree. Basic programs combine general education and nursing courses in a 4-year curriculum.</p>
                        <p>In the past, many associate's degree and diploma program graduates sought baccalaureate level degrees in non-nursing fields, such as health education or business, primarily because they did not require any additional clinical courses and so could be completed more quickly. Non-nursing degrees do not provide advanced education in the discipline of nursing. Also, they offer little for the graduate in terms of job promotion or qualification for admission into a master's degree program in nursing.</p>
                        <p>Recently, many community colleges and universities have established articulation agreements, whereby students from community colleges receive credit for their associate's degree nursing courses so that they do not have to repeat coursework unnecessarily. These cooperative arrangements have made it much easier for graduates of associate's degree programs to continue their education and earn a baccalaureate degree.</p>
                        <h3>Master's Degree Program</h3>
                        <p>There are currently more than 350 master's degree in nursing programs in the United States (NLN, 2000c). The demand for advanced practice nurses has caused an increase in the growth of MSN programs. Entrance into a master's degree program usually requires a baccalaureate degree in nursing, a minimum grade point average of 3.0 on a 4-point scale, and a satisfactory score on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or a similar test. Some programs currently admit RNs with a bachelor's degree in another field into the MSN program. Some programs still require a year of experience in nursing practice as well.</p>
                        <p>Graduate programs prepare students for advanced clinical practice, teaching, and nursing administration. The most common specialty areas are adult health, child health, community/public health, gerontology, neonatal nursing, nurse anesthesia, nursing administration, nursing education, nurse midwifery, nursing information systems, oncology, and psychiatric/mental health (NLN, 1993). Students receive a Master of Science (MS) or Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree after 1 or 2 additional years of study beyond the baccalaureate level.</p>
                        <p>As with the baccalaureate degree, students seeking advanced degrees should be encouraged to pursue a degree in nursing rather than in another discipline. Many times, a master's degree in a related field does not allow for the advancement that a nursing degree provides.</p>
                        <h3>Doctoral Programs</h3>
                        <p>Doctoral programs in nursing are comparatively new. As late as the 1970s, many nurses were still pursuing doctoral degrees in fields other than nursing. There currently are about 75 doctoral programs in nursing in the United States (NLN, 2000c). Most offer either a doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) or doctor of science in nursing (DNSc) degree. The doctor of nursing science degree is a practice-oriented degree that emphasizes clinical research. The doctor of philosophy degree is considered more academically oriented, preparing scholars for the pursuit of research and theory development. Doctorally prepared nurses are in great demand in both university and community settings.</p>
                        <h3>External Degree Programs</h3>
                        <p>External degree programs grant credit to students for their knowledge and experience, regardless of where they were obtained. Students may obtain credit for life experience, for courses taken at other institutions, or through testing and receive a degree without the traditional coursework required by most institutions.</p>
                        <p>The best-known external degree program in nursing is the New York State Regents External Degree Program, established in 1972. Students in this program are expected to achieve the same competencies as a graduate from an associate's degree program in New York and to pass college-level tests in both nursing and general education. The program is accredited by the NLN.</p>
                        <p>External degree programs have advantages for the nontraditional student:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduced commuting time to and from campus.</li>
                            <li>Reduced child care difficulties.</li>
                            <li>Freedom to work at your own pace and on your own time.</li>
                            <li>The stress of returning to a classroom is reduced.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On the other hand, the external degree student must be motivated and self-directed, because there are few deadlines and few reminders that studying must be done. Although some places arrange for meetings of people pursuing an external degree (somewhat like a support group), it can be a lonely process in comparison to having a group of classmates with whom to share scholastic victories and defeats.</p>
                        <h3>Continuing Education</h3>
                        <p>In some states, participation in continuing education is required for licensure renewal. In other states, it is required only for advanced practice nurses. Licensed nurses need to be aware of the requirements of the board of nursing in their own state. Continuing education programs provide an avenue for nurses to update and expand their knowledge and skills, and the time spent in obtaining continuing education should be viewed as valuable to professional growth.</p>

                        <p>Regardless of your basic nursing education, one thing is certain: you will be expected to have computer skills and knowledge in the workplace. As we enter the twenty-first century, computerized information systems, electronic monitoring devices, microprocessor implants, automated imaging systems, telehealth, and robotics have already permeated the healthcare system (Travis & Brennan, 1998). You may be expected to be familiar with:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accessing medical records in real-time online</li>
                            <li>Using a bedside or portable computer to document patient data and nursing care while accessing information from other team members.</li>
                            <li>Holding conferences with other healthcare providers via the Internet</li>
                            <li>Accessing information via the World Wide Web (Bachman & Panzarine, 1998)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Two examples of using technology to access and disseminate information quickly and accurately are the electronic medical record and decision support software. Several benefits of using an electronic medical record are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Accessing the medical record from several different locations at the same time as well as by different levels of providers.</li>
                            <li>Allowing for quick access of records for use in research.</li>
                            <li>Decreasing error potential while improving communication.</li>
                            <li>Decreasing documentation time and thereby increasing time for client care (Hebda, Czar, & Mascara, 1998, p. 7).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Decision support software is written into many computerized patient records. These decision support tools notify the clinician of possible concerns or omissions with the use of a variety of alerts and reminders. For example, when a drug is ordered an alert notifies the primary care provider of any known allergies or even potential interactions with other drug orders for that client.</p>
                        <p>The term informatics was defined in 1983 as "computer science plus information science." Adding the name of the discipline, informatics denotes the application of computer and information sciences to the data management, information, and knowledge of that discipline (Graves & Corcoran, 1989, p. 227).</p>
                        <p>The idea of "medical informatics" began in the 1970s as technologic advances made it possible to enter data about patient care into computers. The term health informatics was later applied to information encompassing medicine, nursing, dental, pharmacy, and other healthcare disciplines. As members of each discipline identified the distinct information needed for professional practice, multiple informatics systems were developed (Graves & Corcoran, 1989). In the late 1960s nurses began to use electronic tools to assist in the collection and management of nursing information. Although slow to develop initially, the field is now advancing rapidly (NINR, 1999).</p>
                        <h3>Nursing Informatics</h3>
                        <p>Nursing informatics is defined as the "combination of computer science, information science, and nursing science designed to assist in management and processing of nursing data, information, and knowledge to support the practice of nursing and the delivery of nursing care" (Graves & Corcoran, 1989, p. 227). As outlined by the American Nurses Association (1994), nursing informatics includes identifying, acquiring, preserving, managing, retrieving, aggregating, analyzing, and transmitting data, information, and knowledge to make it meaningful and useful to nurses (p. 6). Effective application requires (1) use of computers and understanding of computer technology, (2) identification of conceptual issues and key concepts related to nursing knowledge, and (3) development of computerized information management systems to enhance nursing practice through the entering, organizing, and retrieval of information. The interaction of these three requirements constitutes the core of nursing informatics (Turley, 1996).</p>
                        <p>Economics and the knowledge explosion continue to drive the need to advance nursing informatics. The major economic concerns are the need to maximize nursing productivity, achieve efficiency, and ensure satisfactory patient outcomes. In addition, informatics supports nursing research, which continues to expand nursing's knowledge base, while the increasing complexity of patient care forces nurses to use increasing amounts of information when making decisions (Zielstorff, Hudgings, & Grobe, 1993).</p>
                        <p>Using an integrated information system, patient-specific data, collected only once, could be used in many different situations (Fig. 16-4). For example, when the patient is admitted to the hospital, a computerized medical record can be initiated. With the use of an integrated information system, the insurance company is billed electronically. It now becomes unnecessary to incur costs for printing and mailing statements. Staff of the quality improvement department can collect data on all patients and look for trends in cost and patient outcomes. Also, there is no need to copy and mail client records or referral forms to other agencies or for an individual to be designated as the person to code and enter data from each paper chart. The software used to access the computerized patient record can automatically search for identified information.</p>

                        <h3>Databases and Data Sets</h3>
                        <p>The development of computer systems to handle nursing data may well be the easy part. Historically, nurses have had difficulty articulating what nurses actually do and what impact nurses have on outcomes. The problem becomes more acute when the information is computerized. As early as 1986, the American Nurses Association (ANA) supported the development of a national nursing database for clinical practice. In response, the Steering Committee on Databases to Support Clinical Nursing Practice was formed in 1989. This committee recommended adoption of the Nursing Minimum Data Set (NMDS), originally developed by 64 nursing experts during a 3-day invitational conference in 1985. The NMDS is a minimum set of essential informational items concerned with nursing care and supported by standardized definitions and categories. This information is entered into a computerized patient record. The NMDS provides a common language of nursing that can be used in healthcare information systems, provides a common language for nursing research and outcomes assessment, and assists nursing to move toward third-party reimbursement (ANA, 1995). Using a common language facilitates sharing information across disciplines. The NMDS elements included are shown in Figure 16-5.</p>
                        <h3>Nursing Nomenclature and Taxonomies</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the NMDS, the ANA supports the development of scientifically based naming systems that address the uniqueness of nursing practice (ANA, 1994). The holistic nature of nursing phenomena and the use of multiple conceptual frameworks have contributed to difficulty in standardizing nursing data. The question arises not only as to what data to include, but also as to how one defines commonly held concepts. Descriptions such as "copious," "frail," or "weak," for example, are difficult to specify in a data set that will be produced by a "point and click" computer application. This fuzziness of clinical terms and the use of clinical judgments in nursing are critical nursing information issues (NINR, 1999b). The development of a system to collate, integrate, compare, and monitor computerized patient data is essential. In 1994, the ANA Steering Committee published a set of policy statements related to developing a single, comprehensive system for classifying nursing practice (Fig. 16-6). To date, there is not one universally accepted classification system.</p>
                        <p>The predominant nursing classifications systems in use today are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA)</li>
                            <li>The Omaha System</li>
                            <li>The Home Healthcare Classification</li>
                            <li>The Nursing Interventions Classification System</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA).</strong> Work on the NANDA taxonomy began in the early 1970s as part of a demonstration project that required patient data to be computerized and discipline specific. The nurses involved in the project soon realized that they were unable to do either. They recognized what a difficult task they had undertaken and sought assistance and advice from other nurses. Their efforts at problem solving soon led to the initial 1973 meeting of the National Conference Group for the Classification of Nursing Diagnoses. The initial group decided to hold more formalized meetings. After five yearly conferences, members of the group were still unable to agree on a classification scheme, so a decision was made to list the nursing diagnoses alphabetically. During the fifth annual meeting the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) was formed. NANDA is recognized by the ANA as the group responsible for the maintenance and development of a standardized nursing taxonomy (ANA, 1995b).</p>
                        <p><strong>The Omaha System.</strong> The Visiting Nurse Association of Omaha developed the Omaha System through a series of research projects. The system is a method of describing and measuring client problems, interventions, and outcomes. It has been found to be useful in home care, public and school health, correctional facilities, and outpatient facilities.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Home Healthcare Classification.</strong> Development of the Home Healthcare Classification began as a project at Georgetown University in the early 1990s. The purpose of the original study was to determine the resources required to provide home care services to Medicare clients and to identify the expected outcomes of those services. Today, this system is used as the basis for measuring outcomes and effectiveness in many home health and community health agencies.</p>
                        <p><strong>The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) (Iowa Intervention Project).</strong> Nurse researchers at the University of Iowa have been working since 1987 on developing the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) and the Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) (University of Iowa, 1999). In 1995, the Center for Nursing Classification was established at the University of Iowa to facilitate the research and development of NIC and NOC. The Center supports a Web page, an active listserv, a newsletter, and several other publications. NIC includes 433 interventions and is linked to NOC.</p>
                        <p>A computer program that would link these different systems so that common meanings across terms can be identified is also being developed. This common language or Unified Nursing Language System (UNLS) is an important step in organizing and classifying nursing-related information. By using accepted terms, nurses can move toward a system for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of nursing care and services (ANA, 1995a). Guidelines and outcomes established by such agencies as the Healthcare Financing Administration (HCFA), Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research (AHCPR), and Centers for Disease Control (CDC), as well as private insurance companies, can also be linked to the UNLS to further support the evaluation of nursing outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The computerized patient record (CPR) is an electronic file that stores patient information internally by a variety of healthcare providers. The data specified in the NMDS should be included. The Institute of Medicine has identified 12 major characteristics that they consider to be a gold standard for an effective CPR system (Andrew & Dick, 1996):</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A problem list that indicates the client's current clinical problems for each episode.</li>
                            <li>Provision for evaluation of patient health status and functional level using standardized definitions of these outcomes.</li>
                            <li>Include documentation of the clinical reasoning/rationale for diagnoses and conclusions.</li>
                            <li>Link to other client data and records.</li>
                            <li>Provide confidentiality, privacy, and audit trails.</li>
                            <li>Allow continuous and simultaneous access for authorized users.</li>
                            <li>Support links to local and remote information resources.</li>
                            <li>Provide access to decision analysis tools to facilitate clinical problem solving.</li>
                            <li>Allow direct entry of client data by providers</li>
                            <li>Include mechanisms for monitoring the cost and quality of care.</li>
                            <li>Provide for flexibility and expandability of the system.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The gold standard is still a goal to be accomplished. Many healthcare systems have automated part or all of the patient record, but automation alone does not constitute a fully functional CPR as described above. A truly longitudinal CPR that can be accessed by all providers, provides links to other client data and records, allows for documentation or outcomes, and allows for assistance with decision making is probably within 5 to 10 years of becoming a reality (Hebda, Czar, & Mascara, 1997, p. 178).</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits.</strong> A well-developed CPR used by staff who are adequately trained in the system can be of benefit to the entire healthcare team. On CPRs, information is more readable, is better organized, and should be more complete. Access to client information is available at multiple locations at any time of the day or night. Decision trees and other systems for decision analysis allow caregivers to logically plan care and identify appropriate interventions and outcomes. Use of CPRs can facilitate the automation of critical pathways and allows easy access to current and historical data. Less space is needed for record storage, and the chance of losing the record is decreased (Hebda, Czar, & Mascara, 1998).</p>
                        <p><strong>Acceptance.</strong> Resistance to implementation of a CPR is not uncommon. The end user, whether a registered nurse, physician, or other staff member, may feel totally overwhelmed by the need to learn an entirely new system. Some healthcare providers still do not use a computer in their personal life. Their unwillingness to use the CPR may be due to lack of familiarity with computers, the complexity of the software, availability of computer terminals, the disruptive effect on their preferred work flow pattern, or even an inability to type (Simpson, 1997). Being a role model in accepting new ideas and learning new skills is one of the responsibilities of being a professional. Make sure you are not the one of the complainers in the group. Your support and enthusiasm will go a long way in helping others accept change.</p>
                        <p><strong>Security Issues.</strong> As a rule, upper-level managers and information systems department personnel work together to develop policies and procedures related to security functions. As a professional nurse, you can set a positive example related to protection of client privacy and confidentiality. Make sure you have knowledge of the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Policies and procedures related to levels of access to patient and administrative databases</li>
                            <li>User authentication</li>
                            <li>Guidelines for secure data entry</li>
                            <li>Training and service support available to staff</li>
                            <li>Handling incorrect data entries, data tampering, and system failures</li>
                            <li>Procedure for reporting security concerns or breaks in security (Hebda, Czar, & Mascara, 1998)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Audit Trails.</strong> An audit trail is a record of all who have accessed the computer system. Audit software records access to any part of the system by user name or password to identify unauthorized entry into client records or other organizational information. The software searches for unusual activity of any kind. In many organizations, employees are asked to sign a document stating they understand they will be terminated for inappropriate system use (Hebda, Czar, & Mascara, 1998). Users must also be made aware of the danger of giving their password and/or user ID to others.</p>
                        <h3>Telehealth</h3>
                        <p>Telehealth is the "the use of telecommunications equipment and communications networks for transferring healthcare information between participants at different locations" (Chaffee, 1999, p. 27). A well-known telehealth service is the poison control center. Telehealth has expanded to include such applications as client monitoring, diagnostic evaluations, client education, and file transfer and storage (Perednia, 1995; Ensminger, 1996). The largest users of telehealth in the United States are NASA and the military (Telemedicine Research Center, 1996). As cost containment and access to healthcare services issues continue to increase, telehealth has become an attractive instrument to save healthcare dollars. Savings are achieved by (1) allowing earlier access to care, (2) decreasing travel expenses, (3) providing easier access to specialists and experts, and (4) providing easier access to continuing education for both consumers and professionals (Chaffee, 1999; Perednia, 1995).</p>
                        <p>Questions related to the practice of telehealth are increasing. Some of these are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Under what circumstances are health professionals subject to the licensing requirements of a distant state when providing services electronically to a client in another state?</li>
                            <li>What obligations accompany licensure in another state (e.g., public health reporting requirements, state investigative authority, jurisdiction for lawsuits)?</li>
                            <li>What standards govern the confidentiality of telehealth transmissions?</li>
                            <li>Which state's legal requirements govern the disclosure and retention of the medical records of a patient in another state seen via telehealth when they conflict?</li>
                            <li>Should there be unique CPT codes for services provided through telehealth?</li>
                            <li>How can reimbursement for telehealth care be secured from private payers and state programs?</li>
                            <li>What telehealth equipment should be considered a "medical device" subject to FDA regulation? Pacemaker monitoring devices that hook to the telephone are a common example of telehealth equipment.</li>
                            <li>What standards have been adopted by the medical and nursing profession on the appropriate uses of telehealth equipment?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Current activities related to telehealth include the 1995 creation of the Joint Working Group on Telemedicine (JWGT) and the 1998 establishment of the federal government's Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT) to support the administrative efforts of telehealth to improve access to health care for low-income, medically underserved, or geographically isolated persons (Chaffee, 1999, p. 12).</p>
                        <p>Nursing opportunities in telehealth include providing nursing care for clients at distant sites, designing telehealth education programs for clients and professionals, and participating in research. If you decide to participate in telehealth activities, be sure to get answers to the questions above as well as seek up-to-date information as a consumer and healthcare professional.</p>

                        <p>The public image of nursing has not always done justice to the unique combination of art and science that is truly nursing. Nurses need to take the lead in the movement toward a clearer identity and role delineation of the profession. Paramount to achieving these goals is the recognition of the value of nursing and acceptance of its professional status. The importance of viewing nursing as a profession with a systematic body of knowledge, formal college-based education, unique roles, standards of practice, professional accountability, professional culture, and community commitment will continue to move nursing through the twenty-first century. Working toward a universal language for nursing practice and a unified nursing language system will assist nurses in developing a system for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of nursing care and services.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Maryann Fralic, professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, gave a plenary session at the NLN twenty-fourth biennial convention in Miami Beach in 1999 (NLN, 2000). In discussing nursing for the new millennium, she closed with the following advice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set and maintain high standards, both personally and professionally</li>
                            <li>Seek out a mentor.</li>
                            <li>There is no substitute for competence. Cultivate your personal and professional competency as an active, lifelong learner.</li>
                            <li>Be professionally productive. Add to the science and knowledge bases of nursing.</li>
                            <li>Always respect the privilege to be part of a profession that intervenes intimately and meaningfully with people to truly make a difference.</li>

                        <p>Ms. P. recently graduated from the local community college and received an associate's degree in nursing. On obtaining her registered nurse license, she was hired on a busy pediatric floor of a large local hospital. She was responsible for delegating patient assignments to the LPN and nursing assistant who were assigned with her. She often felt uneasy about her decisions because of her inexperience in this area. When she joined the ANA, she received a copy of the Code for Nurses and Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice. How might these two documents guide her in making decisions about delegating patient assignments?</p>
                        <p>After a few weeks, Ms. P. told her nurse manager that she had seen Ms. A., the LPN, discontinuing IVs and hanging IV medications, even though the board of nursing in their state does not allow it. The nurse manager replied, "Oh, she's just like an RN. Don't worry, I'll cover for her."</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Why should Ms. P. feel uneasy about that response?</li>
                            <li>What might happen to the nurse manager, the LPN, and Ms. P. if there is a problem with a patient regarding these IVs?</li>
