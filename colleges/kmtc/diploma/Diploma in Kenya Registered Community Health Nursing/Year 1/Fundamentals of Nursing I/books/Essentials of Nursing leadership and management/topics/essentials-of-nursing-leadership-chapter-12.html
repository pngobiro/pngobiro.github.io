                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The courtroom was cold and sterile. Scanning her surroundings with nervous eyes, Marie decided she knew how Alice must have felt when the Queen of Hearts screamed for her head. The image of the White Rabbit running through the woods, looking at his watch, yelling, "I'm late! I'm late!" flashed before her eyes. For a few moments, she indulged herself in thoughts of being able to turn back the clock and rewrite the past. The future certainly looked grim at that moment.</p>
                        <p>The calling of her name broke her reverie. Mr. Jefferson, the attorney for the plaintiff, wanted her undivided attention regarding the fateful day when she injected a client with 40 mEq of potassium chloride in error. That day, the client died following cardiac arrest because Marie failed to check the appropriate dosage and route for the medication. She had administered 40 mEq of potassium chloride by IV push. Her 15 years of nursing experience meant little to the court. Because she had not followed hospital protocol and had violated an important standard of practice, Marie stood alone. She was being sued for malpractice.</p>
                        <p>As client advocates, nurses have a responsibility to deliver safe care to their clients. This expectation requires that nurses have professional knowledge at their expected level of practice and be proficient in technological skills. A working knowledge of the legal system, client rights, and behaviors that may result in lawsuits helps nurses to act as client advocates. As long as nurses practice nursing according to the established standards of care, they will be able to avoid the kind of day in court that Marie experienced.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Meaning of Law</h3>
                        <p>The word law has several different meanings. For the purposes of this chapter, law means those rules that prescribe and control social conduct in a formal and legally binding manner (Bernzweig, 1994). Laws are created in one of three ways:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Statutory laws</strong> are created by various legislative bodies, such as state legislatures or the Congress. Some examples of federal statutes include the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. State statutes include the state Nurse Practice Act, the State Board of Nursing, and the Good Samaritan Act. Laws that govern nursing practice are statutory laws.</li>
                            <li><strong>Common law</strong> develops within the court system as judicial decisions are made in various cases and precedents for future cases are set. In this way, a decision made in one case can affect decisions made in later cases of a similar nature. This portion of American law is based on the English tradition of case law. This is "judge-made law" (Black, 1957). Many times a judge in a subsequent case will follow the reasoning of a judge in a previous case. Therefore, one case sets a precedent for another.</li>
                            <li><strong>Administrative law</strong> is established through the authority given to government agencies, such as a state board of nursing, by a legislative body. It is then the duty of these governing boards to meet the intent of the law or statute.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Sources of Law</h3>
                        <h4>The Constitution</h4>
                        <p>The Constitution is the foundation of American law. The Bill of Rights, comprising the first 10 amendments to the United States Constitution, is the basis for protection of individual rights. These laws define and limit the power of the government and protect citizens' freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, religious freedom, freedom of the press, and freedom from unwarranted intrusion by government into personal choices. State constitutions can expand individual rights but cannot deprive people of rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.</p>
                        <p>Constitutional law evolves. As individuals or groups bring suit to challenge interpretations of the Constitution, decisions are made concerning application of the law to that particular event. An example is the protection of freedom of speech. Are obscenities protected? Can one person threaten, or criticize, another person? The freedom to criticize is protected; threats are not. The definition of what constitutes obscenity is often debated and has not been fully clarified by the courts.</p>
                        <h4>Statutes</h4>
                        <p>Localities, state legislatures, and the United States Congress create statutes. These can be found in multivolume sets of books.</p>
                        <p>At the federal level, conference committees comprising representatives of both houses of Congress negotiate the resolution of any differences between the houses on wording of the final bill before it becomes law. If the bill does not meet with the approval of the executive branch of government, the president can veto it. If that occurs, the legislative branch must have enough votes to override the veto or the bill will not become law.</p>
                        <p>Nurses have an opportunity to influence the development of statutory law both as citizens and as healthcare providers. Writing to or meeting with state legislators or members of Congress is a way to demonstrate interest in such issues and their outcomes in terms of the laws passed. Passage of a new law is often a long process that includes compromise of the various viewpoints of interested individuals.</p>
                        <h4>Administrative Law</h4>
                        <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Education are federal agencies that have been given the responsibility for administering healthcare-related laws. At the state level are the departments of health and mental health and the licensing boards. Administrative agencies are staffed with professionals who develop the specific rules and regulations that direct the implementation of statutory law. These rules must be reasonable and consistent with the existing statutory law and the intent of the legislature. Usually, they go into effect only after review and comment by affected persons or groups. For example, the state nursing board receives the authority to issue and revoke licenses from specific statutory laws, which means that each Board of Nursing (BON) has the responsibility to oversee the professional nurse's competence.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">TYPES OF LAWS</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Another way to look at the legal system is to divide it into two categories: criminal law and civil law.</p>
                        <h3>Criminal Law</h3>
                        <p>Criminal laws were developed to protect society from actions that threaten its existence. Criminal acts, although directed toward individuals, are considered offenses against the state. The perpetrator of the act is punished, and the victim receives no compensation for injury or damages. There are three categories of criminal law:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Felony</strong> is the most serious category and includes such acts as homicide, grand larceny, and violating a nurse practice act.</li>
                            <li><strong>Misdemeanors</strong> are lesser offenses such as traffic violations or shoplifting of a small dollar amount.</li>
                            <li><strong>Juvenile crimes</strong> are carried out by individuals under the age of 18. The specific age varies by state and crime.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There are occasions when a nurse breaks a law and is tried in criminal court. A nurse who illegally distributes controlled substances, either for personal use or for the use of others, for example, is violating the law. Falsification of records of controlled substances is also a criminal action. In some states, altering a client record may be a misdemeanor (Northrop & Kelly, 1987). For example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Nurse V. needed to administer a blood transfusion. Because she was in a hurry, she did not properly check the paperwork and violated the standard of practice established for blood administration. Because the nurse failed to follow the designated protocol, the patient was transfused with incompatible blood, suffered from a transfusion reaction, and died. Nurse V. attempted to conceal her conduct and falsified the records. She was found guilty of manslaughter (State of New Jersey v. Winter).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Civil Law</h3>
                        <p>Civil laws usually involve the violation of one person's rights by another person. Areas of civil law that particularly affect nurses are tort law, contract law, antitrust law, employment discrimination, and labor laws.</p>
                        <h4>Tort</h4>
                        <p>The remainder of this chapter focuses primarily on tort law. A tort is "a legal or civil wrong committed by one person against the person or property of another" (Black, 1957, p. 1660). Tort law recognizes that individuals in their relationships with each other have a general duty not to harm others (Cushing, 1988). For example, as drivers of automobiles, each of us has a duty to drive safely so that others will not be harmed. A roofer has a duty to place a roof properly so that it will not collapse and injure individuals within the structure. Nurses have a duty to deliver care in such a manner that the consumers of care are not harmed. These legal duties of care may be violated intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
                        <h4>Quasi-Intentional Tort</h4>
                        <p>A quasi-intentional tort is a combination of an unintentional and an intentional tort. It is defined as "a voluntary act that directly causes injury or distress without intent to injure or to cause distress" (Catalano, 1996, p. 298). The elements of cause and desire are present, but the element of intent is missing. Quasiintentional torts usually involve problems in communication that result in damage to a person's reputation, violation of personal privacy, or an individual's civil rights. (For an example of a quasi-intentional tort, see Confidentiality, p. 8.)</p>
                        <h4>Negligence</h4>
                        <p>Negligence is the unintentional tort of acting or failing to act as an ordinary, reasonable, prudent person, resulting in harm to the person to whom the duty of care is owed (Black, 1957). The legal elements of negligence consist of duty, breach of duty, causation, and harm or injury (Cushing, 1988). All four elements must be present in the determination. For example, if a nurse administers the wrong medication to a client but the client is not injured, the element of harm has not been met. However, if a nurse administers appropriate pain medication but fails to put up the side rails and the client falls and breaks a hip, all four elements have been satisfied. The duty of care is the standard of care. The law defines the standard of care as that which a reasonable, prudent practitioner with similar education and experience would do or not do in similar circumstances (Prosser & Keeton, 1984).</p>
                        <h4>Malpractice</h4>
                        <p>Malpractice is the term used for professional negligence. When fulfillment of duties requires specialized education, the term malpractice is used.</p>
                        <p>An important principle in understanding negligence is <strong>respondeat superior,</strong> or the captain of the ship doctrine. Translated literally, this phrase means "let the master speak." The doctrine of respondeat superior holds employers liable for any negligence by their employees when the employees were acting within the realm of employment and when the alleged negligent acts happened during employment (Prosser & Keeton, 1984). Consider the following scenario:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>A nursing instructor on a clinical unit in a busy metropolitan hospital instructed his students not to administer any medications unless he was present. Luis, a second-level student, was unable to find his instructor, so he decided to administer digoxin to his client without supervision. The dose was 0.125 mg . The unit dose came as digoxin 0.5 mg/mL. Luis administered the entire amount without checking the digoxin dose or the client's blood and potassium levels. The client became toxic, developed a dysrhythmia, and was transferred to the intensive care unit. The family sued the hospital and the nursing school for malpractice. The nursing instructor was sued under the principle of respondeat superior, even though specific instructions to the contrary had been given to the students.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Good Samaritan Laws</h3>
                        <p>In the past, fear of being sued often prevented trained professionals from assisting during an emergency. To encourage physicians and nurses to respond to emergencies, many states developed what are now known as the Good Samaritan laws. When administering emergency care, nurses and physicians are protected from civil liability by Good Samaritan laws as long as the individual behaves in the same manner as an ordinary, reasonable, and prudent professional would have in the same or similar circumstances (Prosser & Keeton, 1984). In other words, when assisting during an emergency nurses must still observe professional standards of care.</p>
                        <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
                        <p>It is possible for nurses to be involved in lawsuits other than those involving negligence. For example, clients have the right to confidentiality, and it is the duty of the professional nurse to ensure this right. This assures the client that information obtained by a nurse while giving him or her care will not be communicated to anyone who does not have a need to know (Cushing, 1988). For example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Leonard was admitted for pneumonia. With Leonard's permission, an HIV test was performed and the result was positive. Several nurses were discussing the situation in the cafeteria and were overheard by one of Leonard's coworkers, who had come to visit him. This individual reported the test results to Leonard's supervisor. When Leonard returned to work, he was fired for "poor job performance," although he had had superior job evaluations. In the process of filing a discrimination suit against his employer, Leonard discovered that the information on his health status had come from a group of nurses. A lawsuit was filed against the hospital and the nurses involved based on a breach of confidentiality.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h3>Slander and Libel</h3>
                        <p>Nurses rarely think of themselves as being guilty of slander or libel. The term <strong>slander</strong> refers to the spoken word and <strong>libel</strong> to the written word. Making a false statement about a client's condition that may result in an injury to that client is considered slander. Putting a false statement into writing is libel. For example, stating that a client who had blood drawn for drug testing has a substance abuse problem, when in fact the client does not carry that diagnosis, could be considered a slanderous statement. Such a statement could result in harm or injury if the client is fired from his or her job because it was overheard and repeated (remember Leonard).</p>
                        <h3>False Imprisonment</h3>
                        <p>False imprisonment is confining an individual against his or her will by either physical (restraining) or verbal (detaining) means. The following examples fall within the definition of false imprisonment:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using restraints on individuals without the appropriate written consent.</li>
                            <li>Restraining mentally handicapped individuals who do not represent a threat to themselves or others.</li>
                            <li>Detaining unwilling clients in an institution when they desire to leave.</li>
                            <li>Keeping persons who are medically cleared for discharge for an unreasonable amount of time.</li>
                            <li>Removing the clothing of clients to prevent them from leaving the institution.</li>
                            <li>Threatening clients with some form of physical, emotional, or legal action if they insist on leaving.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Sometimes clients are a danger to themselves and to others. Nurses often need to decide on the appropriateness of restraints as a protective measure. Nurses should try to obtain the cooperation of the client before applying any type of restraints. The first step is to attempt to identify a reason for the risky behavior and resolve the problem. If this fails, documentation of the need for restraints, consultation with the physician, and carefully following the institution's policies and standards of practice are indicated. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in greater harm to the client and possibly a lawsuit for the staff. Consider the following:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Mr. Harrison, who is 87 years old, was admitted through the emergency department with severe lower abdominal pain of 3 days' duration. Physical assessment revealed severe dehydration in a man in acute distress. A surgeon was called, and an abdominal laparotomy was performed, revealing a ruptured appendix. Surgery was successful, and the client was sent to the intensive care unit for 24 hours. On transfer to the surgical floor the next day, Mr. Harrison was in stable condition. Later that night, he became confused, irritable, and anxious. He attempted to climb out of bed and pulled out his indwelling urinary catheter. The nurse restrained him. The next day, his irritability and confusion continued. Mr. Harrison's nurse placed him in a chair, tying him in and restraining his hands. Three hours later he was found in cardiopulmonary arrest.</p>
                            <p>A lawsuit of wrongful death and false imprisonment was brought against the nurse manager, the nurses caring for Mr. Harrison, and the institution. During discovery, it was determined that the primary cause of Mr. Harrison's behavior was hypoxemia. A violation of law occurred with the failure of the nursing staff to notify the physician of the client's condition and to follow the institution's standard of practice on the use of restraints.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>To protect themselves against charges of negligence or false imprisonment in such cases, nurses should discuss safety needs with patients, their families, or other members of the healthcare team. Careful assessment and documentation of client status are also imperative; confusion, irritability, and anxiety often have metabolic causes that need correction, and not restraint.</p>
                        <p>There are also statutes and case laws specific to the admission of clients to psychiatric institutions. Most states have guidelines for emergency involuntary hospitalization for a specific time period. Involuntary admission is considered necessary when clients are a danger to themselves or others. Specific procedures must be followed. A determination by a judge or administrative agency or certification by a specified number of physicians that a person's mental health justifies detention and treatment may be required. Once admitted, these clients may not be restrained unless the guidelines established by state law and the institution's policies are followed. Clients who voluntarily admit themselves to psychiatric institutions are also protected against false imprisonment. Nurses need to make themselves aware of the policies of their state and employing institution.</p>
                        <h3>Assault and Battery</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assault</strong> is a threat to harm. <strong>Battery</strong> is touching another person without their consent. Most medical treatments, particularly surgery, would be battery if it were not for informed consent from the client. The significance of an assault is in the threat. "If you don't stop pushing that call bell, I'll give you this injection with the biggest needle I can find" is considered an assaultive statement. Battery would occur if the injection were given when it was refused, even if medical personnel deemed it was for the "client's good." Holding down a violent client against his or her will and injecting a sedative is battery. With few exceptions, clients have a right to refuse treatment.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">STANDARDS OF PRACTICE</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Concern for the quality of care is a major part of nursing's responsibility to the public. Therefore, the nursing profession is accountable to the consumer for the quality of its services. One of the defining characteristics of a profession is the ability to set its own standards. Nursing standards were established as guidelines for the profession to ensure acceptable quality of care (Beckman, 1995). Standards of practice are also used as criteria to determine whether appropriate care has been delivered. In practice, they represent the minimum acceptable level of care. Nurses are judged on generally accepted standards of practice for their level of education, experience, position, and specialty area. Standards of the profession take many forms. Some are written and may be included in recommendations by professional organizations, job descriptions, agency policies and procedures, and textbooks. Others, which may be intrinsic to the custom of practice, are not found in writing (Beckman, 1995).</p>
                        <p>State Boards of Nursing (BONs) and professional organizations vary by role and responsibility in relation to standards of development and implementation (ANA, 1998, p. 9). Statutes, professional organizations, and healthcare institutions establish standards of practice. The Nurse Practice Acts of individual states define the boundaries of nursing practice within the state. The courts have upheld the authority of BONs to regulate standards. The boards accomplish this through direct or delegated statutory language (ANA, 1998). The American Nurses Association also has specific standards of practice in general and in several clinical areas (see Appendix 1).</p>
                        <p>Internal standards of practice are those that institutions develop. They are usually explained in a specific institutional policy, and the institution includes these standards in policy and procedure manuals. For example, guidelines for the appropriate administration of a specific chemotherapeutic agent or agents would be included in an institutional policy and procedure manual. The guidelines would be based on the current literature and research.</p>
                        <p>With the expansion of advanced nursing practice, it has become particularly important to clarify the legal distinction between nursing and medical practice. It is important to be aware of the boundaries between these professional domains because crossing them can result in legal consequences and disciplinary action. The nurse practice act and related regulations developed by most state legislatures and state BONs help to clarify nursing roles at the various levels of practice.</p>
                        <h3>Use of Standards in Nursing Negligence Malpractice Actions</h3>
                        <p>When omission of prudent care or acts committed by a nurse or those under his or her supervision cause harm to a client, standards are used as a guide to determine whether appropriate care was administered. Many nurses assume that the standards of nursing practice are the only ones used to determine whether malpractice or negligence exists. Other standards may be used. These may include, but are not limited to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>State, local, or national standards</li>
                            <li>Institutional policies that alter or adhere to the nursing standards of care</li>
                            <li>Expert opinions on the appropriate standard of care at the time</li>
                            <li>Available literature and research that substantiates a standard of care or changes in the standard (ANA, 1998)</li>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In 1973, the American Hospital Association approved a statement called "A Patient's Bill of Rights." These standards were derived from the ethical principle of autonomy (see Appendix 5).</p>
                        <h3>Informed Consent</h3>
                        <p>Without consent, many of the procedures performed on clients in a healthcare setting may be considered battery or unwarranted touching. When clients consent to treatment, they give healthcare personnel the right to deliver care and perform specific treatments without fear of prosecution. Although physicians are responsible for obtaining informed consent, nurses often find themselves involved in the process. It is also the physician's responsibility to give information to a client about a specific treatment or medical intervention. This information should contain all the possible negative outcomes as well as the positive. Nurses may be asked to obtain the signatures on the informed consent form. The following are some helpful criteria for ensuring that a client has actually given an informed consent (Northrup & Kelly, 1987; Kozier, Erb, Blais, & Wilkinson, 1995):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A mentally competent adult has voluntarily given the consent.</li>
                            <li>The client understands exactly to what he or she is consenting.</li>
                            <li>The consent includes the risks involved in the procedure, alternative treatments that may be available, and the possible outcome if the treatment is refused.</li>
                            <li>The consent is written.</li>
                            <li>A parent or guardian usually gives consent to treat a minor.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Ideally, a nurse should be present when the physician is explaining the treatment to the client. Before getting a signature, the nurse should ask the client to recall exactly what the physician has told him or her about the treatment. If at any point the nurse thinks that the client does not understand the treatment or the expected outcome, he or she needs to notify the physician of this fact. To give informed consent, the client must be fully informed. Clients have the right to refuse treatment, and nurses must respect this right. If a client refuses the recommended treatment, a client must be informed of the possible consequences of this decision.</p>
                        <p>Implied consent is a form of consent in which the consent is assumed. This may be an issue in an emergency when an individual is unable to give consent, as in the following scenario:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>An accident occurs on a major highway. An elderly woman is involved in an accident. The paramedics called to the scene find her unresponsive and in acute respiratory distress, and her vital signs are unstable. The paramedics immediately intubate her and begin treating her cardiac dysrhythmias. Because she is unconscious and unable to give her verbal consent, there is an implied consent for treatment.</p>

                        <h3>Prevention</h3>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the public's trust in the medical profession has declined over recent years. Consumers are better informed and more assertive in their approach to health care. They demand good and responsible care. If clients and their families feel that behaviors are uncaring or that attitudes are impersonal, they are more likely to sue for what they view as errors in treatment. The same applies to nurses. If nurses demonstrate an interest in and caring behaviors toward clients, a relationship develops. Individuals do not sue those they view as "caring friends." The potential to change attitudes of healthcare consumers lies within the power of healthcare personnel. Demonstrating care and concern and making clients and families aware of choices and methods can assist in decreasing liability. Nurses who involve clients and their families in decisions about care reduce the likelihood of a lawsuit. Tips to prevent legal problems are listed in Box 12-1.</p>

                        <p>All healthcare personnel are accountable for their own actions and adherence to the accepted standards of health care. Most negligence and malpractice cases arise from a violation of the accepted standards of practice and the policies of the employing institution. Common causes of negligence are listed in Table 12-1. Expert witnesses on both sides are called to cite the accepted standards and assist attorneys in formulating the legal strategies pertaining to those standards. For example, most medication errors can be traced back to a violation of the accepted standard of medication administration, the five rights (Kozier, Erb, Blais, & Wilkinson, 1995). These five rights have recently been amended to include a sixth right, right documentation (Springhouse, 1998).</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Right drug</li>
                            <li>Right dose</li>
                            <li>Right route</li>
                            <li>Right time</li>
                            <li>Right patient</li>
                            <li>Right documentation</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Appropriate Documentation</h3>
                        <p>The old adage "not documented, not done" holds true in nursing. According to the law, if something is not documented, then the responsible party did not do whatever needed to be done. If a nurse does not do something, that leaves the nurse open to negligence or malpractice charges.</p>
                        <p>Nursing documentation needs to be legally credible. Legally credible documentation is an accurate accounting of the care the client received. It also indicates the competence of the individual who delivered the care.</p>
                        <p>Charting by exception creates defense difficulties. When this method of documentation is used, investigators need to review the entire client record in an attempt to reconstruct the care given to the client. Clear, concise, and accurate documentation helps nurses when they are named in lawsuits. Often, this documentation clears the individual of any negligence or malpractice. Documentation holds credibility when it is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Contemporaneous</strong>—documenting your care at the time it was provided</li>
                            <li><strong>Accurate</strong>—documenting exactly what you did</li>
                            <li><strong>Truthful</strong>—documenting only what you actually did or observed</li>
                            <li><strong>Appropriate</strong>—documenting only what you would be comfortable discussing in a public setting</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Box 12-2 lists some documentation tips.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Luis, the nursing student violated the right dose principle and therefore made a medication error. When a nurse signs off medications on all clients for the shift before they are administered, he or she is left open to charges of medication error.</p>

                        <p>In the case of Mr. Harrison, the institutional personnel were found negligent because of a direct violation of the institution's standards on the application of restraints.</p>
                        <p>Nursing units are busy and often understaffed. These situational realities exist but should not be allowed to interfere with the safe delivery of health care. Clients have a right to safe and effective health care, and nurses have an obligation to deliver this care.</p>
                        <h3>Common Actions Leading to Malpractice Suits</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Failure to appropriately assess a client</li>

                            <li>Failure to document in the client record</li>
                            <li>Altering or falsifying a client record</li>
                            <li>Failure to obtain informed consent</li>
                            <li>Failure to report a coworker's negligence or poor practice</li>
                            <li>Failure to provide appropriate education to a client and/or family members</li>
                            <li>Violation of internal or external standards of practice</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>If a Problem Arises</h3>
                        <p>When served with a summons or complaint, people often panic, allowing fear to overcome reason and sanity. First of all, you are required to answer the complaint. Failure to do this may result in a default judgment, causing greater distress and difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In addition, you can do many things to protect yourself if you are named in a lawsuit. You may want to obtain legal representation to protect personal property. Never sign any documents without consulting with your malpractice insurance carrier or your legal representative. If you are personally covered by malpractice insurance, notify the company immediately and follow their instructions carefully. Institutions usually have lawyers to defend themselves and their employees. Whether or not you are personally insured, the legal department of the institution should be contacted. You need to keep a file of all papers, proceedings, meetings, and telephone conversations about the case. Although a pending or ongoing legal case should not be discussed with coworkers or friends, do not withhold any information you have from your attorneys, even if you believe that it may be harmful to you. Let the attorneys and the insurance company help you decide how to handle the difficult situation. They are in charge of damage control. Concealing information usually causes more damage than disclosing it.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes nurses feel that they are not being adequately protected or represented by the attorneys from their employing institution. If this happens, consider hiring a personal attorney who is experienced in malpractice. This information can be obtained through either the State Bar Association or the local Trial Lawyer's Association.</p>

                        <p>Various forms of professional liability insurance are available to nurses. These policies have been developed to protect nurses against personal financial losses if they are involved in a medical malpractice suit. If a nurse is charged with malpractice and found guilty, the employing institution has the right to sue for reclaiming of damages.

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>When a heart ceases to beat, a client is in a state of cardiac arrest. Both in modern healthcare institutions and in the community, it is common to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation when cardiac arrest occurs. In healthcare institutions, an elaborate mechanism is put into action when a client "codes." Much controversy exists concerning when these mechanisms should be used and whether individuals who have no chance of regaining full viability should be resuscitated.</p>
                        <h3>Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Orders</h3>
                        <p>A DNR order is a specific directive to healthcare personnel not to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitative measures. Only physicians can write a DNR order, usually after consulting with the client or family. Other members of the healthcare team are expected to comply with the order. Clients have the right to request a DNR order. However, they may make this request without a full understanding of what it really means. Take the following example:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>When Mrs. Vincent, 58 years old, was admitted to the hospital for a hysterectomy, she explicitly stated, "I want to be made a DNR." The nurse, rather concerned by the statement, questioned Mrs. Vincent's understanding of a DNR order. The nurse asked her, "Do you mean that if you are walking down the hall after your surgery and your heart stops beating, you do not want the nurses or physicians to do anything? You want us to just let you die?" Mrs. Vincent responded with a resounding, "No, that is not what I mean. I mean if something happens to me and I won't be able to be the way I am now, I want to be a DNR!" The nurse then explained the concept of a DNR order.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>DNR orders are common in many acute care and long-term care facilities. Every facility should have a written policy regarding the initiation of such orders (ANA, 1992). The client or, if the client is unable to speak for himself or herself, a family member or guardian should make clear the client's preference for either having as much as possible done or withholding treatment (see the next section, Advance Directives). Elements to include in a DNR order are listed in Box 12-3.</p>
                        <h3>Advance Directives</h3>
                        <p>The legal dilemmas that may arise in relation to DNR orders often require court decisions. For this reason, in 1990 Senator John Danforth of Missouri and Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York introduced the Patient Self-Determination Act to address questions regarding life-sustaining treatment. The act was created to allow people the opportunity to make decisions about treatment in advance of a time when they might become unable to participate in the decisionmaking process. Through this mechanism, families can be spared the burden of having to decide what the family member would have wanted.</p>
                        <p>Federal law requires that healthcare institutions that receive federal money (from Medicare, for example) inform clients of their right to create advance directives. The Patient Self-Determination Act provides guidelines for developing advance directives concerning what will be done for individuals if they no longer are able to actively participate in making decisions about care options. The Patient Self-Determination Act (S.R. 13566) states that institutions must do several things:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Provide information to every client.</strong> On admission, all clients must be informed in writing of their rights under state law to accept or refuse medical treatment while they are competent to make decisions about their care. This includes the right to execute advance directives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Documentation.</strong> All clients must be asked whether they have a living will or have chosen a durable power of attorney for health care (also known as a healthcare surrogate). The response must be indicated on the medical record and a copy of the documents, if available, should be placed on the client's chart.</li>
                            <li><strong>Education.</strong> Nurses, other healthcare personnel, and the community need to understand what the Patient SelfDetermination Act requires, as well as the state laws regarding advance directives.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clients' rights.</strong> All clients are to be treated with respectful care regardless of their decision regarding life-prolonging treatments.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (Healthcare Surrogate)</h4>
                        <p>The two most common forms of advance directives are living wills and durable power of attorney for health care (also known as a healthcare surrogate).</p>
                        <p>A <strong>living will</strong> is a legally executed document that states an individual's wishes regarding the use of "life-prolonging" medical treatment in the event that he or she is no longer competent to make informed treatment decisions on his or her own behalf and is suffering from a terminal condition (Flarey, 1991). A condition is considered terminal when, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, there is little likelihood of recovery or the condition is expected to cause death. It may also refer to a persistent vegetative state characterized by a permanent and irreversible condition of unconsciousness in which there is (1) absence of voluntary action or cognitive behavior of any kind and (2) an inability to communicate or interact purposefully with the environment (Marshall, Marshall, Vos, & Chestnut, 1990).</p>
                        <p>Another form of advance directive is the appointment of a <strong>healthcare surrogate</strong>. Chosen by the client, the healthcare surrogate is usually a family member or close personal friend. The role of the healthcare surrogate is to make the client's wishes known to medical and nursing personnel. Imperative in the designation of a healthcare surrogate is a clear understanding of an individual's wishes should the need arise to know them.</p>
                        <p>In some situations, clients are unable to adequately or competently express themselves although they are not terminally ill. For example, clients with advanced Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia cannot communicate their wishes, clients under anesthesia are temporarily unable to communicate effectively, and the condition of comatose clients does not allow for expression of healthcare wishes.</p>
                        <p>In these situations, the healthcare surrogate can make treatment decisions on the behalf of the client. However, when a client regains the ability to make his or her own decisions and is capable of expressing them effectively, he or she resumes control of all decision-making pertaining to medical treatment (Reigle, 1992).</p>
                        <h4>Nursing Implications</h4>
                        <p>The Patient Self-Determination Act does not specify who should discuss treatment decisions or advance directives with clients. Because directives are often implemented on nursing units, however, nurses need to be knowledgeable about living wills and healthcare surrogates and be prepared to answer questions that clients may have about directives and the forms used by the healthcare institution.</p>
                        <p>As client advocates, the responsibility for creating an awareness of individual rights often falls on nurses. It is the responsibility of the healthcare institution to educate personnel about the policies of the institution so that nurses and others involved in client care can inform healthcare consumers of their choices. Nurses who are unsure of the policies in their healthcare institution should contact the appropriate department.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Evans, 40 years old, was admitted to the medical-surgical unit from the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute abdomen. He had a 20-year history of Crohn's disease and had been on prednisone, 20 mg, every day for the last year. Because he was allowed nothing by mouth (NPO), total parenteral nutrition was started through a triple-lumen central venous catheter line, and his steroids were changed to Solu-medrol, 60 mg by IV push q 6 h . He was also receiving several intravenous antibiotics, as well as medication for pain and nausea. Over the next several days, his condition worsened. He was in severe pain and needed more analgesics. One evening at 9 P.M., it was discovered that his central venous catheter line was out. The registered nurse notified the physician, who stated that a surgeon would come in the morning to replace it. The nurse failed to ask the physician what to do about the intravenous steroids, antibiotics, and fluid replacement because the patient was still NPO. At 7 A.M., the night nurse noted that the client had had no urinary output since 11 P.M. the night before. She failed to report this information to the day shift.</p>
                        <p>The client's physician made rounds at 9 a.m. The nurse for Mr. Evans did not discuss the fact that the client had not voided since 11 P.M. the previous night, nor did she request orders for alternative delivery of the steroids and antibiotics. At 5 P.M. that evening, while Mr. Evans was having a computed tomography (CT) scan, his blood pressure dropped to 70 mm Hg, and because no one was in the scan room with him, he coded. He was transported to the intensive care unit and intubated. He developed sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p>
