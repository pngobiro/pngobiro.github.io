                <section id="introduction" class="content-section" aria-labelledby="section-heading-2">
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Almost half our waking hours are spent in the workplace. For this reason alone, the quality
                            of the workplace environment is a major concern. Yet it is neglected to a surprising extent
                            in many healthcare organizations. It is neglected by administrators, who would never allow
                            peeling paint or poorly maintained equipment but leave their staff, their most costly and
                            valuable resource, unmaintained and unrefreshed. The "do more with less" thinking that has
                            predominated in many organizations places considerable pressure on staff and management
                            alike (Chisholm, 1992). Improvement of the workplace environment is more difficult to
                            accomplish under these circumstances, but it is more important than ever.</p>
                        <p>Occupational hazards for healthcare workers are an enormous health and economic problem.
                            According to Linda Rosenstock, MD, MPH, director of the National Institute for Occupational
                            Health and Safety (NIOSH), every day in the United States, 9000 healthcare workers sustain a
                            disabling injuring on the job (Slattery, 1998, p. 12).</p>
                        <p>Much of the responsibility for enhancing the workplace environment rests with upper-level
                            management people, who have the authority and resources to encourage organization-wide
                            growth and change. However, nurses have begun to take more responsibility for identification
                            of and problem solving for workplace issues. The first international conference, Caring for
                            Those Who Care: Occupational Hazards to Health Care Workers, was held in 1998. Some of the
                            most prevalent threats identified at the conference were latex allergy, back injury,
                            violence, needlestick injury, and pollution. These issues, as well as sexual harassment,
                            impaired workers, enhancement of the quality of work life, and diversity, are the focus of
                            this chapter.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Safety is not a new concept in the workplace. Although guidelines for safe working conditions
                            have existed since the early Egyptians, the major movement began during the Industrial
                            Revolution. In 1913, the National Council for Industrial Safety (now the National Safety
                            Council) was formed. Through the National Safety Council, national standards for
                            occupational safety issues are developed and statistics on accident and injury rates are
                            collected. The National Safety Council believes that safety in the workplace is the
                            responsibility of both the employer and the employee. The employer must ensure a safe,
                            healthful work environment, and employees are accountable for knowing and following safety
                            guidelines and standards (National Safety Council, 1992).</p>
                        <h3>Threats to Safety</h3>
                        <p>Threats to safety in the workplace can range from exposure to potentially lethal chemical,
                            infectious, and radioactive agents to violence from clients or other staff members.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>In 1993, 300 of Brigham Young Hospital's 1000 staff nurses reported the following
                                symptoms: hives; rashes; headache; dizziness; nausea; eye, nose, and throat irritation;
                                menstrual irregularities; urticaria; cardiac and respiratory distress; hair loss; joint
                                pain; and memory loss. The mysterious illness began with the operating room staff and
                                soon spread to all areas of the hospital. The hospital, undergoing reconstruction, was
                                soon given a diagnosis of "sick building syndrome." Several nurses became so sensitized
                                to the chemicals floating in the hospital air that they have been on permanent leave
                                since 1994 and may never be able to return to nursing (Himali, 1995).</p>
                            <p>A survey of 1540 Milwaukee nurses found that many of them had experienced physical or
                                verbal abuse. Fifty-three percent of the nurses responding to the survey said that they
                                had been hit, pushed, or had something thrown at them by clients. Another 6% said that
                                they had had the same experience with physicians. Verbal abuse was even more common: 58%
                                said that they had been verbally abused by clients, 51% by physicians, and 22% by their
                                supervisors ("RNs cite physical and verbal abuse," 1993).</p>
                            <p>With approximately 800,000 needlestick injuries annually to U.S. healthcare workers,
                                percutaneous exposure is the principal route for HIV/HBV transmission. In fact, 86% of
                                HIV exposures occur through this method, with recapping of needles as the primary
                                exposure source. As of 1995, the CDC reported 151 persons with documented or possible
                                work-related HIV infection and an estimated 1000 healthcare workers with HBV infections,
                                with 150 dying annually (Rogers, 1997; http://www.nursingworld.org/dlwa/osh/brogers.htm,
                                9/25/99).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Threats to safety in the workplace vary from one setting to another and from one individual
                            to another. A pregnant staff member may be more vulnerable to risks from radiation; staff
                            members working in the emergency room of a large urban public hospital are at more risk for
                            HIV and tuberculosis than the staff members working in the newborn nursery. All staff
                            members have the right to be made aware of potential risks. No worker should feel
                            intimidated or uncomfortable in the workplace.</p>
                        <h3>Reducing Risk</h3>
                        <h4>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</h4>
                        <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977
                            were the first federal guidelines and standards related to safe and healthful working
                            conditions. Through these acts, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
                            (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were formed. OSHA
                            regulations apply to most U.S. employers who have one or more employees and who engage in
                            businesses affecting commerce. Under OSHA regulations, the employer must comply with
                            standards for providing a safe, healthful work environment. Employers are also required to
                            keep records of all occupational (job-related) illnesses and accidents. Examples of
                            occupational accidents and injuries include burns, chemical exposures, lacerations, hearing
                            loss, respiratory exposure, musculoskeletal injuries, and exposure to infectious diseases.
                        </p>
                        <p>OSHA regulations provide for workplace inspections that may be conducted with or without
                            prior notification to the employer. However, catastrophic or fatal accidents and employee
                            complaints may also trigger an OSHA inspection. OSHA encourages employers and employees to
                            work together to identify and remove any workplace hazards before contacting the nearest
                            OSHA area office. If the employee has not been able to resolve the safety or health issue,
                            the employee may file a formal complaint, and an inspection will be ordered by the area OSHA
                            director (United States Department of Labor, 1995). Any violations found are posted where
                            all employees can view them. The employer has the right to contest the OSHA decision. The
                            law also states that the employer cannot punish or discriminate against employees for
                            exercising their rights related to job safety and health hazards or participating in OSHA
                            inspections (United States Department of Labor, 1995).</p>
                        <p>OSHA inspections focus especially on blood-borne pathogens, lifting and ergonomic (proper
                            body alignment) guidelines, confinedspace regulations, and respiratory guidelines (National
                            Safety Council, 1992). More recently, OSHA has also been committed to preventing workplace
                            violence (United States Department of Labor, 1996). The U.S. Department of Labor publishes
                            fact sheets related to various OSHA guidelines and activities. They can be obtained from
                            your employer, at the local public library, or via the Internet. There is also an extensive
                            government Website developed by OSHA where extensive information on preventing workplace
                            violence for healthcare workers can be found (http://
                            www.osha-slc.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/ guideline.html).</p>
                        <h4>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</h4>
                        <p>Although not directly involved in workplace safety, the Centers for Disease Control and
                            Prevention (CDC) is another good resource for the nurse. The CDC publishes continuous
                            updates on recommendations for prevention of HIV transmission in the workplace and universal

                        <p>Box 11-1 lists the most important federal laws enacted to protect individuals in the
                            workplace.</p>
                        <h4>Programs</h4>
                        <p>The primary objective of any workplace safety program is to prevent staff members from harm
                            and to protect the organization from liability related to that harm. The first step in
                            development of a workplace safety program is to recognize a potential hazard and then take
                            steps to control it. Based on OSHA regulations (United States Department of Labor, 1995),
                            the employer must inform staff members of any potential health hazards and provide as much
                            protection from these hazards as possible. In many cases, initial warnings come from the
                            CDC, NIOSH, and other federal, state, and local agencies. For example, employers must
                            provide tuberculosis testing and hepatitis B vaccine; protective equipment such as gloves,
                            gowns, and masks; and immediate treatment after exposure for all staff members who may have
                            contact with bloodborne pathogens. They are expected to remove hazards, educate employees,
                            and establish institution-wide policies and procedures to protect their employees (Herring,
                            1994; Roche, 1993). For example, nurses who are not provided with latex gloves may refuse to
                            participate in any activities involving blood or blood products. The employee cannot be
                            discriminated against in the workplace, and reasonable accommodations for safety against
                            blood-borne pathogens must be provided. This may mean that the nurse with latex allergies is
                            placed in an area where exposure to blood-borne pathogens is not an issue (Strader & Decker,
                            1995; United States Department of Labor, 1995).</p>
                        <p>The second step in a workplace safety program is a thorough assessment of the degree of risk
                            entailed. Staff members, for example, may become very fearful in situations that do not
                            warrant such fear.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Nancy Wu is the nurse manager on a busy geriatric unit. The majority of the clients
                                require total care: bathing, feeding, positioning. She has observed that several of the
                                staff members working on the unit use poor body mechanics in lifting and moving the
                                clients. In the last month, several of the staff members have been referred to employee
                                health for back pain. This week, she noticed that the clients seem to remain in the same
                                position for long periods of time and frequently are never out of bed or are in a chair
                                for the entire day. When she confronted the staff, the response was the same from all of
                                them: "I have to work for a living. I can't afford to risk a back injury for someone who
                                may not live past the end of the week." Nancy Wu was concerned about the care of the
                                clients as well as the apparent lack of information her staff had about prevention of
                                back injuries. She decided to seek assistance from the nurse practitioner in charge of
                                employee health in developing a back injury prevention program.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>These same individuals may be complacent about such risks as radiation or clean air, which
                            cannot be seen or felt as one works with clients.</p>
                        <p>Assessment of the workplace may require considerable data-gathering to document the incidence
                            of the problem and consultation with experts before a plan of action is drawn up. Healthcare
                            organizations often create formal committees comprising experts from within the institution
                            and representatives from the affected departments to assess these risks. It is important
                            that staff members from various levels of the organization be allowed to give input into an
                            assessment of safety needs and risks.</p>
                        <p>The third step is to draw up a plan to provide optimal protection for staff members. It is
                            not always a simple matter to protect staff members without interfering with the provision
                            of client care. For example, some devices that can be worn to prevent transmission of
                            tuberculosis interfere with communication with the client ("Federal agencies clash," 1993).
                            Some attempts have been made to limit visits or withdraw home healthcare nurses from
                            high-crime areas, but this leaves homebound clients without care (Nadwairski, 1992). A
                            threat-assessment team that evaluates problems and suggests appropriate actions may reduce
                            the incidence and severity of problems with violent behavior, but it may also increase
                            employees' fear of violence if not handled well.</p>
                        <p>Developing a safety plan includes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consulting federal, state, and local regulations</li>
                            <li>Distinguishing real from imagined risks</li>
                            <li>Seeking administrative support and enforcement for the plan</li>
                            <li>Calculating costs of a program</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The final stage in developing a workplace safety program is implementing the program.
                            Educating the staff, providing the necessary safety supplies and equipment, and modifying
                            the environment contribute to an effective program. Protecting client and staff
                            confidentiality and monitoring adherence to control and safety procedures should not be
                            overlooked in the implementation stage (CDC, 1992; "Federal agencies clash," 1993;
                            Jankowski, 1992).</p>
                        <p>An example of a safety program is the one for healthcare workers exposed to HIV instituted at
                            the Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital, San Francisco, California (Armstrong, Gordon, &
                            Santorella, 1995). An HIV exposure can be stressful for both healthcare workers and their
                            loved ones. This employee assistance program includes as many as ten 60-minute individual
                            counseling sessions on the meaning and experience of this traumatic event. Additional
                            counseling sessions for couples are also provided. Information about HIV and about dealing
                            with acute stress reactions is provided. Additional counseling assists workers to identify a
                            plan to obtain help from their individual support systems, the healthcare worker's practice
                            methods of dealing with blood-borne pathogens, and helping the client to return to work.</p>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association (ANA) has published a brochure entitled HIV, Hepatitis-B,
                            Hepatitis-C: Nurses' Risks, Rights, and Responsibilities (ANA, 1993). A free copy of the

                        <h3>Violence</h3>
                        <p>Violence in the workplace is a contemporary social issue. Newspapers and magazines have
                            reported on numerous violent incidents in the workplace. Today, more assaults occur in the
                            healthcare and social services industries than in any other (United States Department of
                            Labor, 1996). Department of labor data indicate that the rate of workplace violence for
                            private industry is 3 cases for every 10,000 workers and 38 to 47 cases per 10,000 workers
                            for healthcare facilities. One of six violent crimes occurs in the workplace, and homicide
                            is the second leading cause of workplace death (Edwards, 1999). There are approximately 1000
                            murders and 1.5 million assaults on healthcare workers each year in the workplace
                            (http://www.osha-slc.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/index.html). The aggressor can be a
                            disgruntled employee or employer, an unhappy significant other, or a person committing a
                            random act of violence. Nurses have been identified as a group at risk of violence from
                            clients, family members, and other staff members. Between 1983 and 1989, 69 registered
                            nurses were killed at work. Homicide is the leading cause of traumatic occupational death
                            among employees in nursing homes and personal care facilities. Nurses employed in
                            psychiatric settings, emergency departments, and outpatient clinics are considered
                            particularly vulnerable. Assault by a client is defined as "the act of a patient physically
                            attacking or restraining a nurse with part of the patient's body or an object" (United
                            States Department of Labor, 1996; Collins, 1994).</p>
                        <p>The circumstances surrounding healthcare work contributes to workers' susceptibility to
                            homicide and assault (Edwards, 1999, p. 8; http://www.nursingworld.org/dlwa/osh/wp5. htm):

                        <p>Nurses should know their workplace. Start by asking yourself the following questions:</p>

                            <li>Does violence in the surrounding community have an impact on my workplace?</li>
                            <li>Does my facility's layout invite violence, such as doors that open to the street or

                            <p>Ms. Jones works on the evening shift in the emergency department (ED) at a large, urban
                                hospital. The ED frequently receives clients who have been victims of gunshot wounds,
                                stabbings, and other gang-related incidents. Many of the clients entering the ED are
                                high on alcohol or drugs. Ms. Jones has just interviewed a 21-year-old male client who
                                is awaiting treatment as a result of a fight during an evening of heavy drinking.
                                Because his injuries have been determined not to be life-threatening, he had to wait to
                                see a doctor. "I'm tired of waiting. Let's get this show on the road," he screamed
                                loudly as Ms. Jones walked by. "I'm sorry you have to wait, Mr. P., but the doctor is
                                busy with another client and will get to you as soon as possible." She handed him a cup
                                of juice she had been bringing to another client. He grabbed the cup, threw it in her
                                face, and then grabbed her arm. Slamming her against the wall, he jumped off the
                                stretcher and yelled obscenities at her. He continued to scream in her face until a
                                security guard intervened.</p>

                        <p>Long waiting times, staff-to-staff conflicts, open access to client care areas, and unlimited
                            visiting hours have also been linked to the potential for violence in healthcare facilities.
                            Even clients with no history of violent behavior may react violently to medication or pain
                            (Carroll & Sheverbush, 1996; Lanza & Carifio, 1991).</p>
                        <p>Also of concern are the underreporting of violence and persistent misperception within the
                            healthcare industry that assaults are part of the job or that the victim somehow caused the
                            assault. Causes of underreporting may be a lack of institutional reporting policies or fear
                            on the part of employees that the assault was a result of negligence or poor job performance
                            (United States Department of Labor, 1996). Table 11-1 lists some of the faulty reasoning
                            that leads to placing blame on the victim of the assault.</p>
                        <p>Actions to address violence in the workplace include (1) identifying the factors that
                            contribute to violence and controlling as many as possible and (2) assessing staff attitudes
                            and knowledge regarding violence in the workplace (Carroll & Sheverbush, 1996; Collins,
                            1994; Mahoney, 1991).</p>
                        <p>When you begin your new job, you may want to find out what the policies and procedures
                            related to violence in the workplace are at your institution. Seeking information after an
                            incident occurs may be too late. Preventing an incident is better than having to intervene
                            after violence has occurred. Some of the strategies you can individually institute to
                            prevent violence include the following (Carroll & Sheverbush, 1996; Collins, 1994; Mahoney,
                            1991):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Look for clues indicating a potential for violence.</li>
                            <li>Call clients, family members, and visitors by name; anonymity has been associated with a
                                higher incidence of violence.</li>
                            <li>Encourage the client or family to vent anger verbally by using effective communication
                                techniques.</li>
                            <li>Trust your intuition if you feel uncomfortable.</li>
                            <li>Be knowledgeable regarding policies and procedures in your institution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Violence in the workplace increases costs of care. Box 11-4 lists some additional actions
                            that can be taken to protect staff members and clients from violence in the workplace.</p>

                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>A new supervisor was hired on the unit. After months of interviewing, the candidate
                                selected was a young male nurse whom the staff members jokingly described as "a blond
                                Tom Cruise." The new supervisor was an instant hit with the predominantly female
                                executives and staff members. However, he soon found himself on the receiving end of
                                sexual jokes and innuendoes. He had been trying to prove himself a competent supervisor,
                                with hopes of eventually moving up to a higher management position. He viewed the
                                behavior of the female staff members and supervisors as undermining his credibility, in
                                addition to being embarrassing and annoying. He attempted to have the unwelcome conduct
                                stopped by discussing it with his boss, a female nurse manager. She told him jokingly
                                that it is nothing more than "good-natured fun" and besides, "men can't be harassed by
                                women" (Outwater, 1994).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>The laws that prohibit discrimination in the workplace are based on the Fifth and Fourteenth
                            amendments to the Constitution, mandating due process and equal protection under the law.
                            The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) oversees the administration and
                            enforcement of issues related to workplace equality. Although there may be exemptions from
                            any law, it is important that nurses recognize that there is significant legislation that
                            prohibits employers from making workplace decisions based on race, color, sex, age,
                            disability, religion, or national origin.</p>
                        <p>The employer may ask questions related to these issues but cannot make decisions about
                            employment based on them. The American Nurses Association has a brochure available on sexual
                            harassment (ANA, 1993). The information is also available on their Website. The ANA states:
                            "ANA is deeply committed to the principles of civil rights and opposes any form of
                            discrimination against individuals or groups of individuals based on sex, race, age,
                            national origin, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. ANA believes that nurses and
                            students of nursing have a right to and responsibility for a workplace free of sexual
                            harassment. Sexual harassment has an adverse impact on the healthcare environment. Remember,
                            your employer has the responsibility to provide you with a harassment-free environment"
                            (http://www/nursingworld.org, 9/25/99). Behaviors that could be defined as sexual harassment
                            are identified in Table 11-2.</p>
                        <p>The EEOC issued a statement in 1980 that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination
                            prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Two forms of sexual harassment are
                            identified; both are based on the premise that the action is unwelcome sexual conduct:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Quid pro quo:</strong> Sexual favors are given in exchange for favorable job
                                benefits or continuation of employment. The employee must demonstrate that he or she was
                                required to endure unwelcome sexual advances to keep the job or job benefits and that
                                rejection of these behaviors would have resulted in deprivation of a job or benefits.
                                Example: The administrator approaches a nurse for a date in exchange for a salary
                                increase 3 months before the scheduled review.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hostile environment:</strong> This is the most common sexual harassment claim
                                and the most difficult to prove. The employee making the claim must prove that the
                                harassment is based on gender and that it has affected conditions of employment or
                                created an environment so offensive that the employee could not effectively discharge
                                the responsibilities of the job (Outwater, 1994).</li>

                                    Institute, 1996; http://www.de.psu.edu/harass/legal/define.htm 9/25/99.</em></p>

                        <p>In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled that a plaintiff is not required to prove any psychological
                            injury to establish a harassment claim. If the environment could be shown to be hostile or
                            abusive, there was no further need to establish that it was also psychologically injurious.
                            Although sexual harassment against women is more common, men can also become the victims of
                            sexual harassment.</p>
                        <p>Since the 1991 allegations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill against Justice Clarence
                            Thomas, the number of claims filed with the EEOC has increased dramatically, from 6892 in
                            1991 to more than 12,500 in 1993. A study of female physicians conducted by the American
                            Medical Association in 1993 indicated that more than 41% experienced sexual harassment in
                            their practice (Outwater, 1994). Sexual harassment can cost an employer money, unfavorable
                            publicity, expensive lawsuits, and large damage awards. Low morale caused by a hostile work
                            environment can cause significant decreases in employee productivity, increased absenteeism,
                            increases in sick leave and medical payments, and decreased job satisfaction.</p>
                        <p>Addressing the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace is important. As an employee, you
                            should be familiar with the policies and procedures related to reporting sexual harassment
                            incidents. If you supervise other employees, you should regularly review the agency's
                            policies and procedures. Seek appropriate guidance from your human resources personnel. If
                            an employee approaches you with a complaint, a confidential investigation of the charges
                            should be initiated. Above all, do not dismiss any incidents or charges of sexual harassment
                            involving yourself or others as "just having fun" or respond that "there is nothing anyone
                            can do." Responses such as this can have serious consequences in the workplace (Outwater,
                            1994).</p>

                            <li><strong>Confront</strong><br>Indicate immediately and clearly to the harasser that the
                                attention is unwanted. If you are in a union facility, ask the nursing representative to
                                accompany you.</li>
                            <li><strong>Report</strong><br>Report the incident immediately to your supervisor. If the
                                harasser is your supervisor, report the incident to a higher authority. File a formal
                                complaint and follow the chain of command.</li>
                            <li><strong>Document</strong><br>Document the incident immediately while it is fresh in your
                                mind—what happened, when and where it occurred, and how you responded. Name any
                                witnesses. Keep thorough records, and keep them in a safe place away from work.</li>
                            <li><strong>Support</strong><br>Seek support from friends, relatives, and organizations such
                                as your state nurses association. If you are a student, seek support from a trusted
                                faculty member or advisor.</li>

                            <p>A nurse developed hives in 1987, nasal congestion in 1989, and asthma in 1992.
                                Eventually, she developed severe respiratory symptoms in the healthcare environment even
                                when she had no direct contact with latex. The nurse was forced to leave her occupation
                                because of these health effects (Bauer, Ammon, Chen, Beckman, & Czuppon, 1993, p. 1148).

                            <p>A midwife initially suffered hives, nasal congestion, and conjunctivitis. Within a year,
                                she developed asthma, and 2 years later she went into shock after a routine
                                gynecological examination during which latex gloves were used. The midwife also suffered
                                respiratory distress in latex-containing environments when she had no direct contact
                                with latex products. She was unable to continue working (Bauer et al., 1993, p. 1148).

                            <p>A physician with a history of seasonal allergies, runny nose, and eczema on his hands
                                suffered severe runny nose, shortness of breath, and collapse minutes after putting on a
                                pair of latex gloves. A cardiac arrest team successfully resuscitated him. (Rosen,
                                Isaacson, Brady, & Corey, 1993, p. 731).</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Latex products are manufactured from the milky fluid of the rubber tree. Latex allergy was
                            first identified in the late 1970s. It has become such a major health problem in the
                            workplace that both OSHA and the ANA have devoted Websites to the problem. It is estimated
                            that currently 8-12% of healthcare workers are sensitive to natural rubber latex products.
                            Table 11-3 lists products commonly produced with latex. Since the 1987 CDC recommendations
                            for universal precautions, the use of latex gloves has greatly increased the exposure of
                            healthcare workers to natural rubber latex (NRL). The two major routes of exposure to NRL
                            include skin and inhalation, particularly when glove powder acts as a carrier for NRL
                            protein (OSHA latex alert at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/latexalt.html, 9/25/99). Reactions
                            range from contact dermatitis with scaling, drying, cracking, blistering skin to allergic
                            contact dermatitis in the form of generalized hives. More serious generalized reactions can
                            progress to generalized urticaria, rhinitis, wheezing, swelling, shortness of breath, and
                            anaphylaxis.</p>
                        <p>Latex allergy should be suspected if an employee develops symptoms after latex exposures. A
                            complete medical history can reveal latex sensitivity, and blood tests approved by the FDA
                            are available to detect latex antibodies. Skin testing and glove-use tests are also
                            available.</p>
                        <p>Compete latex avoidance is the most effective approach. Medications may reduce allergic
                            symptoms, and special precautions are needed to prevent exposure during medical and dental
                            care. Encourage employees with a latex allergy to wear a medical alert bracelet.</p>
                        <p>Decreasing the potential for development of latex allergy consists of reducing unnecessary
                            exposure to NRL proteins for all healthcare workers. Many employees in a healthcare setting,
                            such as food handlers or gardeners, can use alternative gloves. If an employee must use NRL
                            gloves, those with a lower protein content and powder-free gloves should be considered. Good
                            housekeeping practices should be identified to remove latex-containing dust from the
                            workplace. Employee education programs to ensure appropriate work practices and hand washing
                            should be encouraged. Identification of employees with increased potential for latex
                            allergies is not possible. However, clinical evidence indicates that certain workers may be
                            at greater risk, including those with:</p>

                                from a patient's IV line. The patient, in the advanced stages of AIDS, moved, and the
                                needle went into Lisa's hand. Nine months later she tested positive for HIV and 3 months
                                after that for hepatitis C. She continues to share her story with nurses everywhere in
                                an effort to prevent this unfortunate accident from happening to one more nurse
                                (Trossman, 1999a, p. 1).</p>

                        <p>Healthcare workers suffer between 600,000 and 1 million injuries from conventional needles
                            and sharps on an annual basis. These exposures lead to diseases such as hepatitis B,
                            hepatitis C, and HIV. Although the first safe needle designs were patented in the 1970s and
                            the FDN issued a recommendation in 1992 that all healthcare facilities use needleless IV
                            systems, less than 15% of American hospitals use such systems (Nursing Facts from the ANA at
                            http://www.nursingworld.org/readroom/fsneedle/htm).</p>
                        <p>In September 1998, the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Public Affairs published the
                            following OSHA National News Release: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration
                            (OSHA) is asking for information on additional ways to better protect healthcare workers
                            from contaminated needles or other sharp objects. Injuries from needlesticks and other sharp
                            objects continue to be of occupational concern because of the frequency with which they
                            occur and the severe health effects they can produce. An estimated 600,000 such injuries
                            occur annually in the workplace (http://www.osha.gov/media;oshnews/sept98/ needles.html).

                        <h3>BACK INJURY</h3>
                        <p>Occupational-related back injuries affect almost 40% of nurses. Injuries can become so severe
                            that the nurse may have to leave the profession. Lifting patients who exceed NIOSH's
                            guidelines (a stable object with handles is the heaviest amount anyone should lift) is the
                            main source of injury. A recent grant from NIOSH to study how to reduce back stress in
                            nursing personnel found that 98% of transfers were done using the underarm or "hook and
                            toss" method. This method is much more stressful to both the patient and the nurse than when
                            a mechanical device, such as a gait belt, is used.</p>
                        <p>Suggestions for decreasing back injuries for nurses include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Participate on the safety committee as a nursing representative to develop written
                                guidelines detailing transfer requirements</li>
                            <li>Work in teams if possible—don't be afraid to ask for help</li>
                            <li>Use transfer and lifting equipment</li>
                            <li>Do back exercises (Trossman, 1999b, p. 12; Slattery, 1998, p. 12)</li>

                        <p>Alcohol and drug abuse continue to be major health problems in this country. Healthcare
                            professionals are not immune to alcoholism or chemical dependency. In addition, various
                            kinds of mental illnesses may also affect a nurse's ability to deliver safe, competent care.
                            Impaired workers can adversely affect client care, staff retention, morale, and management
                            time as team members try to "pick up the slack for the impaired worker" (Damrosch &
                            Scholler-Jaquish, 1993). The most common signs of impairment are as follows (Damrosch &
                            Scholler-Jaquish, 1993, pp. 154-160):</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Witnessed theft of controlled substances</li>

                            <p>Mr. P., the unit manager, has noticed that Ms. J. has frequently been late for work. She
                                arrives with a wrinkled uniform, dirty shoes, unkempt hair, and broken nails. Lately she
                                has been overheard making terse remarks to clients such as, "Who do you think I am—your
                                maid?" and spends longer and longer periods of time off the unit. The floor has a large
                                number of surgical clients who receive intramuscular and oral medications for pain.
                                Lately Ms. J.'s clients continue to complain of pain even after medication
                                administration has been charted. She frequently "forgets" to waste her intramuscular
                                narcotics in front of another nurse. Mr. P. is concerned that Ms. J. may be an impaired
                                nurse.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Most employers and state boards of nursing have strict guidelines related to impaired nurses.
                        </p>
                        <p>Impaired-nurse programs conducted by state boards of nursing work with the employer to assist
                            the impaired nurse to remain licensed while receiving help for the addiction problem. It is
                            important that you become aware of workplace issues surrounding the impaired worker, signs
                            and symptoms of impairment, and the policies and reporting procedures concerning an impaired
                            worker. Compassion from coworkers and supervisors is of utmost importance in assisting the
                            impaired worker to seek help (Damrosch & Scholler-Jaquish, 1993).</p>
                        <p>A recent concern regarding safety in the workplace involves nurses working rotating shifts.
                            Nurses who work permanently at night often readjust their sleep-wake cycle. Nurses who
                            randomly rotate shifts throw off their circadian rhythm. Fatigue, the number one complaint
                            of these nurses, is the result of the body never getting the chance to adapt to changing
                            sleep-wake cycles.</p>
                        <p>One of the most serious effects of rotating night shifts is the increasing number of nurses
                            affected by coronary heart disease. Studies indicate that nurses who rotate to nights for
                            six years have a 70% greater risk of developing CHD than nurses who never rotated shifts
                            (Trossman, 1999). Suggestions for nurses who rotate shifts include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Try to schedule working the same shifts for an entire scheduling period instead of
                                rotating different shifts in one schedule.</li>
                            <li>Try to schedule to same days off within the schedule.</li>
                            <li>If you become sleepy during the shift, take a walk or climb stairs.</li>
                            <li>Limit caffeine intake, especially toward the end of the shift.</li>
                            <li>If you work evenings or nights, do not eat a big meal at the end of the shift. This
                                interferes with sleep.</li>
                            <li>Try to sleep a continuous block of time instead of catching a few hours "here and
                                there."</li>
                            <li>Make the room you are sleeping in as dark and noise free as possible.</li>
                            <li>Maintain good nutrition and an exercise program.</li>
                            <li>Negotiate your schedule with your manager. If you and your colleagues feel strongly
                                about eliminating rotating shifts, work together to make changes.</li>
                            <li>The American Nurses Association has published The Nurse's Shift Work Handbook, which
                                includes suggestions for both nurses and managers involved in shift work and scheduling
                                (Trossman, 1999, p. 2).</li>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>When the nurse is aware of inappropriate or questionable practice in the provision of
                                health care, concern should be expressed to the person carrying out the questionable
                                practice and attention called to the possible detrimental effect upon the client's
                                welfare. When factors in the healthcare delivery system threaten the welfare of the
                                client, similar action should be directed to the responsible administrative person. If
                                indicated, the practice should then be reported to the appropriate authority within the
                                institution, agency, or larger system. (ANA, 1985, pp. 6-7)</p>

                            may cause nurses to have no protection from retaliation if they report illegal practices in
                            the workplace (ANA, 1995). The 1995 brochure from the American Nurses Association, Protect
                            Your Patients—Protect Your License, states, "Be aware that reporting quality and safety
                            issues may result in reprisals by an employer."</p>
                        <p>If attempts to resolve issues through appropriate workplace channels fail, the ANA has
                            published information to assist the registered nurse in reporting quality concerns in the
                            workplace (ANA, 1995). The brochure, item NP-115, may be obtained by calling 1-800-274-4ANA.

                        <p>It is the responsibility of professional nurses to become acquainted with the state and
                            federal regulations, standards of practice and professional performance, and agency
                            protocols and practice guidelines governing their practice. Lack of knowledge will not
                            protect you from ethical and legal obligations. Your state nurses association can assist you
                            in seeking information related to incompetent, unethical, or illegal practices. When you
                            join your state association, you will gain access to an opportunity to have input into
                            policies and procedures designed to protect the public.</p>

                        <p>Both the social and physical aspects of a workplace can affect the way in which people work
                            and how they feel about their jobs. The social aspects include working relationships, a
                            climate that allows growth and creativity, and cultural diversity.</p>
                        <h3>Social Environment</h3>
                        <h4>Working Relationships</h4>
                        <p>Many aspects of the social environment have received attention in earlier chapters.
                            Teambuilding, effective communication, and development of leadership skills are essential to
                            the development of effective working relationships. The day-to-day interactions with one's
                            peers and supervisors have a major impact on the quality of the workplace environment.</p>
                        <h4>Support of One's Peers and Supervisors</h4>
                        <p>Most employees keenly feel the difference between a supportive and a nonsupportive
                            environment.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Ms. B. came to work already tired. Her baby was sick and had been awake most of the
                                night. Her team expressed concern about the baby when she told them she had a difficult
                                night. Each team member voluntarily took an extra client so that Ms. B. could have a
                                lighter assignment that day. When Ms. B. expressed her appreciation, her team leader
                                said, "We know you would do the same for us." Ms. B. worked in a supportive environment.
                            </p>
                            <p>Ms. G. came to work after a sleepless night. Her young son had been given a diagnosis of
                                leukemia and she was very worried about him. When she mentioned her concerns, her team
                                leader interrupted her, saying, "Please leave your personal problems at home. We have a
                                lot of work to do and expect you to do your share." Ms. G. worked in a nonsupportive
                                environment.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Support from peers and supervisors involves professional concerns as well as personal ones.
                            In a supportive environment, people are willing to make difficult decisions, take risks, and
                            "go the extra mile" for team members and the organization. In contrast, in a nonsupportive
                            environment, they are afraid to take risks, avoid making decisions, and usually limit their
                            commitment.</p>
                        <h4>Involvement in Decision Making</h4>
                        <p>The importance of having a voice in the decisions made about one's work and patients cannot
                            be overstated. Empowerment is a related phenomenon. It is a sense of having both the ability
                            and the opportunity to act effectively (Kramer & Schmalenberg, 1993). Empowerment is the
                            opposite of apathy and powerlessness. A number of actions can be taken to empower nurses:
                            remove barriers to their autonomy and participation in decision making, publicly express
                            confidence in their capability and value, reward initiative and assertiveness, and provide
                            role models who demonstrate confidence and competence. The following illustrates the
                            difference between empowerment and powerlessness:</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Soon after completing orientation, nurse A heard a new nurse aide scolding a client for
                                soiling the bed. Nurse A did not know how incidents of potential verbal abuse were
                                handled in this institution, so she reported it to the nurse manager. The nurse manager
                                asked nurse A several questions and thanked her for the information. The new aide was
                                counseled immediately after their meeting. Nurse A noticed a positive change in the
                                aide's manner with clients after this incident. Nurse A felt good about having
                                contributed to a more effective client care team. Nurse A felt empowered and will take
                                action again when another occasion arises.</p>
                            <p>A colleague of nurse B was an instructor at a nearby community college. This colleague
                                asked nurse B if students would be welcome on her unit. "Of course," replied nurse B.
                                "I'll speak with my head nurse about it." When nurse B spoke with her head nurse, the
                                response was that the unit was too busy to accommodate students. In addition, nurse B
                                received a verbal reprimand from the supervisor for overstepping her authority by
                                discussing the placement of students. "All requests for student placement must be
                                directed to the education department," she said. The supervisor directed nurse B to
                                write a letter of apology for having made an unauthorized commitment to the community
                                college. Nurse B was afraid to make any decisions or public statements after this
                                incident. Nurse B felt alienated and powerless.</p>

                        <h3>Professional Growth and Innovation</h3>
                        <p>The difference between a climate that encourages staff growth and creativity and one that
                            does not can be quite subtle. In fact, many people are only partly aware, if at all, of
                            whether or not they work in an environment that fosters professional growth and learning.
                            Yet the effect on the quality of the work done is pervasive, and it is an important factor
                            in distinguishing the merely good healthcare organization from the excellent healthcare
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>Much of the responsibility for staff development and promotion of innovation lies with
                            upper-level management people, who can sponsor seminars, conduct organizationwide workshops,
                            establish educational policies, promote career mobility, develop clinical ladders, initiate
                            innovative projects, and reward suggestions.</p>
                        <p>Some of the ways in which first-line managers can develop and support a climate of
                            professional growth are to encourage critical thinking, provide opportunities to take
                            advantage of educational programs, encourage new ideas and projects, and reward professional
                            growth.</p>
                        <h4>Encourage Critical Thinking</h4>
                        <p>If you ever find yourself or other staff members saying, "Don't ask why; just go ahead and do
                            it," you need to evaluate the type of climate in which you are functioning. An inquisitive
                            frame of mind is relatively easy to suppress in a work environment. Clients and staff
                            members quickly perceive a nurse's impatience or defensiveness when too many questions are
                            raised. Their response will be to simply give up asking these questions.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if you support critical thinkers and act as a role model who adopts a
                            questioning attitude, you can encourage others to do the same.</p>
                        <h4>Seek Out Educational Opportunities</h4>
                        <p>In most organizations, first-line managers do not have discretionary funds that can be
                            allocated for educational purposes. However, they can usually support a staff member's
                            request for educational leave or for financial support and often have a small budget that
                            can be used for seminars or workshops.</p>
                        <p>Team leaders and nurse managers can make it either easier or more difficult for staff members
                            to further their education. They can make things difficult for the staff member who is
                            trying to balance work, home, and school responsibilities. Or they can pitch in and help
                            lighten the load of the staff member who has to finish a paper or take an examination.
                            Unsupportive supervisors have even attacked staff members who pursue further education,
                            criticizing every minor error and blocking their advancement. Obviously, such behavior
                            should be dealt with quickly by upper-level management, because it is a serious inhibitor of
                            staff development.</p>
                        <h4>Encourage New Ideas</h4>
                        <p>The increasingly rapid accumulation of knowledge in the healthcare field mandates continuous
                            learning for safe practice. Intellectual curiosity is a hallmark of the professional.</p>
                        <p>Every move up the professional ladder should bring new challenges that enrich one's work
                            (Roedel & Nystrom, 1987). As a professional, you can be a role model for an environment in
                            which every staff member is both challenged and rewarded for meeting these challenges.
                            Participating in brainstorming sessions, group conferences, and discussions encourages the
                            generation of new ideas. Although new nurses may think that they have nothing to offer, it
                            is important to participate in activities that encourage staff members to look at fresh new
                            ideas.</p>
                        <h4>Reward Professional Growth</h4>
                        <p>A primary source of discontent in the workplace is lack of recognition. Positive feedback and
                            recognition of our contributions are important intangible rewards in the workplace.
                            Regardless of how small a contribution is, everyone enjoys praise and recognition. A smile,
                            a card or note, or a verbal "thank you" goes a long way with coworkers in recognizing a job
                            well done. Staff recognition programs have also been identified as a means to increase
                            self-esteem, social gratification, morale, and job satisfaction (Hurst, Croker, & Bell,
                            1994).</p>
                        <h3>Cultural Diversity</h3>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p>Ms. V. is beginning orientation for a new staff nurse position. She has been told that
                                part of her orientation will be a morning class on cultural diversity. She says to the
                                human resources person in charge of orientation, "I don't think I need to attend that
                                class. I treat all people as equal. Besides, anyone living in the United States has an
                                obligation to learn the language and ways of those of us who were born here, not the
                                other way around."</p>
                            <p>Mr. M. is a staff nurse on a medical-surgical unit. A young man with HIV infection has
                                been admitted recently. He is scheduled for surgery in the morning and has requested
                                that his significant other be present for the preoperative teaching. Mr. M. reluctantly
                                agrees but mumbles under his breath to a coworker, "It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't
                                throw their homosexuality around and act like an old married couple. Why can't he act
                                like a man and get his own pre-op instructions?"</p>
                        </aside>
                        <p>Diversity in healthcare organizations includes ethnicity, culture, gender, lifestyle, and
                            career stages of employees. The composition of nurses in health care is changing to include
                            more older workers, minorities, and males. Working with people who have different customs,
                            traditions, communication styles, and beliefs can be exciting as well as challenging.
                            Workforce diversity in terms of age, gender, culture, ethnicity, race, primary language,
                            physical capabilities, and lifestyle presents a challenge to the workplace. It was projected
                            that by the year 2000, 47% of workers will be women and 26% minorities (Lappetito, 1994, p.
                            22). An organization that fosters diversity in the workplace encourages respect and
                            understanding of human characteristics and acceptance of the similarities and differences
                            that make us human.</p>
                        <p>Often, when stressful situations arise, gender, age, and culture can contribute to
                            misunderstandings. Giger, Davidhizer, and Dowd (1999) have identified six important factors
                            in their model for understanding cultural diversity:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Communication.</strong> Communication and culture are closely bound. Culture is
                                transmitted through communication, and culture influences how verbal and nonverbal
                                communication are expressed. The use of vocabulary, voice qualities, intonation, rhythm,
                                speed, silence, touch, body postures, eye movements, and pronunciation all differ among
                                cultural groups and even vary among persons from similar cultures. Using respect as a
                                central core to a relationship, each one of us needs to assess personal beliefs and
                                communication variables of others in the workplace.</li>
                            <li><strong>Space.</strong> Personal space is the area that surrounds our body. The amount
                                of personal space individuals prefer varies from person to person and from situation to
                                situation. Cultural beliefs also influence a person's personal space comfort zone. In
                                the workplace, an understanding of our coworkers' comfort related to personal space is
                                important. Often this comfort is relayed in nonverbal rather than verbal communication.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Social organization.</strong> In most cultures, the family is the most important
                                social organization. For some people, the importance of family supersedes other
                                personal, workor national causes. Because the healthcare industry employs a large number
                                of women, the value of the family becomes an important issue in the workplace. For some
                                people, the importance of caring for a sick child overrides the importance of being on
                                time or even coming to work, regardless of staffing needs or policies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time.</strong> Time orientation is often related to culture, environment, and
                                family experiences. Some cultures are more past oriented and focus on maintaining
                                traditions, with little interest in future goals. Cultures with more of a present and
                                future orientation may be more likely to engage in activities, such as returning to
                                school or certifications, that will enhance the future. Working with people who have
                                different time orientations may cause difficulty in planning schedules and setting
                                deadlines for the group.</li>
                            <li><strong>Environment control.</strong> Environmental control is viewed as those
                                activities that an individual plans to control nature. Environmental control is best
                                understood through the psychological terms internal or external locus of control.
                                Individuals with an external locus of control believe in fate or chance. People with an
                                internal locus of control believe in developing plans and directing their environment.
                                It is expected in the workplace that the nurse will operate from an internal locus of
                                control. This approach may be different from what a person has grown up with or how a
                                client deals with illness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Biological variations.</strong> More and more information is available to
                                healthcare workers about the variations among races in aspects such as body structure,
                                skin color, genetic variations, susceptibility to disease, and psychological
                                differences. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)
                                states that cultural factors must be assessed in developing materials for patient
                                education.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>As you begin your career, be alert to the signs of cultural diversity or insensitivity where
                            you work. Signs that increased sensitivity and responsiveness to the needs of a culturally
                            diverse workforce are needed on your team or in your organization may include a greater
                            proportion of minorities or women in lower-level jobs, lower career mobility and higher
                            turnover rates in these groups, and acceptance or even approval of insensitivity and
                            unfairness (Malone, 1993). Observe interaction patterns, such as where people sit in the
                            cafeteria or how they cluster during coffee breaks. Are they mixing freely or can you see
                            divisions by sex, race, language, or status in the organization (Moch & Diemert, 1990; Ward,
                            1992)? Other indications of an organization's diversity "fitness" include the following
                            (Mitchell, 1995, pp. 44-48):</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The personnel mix reflects the current and potential population being served.</li>
                            <li>Individual cultural preferences pertaining to issues of social distance, touching, voice
                                volume and inflection, silence, and gestures are respected.</li>
                            <li>There is awareness of special family and holiday celebrations important to people of
                                different cultures.</li>
                            <li>The organization communicates through action that people are individuals first and
                                members of a particular culture second.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Effective management of cultural diversity requires considerable time and energy. Although
                            organized cultural diversity programs are usually the responsibility of middle- and
                            upper-level managers, you can play a part in raising awareness. You can be a culturally
                            competent practitioner and a role model for others by becoming:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aware of and sensitive to your own culture-based preferences</li>
                            <li>Willing to explore your own biases and values</li>
                            <li>Knowledgeable about other cultures</li>
                            <li>Respectful of and sensitive to diversity among individuals</li>
                            <li>Skilled using and selecting culturally sensitive intervention strategies</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Physical Environment</h3>
                        <p>Attention to this aspect of workplace improvement is not as well developed as the social
                            aspect, especially in nursing. However, with the increase in technology in health care, we
                            may see more attention to this area of work life. The use of lighting, colors, and music in
                            improving the workplace environment is increasing. Computer workstations designed to promote
                            efficiency in the client care unit are becoming commonplace. Modifications to various
                            elements of the physical environment, such as the floors, chairs, desks, beds, and
                            workstations, can decrease the incidence of back and upper extremity injuries. Relocation of
                            supplies and substations closer to client rooms to reduce steps, easier visual and auditory
                            scanning of clients from the nurses' station, better light and ventilation, a unified
                            information system, and reduced need for client transport are all possible with changes in
                            the physical environment.</p>
                        <p>Healthcare pollution is a more recent identified problem. The CDC states that less than 2% of
                            all hospital waste must be incinerated, yet most hospitals claim they incinerate 75-100%.
                            Dioxin emissions, mercury, and battery waste are often not disposed of properly in the
                            hospital environment. Disinfectants, chemicals, waste anesthesia gases, and laser plume that
                            floats in the air are other sources of pollution exposure for nurses.</p>
                        <p>Nurses have a responsibility to be aware of these potential problems and identify areas in
                            the hospital at risk. Rethinking product choices, such as avoiding the use of PVC or mercury
                            products, location of collection sites for battery and mercury waste, and mandatory
                            education for employees is a start toward a more pollution-free environment. (Slattery,
                            1998, p 12).</p>

                        <p>Workplace safety is an area of increasing concern. Staff members have a right to be informed
                            of any potential risks in the workplace. Employers have a responsibility to provide adequate
                            equipment and supplies to protect employees as well as programs and policies to inform
                            employees about minimizing risks to the extent possible. Issues of workplace violence,
                            sexual harassment, and impaired workers should be addressed to protect both employees and
                            patients.</p>
                        <p>A social environment that promotes professional growth and creativity and a physical
                            environment that offers comfort and maximum work efficiency should be considered in

                        <p>Many waking hours are spent in the workplace. It can offer a climate of companionship,

                            metropolitan hospital. The hospital provides services for a culturally diverse population
                            including African American, Asian, and Hispanic people. Family members often attempt
                            alternative healing practices specific to their culture and bring special foods from home to
                            entice the sick child to eat. One of the more experienced nurses said to you, "We need to
                            discourage these people from fooling with all this hocus-pocus. We are trying to get their
                            sick kid well in the time allowed under their managed care plans, and all this medicine-man
                            stuff is only making the kid sick longer. Besides, all this stuff stinks up the rooms and
                            brings in bugs." You have observed how important these healing rituals and foods are to the
                            clients and families and believe that both the families and the children have benefited from
