\section*{History taking}
- Systematic procedure of gathering subjective and objective data about a client/ patient' health status
- Information can be obtained from
- patient/client
${ }^{\text {- }}$ guardian/companion
- Previous records through interview

\section*{Nursing history}
- Narrative of the clients' past health and health practices that focus on the information needed to:
*Diagnose illness
- Plan nursing care
* Plan investigations and treatment

NB/ both medical and nursing histories are collected through interview to collect data that forms the reason why the client visits the doctor

\section*{Qualities of GP: must be}
- Professional in dress and behavior
- Neat, polite, clean
- Show concern to patient situation
- Pick up non-verbal cues from the patient:
- Are they distressed, how are their mood, demeanor, changes in body language during consultation gives clues to difficulties they have that cannot be expressed verbally

\section*{Objectives / purpose of history}
- To gather information related to the patient's background as a base for treatment (baseline data to make clinical judgment on client's health status)
- Be able to understand the patient and identify the problems faced by the patient then plan for therapeutic interventions

\section*{Objectives / purpose of history}
- Establish previous consultations/ hospitalization with details of treatments given
- To confirm observations made while the patient is in the ward
$\square$ The rationale for history taking therefore is to provide information and relevant details for making a diagnosis and subsequent decision on patient management

\section*{indications}
- $1{ }^{\text {st }}$ contact with patient or informant/companion
- Any patient seeking health care services

NOTE: consultation time ranges between:
* 5-10 minutes

\section*{PHYSICAL EXAMINATION}
- HEAD TO TOE

\section*{Physical examination}
- Def: A systematic review of body systems, structures by use of inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation techniques
- Purpose:
- Establish database for patient abilitiesdetermine risk factors for dysfunction and current pathology
- For diagnosis on current health state in order to plan for appropriate care

\section*{Physical examination}
- Uses:
- To verify findings of history or determine meaning of findings
- Information is used to explain client's problems
- Indications:
- New client/ patient- on routine assessment to plan patient care
- FP clients
- Unexplained physical discomfort and when necessary
- On admission

\section*{Types of P/EXAMINATION}
${ }^{-}$Comprehensive (general):
- Evaluate every body system and every area of function
- Often limited to first visit
${ }^{-}$Focused (local):
- Based on reason for visit and client's current needs e.g abdominal examination in labour
Used to judge whether the client's condition is improving or worsening and identify factors that place client at risk for additional health problems

\section*{Cont}
- Ongoing

Done daily or in every shift to assess progress

\section*{requirements}
- Quiet room with sufficient privacy and ventilation
${ }^{-}$Examination couch or a bed
- A gown
- Stethoscope
- Sphygmomanometer
- Torch with dry cells
- Spatula in a receiver
- Tendon hammer
- Pins

Tape measure
Watch
Thermometer
- Weighing scale
- Cotton wool swabs in a receiver
- Blanket or draw sheet
- Ophthalmoscope
- Otoscope
- Examination gloves

\section*{Senses used}
- Sight
- Smell
- Touch
- Hearing

\section*{Four Techniques used}
- Inspection
- Palpation
- Percussion
- Auscultation
- NOTE: the above order is followed during examination except during examination of the abdomen when palpation is done last so that it does not alter bowel sounds or change findings on percussion and auscultation

\section*{inspection}
- Observing signs indicating a healthy or a pathological state of certain systems within the patient by use of sight
- Involves observation of: color, shape, size, symmetry, position, movement using sense of: smell, hearing, sight- facial appearance
${ }^{-}$It is a continuous process and begins as the patient enters or $1^{\text {st }}$ contact and throughout History

\section*{Cont....}
- Main systems of observation upon the patients entrance:
- Posture
- Gait
- Colour
- Unusual odours
- Inspection continues throughout history and physical examination.
- Validate inspection findings with your patient

\section*{Inspection- teach eyes to see}
- An example of what is meant by "teaching the eye to see" can be demonstrated in the following illustration. Read the sentence in the box. Then count the number of " $f$ ' $s$ " in the sentence.
- How many did you count?
- This example clearly shows that eyes have to be trained to see

Finished files are the result of years of scientific study combined with the experience of years.

\section*{inspection}
- Expose only the area you want to inspect
- Use natural light to avoid distortion of color
- Tangential lighting- one shining from the side and cast shadows to increase ability to detect variations in body surfaces eg changes in abdominal contours

\section*{palpation}
- Examination of the body through the use of touch
- Used to obtain information- temperature, moisture, size, shape, consistency, texture, position and movement
- To check pulses, tenderness, guarding, abdominal distension, masses and edema

\section*{palpation}
- Involves the use of hands and fingers to gather information through sense of touch
- Parts of hands and fingers used in palpation: palmer surface and finger pads- most suitable for position, texture, size, form, consistency and presence of fluid or crepitus of a mass or structure
- Ulna surface- suitable for vibrations
- Dorsal surface- suitable to assess temperature

\section*{Types of palpation}
- Light palpation:
- Precedes deep palpation
- Used to examine masses or lesions on the surface of the skin or lying immediately under the skin. Press $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ ( $1 / 2-3 / 4$ inches)
- In abdomen, begin palpation with light systematic palpation of four quadrants while avoiding areas of tenderness or problem spots
- It identifies areas of muscle resistance and tenderness

\section*{Types of palpation}
- Deep palpation:
- Done only in abdomen
- Used to identify abdominal organs and abdominal masses
- Fingers are held at $60^{\circ}$, fingers together and use pads of fingers and finger tips- press fingers 4 cm (2inches)
- Can be done using one hand or two hands on top of each other with the upper one exerting pressure (reinforced palpation)
- Bimanual palpation- palpation of organs using both hands

\section*{Preparation for palpation}
- Finger nails MUST be short
- Wash hands and dry them, warm hands to avoid producing muscle contractions
- Patient is relaxed and comfortable
- Client supine, hands to the sides (assist in relaxing abdominal muscles)
- Stand on the right side of the patient

\section*{Preparation for palpation}
- If patient is ticklish, add pt fingers to yours till hypersensitivity is lessened then remove clients hand
- Client to take slow deep breath through mouth to decrease muscle tension
- Tender area MUST be palpated last and stop if client has pain

\section*{method}
- Lay palm of hand on the area to be palpated with fingers extended and approximated
- Mould the palpating palm of the hand on surface to be palpated.
- Depress the surface being palpated using the palmer surface of the fingers with an even pressing motion.
- Begin with non-tender area.
- Avoid using finger tips

\section*{Cont....}
- Watch the patients face for any signs of discomfort during palpation
- Palpate lightly in each region
- Repeat this palpation deeply
- Avoid short, quick jabs

\section*{Percussion}
- Tapping of body lightly but sharply to determine the position, size and density of underlying structures and to detect fluid or air in a cavity
- Is striking one object against another to produce vibrations and subsequent sound waves
- Middle finger used as hammer and vibration produced by impact of the finger against underlying tissue

\section*{percussion}
- Sound waves produced are heard as percussion notes (tones) and determined by the density of medium through which sound waves travel eg air, fluid or solid

\begin{table}
\captionsetup{labelformat=empty}
\caption{Percussion notes}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Sound & Pitch & Intensity & Quality & Location \\
\hline Flatness & High & Soft & Extreme dullness & Normal: sternum, thigh Abnormal: atelectatic lung \\
\hline Dullness & Medium & Medium & Thud like & Normal: liver, diaphragm Abnormal: pleural effusion \\
\hline Resonance & Low & Loud & Hollow & Normal: lung Abnormal: emphysematous lung \\
\hline Hyperresonance & Lower than resonance & Very loud & Broom like & Normal: gastric air bubble Abnormal: air distended abdomen \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{Types of percussion}
- Mediate or indirect:
- Middle finger act as hammer (plexor), other finger of other hand act as striking surface (pleximeter)
- Downward snap of pleximeter originate from the wrist and NOT from movement in the forearm or shoulder
- It is quick, sharp but relaxed wrist motion

\section*{Types of percussion}
- Immediate (direct)
- Striking finger or hand directly against the body eg clavicle and skull (in hydrocephalus)

\section*{auscultation}
- Listening for sounds produced by the body
- Done last after other techniques have provided information about what you hear except in abdomen where it is done before palpation and percussion which may interfere with bowel sounds
- Most sounds require stethoscope to augment the sound to aid in hearing
- Others can be heard with the ear without stethoscope eg speech

\section*{preparation}
- Quiet, environment
- Calm patient
- Bell or diaphragm of stethoscope placed on naked skin- clothing obscure sound
- Avoid touching tubing with your fingers or tubing rubbing against other surface to prevent extraneous noise

\section*{Summary of patient diagnosissteps}
- Greet, welcome, offer seat
- Biodata- name, age, sex, marital status, residence, address, telephone, NOK.......
- History of illness and details of progress
- Systemic review
- Physical examination performed
- Lab investigations and other investigations (special) ordered
- Make Differential diagnosis, followed by specific Diafnosis once results are (ready) confirmed
- Prescribe appropriate treatment

\section*{Summary of patient diagnosissteps}
- Give patient return date (TCA) for review
- If patient has acute condition, admission for close monitoring (observation) and review
- NB/ Dx of patient will change depending on the presenting $S / S$ each time he/she is reviewed
- As pt improves, discharge home
- NOTE: people are individuals, no two people are alike, some may have started treating themselves before coming for help from you
