                        <p>Nurses promote healthy nutrition to prevent disease, assist patients to recover from illness and surgery, and teach patients how to optimally manage chronic illness with healthy food choices. Healthy nutrition helps to prevent obesity and chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. By proactively encouraging healthy eating habits, nurses provide the tools for patients to maintain their health, knowing it is easier to stay healthy than to become healthy after disease sets in. When patients are recovering from illness or surgery, nurses use strategies to promote good nutrition even when a patient has a poor appetite or nausea. If a patient develops chronic disease, the nurse provides education about prescribed diets that can help manage the disease, such as a low carbohydrate diet for patients with diabetes or a low fat, low salt, low cholesterol diet for patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>
                        <p>Nurses also advocate for patients with conditions that can cause nutritional deficits. For example, a nurse may be the first to notice that a patient is having difficulty swallowing at mealtime and advocates for a swallow study to prevent aspiration. A nurse may also notice other psychosocial risk factors that place a patient at risk for poor nutrition in their home environment and make appropriate referrals to enhance their nutritional status. Nurses also administer alternative forms of nutrition, such as enteral (tube) feedings or parenteral (intravenous) feedings.</p>
                        <p>This chapter will review basic information about the digestive system, essential nutrients, nutritional guidelines, and then discuss the application of the nursing process to addressing patients' nutritional status.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Before discussing assessments and interventions related to promoting good nutrition, let's review the structure and function of the digestive system, essential nutrients, and nutritional guidelines.</p>
                        <h3>Digestive System</h3>
                        <p>The digestive system breaks down food and then absorbs nutrients into the bloodstream via the small intestine and large intestine. Because good health depends on good nutrition, any disorder affecting the functioning of the digestive system can significantly impact overall health and well-being and increase the risk of chronic health conditions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Structure and Function</h4>
                        <p>The gastrointestinal system (also referred to as the digestive system) is responsible for several functions, including digestion, absorption, and immune response. Digestion begins in the upper gastrointestinal tract at the mouth, where chewing of food occurs, called mastication. Mastication results in mechanical digestion when food is broken down into small chunks and swallowed. Masticated food is formed into a bolus as it moves toward the pharynx in the back of the throat and then into the esophagus. Coordinated muscle movements in the esophagus called peristalsis move the food bolus into the stomach where it is mixed with acidic gastric juices and further broken down into chyme through a chemical digestion process. As chyme is moved out of the stomach and into the duodenum of the small intestine, it is mixed with bile from the gallbladder and pancreatic enzymes from the pancreas for further digestion.</p>
                        <p>Absorption is a second gastrointestinal function. After chyme enters the small intestine, it comes into contact with tiny fingerlike projections along the inside of the intestine called villi. Villi increase the surface area of the small intestine and allow nutrients, such as protein, carbohydrates, fat, vitamins, and minerals, to absorb through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream. Absorption of nutrients is essential for metabolism to occur because nutrients fuel bodily functions and create energy. Peristalsis moves leftover liquid from the small intestine into the large intestine, where additional water and minerals are absorbed. Waste products are condensed into feces and excreted from the body through the anus. See Figure 14.1 for labeled parts of the gastrointestinal system.</p>
                        <p>In addition to digestion and absorption, the gastrointestinal system is also involved in immune function. Good bacteria in the stomach create a person's gut biome. Gut biome contributes to a person's immune response through antibody production in response to foreign materials, chemicals, bacteria, and other substances. For example, patients may develop Clostridium difficile (C diff) after taking antibiotics that kill these beneficial bacteria in the gut. Read additional details about our microbiome and immune response in the "Infection" chapter of this book.</p>

                        <h3>Essential Nutrients</h3>
                        <p>Nutrients from food and fluids are used by the body for growth, energy, and bodily processes. <strong>Essential nutrients</strong> refer to nutrients that are necessary for bodily functions but must come from dietary intake because the body is unable to synthesize them. Essential nutrients include vitamins, minerals, some amino acids, and some fatty acids. Essential nutrients can be further divided into macronutrients and micronutrients.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Macronutrients</h4>
                        <p><strong>Macronutrients</strong> make up most of a person's diet and provide energy, as well as essential nutrient intake. Macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. However, too many macronutrients without associated physical activity cause excess nutrition that can lead to obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and other chronic diseases. Too few macronutrients result in undernutrition, which contributes to nutrient deficiencies and malnourishment.</p>
                        
                        <h5>CARBOHYDRATES</h5>
                        <p><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> are sugars and starches and are an important energy source that provides 4 kcal/g of energy. <strong>Simple carbohydrates</strong> are small molecules (called monosaccharides or disaccharides) and break down quickly. As a result, simple carbohydrates are easily digested and absorbed into the bloodstream, so they raise blood glucose levels quickly. Examples of simple carbohydrates include table sugar, syrup, soda, and fruit juice. <strong>Complex carbohydrates</strong> are larger molecules (called polysaccharides) that break down more slowly, which causes slower release into the bloodstream and a slower increase in blood sugar over a longer period of time. Examples of complex carbohydrates include whole grains, beans, and vegetables.</p>
                        <p>Foods can also be categorized according to their <strong>glycemic index</strong>, a measure of how quickly glucose levels increase in the bloodstream after carbohydrates are consumed. The glycemic index was initially introduced as a way for people with diabetes mellitus to control their blood glucose levels. For example, processed foods, white bread, white rice, and white potatoes have a high glycemic index. They quickly raise blood glucose levels after being consumed and also cause the release of insulin, which can result in more hunger and overeating. However, foods such as fruit, green leafy vegetables, raw carrots, kidney beans, chickpeas, lentils, and bran breakfast cereals have a low glycemic index. These foods minimize blood sugar spikes and insulin release after eating, which leads to less hunger and overeating. Eating a diet of low glycemic foods has been linked to a decreased risk of obesity and diabetes mellitus. See Figure 14.2 for an image of the glycemic index of various foods.</p>

                        <h5>PROTEINS</h5>
                        <p><strong>Proteins</strong> are peptides and amino acids that provide 4 kcal/g of energy. Proteins are necessary for tissue repair and function, growth, energy, fluid balance, clotting, and the production of white blood cells. Protein status is also referred to as nitrogen balance. <strong>Nitrogen balance</strong> is consumed in dietary intake and excreted in the urine and feces. If the body excretes more nitrogen than it takes in through the diet, this is referred to as a negative nitrogen balance. Negative nitrogen balance is seen in patients with starvation or severe infection. Conversely, if the body takes in more nitrogen through the diet than what is excreted, this is referred to as a positive nitrogen balance. During positive nitrogen balance, excess protein is converted to fat tissue for storage.</p>
                        <p>Proteins are classified as complete, incomplete, or partially complete. <strong>Complete proteins</strong> must be ingested in the diet. They have enough amino acids to perform necessary bodily functions, such as growth and tissue maintenance. Examples of foods containing complete proteins are soy, quinoa, eggs, fish, meat, and dairy products. <strong>Incomplete proteins</strong> do not contain enough amino acids to sustain life. Examples of incomplete proteins include most plants, such as beans, peanut butter, seeds, grains, and grain products. Incomplete proteins must be combined with other types of proteins to add to amino acids and form complete protein combinations. For example, vegetarians must be careful to eat complementary proteins, such as grains and legumes, or nuts and seeds and legumes, to create complete protein combinations during their daily food intake. <strong>Partially complete proteins</strong> have enough amino acids to sustain life, but not enough for tissue growth and maintenance. Because of the similarities, most sources consider partially complete proteins to be in the same category as incomplete proteins. See Figure 14.3 for an image of protein-rich foods.</p>

                        </figure>

                        <h5>FATS</h5>
                        <p><strong>Fats</strong> consist of fatty acids and glycerol and are essential for tissue growth, insulation, energy, energy storage, and hormone production. Fats provide 9 kcal/g of energy. While some fat intake is necessary for energy and uptake of fat-soluble vitamins, excess fat intake contributes to heart disease and obesity. Due to its high-energy content, a little fat goes a long way.</p>
                        <p>Fats are classified as saturated, unsaturated, and trans fatty acids. <strong>Saturated fats</strong> come from animal products, such as butter and red meat (e.g., steak). Saturated fats are solid at room temperature. Recommended intake of saturated fats is less than 10% of daily calories because saturated fat raises cholesterol and contributes to heart disease.</p>
                        <p><strong>Unsaturated fats</strong> come from oils and plants, although chicken and fish also contain some unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats are healthier than saturated fats. Examples of unsaturated fats include olive oil, canola oil, avocados, almonds, and pumpkin seeds. Fats containing omega-3 fatty acids are considered polyunsaturated fats and help lower LDL cholesterol levels. Fish and other seafood are excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
                        <p><strong>Trans fats</strong> are fats that have been altered through a hydrogenation process, so they are not in their natural state. During the hydrogenated process, fat is changed to make it harder at room temperature and have a longer shelf life. Trans fats are found in processed foods, such as chips, crackers, and cookies, as well as in some margarines and salad dressings. Minimal trans fat intake is recommended because it increases cholesterol and contributes to heart disease.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Micronutrients</h4>
                        <p>Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals.</p>
                        
                        <h5>VITAMINS</h5>
                        <p>Vitamins are necessary for many bodily functions, including growth, development, healing, vision, and reproduction. Most vitamins are considered essential because they are not manufactured by the body and must be ingested in the diet. Vitamin D is also manufactured through exposure to sunlight.</p>

                        <h3>Nutritional Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>Nutritional guidelines are developed by governmental agencies to provide guidance to the population on how to best meet nutritional needs. These guidelines may vary by country. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine set the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for the United States and Canada. Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are a set of reference values used to plan and assess nutrient intakes of healthy people, including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Choose MyPlate Food Guide</h4>
                        <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues dietary guidelines for appropriate serving sizes of each food group and number of servings recommended each day. The "Choose MyPlate" food guide is an easy-to-understand visual representation of how a healthy plate of food should be divided based on food groups. See Figure 14.4 for a Choose MyPlate image. A little more than half of the plate should be grains and vegetables, with a focus on whole grains and a variety of vegetables. About one quarter of the plate should be fruits, with an emphasis on whole fruits. About one quarter of the plate should be protein, with an emphasis on consuming a variety of low-fat protein sources. All of these groups combined should make up no more than 85% of daily caloric intake based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Fats, oils, and added sugars are not included, but should make up no more than 15% of daily caloric intake. Foods should be selected that are as nutrient-dense as possible.</p>

                        <h4>Gender</h4>
                        <p>A person's gender affects their calorie and nutrient requirements. Males typically have higher calorie and protein needs related to increased muscle mass. Females typically require fewer calories to maintain their body weight due to a higher proportion of adipose (fat tissue) than muscle. Menstruating females also have higher iron requirements to offset losses that occur during menstruation.</p>

                        <h3>Factors Affecting Nutritional Status</h3>
                        <p>Many things that can cause altered nutrition, such as physiological factors, cultural and religious beliefs, economic resources, drug and nutrient disorders, surgery, altered metabolic states, alcohol and drug abuse, and psychological states.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Physiological Factors</h4>
                        <p>Nutritional intake is affected by several physiological factors. Appetite is controlled by the hypothalamus. The five senses, oral health, and gastrointestinal function all play a role in stimulation of appetite and nutrient absorption. Difficulty swallowing, called <strong>dysphagia</strong>, can make it dangerous for the patient to swallow food because it can result in pneumonia from aspiration of food into the lungs. Special soft diets or enteral or parenteral nutrition are typically prescribed for patients with dysphagia.</p>
                        <figure>
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0904-1.jpg" alt="A medical illustration of the human brain with an arrow pointing to the hypothalamus." class="content-image" style="max-width: 450px;">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Cultural and Religious Beliefs</h4>
                        <p>Cultural and religious beliefs often influence food selection and food intake. It is important for nurses to conduct a thorough patient assessment, including food preferences, to ensure adequate nutritional intake during hospitalization.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Economic Resources</h4>
                        <p>If a patient has inadequate financial resources, food security and food choices are often greatly impacted. Nurses refer at-risk patients to social workers and case managers for assistance in applying for social programs like Meals on Wheels.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Drug and Nutrient Interactions</h4>
                        <p>Some prescription drugs affect nutrient absorption. For example, some medications such as proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) alter the pH of stomach acid, resulting in poor absorption of nutrients. Other medications, such as opioids, often decrease a person's appetite or cause nausea.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Surgery</h4>
                        <p>Surgery can affect a patient's nutritional status due to several factors. Food and drink are typically withheld for a period of time prior to surgery to prevent aspiration. Anesthesia and pain medication slow peristalsis. The stress response from surgery increases metabolic demands and can elevate blood glucose levels.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Altered Metabolic States</h4>
                        <p>Metabolic demands impact nutrient intake. Disease states, such as cancer, hyperthyroidism, and AIDS, can increase metabolism and require an increased amount of nutrients. Other diseases like diabetes mellitus cause complications with nutrient absorption due to insulin.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Alcohol and Drug Abuse</h4>
                        <p>Alcohol and drug abuse can affect nutritional status. Alcohol is calorie-dense and nutrient-poor. Stimulants, such as methamphetamine and cocaine abuse, cause an increased metabolic rate and decreased appetite and contribute to weight loss and malnourishment.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Psychological State</h4>
                        <p>Various psychological states have a direct effect on appetite and a patient's desire to eat. Acute and chronic stress can increase or decrease appetite. Depression can also cause loss of appetite or overeating.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>A thorough nutritional assessment provides information about an individual's nutritional status, as well as risk factors for nutritional imbalances. Assessment starts with reviewing the patient's medical record and initiating a patient interview, followed by a physical exam and review of lab and diagnostic test results.</p>
                        <h4>Objective Assessment</h4>
                        <p>Objective assessment data is information derived from direct observation by the nurse. The nurse begins the physical examination by making general observations about the patient's status. A well-nourished patient has normal skin color and hair texture for their ethnicity, healthy nails, a BMI within normal range according to their height, and appears energetic. Height and weight in adults are often compared to a Body Mass Index (BMI) graph.</p>

                        <h4>DIAGNOSTIC AND LAB WORK</h4>
                        <p>Common lab tests include hemoglobin (hgb), hematocrit (HCT), white blood cells (WBC), albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin. Low albumin levels can indicate prolonged protein deficiency, whereas prealbumin levels reflect protein intake over the previous few weeks. Various diagnostic tests may be ordered by the health care provider based on the patient's medical conditions and circumstances, such as a swallow study, an abdominal X-ray, or a CT scan.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Life Span and Cultural Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Nutritional needs vary across the lifespan. Newborns and infants require nutrient-dense food for rapid growth, with breast milk being ideal. Children and adolescents continue to have high demands for growth, but diet quality often decreases. Adults' metabolic rates decrease, and poor habits can lead to chronic disease. Pregnancy and lactation increase nutritional requirements. Older adults have lower calorie needs but higher nutrient needs and face challenges like decreased thirst, chronic disease, and social isolation affecting their intake.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>NANDA-I nursing diagnoses related to nutrition include <em>Imbalanced Nutrition: Less than Body Requirements, Overweight, Obesity, Risk for Overweight, Readiness for Enhanced Nutrition</em>, and <em>Impaired Swallowing</em>.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>An overall goal related to nutritional imbalances is, "The patient will weigh within normal range for their height and age." A sample SMART goal is, "The patient will select three dietary modifications to meet their long-term health goals using USDA MyPlate guidelines by discharge."</p>

                        <h3>Planning Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Interventions are specific to the alteration in nutritional status and should accommodate the patient's cultural and religious beliefs. Nurses may plan interventions related to prescribed special diets, enteral nutrition, or parenteral nutrition.</p>

                        <p><strong>Enteral nutrition</strong> is administered directly to a patient's gastrointestinal tract while bypassing chewing and swallowing. Examples of enteral tube access are nasogastric tubes (NG), orogastric tubes (OG), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes, or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (PEJ) tubes. See Figure 14.12 for an illustration of common enteral tube placement. Safety considerations for nurses include verifying tube placement, preventing aspiration by elevating the head of the bed, and monitoring for signs of intolerance such as bloating, nausea, or diarrhea.</p>

                        <h4>Parenteral Nutrition</h4>
                        <p><strong>Parenteral nutrition</strong> is nutrition delivered through a central intravenous line to patients who require nutritional supplementation but are not candidates for enteral nutrition. Parenteral nutrition is an intravenous solution containing glucose, amino acids, minerals, electrolytes, and vitamins. A lipid solution is typically given in a separate infusion in a hospital setting. This combination of solutions is called total parenteral nutrition because it supplies complete nutritional support.</p>

                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>It is always important to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions implemented. For example, for <em>Imbalanced Nutrition: Less than Body Requirements</em>, improvement is indicated by stable or increasing weight, sufficient calorie intake, and improved energy.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Curtis is a 47-year-old patient admitted to the hospital with increased weakness, fatigue, and dehydration. His skin appears dry, and tenting occurs when skin turgor is evaluated. He is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment for multiple myeloma and has experienced weight loss of 10 pounds within the last two weeks. He describes that "nothing tastes good," and he feels as if there is "metal taste in his mouth." When he does eat small meals, he reports that he is often nauseous. The patient's serum protein level is 3.1 g/dL.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse identifies that the patient is experiencing signs of imbalanced nutrition with the signs of increased weakness, fatigue, and signs of dehydration such as skin tenting and dryness. The patient has demonstrated a significant weight loss over the past two weeks and reports "nothing tastes good" and "a metal taste in the mouth." The patient also reports nausea after eating. His serum protein level reflects signs of malnutrition.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Imbalanced Nutrition: Less Than Body Requirements r/t insufficient dietary intake as manifested by weight loss of 10 pounds in the last two weeks, skin tenting and dryness, reports of "nothing tastes good," and serum protein of 3.1 g/dL.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will demonstrate improvement in nutrition intake.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mr. Curtis will eat 50% of offered meals and demonstrate dietary tolerance within 24 hours.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will validate the patient's feelings regarding his current symptoms and provide emotional support. The nurse will determine the time of day when the patient's appetite is highest and offer the highest calorie meal at that time. The nurse will offer high-calorie protein shakes to the patient at frequent intervals. The nurse will assess the patient's food preferences and ensure that small frequent meals are offered that incorporate those preferences. The nurse will also encourage the use of plastic utensils and encourage the patient to eat mints or chew gum to minimize the metallic taste in the mouth.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>Twenty-four hours later, the nurse evaluates Mr. Curtis and finds he is able to consume 50% of breakfast with his preferred dietary items. Planned interventions will continue and the nurse plan to reevaluate his progress the following day.</p>
