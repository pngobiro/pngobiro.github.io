                        <p>No matter who we are or where we come from, every person belongs to a culture. The impact of culture on a person's health is profound because it affects many health beliefs, such as perceived causes of illness, ways to prevent illness, and acceptance of medical treatments. Culturally responsive care integrates these cultural beliefs into an individual's health care. Culturally responsive care is intentional and promotes trust and rapport with patients. At its heart, culturally responsive care is patient-centered care. The American Nurses Association (ANA) states, "The art of nursing is demonstrated by unconditionally accepting the humanity of others, respecting their need for dignity and worth, while providing compassionate, comforting care."</p>
                        <p>Nurses provide holistic care when incorporating their patients' physical, mental, spiritual, cultural, and social needs into their health care (referred to as holism). As a nursing student, you are undertaking a journey of developing cultural competency with an attitude of cultural humility as you learn how to provide holistic care to your patients. Cultural competency is a lifelong process of applying evidence-based nursing in agreement with the cultural values, beliefs, worldview, and practices of patients to produce improved patient outcomes. Cultural humility is defined by the American Nurses Association as, "A humble and respectful attitude toward individuals of other cultures that pushes one to challenge their own cultural biases, realize they cannot know everything about other cultures, and approach learning about other cultures as a life-long goal and process." The bottom line is you will improve the quality of your nursing care by understanding, respecting, and responding to a patient's experiences, values, beliefs, and preferences.</p>
                        <p>This chapter will focus on developing culturally competency and cultural humility and providing culturally responsive care.</p>

                        <p>Let's begin the journey of developing cultural competency by exploring basic concepts related to culture.</p>
                        <h3>Culture and Subculture</h3>
                        <p>Culture is a set of beliefs, attitudes, and practices shared by a group of people or community that is accepted, followed, and passed down to other members of the group. The word "culture" may at times be interchanged with terms such as ethnicity, nationality, or race. See Figure 3.1 for an illustration depicting culture by various nationalities. Cultural beliefs and practices bind group or community members together and help form a cohesive identity. Culture has an enduring influence on a person's view of the world, expressed through language and communication patterns, family connections and kinship, religion, cuisine, dress, and other customs and rituals. Culture is not static but is dynamic and ever-changing; it changes as members come into contact with beliefs from other cultures. For example, sushi is a traditional Asian dish that has become popular in America in recent years.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0165-1.jpg" alt="A circle of diverse people holding hands around a globe, representing different cultures." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Nurses and other health care team members are impacted by their own personal cultural beliefs. For example, a commonly held belief in American health care is the importance of timeliness; medications are administered at specifically scheduled times, and appearing for appointments on time is considered crucial.</p>
                        <p>Most cultural beliefs are a combination of beliefs, values, and habits that have been passed down through family members and authority figures. The first step in developing cultural competence is to become aware of your own cultural beliefs, attitudes, and practices.</p>
                        <p>Nurses should also be aware of subcultures. A subculture is a smaller group of people within a culture, often based on a person's occupation, hobbies, interests, or place of origin. People belonging to a subculture may identify with some, but not all, aspects of their larger "parent" culture. Members of the subculture share beliefs and commonalities that set them apart and do not always conform with those of the larger culture. See Table 3.2a for examples of subcultures.</p>

                        <p>Culture is much more than a person's nationality or ethnicity. Culture can be expressed in a multitude of ways, including the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Language(s) spoken</li>
                            <li>Religion and spiritual beliefs</li>
                            <li>Gender identity</li>
                            <li>Socioeconomic status</li>
                            <li>Age</li>
                            <li>Sexual orientation</li>
                            <li>Geography</li>
                            <li>Educational background</li>
                            <li>Life experiences</li>
                            <li>Living situation</li>
                            <li>Employment status</li>
                            <li>Immigration status</li>
                            <li>Ability/Disability</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>People typically belong to more than one culture simultaneously. These cultures overlap, intersect, and are woven together to create a person's cultural identity. In other words, the many ways in which a person expresses their cultural identity are not separated, but are closely intertwined, referred to as intersectionality.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Assimilation</h3>
                        <p>Assimilation is the process of adopting or conforming to the practices, habits, and norms of a cultural group. As a result, the person gradually takes on a new cultural identity and may lose their original identity in the process. An example of assimilation is a newly graduated nurse, who after several months of orientation on the hospital unit, offers assistance to a colleague who is busy. The new nurse has developed self-confidence in the role and has developed an understanding that helping others is a norm for the nurses on that unit.</p>
                        <p>Assimilation is not always voluntary, however, and may become a source of distress. There are historic examples of involuntary assimilation in many countries. For example, in the past, authorities in the United States and Canadian governments required indigenous children to attend boarding schools, separated them from their families, and punished them for speaking their native language.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cultural Values and Beliefs</h3>
                        <p>Culture provides an important source of values and comfort for patients, families, and communities. Think of culture as a thread that is woven through a person's world and impacts one's choices, perspectives, and way of life. It plays a role in all of a person's life events and threads its way through the development of one's self-concept, sexuality, and spirituality. It affects lifelong nutritional habits, as well as coping strategies with death and dying.</p>
                        <p>Culture influences how a patient interprets "good" health, as well as their perspectives on illness and the causes of illness. The manner in which pain is expressed is also shaped by a person's culture. See Table 3.2b for additional examples of how a person's culture impacts common values and beliefs regarding family patterns, communication patterns, space orientation, time orientation, and nutritional patterns. As you read Table 3.2b, take a moment to reflect on your own cultural background and your personally held beliefs for each of these concepts.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Diversity and Cultural Humility</h3>
                        <p>Cultural diversity is a term used to describe cultural differences among people. See Figure 3.2 for artwork depicting diversity. While it is useful to be aware of specific traits of a culture or subculture, it is just as important to understand that each individual is unique and there are always variations in beliefs among individuals within a culture. Nurses should, therefore, refrain from making assumptions about the values and beliefs of members of specific cultural groups. Instead, a better approach is recognizing that culture is not a static, uniform characteristic but instead realizing there is diversity within every culture and in every person. The American Nurses Association (ANA) defines cultural humility as, "A humble and respectful attitude toward individuals of other cultures that pushes one to challenge their own cultural biases, realize they cannot possibly know everything about other cultures, and approach learning about other cultures as a lifelong goal and process."</p>
                        <p>Current demographics in the United States reveal that the population is predominantly white. People who were born in another country, but now live in the United States, comprise approximately 14% of the nation's total population. However, these demographics are rapidly changing. The United States Census Bureau projects that more than 50 percent of Americans will belong to a minority group by 2060. With an increasingly diverse population to care for, it is imperative for nurses to integrate culturally responsive care into their nursing practice. Creative a culturally responsive environment is discussed in a later subsection of this chapter.</p>

                        <h3>Concepts Related to Culture</h3>
                        <p>There are additional concepts related to culture that can impact a nurse's ability to provide culturally responsive care, including stereotyping, ethnocentrism, discrimination, prejudice, and bias. See Table 3.2c for definitions and examples of these concepts.</p>

                        <p>Race is a socially constructed idea because there are no true genetically- or biologically-distinct races. Humans are not biologically different from each other. Racism presumes that races are distinct from one another, and there is a hierarchy to race, implying that races are unequal. Ernest Grant, president of the American Nurses Association (ANA), recently declared that nurses are obligated "to speak up against racism, discrimination, and injustice. This is non-negotiable." As frontline health care providers, nurses have an obligation to recognize the impact of racism on their patients and the communities they serve.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity</h3>
                        <p>Culture can exert a powerful influence on a person's sexual orientation and gender expression. Sexual orientation refers to a person's physical and emotional interest or desire for others. Sexual orientation is on a continuum and is manifested in one's self-identity and behaviors. The acronym LGBTQ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning in reference to sexual orientation. (A "+" is sometimes added after LGBTQ to capture additional orientations). See Figure 3.3 for an image of participants in a LGBTQ rally in Dublin. Historically, individuals within the LGBTQ community have experienced discrimination and prejudice from health care providers and avoided or delayed health care due to these negative experiences. Despite increased recognition of this group of people in recent years, members of the LGBTQ community continue to experience significant health disparities. Persistent cultural bias and stigmatization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBTQ) people have also been shown to contribute to higher rates of substance abuse and suicide rates in this population.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Gender identity refers to a person's inner sensibility that they are a man, a woman, or perhaps neither. Cisgender is the term used to describe a person whose identity matches their sex assigned at birth. To the extent that a person's gender identity does not conform with the sex assigned to them at birth, they may identify as transgender or as gender nonbinary. Transgender people, like cisgender people, "may be sexually oriented toward men, women, both sexes, or neither sex." Gender expression refers to a person's outward demonstration of gender in relation to societal norms, such as in style of dress, hairstyle, or other mannerisms. Sharing pronouns as part of a basic introduction to a patient can assist a transgender patient to feel secure sharing their pronouns in a health care setting. Asking a patient for their pronoun (he, she, they, ze, etc.) is considered part of a nursing assessment.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Related Ethical Considerations</h3>
                        <p>Justice, a principle and moral obligation to act on the basis of equality and equity, is a standard linked to fairness for all in society. The ANA states this obligation guarantees not only basic rights (respect, human dignity, autonomy, security, and safety) but also fairness in all operations of societal structures. This includes care being delivered with fairness, rightness, correctness, unbiasedness, and inclusiveness while being based on well-founded reason and evidence.</p>
                        <p>Social justice is related to respect, equity, and inclusion. The ANA defines social justice as equal rights, equal treatment, and equitable opportunities for all. The ANA further states, "Nurses need to model the profession's commitment to social justice and health through actions and advocacy to address the social determinants of health and promote well-being in all settings within society." Social determinants of health are nonmedical factors that influence health outcomes, including conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider sets of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. Health outcomes impacted by social determinants of health are referred to as health disparities. Health disparities are further discussed in a subsection later in this chapter.</p>

                        <p>The Patient's Bill of Rights is an evolving document related to providing culturally competent care. In 1973 the American Hospital Association (AHA) adopted the Patient's Bill of Rights. See the following box to review the original Patient's Bill of Rights. The bill has since been updated, revised, and adapted for use throughout the world in all health care settings. There are different versions of the bill, but, in general, it safeguards a patient's right to accurate and complete information, fair treatment, and self-determination when making health care decisions. Patients should expect to be treated with sensitivity and dignity and with respect for their cultural values. While the Patient's Bill of Rights extends beyond the scope of cultural considerations, its basic principles underscore the importance of cultural competency when caring for people.</p>

In case of such refusal, the patient is entitled to other appropriate care and services that the hospital provides or transfer to another hospital. The hospital should notify patients of any policy that might affect patient choice within the institution.</li>
                                <li>The patient has the right to have an advance directive (such as a living will, health care proxy, or durable power of attorney for health care) concerning treatment or designating a surrogate decision-maker with the expectation that the hospital will honor the intent of that directive to the extent permitted by law and hospital policy. Health care institutions must advise patients of their rights under state law and hospital policy to make informed medical choices, ask if the patient has an advance directive, and include that information in patient records. The patient has the right to timely information about hospital policy that may limit its ability to implement fully a legally valid advance directive.</li>

The hospital must provide evaluation, service, and/or referral as indicated by the urgency of the case. When medically appropriate and legally permissible, or when a patient has so requested, a patient may be transferred to another facility. The institution to which the patient is to be transferred must first have accepted the patient for transfer.

                                <li>The patient has the right to ask and be informed of the existence of business relationships among the hospital, educational institutions, other health care providers, or payers that may influence the patient's treatment and care.</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The freedom to express one's cultural beliefs is a fundamental right of all people. Nurses realize that people speak, behave, and act in many different ways due to the influential role that culture plays in their lives and their view of the world. Cultural competence is a lifelong process of applying evidence-based nursing in agreement with the cultural values, beliefs, worldview, and practices of patients to produce improved patient outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Culturally-competent care requires nurses to combine their knowledge and skills with awareness, curiosity, and sensitivity about their patients' cultural beliefs. It takes motivation, time, and practice to develop cultural competence, and it will evolve throughout your nursing career. Culturally competent nurses have the power to improve the quality of care leading to better health outcomes for culturally diverse patients. Nurses who accept and uphold the cultural values and beliefs of their patients are more likely to develop supportive and trusting relationships with their patients. In turn, this opens the way for optimal disease and injury prevention and leads towards positive health outcomes for all patients.</p>
                        <p>The roots of providing culturally-competent care are based on the original transcultural nursing theory developed by Dr. Madeleine Leininger. Transcultural nursing incorporates cultural beliefs and practices of individuals to help them maintain and regain health or to face death in a meaningful way. See Figure 3.4 for an image of Dr. Leininger. Read more about transcultural nursing theory in the following box.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Madeleine Leininger and the Transcultural Nursing Theory</h4>
                            <p>Dr. Madeleine Leininger (1925-2012) founded the transcultural nursing theory. She was the first professional nurse to obtain a PhD in anthropology. She combined the "culture" concept from anthropology with the "care" concept from nursing and reformulated these concepts into "culture care."</p>
                            <p>In the mid-1950s, no cultural knowledge base existed to guide nursing decisions or understand cultural behaviors as a way of providing therapeutic care. Leininger wrote the first books in the field and coined the term "culturally congruent care." She developed and taught the first transcultural nursing course in 1966, and master's and doctoral programs in transcultural nursing were launched shortly after. Dr. Leininger was honored as a Living Legend of the American Academy of Nursing in 1998.</p>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <p>Nurses have an ethical and moral obligation to provide culturally competent care to the patients they serve. The "Respectful and Equitable Practice" Standard of Professional Performance set by the American Nurses Association (ANA) states that nurses must practice with cultural humility and inclusiveness. The ANA Code of Ethics also states that the nurse should collaborate with other health professionals, as well as the public, to protect human rights, fight discriminatory practices, and reduce disparities. Additionally, the ANA Code of Ethics also states that nurses "are expected to be aware of their own cultural identifications in order to control their personal biases that may interfere with the therapeutic relationship. Self-awareness involves not only examining one's culture but also examining perceptions and assumptions about the patient's culture...nurses should possess knowledge and understanding how oppression, racism, discrimination, and stereotyping affect them personally and in their work."</p>
                        <p>Developing cultural competence begins in nursing school. Culture is an integral part of life, but its impact is often implicit. It is easy to assume that others share the same cultural values that you do, but each individual has their own beliefs, values, and preferences. Begin the examination of your own cultural beliefs and feelings by answering the questions below.</p>

                        <h3>The Process of Developing Cultural Competence</h3>
                        <p>Dr. Josephine Campinha-Bacote is an influential nursing theorist and researcher who developed a model of cultural competence. The model asserts there are specific characteristics that a nurse becoming culturally competent possesses, including cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, cultural skill, and cultural encounters.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cultural awareness</strong> is a deliberate, cognitive process in which health care providers become appreciative and sensitive to the values, beliefs, attitudes, practices, and problem-solving strategies of a patient's culture. To become culturally aware, the nurse must undergo reflective exploration of personal cultural values while also becoming conscious of the cultural practices of others. In addition to reflecting on one's own cultural values, the culturally competent nurse seeks to reverse harmful prejudices, ethnocentric views, and attitudes they have. Cultural awareness goes beyond a simple awareness of the existence of other cultures and involves an interest, curiosity, and appreciation of other cultures. Although cultural diversity training is typically a requirement for health care professionals, <strong>cultural desire</strong> refers to the intrinsic motivation and commitment on the part of a nurse to develop cultural awareness and cultural competency.</p>
                        <p>Acquiring <strong>cultural knowledge</strong> is another important step towards becoming a culturally competent nurse. Cultural knowledge refers to seeking information about cultural health beliefs and values to understand patients' world views. To acquire cultural knowledge, the nurse actively seeks information about other cultures, including common practices, beliefs, values, and customs, particularly for those cultures that are prevalent within the communities they serve. Cultural knowledge also includes understanding the historical backgrounds of culturally diverse groups in society, as well as physiological variations and the incidence of certain health conditions in culturally diverse groups. Cultural knowledge is best obtained through cultural encounters with patients from diverse backgrounds to learn about individual variations that occur within cultural groups and to prevent stereotyping.</p>
                        <p>While obtaining cultural knowledge, it is important to demonstrate <strong>cultural sensitivity</strong>. Cultural sensitivity means being tolerant and accepting of cultural practices and beliefs of people. Cultural sensitivity is demonstrated when the nurse conveys nonjudgmental interest and respect through words and action and an understanding that some health care treatments may conflict with a person's cultural beliefs. Cultural sensitivity also implies a consciousness of the damaging effects of stereotyping, prejudice, or biases on patients and their well-being. Nurses who fail to act with cultural sensitivity may be viewed as uncaring or inconsiderate, causing a breakdown in trust for the patient and their family members. When a patient experiences nursing care that contradicts with their cultural beliefs, they may experience moral or ethical conflict, nonadherence, or emotional distress.</p>
                        <p>Cultural desire, awareness, sensitivity, and knowledge are the building blocks for developing <strong>cultural skill</strong>. Cultural skill is reflected by the nurse's ability to gather and synthesize relevant cultural information about their patients while planning care and using culturally sensitive communication skills. Nurses with cultural skill provide care consistent with their patients' cultural needs and deliberately take steps to secure a safe health care environment that is free of discrimination or intolerance. For example, a culturally skilled nurse will make space and seating available within a patient's hospital room for accompanying family members when this support is valued by the patient.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cultural encounters</strong> is a process where the nurse directly engages in face-to-face cultural interactions and other types of encounters with clients from culturally diverse backgrounds in order to modify existing beliefs about a cultural group and to prevent possible stereotyping.</p>
                        <p>By developing the characteristics of cultural awareness, cultural knowledge, cultural skill, and cultural encounters, a nurse develops cultural competence.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Despite decades of promoting cultural competent care and the Patient's Bill of Rights, disparities in health care continue. Vulnerable populations continue to experience increased prevalence and burden of diseases, as well as problems accessing quality health care. In 2003 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care, sharing evidence that "bias, prejudice, and stereotyping on the part of health care providers may contribute to differences in care." The health care system in the United States was shaped by the values and beliefs of mainstream white culture and originally designed to primarily serve English-speaking patients with financial resources. In addition, most health care professionals in the United States are members of the white culture and medical treatments tend to arise from that perspective.</p>
                        <p>The term <strong>health disparities</strong> describes the differences in health outcomes that result from social determinants of health. <strong>Social determinants of health</strong> are conditions in the environment where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes. Resources that enhance quality of life can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. Examples of resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy foods, local emergency/health services, and environments free of life-threatening toxins.</p>
                        <p>Vulnerable populations experience increased prevalence and burden of diseases, as well as problems accessing quality health care because of social determinants of health. Health disparities negatively impact groups of people based on their ethnicity, gender, age, mental health, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, geographic location, or other characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion. A related term is <strong>health care disparity</strong> that refers to differences in access to health care and insurance coverage. Health disparities and health care disparities can lead to decreased quality of life, increased personal costs, and lower life expectancy. More broadly, these disparities also translate to greater societal costs, such as the financial burden of uncontrolled chronic illnesses.</p>
                        <p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) releases an annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report that provides a comprehensive overview of the quality of health care received by the general U.S. population and disparities in care experienced by different racial and socioeconomic groups. Quality is described in terms of patient safety, person-centered care, care coordination, effective treatment, healthy living, and care affordability. Although access to health care and quality have improved since 2000 in the wake of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the 2019 report shows continued disparities, especially for poor and uninsured populations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For about 40% of quality measures, Blacks, African Americans, and Alaska Natives received worse care than Whites. For more than one third of quality measures, Hispanics received worse care than Whites.</li>
                            <li>For nearly a quarter of quality measures, residents of large metropolitan areas received worse care than residents of suburban areas. For one third of quality measures, residents of rural areas received worse care than residents of suburban areas.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are several initiatives and agencies designed to combat the problem of health disparities in the United States. See Table 3.5 for a list of hyperlinks to available resources to combat health disparities.</p>

                            <p>In 2014 the water system in Flint, Michigan, was discovered to be contaminated with lead. The city's children were found to have perilously elevated lead levels. Children from poor households were most affected by the crisis. Lead is a dangerous neurotoxin. Elevated lead levels are linked to slowed physical development; low IQ; problems with cognition, attention, and memory; and learning disabilities.</p>
                            <p>In Flint approximately 150 local nurses and nursing students answered the call, organizing and arranging educational seminars, as well as setting up lead testing clinics to determine who had been affected by the water contamination. A nursing student involved in the effort told CBS Detroit that this situation has illustrated that "the need for health care, the need for nursing, goes way outside the hospital walls." See Figure 3.5 for an image of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.</p>

These interventions will be further discussed in the following sections. On the other hand, a lack of culturally responsive care potentially contributes to miscommunication between the patient and the nurse. The patient may experience distress or loss of trust in the nurse or the health care system as a whole and may not adhere to prescribed treatments. Nurses are uniquely positioned to directly impact patient outcomes as we become more aware of unacceptable health disparities and work together to overcome them.</p>

                        <p>Providing culturally responsive care integrates an individual's cultural beliefs into their health care. Begin by conveying cultural sensitivity to patients and their family members with these suggestions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Set the stage by introducing yourself by name and role when meeting the patient and their family for the first time. Until you know differently, address the patient formally by using their title and last name. Ask the patient how they wish to be addressed and record this in the patient's chart. Respectfully acknowledge any family members and visitors at the patient's bedside.</li>
                            <li>Begin by standing or sitting at least arm's length from the patient.</li>
                            <li>Observe the patient and family members in regards to eye contact, space orientation, touch, and other nonverbal communication behaviors and follow their lead.</li>
                            <li>Make note of the language the patient prefers to use and record this in the patient's chart. If English is not the patient's primary language, determine if a medical interpreter is required before proceeding with interview questions. See the box below for guidelines in using a medical interpreter.</li>
                            <li>Use inclusive language that is culturally sensitive and appropriate. For example, do not refer to someone as "wheelchair bound"; instead say "a person who uses a wheelchair."</li>
                            <li>Be open and honest about the extent of your knowledge of their culture. It is acceptable to politely ask questions about their beliefs and seek clarification to avoid misunderstandings.</li>
                            <li>Adopt a nonjudgmental approach and show respect for the patient's cultural beliefs, values, and practices. It is possible that you may not agree with a patient's cultural expressions, but it is imperative that the patient's rights are upheld. As long as the expressions are not unsafe for the patient or others, the nurse should attempt to integrate them into their care.</li>
                            <li>Assure the patient that their cultural considerations are a priority their care.</li>
                        </ul>

                             <h4 class="callout-title">Guidelines for Using a Medical Interpreter</h4>
                            <p>When caring for a patient whose primary language is not English and they have a limited ability to speak, read, write, or understand the English language, seek the services of a trained medical interpreter. Health care facilities are mandated by The Joint Commission to provide qualified medical interpreters. Use of a trained medical interpreter is linked to fewer communication errors, shorter hospital stays, reduced 30-day readmission rates, and improved patient satisfaction.</p>
                            <p>Refrain from asking a family member to act as an interpreter. The patient may withhold sensitive information from them, or family members may possibly edit or change the information provided. Unfamiliarity with medical terminology can also cause misunderstanding and errors.</p>
                            <p>Medical interpreters may be on-site or available by videoconferencing or telephone. The nurse should also consider coordinating patient and family member conversations with other health care team members to streamline communication, while being aware of cultural implications such who can discuss what health care topics and who makes the decisions. When possible, obtain a medical interpreter of the same gender as the patient to prevent potential embarrassment if a sensitive matter is being discussed.</p>
                            <p>Guidelines for working with a medical interpreter:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Allow extra time for the interview or conversation with the patient.</li>
                                <li>Whenever possible, meet with the interpreter beforehand to provide background.</li>

                        <p>After establishing a culturally sensitive environment, nurses should incorporate a cultural assessment when caring for all patients. There are many assessment guides used for patient interviews that are adaptable to a variety of health care settings and are designed to facilitate understanding and communication. The Four Cs of Culture model is an example of a quick cultural assessment tool that asks questions about what the patient Considers to be a problem, the Cause of the problem, how they are Coping with the problem, and how Concerned they are about the problem. See the following box for examples of sample answers to the four Cs assessment.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>After establishing a culturally sensitive environment and performing a cultural assessment, nurses and nursing students can continue to promote culturally responsive care. Culturally responsive care includes creating a culturally safe environment, using cultural negotiation, and considering the impact of culture on patients' time orientation, space orientation, eye contact, and food choices.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Culturally Safe Environment</h3>
                        <p>A primary responsibility of the nurse is to ensure the environment is culturally safe for the patient. A culturally safe environment is a safe space for patients to interact with the nurse, without judgment or discrimination, where the patient is free to express their cultural beliefs, values, and identity. This responsibility belongs to both the individual nurse and also to the larger health care organization.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Cultural Negotiation</h3>
                        <p>Many aspects of nursing care are influenced by the patient's cultural beliefs, as well as the beliefs of the health care culture. For example, the health care culture in the United States places great importance on punctuality for medical appointments, yet a patient may belong to a culture that views "being on time" as relative. In some cultures, time is determined simply by whether it is day or night or time to wake up, eat, or sleep. Making allowances or accommodations for these aspects of a patient's culture is instrumental in fostering the nurse-patient relationship. This accommodation is referred to as cultural negotiation. See Figure 3.6 for an image illustrating cultural negotiation. During cultural negotiation, both the patient and nurse seek a mutually acceptable way to deal with competing interests of nursing care, prescribed medical care, and the patient's cultural needs. Cultural negotiation is reciprocal and collaborative. When a patient's cultural needs do not significantly or adversely affect their treatment plan, their cultural needs should be accommodated when feasible.</p>
                        <p>As an example, think about the previous example of a patient for whom a fixed schedule is at odds with their cultural views. Instead of teaching the patient to take a daily medication at a scheduled time, the nurse could explain that the patient should take the medication every day when he gets up. Another example of cultural negotiation is illustrated by a scenario in which the nurse is preparing a patient for a surgical procedure. As the nurse goes over the preoperative checklist, the nurse asks the patient to remove her head covering (hijab). The nurse is aware that personal items should be removed before surgery; however, the patient wishes to keep on the hijab. As an act of cultural negotiation and respect for the patient's cultural beliefs, the nurse makes arrangements with the surgical team to keep the patient's hijab in place for the surgical procedure and covering the patient's hijab with a surgical cap.</p>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>Decision-Making</h3>
                        <p>Health care culture in the United States mirrors cultural norms of the country, with an emphasis on individuality, personal freedom, and self-determination. This perspective may conflict with a patient whose cultural background values group decision-making and decisions made to benefit the group, not necessarily the individual. As an example, in the 2019 film The Farewell, a Chinese-American family decides to not tell the family matriarch she is dying of cancer and only has a few months left to live. The family keeps this secret from the woman in the belief that the family should bear the emotional burden of this knowledge, which is a collectivistic viewpoint in contrast to American individualistic viewpoint.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Space Orientation</h3>
                        <p>The amount of space that a person surrounds themselves with to feel comfortable is influenced by culture. (Read more about space orientation in the "Communication" chapter.) See Figure 3.7 for an image illustrating space orientation. For example, for some people, it would feel awkward to stand four inches away from another person while holding a social conversation, but for others a small personal space is expected when conversing with another. There are times when a nurse must enter a patient's intimate or personal space, which can cause emotional distress for some patients. The nurse should always ask for permission before entering a patient's personal space and explain why and what is about to happen.</p>
                        <p>Patients may also be concerned about their modesty or being exposed. A patient may deal with the violation of their space by removing themselves from the situation, pulling away, or closing their eyes. The nurse should recognize these cues for what they are, an expression of cultural preference, and allow the patient to assume a position or distance that is comfortable for them.</p>
                        <p>Similar to cultural influences on personal space, touch is also culturally determined. This has implications for nurses because it may be inappropriate for a male nurse to provide care for a female patient and vice versa. In some cultures, it is also considered rude to touch a person's head without permission.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0204-1.jpg" alt="A diagram showing different zones of personal space: intimate, personal, social, and public." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>Eye Contact</h3>
                        <p>Eye contact is also a culturally mediated behavior. See Figure 3.8 for an image of eye contact. In the United States, direct eye contact is valued when communicating with others, but in some cultures, direct eye contact is interpreted as being rude or bold. Rather than making direct eye contact, a patient may avert their eyes or look down at the floor to show deference and respect to the person who is speaking. The nurse should notice these cultural cues from the patient and mirror the patient's behaviors when possible.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0205-1.jpg" alt="A close-up image of a human eye, representing eye contact." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h3>Food Choices</h3>
                        <p>Culture plays a meaningful role in the dietary practices and food choices of many people. Food is used to celebrate life events and holidays. Most cultures have staple foods, such as bread, pasta, or rice and particular ways of preparing foods. See Figure 3.9 for an image of various food choices. Special foods are prepared to heal and to cure or to demonstrate kinship, caring, and love. For example, in the United States, chicken noodle soup is often prepared and provided to family members who are ill.</p>
                        <p>Conversely, certain foods and beverages (such as meat and alcohol) are forbidden in some cultures. Nurses should accommodate or negotiate dietary requests of their patients, knowing that food holds such an important meaning to many people.</p>

                        <h3>Summary</h3>
                        <p>In summary, there are several steps in the journey of becoming a culturally competent nurse with cultural humility who provides culturally responsive care to patients. As you continue in your journey of developing cultural competency, keep the summarized points in the following box in mind.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mrs. Rosas is a 76-year-old patient admitted to the cardiology floor with an exacerbation of congestive heart failure. The patient's primary language is Spanish, and she has a limited understanding of English. The patient's daughter reports that the patient has been experiencing increased swelling in her ankles and increased shortness of breath over the last three weeks. Her daughter also reports that the patient has noted unexplained weight gain. During the admission assessment the nurse attempts to collect additional information related to current symptoms, diet, and history. The patient nods in response to questions and converses quietly in Spanish with her daughter.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse notes that the patient does not respond to questions appropriately and is unable to converse in English. She defers to her daughter to provide interpretation of questions and relay information.</p>
                        <p>Based on the assessment information that has been gathered, the following nursing care plan is created for Mrs. Rosas.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> Impaired Verbal Communication related to cultural incongruence as evidenced by inability to speak the language of the caregiver.</p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will use effective communication techniques.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mrs. Rosas will utilize interpreter services in order to receive information and express needs throughout her hospitalization.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will provide patient with interpreter services in order to facilitate patient communication. In-person interpreter or language line telephone services will be utilized to ensure that the patient receives information about her care. The nurse will eliminate distractions such as the television, hallway noise, etc., to decrease sources of additional stimuli in the communication experience. The nurse will communicate directly with the patient, utilizing appropriate eye contact, and nonverbal cues to enhance the communication experience.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Documentation</h4>
                        <p>Mrs. Rosas has impaired verbal communication due to limited English proficiency.
