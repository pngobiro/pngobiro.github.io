                        <p>Sufficient oxygenation is vital to maintain life. When prioritizing nursing interventions, we often refer to using the "ABCs," an acronym used to signify the importance of maintaining a patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Several body systems work collaboratively during the oxygenation process to take in oxygen from the air, carry it through the bloodstream, and adequately oxygenate tissues. It is important that all parts of the system work together to ensure that oxygen is delivered appropriately to tissues within each system. Any alteration in these systems can have catastrophic implications on a patient's health. First, the airway must be open and clear. The chest and lungs must mechanically move air in and out of the lungs. The bronchial airways must be open so that air can reach the alveoli, where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs. The heart must effectively pump oxygenated blood from the lungs and through the systemic arteries. There must be adequate amounts of hemoglobin in the blood to sufficiently carry the oxygen molecules to the tissues. However, several medical conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, heart disease, and anemia can impair the body's ability to effectively complete this oxygenation process. This chapter will review these basic concepts related to oxygenation and apply the nursing process to patients who are experiencing alterations in oxygenation.</p>

                        <p>Several body systems contribute to a person's oxygenation status, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, and hematological systems. These systems are reviewed in the following sections.</p>
                        <h3>Respiratory System</h3>
                        <p>The main function of our respiratory system is to provide the body with a constant supply of oxygen and to remove carbon dioxide. To achieve these functions, muscles and structures of the thorax create the mechanical movement of air into and out of the lungs called <strong>ventilation</strong>. Gas exchange occurs at the alveolar level where blood is oxygenated and carbon dioxide is removed, which is called <strong>respiration</strong>. Several respiratory conditions can affect a patient's ability to maintain adequate ventilation and respiration, and there are several medications used to enhance a patient's oxygenation status.</p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Cardiovascular System</h3>
                        <p>In order for oxygenated blood to move from the alveoli in the lungs to the various organs and tissues of the body, the heart must adequately pump blood through the systemic arteries. The amount of blood that the heart pumps in one minute is referred to as <strong>cardiac output</strong>. The passage of blood through arteries to an organ or tissue is referred to as <strong>perfusion</strong>. Several cardiac conditions can adversely affect cardiac output and perfusion in the body. There are several medications used to enhance a patient's cardiac output and maintain adequate perfusion to organs and tissues throughout the body.</p>
                        <p>Read additional information about the cardiovascular system in the "Cardiovascular & Renal" chapter in Open RN Nursing Pharmacology or use the following hyperlinks to go to specific subsections of this chapter:</p>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Hematological System</h3>
                        <p>Although the bloodstream carries small amounts of dissolved oxygen, the majority of oxygen molecules are transported throughout the body by attaching to hemoglobin within red blood cells. Each hemoglobin protein is capable of carrying four oxygen molecules. When all four hemoglobin structures contain an oxygen molecule, it is referred to as "saturated." See Figure 8.1 for an image of hemoglobin protein within a red blood cell with four sites for carrying oxygen molecules.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0471-1.jpg" alt="A detailed illustration of a hemoglobin molecule within a red blood cell, showing its four subunits and the binding sites for oxygen molecules." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>When oxygenated blood reaches tissues within the body, oxygen is released from the hemoglobin, and carbon dioxide is picked up and transported to the lungs for release on exhalation. Carbon dioxide is transported throughout the body by three major mechanisms: dissolved carbon dioxide, attachment to water as HCO3-, and attachment to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. See Figure 8.2 for an illustration of carbon dioxide transport.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0472-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating the transport of carbon dioxide in the blood.

                        <h4>Measuring Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, and Acid Base Levels</h4>
                        <p>Because the majority of oxygen transported in the blood is attached to hemoglobin, a patient's oxygenation status is easily assessed using pulse oximetry, referred to as <strong>SpO2</strong>. See Figure 8.3 for an image of a pulse oximeter.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0474-1.jpg" alt="A portable pulse oximeter device clipped to a person's fingertip, displaying the oxygen saturation level and pulse rate." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>This reading refers to the amount of hemoglobin that is saturated. The target range of SpO2 for an adult is 94-98%. For patients with chronic oxygenation conditions such as COPD, the target range for SpO2 is often lower at 88% to 92%. Although SpO2 is an efficient, noninvasive method for assessing a patient's oxygenation status, it is not always accurate. For example, if a patient is severely anemic, the patient has a decreased amount of hemoglobin in the blood available to carry the oxygen, which subsequently affects the SpO2 reading. Decreased perfusion of the extremities can also cause inaccurate SpO2 levels because less blood delivered to the tissues causes a false low SpO2. Additionally, other substances can attach to hemoglobin such as carbon monoxide, causing a falsely elevated SpO2.</p>
                        <p>A more specific measurement of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood is obtained using an <strong>arterial blood gas (ABG)</strong>. ABG results are often used for patients who have deteriorating or unstable respiratory status requiring emergency treatment. An ABG is a blood sample that is typically drawn from the radial artery by a respiratory therapist. ABG results indicate oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, and bicarbonate levels. The partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood is referred to as <strong>PaO2</strong>. PaO2 measures the pressure of oxygen dissolved in the arterial blood and how well oxygen is able to move from the lungs into the blood. The normal PaO2 level of a healthy adult is 80 to 100 mmHg. The PaO2 reading is more accurate than a SpO2 reading because it is not affected by hemoglobin levels. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood is the <strong>PaCO2</strong> level. The PaCO2 level measures the pressure of carbon dioxide dissolved in the blood and how well carbon dioxide is able to move out of the body. It is typically used to determine if sufficient ventilation is occurring at the alveolar level. The normal PaCO2 level of a healthy adult is 35-45 mmHg. The normal range of <strong>pH</strong> level for arterial blood is 7.35-7.45, and the normal range for the bicarbonate (<strong>HCO3-</strong>) level is 22-26. The <strong>SaO2</strong> level is also calculated in ABG results, which is the calculated arterial oxygen saturation level.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hypoxia and Hypercapnia</h4>
                        <p><strong>Hypoxia</strong> is defined as a reduced level of tissue oxygenation. <strong>Hypoxemia</strong> is a specific type of hypoxia that is defined as decreased partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO2) indicated in an arterial blood gas (ABG) result.</p>
                        <p>Early signs of hypoxia are anxiety, confusion, and restlessness. As hypoxia worsens, the patient's level of consciousness and vital signs will worsen with an increased respiratory rate and heart rate and decreased pulse oximetry readings. Late signs of hypoxia include bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes called <strong>cyanosis</strong>. See Figure 8.4 for an image of cyanosis.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0476-1.jpg" alt="A close-up of a person's hand showing cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin and nail beds due to low oxygen levels." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Hypercapnia</strong>, also referred to as hypercarbia, is an elevated level of carbon dioxide in the blood. This level is measured by the PaCO2 level in an ABG test and is indicated when the PaCO2 level is greater than 45. Hypercapnia is caused by hypoventilation or when the alveoli are ventilated but not perfused. In a state of hypercapnia, the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood causes the pH of the blood to drop, leading to a state of respiratory acidosis. You can read more about respiratory acidosis in the "Acid-Base Balance" section of the "Fluids and Electrolytes" chapter. Patients with hypercapnia have symptoms such as tachycardia, dyspnea, flushed skin, confusion, headaches, and dizziness. If the hypercapnia develops gradually over time, symptoms may be mild or may not be present at all. Hypercapnia is managed by addressing its underlying cause. A noninvasive positive pressure device such as a BiPAP may be used to help eliminate the excess carbon dioxide, but if this is not sufficient, intubation may be required. You can read more about BiPAP devices and intubation in the "Oxygen Therapy" chapter in Open RN Nursing Skills.</p>
                        <p>It is important for a nurse to recognize early signs of respiratory distress and report changes in patient condition to prevent respiratory failure. See Table 8.2a for symptoms and signs of respiratory distress.</p>

                        <h4>Treating Hypoxia and Hypercapnia</h4>
                        <p>Hypoxia and/or hypercapnia are medical emergencies and should be treated promptly by calling for assistance as indicated by agency policy.</p>
                        <p>Failure to initiate oxygen therapy when needed can result in serious harm or death of the patient. Although oxygen is considered a medication that requires a prescription, oxygen therapy may be initiated without a physician's order in emergency situations as part of the nurse's response to the "ABCs," a common abbreviation for airway, breathing, and circulation. Most agencies have a protocol in place that allows nurses to apply oxygen in emergency situations and obtain the necessary order at a later time.</p>
                        <p>In addition to administering oxygen therapy, there are several other interventions a nurse can implement to assist an hypoxic patient. Additional interventions used to treat hypoxia in conjunction with oxygen therapy are outlined in Table 8.2b.</p>

                        <h4>Enhanced Breathing and Coughing Techniques</h4>
                        <p>In addition to oxygen therapy and the interventions listed in Table 8.2b, there are several techniques a nurse can teach a patient to use to enhance their breathing and coughing. These techniques include pursed-lip breathing, incentive spirometry, coughing and deep breathing, and the huffing technique. Additionally, vibratory positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can be incorporated in collaboration with a respiratory therapist.</p>
                        
                        <h5>PURSED-LIP BREATHING</h5>
                        <p><strong>Pursed-lip breathing</strong> is a technique that decreases dyspnea by teaching people to control their oxygenation and ventilation. See Figure 8.5 for an illustration of pursed-lip breathing. The technique teaches a person to inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth at a slow, controlled flow. This type of exhalation gives the person a puckered or pursed-lip appearance. By prolonging the expiratory phase of respiration, a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is created in the airways that helps to keep them open so that more air can be exhaled. This subsequently reduces air trapping that commonly occurs in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pursed-lip breathing relieves the feeling of shortness of breath, decreases the work of breathing, and improves gas exchange. People also regain a sense of control over their breathing while simultaneously increasing their relaxation.</p>

                        <h5>INCENTIVE SPIROMETRY</h5>
                        <p>An <strong>incentive spirometer</strong> is a medical device commonly prescribed after surgery to expand the lungs, reduce the buildup of fluid in the lungs, and prevent pneumonia. See Figure 8.6 for an image of a patient using an incentive spirometer. While sitting upright, if possible, the patient should place the mouthpiece in their mouth and create a tight seal with their lips around it. They should breathe in slowly and as deeply as possible through the tubing with the goal of raising the piston to their prescribed level. The resistance indicator on the right side should be monitored to ensure they are not breathing in too quickly. The patient should attempt to hold their breath for as long as possible (at least 5 seconds) and then exhale and rest for a few seconds. Coughing is expected. Encourage the patient to expel the mucus and not swallow it. This technique should be repeated by the patient 10 times every hour while awake. The nurse may delegate this intervention to unlicensed assistive personnel, but the frequency in which it is completed and the volume achieved should be documented and monitored by the nurse.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0485-1.jpg" alt="A patient using an incentive spirometer, inhaling deeply to raise the piston within the device." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Using an incentive spirometer can feel monotonous to patients, resulting in the lack of performing this important activity to prevent pneumonia. It is helpful to encourage patients to create easy reminders to complete the activity. For example, many patients watch television. Create the reminder to use the incentive spirometer each time they view a commercial. This is a helpful trigger to use the incentive spirometer frequently.</p>
                        
                        <h5>COUGHING AND DEEP BREATHING</h5>
                        <p><strong>Coughing and deep breathing</strong> is a breathing technique similar to incentive spirometry but no device is required. The patient is encouraged to take deep, slow breaths and then exhale slowly. After each set of breaths, the patient should cough. This technique is repeated 3 to 5 times every hour.</p>
                        
                        <h5>HUFFING TECHNIQUE</h5>
                        <p>The <strong>huffing technique</strong> is helpful to teach patients who have difficulty coughing. Teach the patient to inhale with a medium-sized breath and then make a sound like "ha" to push the air out quickly with the mouth slightly open.</p>
                        
                        <h5>VIBRATORY PEP THERAPY</h5>
                        <p><strong>Vibratory Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) Therapy</strong> uses handheld devices such as flutter valves or Acapella devices for patients who need assistance in clearing mucus from their airways. These devices require a prescription and are used in collaboration with a respiratory therapist or advanced health care provider. To use vibratory PEP therapy, the patient should sit up, take a deep breath, and blow into the device. A flutter valve within the device creates vibrations that help break up the mucus so the patient can cough and spit it out. Additionally, a small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is created in the airways that helps to keep them open so that more air can be exhaled.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Now that we have discussed various concepts related to oxygenation and hypoxia, we will explain how a nurse uses the nursing process to care for patients with alterations in oxygenation.</p>
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>When assessing a patient's oxygenation status, there are several subjective and objective assessments to include.</p>
                        <h4>Subjective Assessment</h4>
                        <p>The primary symptom to assess when a patient is experiencing decreased oxygenation is their level of <strong>dyspnea</strong>, the medical term for the subjective feeling of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Patients can be asked to rate their dyspnea on a scale of 0-10, similar to using a pain rating scale. The feeling of dyspnea can be very disabling for patients. There are many interventions that a nurse can implement to help improve the feeling of dyspnea and, thus, improve a patient's overall quality of life.</p>
                        <p>It is also important to ask patients if they are experiencing a cough. If a cough is present, determine if sputum is present, and if so, the color and amount of sputum. Sputum is mucus and other secretions that are coughed up from the mouth. The body always produces mucus to keep the delicate tissues of the respiratory tract moist so small particles of foreign matter can be trapped and forced out, but when there is an infection in the lungs, an excess of mucus is produced. The body attempts to get rid of this excess by coughing it up as sputum. The color of a patient's sputum can provide cues for underlying medical conditions. For example, sputum caused by a respiratory infection is often yellow or green and often referred to as <strong>purulent sputum</strong>. See Figure 8.7 for an image of purulent sputum.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0489-1.jpg" alt="A sample of purulent (yellowish-green) sputum in a container." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Patients should be asked if they are experiencing chest pain. Chest pain can occur with several types of respiratory and cardiac conditions, some which are emergent. If the patient reports chest pain, first determine if it is an emergency by asking questions such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Does it feel like something is sitting on your chest?"</li>
                            <li>"Is the pain radiating into your jaw or arm?"</li>
                            <li>"Do you feel short of breath, dizzy, or nauseated?"</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If any of these symptoms are occurring, seek emergency medical assistance according to agency policy. If it is not a medical emergency, perform a focused assessment on the chest pain, including onset, location, duration, characteristics, alleviating or aggravating factors, radiation, and if any treatment has been used for the pain.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Objective Assessment</h4>
                        <p>Focused objective assessments for a patient experiencing decreased oxygenation include assessing airway, evaluating respiratory rate and heart rate, analyzing pulse oximetry readings, and auscultating lung sounds for adventitious sounds.</p>

                        <p>Signs of cyanosis or clubbing should be noted. <strong>Clubbing</strong> is the enlargement of the fingertips that occurs with chronic hypoxia such as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congenital deficits in pediatric patients. See Figure 8.8 for an image of clubbing.</p>

                        <p>Another sign of chronic hypoxia that often occurs in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes an increased anterior-posterior chest diameter, often referred to as a <strong>barrel chest</strong>. A barrel chest results from air trapping in the alveoli. See Figure 8.9 for an image of a barrel chest.</p>

                        <h4>DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND LAB WORK</h4>
                        <p>Diagnostic tests and lab work are based on the patient's medical condition that is causing the decreased oxygenation. For example, patients with a productive cough may have a chest X-ray or sputum culture ordered, and patients experiencing respiratory distress often have arterial blood gas (ABG) tests performed.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>chest X-ray</strong> is a fast and painless imaging test that uses certain electromagnetic waves to create pictures of the structures in and around the chest. This test can help diagnose and monitor conditions such as pneumonia, heart failure, lung cancer, and tuberculosis. Health care providers also use chest X-rays to see how well certain treatments are working and to check for complications after certain procedures or surgeries. Chest X-rays are contraindicated during pregnancy. See Figure 8.10 for an image of a chest X-ray.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>A <strong>sputum culture</strong> is a diagnostic test that evaluates the type and number of bacteria present in sputum. The patient is asked to cough deeply and spit any mucus that comes up into a sterile specimen container. The sample is sent to a lab where it is placed in a special dish and is watched for two to three days or longer to see if bacteria or other disease-causing germs grow. See Figure 8.11 for an image of a sputum culture.</p>

                        <p>For patients experiencing respiratory distress, arterial blood gas (ABG) tests are often ordered. Additional details about ABG tests are discussed in the "Oxygenation Basic Concepts" section of this chapter, as well as in the "Acid-Base Balance" section of the "Fluid and Electrolytes" chapter. See Table 8.3a for a summary of normal ranges of ABG values in adults.</p>

                            </ul>
                        </aside>

                        <p>In addition to the independent nursing interventions listed in the preceding box, several nursing interventions can be implemented to manage hypoxia, such as teaching enhanced breathing and coughing techniques, repositioning, managing oxygen therapy, administering medications, and providing suctioning. Refer to Table 8.2b in the "Oxygenation Basic Concepts" section earlier in this chapter for information about these interventions.</p>
                        <p>Patients should also receive individualized health promotion patient education to enhance their respiratory status. Health promotion education includes encouraging activities such as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Receiving an annual influenza vaccine</li>
                            <li>Receiving a pneumococcal vaccine every five years as indicated</li>
                            <li>Stopping smoking</li>
                            <li>Drinking adequate fluids to thin respiratory secretions</li>
                            <li>Participating in physical activity as tolerated</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Implementing Interventions</h3>
                        <p>When implementing interventions that have been planned to enhance oxygenation, it is always important to assess the patient's current level of dyspnea and modify interventions based on the patient's current status. For example, if dyspnea has worsened, some interventions may no longer be appropriate (such as ambulating), and additional interventions may be needed (such as consulting with a respiratory therapist or administering additional medication).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>After implementing interventions, the effectiveness of interventions should be documented and the overall nursing care plan evaluated. Focused reassessments for evaluating improvement of oxygenation status include analyzing the patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry reading, and lung sounds, in addition to asking the patient to rate their level of dyspnea.</p>

                        <p>The following patient care scenario applies information from this chapter to create an abbreviated nursing care plan and sample documentation note.</p>
                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Smith is an 82-year-old patient in a long-term care facility and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
                        <p>This morning Mr. Smith told the CNA as he was getting ready for breakfast, "I'm feeling short of breath and tired today." The CNA obtained vital signs and reported them to you: respiratory rate 24, O2 sat 86%, pulse 88, and temperature 36.8 C.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> You auscultate Mr. Smith's breath sounds and find scattered wheezing and rhonchi anteriorly, with diminished breath sounds in the posterior lower lobes. You ask Mr. Smith to rate his shortness of breath now on a scale from 0-10 and he reports it is a "4," but usually a "2" during activity. While assessing Mr. Smith, you note he is using accessory muscles to breathe and is sitting up in the tripod position. He also has a barrel chest. You quickly check his chart and note the following orders and scheduled medications:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tiotropium (Spiriva) inhaler daily</li>
                            <li>Fluticasone (Flovent) inhalers daily</li>
                            <li>Oxygen via nasal cannula at 1-2 L per minute as needed to maintain O2 saturation greater than 90%</li>
                            <li>Albuterol nebulizer as needed for wheezing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Based on this information, you formulate the following nursing care plan:</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Ineffective Breathing Pattern related to respiratory muscle fatigue as manifested by tachypnea and use of accessory muscles to breathe and patient stating, "I'm feeling short of breath and tired today."</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will have adequate movement of air into and out of the lungs.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mr. Smith's reported level of dyspnea will be within his stated desired range of 1-2 by the end of the shift.</p>

The wheezing and rhonchi in the anterior lungs have diminished. You ask Mr. Smith how he is feeling. He rates his current level of dyspnea as a "2" and states, "I feel less short of breath but I am still tired." The SMART outcome was "met." You encourage Mr. Smith to rest after eating breakfast, but encourage a walk in the hallway later that morning. You enter the following documentation note in the patient record.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Documentation Note</h4>
                        <p>Upon awakening, the patient reported a dyspnea level of a "4" and stated, "I'm feeling short of breath and tired today." Vital signs were respiratory rate 24, O2 sat 86%, pulse 88, and temperature 36.8 C. Scattered wheezing and rhonchi present anteriorly, with diminished breath sounds in the posterior lower lobes. Oxygen applied via nasal cannula at 1 L/min; albuterol nebulizer and scheduled medications were administered. Patient was placed in tripod position at edge of bed and encouraged to use pursed-lip breathing and Huff coughing. Post albuterol administration, vital signs were respiratory rate 16, pulse 78, and O2 sat 90% on room air. The wheezing and rhonchi in the anterior lungs were diminished. Patient reported dyspnea decreased to a "2" but stated, "I feel less short of breath but I am still tired." Encouraged patient to push fluids and ambulate as tolerated today, along with frequent rest breaks. Will continue to monitor respiratory rate, pulse, lung sounds, and reported level of dyspnea every four hours today.</p>
