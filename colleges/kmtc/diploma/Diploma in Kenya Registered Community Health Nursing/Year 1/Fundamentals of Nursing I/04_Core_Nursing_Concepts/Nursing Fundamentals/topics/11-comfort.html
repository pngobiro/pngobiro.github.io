                        <h3>Definitions of Pain</h3>
                        <p>Pain has been defined as, "Whatever the patient says it is, experienced whenever they say they are experiencing it." In 2020 the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) released a revised definition of pain as, "An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage," along with these additional notes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, and social factors.</li>
                            <li>Individuals learn the concept of pain throughout all stages of their life.</li>
                            <li>A person's report of an experience as pain should be respected.</li>
                            <li>Although pain usually serves an adaptive role, it can have adverse effects on function, socialization, and psychological well-being.</li>
                            <li>Verbal description is only one of several behaviors that express pain. The inability to communicate does not negate the possibility that a person is experiencing pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from dangerous stimuli, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. Most pain resolves after the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but sometimes pain persists despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. Additionally, pain can occur in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage, or disease.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Physiology of Pain</h3>
                        <p>Let's begin by reviewing the physiological processes of pain. A <strong>nociceptor</strong> is a type of sensory receptor that responds to potentially damaging stimuli by sending nerve signals to the spinal cord and brain in a process called nociception. There are several types and functions of nociceptors:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Thermal nociceptors</strong> are activated by noxious heat or cold, such as a hot pan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mechanical nociceptors</strong> are activated by excess pressure or mechanical deformation, such as a finger getting caught in a car door. They also respond to incisions that break the skin surface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chemical nociceptors</strong> are activated by a wide variety of spices commonly used in cooking. For example, capsaicin is a compound in chili peppers that causes a burning sensation of the mucus membranes. It is also used in common over-the-counter creams for pain relief because when it is applied to the skin, it blocks the transmission of pain impulses.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Noxious stimuli are detected by nociceptors and transduced into electrical energy. An action potential is created and transmitted along nociceptor fibers. There are two types of nociceptor fibers, A-Delta and C. A-Delta fibers are fast-conducting fibers and associated with the initial sharp, stinging, or pricking pain sensation. C fibers are slower-conducting fibers and are associated with the secondary sensation of diffuse, dull, burning, and aching pain. The pain impulse is transmitted along these nociceptor fibers to the dorsal horn in the spinal cord and then from the spinal cord to the thalamus, where pain messages are relayed to the cerebral cortex. In the cerebral cortex, pain impulses are perceived and the conscious awareness of pain occurs.</p>

                        <h3>Types of Pain</h3>
                        <p>Pain can be divided into visceral, deep somatic, superficial, and neuropathic pain.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Visceral structures</strong> are highly sensitive to stretch, ischemia, and inflammation. Visceral pain is diffuse, difficult to locate, and often referred to a distant, usually superficial, structure. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting and may be described as sickening, deep, squeezing, and dull.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deep somatic pain</strong> is initiated by stimulation of nociceptors in ligaments, tendons, bones, blood vessels, fascia, and muscles and is a dull, aching, poorly localized pain. Examples include sprains and broken bones.</li>
                            <li><strong>Superficial pain</strong> is initiated by the activation of nociceptors in the skin or other superficial tissue and is sharp, well-defined, and clearly located. Examples of injuries that produce superficial somatic pain include minor wounds and minor (first-degree) burns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Neuropathic pain</strong> is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. It is typically described by patients as "burning" or "like pins and needles." Neuropathic pain can be caused by several disease processes, such as diabetes mellitus, strokes, and HIV, and is generally undertreated because it typically does not respond to analgesics. Medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentin are typically used to manage this type of pain.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pain can radiate from one area to another. For example, back pain caused by a herniated disk can cause pain to radiate down an individual's leg. <strong>Referred pain</strong> is different from radiating pain because it is perceived at a location other than the site of the painful stimulus. For example, pain from retained gas in the colon can cause pain to be perceived in the shoulder. See Figure 11.2 for an illustration of common sites of referred pain.</p>

                        <h3>Factors Affecting the Pain Experience</h3>
                        <p>There are many biological, psychological, and social factors that affect the perception of pain, making it a unique, individual experience. See Table 11.2a for a list of these factors. Nurses must consider these factors while assessing and providing holistic nursing care for patients experiencing pain.</p>

                        <h3>Acute vs. Chronic Pain</h3>
                        <p>Pain is differentiated between acute pain and chronic pain. <strong>Acute pain</strong> has limited duration and is associated with a specific cause. It usually causes a physiological response resulting in increased pulse, respirations, and blood pressure. Diaphoresis (sweating, especially to an unusual degree) may also occur. Examples of acute pain include postoperative pain; burns; acute musculoskeletal conditions like strains, sprains, and fractures; labor and delivery; and traumatic injury.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chronic pain</strong> is ongoing and persistent for longer than six months. It typically does not cause a change in vital signs or diaphoresis. It may be diffuse and not confined to a specific area of the body. Chronic pain often affects an individual's psychological, social, and behavioral responses that can influence daily functioning. Chronic medical problems, such as osteoarthritis, spinal conditions, fibromyalgia, and peripheral neuropathy, are common causes of chronic pain. Chronic pain can continue even after the original injury or illness that caused it has healed or resolved. Some people suffer chronic pain even when there is no past injury or apparent body damage.</p>
                        <p>People who have chronic pain often have physical effects that are stressful on the body. These effects include tense muscles, limited ability to move around, lack of energy, and appetite changes. Emotional effects of chronic pain include depression, anger, anxiety, and fear of reinjury. These effects can limit a person's ability to return to their regular work or leisure activities. It is estimated that chronic pain affects 50 million U.S. adults, and 19.6 million of those adults experience high-impact chronic pain that interferes with daily life or work activities. See Figure 11.3 for an illustration of low back pain, an example of both acute and chronic pain that often affects daily functioning.</p>

                        <h3>Life Span and Cultural Considerations</h3>
                        <p>The pain experience varies across the life span. Newborns and infants can feel pain but are unable to verbalize it. Repetitive and prolonged pain may be associated with altered pain sensitivity and pain processing later in life. Toddlers and preschoolers often have difficulty describing, identifying, and locating pain. Instead, pain may be demonstrated behaviorally with crying, anger, physical resistance, or withdrawal. School-age children and adolescents may try to be "brave" and rationalize the pain; they are more responsive to explanations about pain.</p>
                        <p>Older adults are at increased risk for undertreatment of pain. It is estimated that up to 70% of older adults in the community and up to 85% living in long-term care centers have significant pain due to chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis and peripheral neuropathy. Pain is often underassessed in older adults because they are less likely to report it and also because it can present atypically with confusion and agitation.</p>
                        <p>Other special populations who are at increased risk for the undertreatment of pain include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patients with a history of addictive disease</li>
                            <li>Nonverbal, cognitively impaired, or unconscious patients</li>
                            <li>Patients who endure pain without complaining due to cultural or religious beliefs</li>
                            <li>Non-English speaking patients where communicating is a barrier</li>
                            <li>Uninsured or underinsured patients where cost of medications is a barrier</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nurses must be especially vigilant of nonverbal signs of pain in these at-risk groups and implement appropriate assessment tools and interventions.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">A True Story of Undertreated Pain</h4>
                            <p>A teenage boy from the Amish community was admitted to the hospital after he sustained several fractures when his buggy was hit by a motor vehicle. His parents stayed at his bedside throughout his hospital stay. The nurses noticed that although he denied pain, he grimaced and guarded the body parts that were injured. He moaned when repositioned and declined to get out of bed to begin physical therapy when it was prescribed for rehabilitation. However, despite these nonverbal indicators of pain, he continued to deny the existence of pain and refused all pain medication. One day, when his parents left the room briefly to get coffee, the nurse said to the patient, "Most people in your situation experience severe pain. I can see that you are hurting by your expressions when you move. Can you help me to understand why you don't want any pain medication?" A tear began to fall down the boy's cheek. He explained that his community does not believe in complaining about pain and to be a man, he must learn how to tolerate suffering. The nurse explained, "It is important for you to attend physical therapy so that you can heal and go home. Can we bring you pain pills every day before physical therapy so that you can participate in the exercises, recover quickly, and go home?" The boy agreed to this plan. The nurse documented her findings and made notes in the care plan to administer the prescribed PRN pain medications one hour before physical therapy was scheduled. She also communicated her findings during the nurse handoff report. The boy was able to satisfactorily complete the prescribed physical therapy and was discharged home the following week.</p>

                        <h3>Trends in Pain Management, Substance Abuse, and Addiction</h3>
                        <p>Several well-known agencies have recently published materials focused on the importance of optimal pain management. For example, in 2017 The Joint Commission published new and revised standards of pain assessment and pain management that apply to all Joint Commission-accredited hospitals.</p>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association published a position statement in 2018 on the ethical responsibility of nurses to properly manage pain. In 2019 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published Pain Management Best Practices. Why is there continued emphasis on optimal pain management? Let's review some trends related to pain management over the past few decades.</p>
                        <p>Pain assessment and pain management began to undergo significant changes in the 1990s when pain experts recognized that inadequate assessment and treatment of pain had become a public health issue. Recommendations for improving the quality of pain care were followed by initiatives that recognized patients' reported pain as "the 5th vital sign." Hospital administrators and regulators began to focus on pain scores, encouraging and incentivizing providers to aggressively treat pain to lower pain scores. These trends led to liberal prescribing of opioid pain medications for both acute and chronic pain.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, this increase in prescription of opioid pain medication led to an associated rise in the number of deaths from overdose. Organizations began to urge caution about the use of opioids for pain, including guidelines published in 2016 by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on prescribing opioids for pain. The 2016 CDC guideline led to limited prescriptions of opioids and unintended consequences, such as forced tapering of medications for established patients requiring chronic pain control and the transition of some patients desperate for pain control to using illicit drugs, such as heroin.</p>
                        <p>In this manner, pain management and the opioid crisis have influenced one another as each continues to evolve. It is imperative for nurses to ensure that patients with painful conditions can work with their health care providers to develop pain treatment plans that balance pain control, optimize function, and enhance quality of life while also minimizing risks for opioid misuse and harm.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Associated Definitions</h4>
                        <p>When discussing the use and abuse of drugs used to treat pain, it is important to distinguish between tolerance, physical dependence, misuse, substance abuse disorder, and addiction.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tolerance</strong> is a reduced response to pain medication when the same dose of a drug has been given repeatedly, requiring a higher dose of the drug to achieve the same level of response.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical dependence</strong> refers to withdrawal symptoms that occur when a chronic pain medication is suddenly reduced or stopped because of physiological adaptations that occur to chronic exposure to the medication.</li>
                            <li><strong>Misuse</strong> refers to a person taking prescription pain medications in a manner or dose other than prescribed; taking someone else's prescription, even if for a medical complaint such as pain; or taking a medication to feel euphoria (i.e., to get high).</li>
                            <li><strong>Substance abuse disorder</strong> is a significant impairment or distress from a pattern of substance use with at least two specific symptoms in a given year.</li>
                            <li><strong>Addiction</strong> is a chronic disease of the brain's reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry reflected in an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by substance use.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Substance Abuse Among Nurses and Nursing Students</h4>
                        <p>Substance abuse and addiction can occur in anyone, including nurses and nursing students. The American Nursing Association released the following statements in 2016:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health care facilities should provide education to nurses and other employees regarding alcohol and other drug use and establish policies, procedures, and practices to promote safe, supportive, drug-free workplaces.</li>
                            <li>Health care facilities and schools of nursing should adopt alternative-to-discipline approaches to treating nurses and nursing students with substance use disorders, with stated goals of retention, rehabilitation, and reentry into safe, professional practice.</li>
                            <li>Drug diversion, in the context of personal use, is viewed primarily as a symptom of a serious and treatable disease, and not exclusively as a crime.</li>
                            <li>Nurses and nursing students are aware of the risks associated with substance use, impaired practice, and drug diversion and have the responsibility and means to report suspected or actual concerns.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Standards of Care</h3>
                        <p>Pain assessment and management standards were recently revised and published in 2018 by The Joint Commission. The revised standards require hospitals to identify pain assessment and pain management, including safe opioid prescribing, as an organizational priority. Nurses are expected to implement these best practices. See Table 11.2b for a summary of associated requirements that must be incorporated into nursing care. If these components are not included when providing nursing care, the hospital may be cited by The Joint Commission and potentially lose Medicare funding.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Asking a patient to rate the severity of their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, with "0" being no pain and "10" being the worst pain imaginable is a common question used to screen patients for pain. However, according to The Joint Commission requirements described earlier, this question can be used to initially screen a patient for pain, but a thorough pain assessment is required. Additionally, the patient's comfort-function goal must be assessed. The comfort-function goal provides the basis for the patient's individualized pain treatment plan and is used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>PQRSTU, OLDCARTES, and COLDSPA</h3>
                        <p>The "PQRSTU," "OLDCARTES," or "COLDSPA" mnemonics are helpful in remembering a standardized set of questions used to gather additional data about a patient's pain. See Figure 11.4 for the questions associated with a "PQRSTU" assessment framework. While interviewing a patient about pain, use open-ended questions to allow the patient to elaborate on information that further improves your understanding of their concerns. If their answers do not seem to align, continue to ask focused questions to clarify information. For example, if a patient states that "the pain is tolerable" but also rates the pain as a "7" on a 0-10 pain scale, these answers do not align, and the nurse should continue to use follow-up questions using the PQRSTU framework. Upon further questioning the patient explains they rate the pain as a "7" in their knee when participating in physical therapy exercises, but currently feels the pain is tolerable while resting in bed. This additional information assists the nurse to customize interventions for effective treatment with reduced potential for overmedication with associated side effects.</p>

                        <h3>Pain Scales</h3>
                        <p>In addition to using the PQRSTU or OLDCARTES methods of investigating a patient's chief complaint, there are several standardized pain rating scales used in nursing practice.</p>
                        
                        <h4>FACES SCALE</h4>
                        <p>The FACES scale is a visual tool for assessing pain with children and others who cannot quantify the severity of their pain on a scale of 0 to 10. See Figure 11.5 for the FACES Pain Rating Scale. To use this scale, use the following evidence-based instructions. Explain to the patient that each face represents a person who has no pain (hurt), some pain, or a lot of pain. "Face 0 doesn't hurt at all. Face 2 hurts just a little. Face 4 hurts a little more. Face 6 hurts even more. Face 8 hurts a whole lot. Face 10 hurts as much as you can imagine, although you don't have to be crying to have this worst pain." Ask the person to choose the face that best represents the pain they are feeling.</p>

                        <p>The FLACC scale (i.e., the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability scale) is a measurement used to assess pain for children between the ages of 2 months and 7 years or individuals who are unable to verbally communicate their pain. The scale has five criteria, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1, or 2. The scale is scored in a range of 0-10 with "O" representing no pain.</p>

                        <h3>Comfort-Function Goals</h3>
                        <p>Comfort-function goals encourage the patient to establish their level of comfort needed to achieve functional goals based on their current health status. For example, one patient may be comfortable ambulating after surgery and their pain level is 3 on a 0-to-10 pain intensity rating scale, whereas another patient desires a pain level of 0 on a 0-to-10 scale in order to feel comfortable ambulating. To properly establish a patient's comfort-function goal, nurses must first describe the essential activities of recovery and explain the link between pain control and positive outcomes.</p>
                        <p>If a patient's pain score exceeds their comfort-function goal, nurses must implement an intervention and follow up within 1 hour to ensure that the intervention was successful. Using the previous example, if a patient had established a comfort-function goal of 3 to ambulate and the current pain rating was 6, the nurse would provide appropriate interventions, such as medication, application of cold packs, or relaxation measures. Documentation of the comfort-function goal, pain level, interventions, and follow-up are key to effective, individualized pain management.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Pain management requires collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, including nurses, health care providers, pharmacists, and sometimes pain specialists. There are many different types of pain medications (called analgesics) that can be administered by various routes. Analgesics are classified as nonopioids, opioids, or adjuvants. An <strong>adjuvant</strong> is a medication that has been found in clinical practice to have either an independent analgesic effect or additive analgesic properties when administered with opioids. Examples of adjuvant medications include antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and anti-seizure medications (e.g., gabapentin).</p>
                        <p>A general rule of thumb when administering analgesics is to use the lowest dose of medication, with fewest potential side effects and the least invasive route of administration, to effectively treat the level of pain as reported by the patient. The WHO ladder was originally developed by the World Health Organization for selecting analgesics for patients with cancer pain, but it can be broadened to illustrate this rule of thumb for managing pain appropriately for all patients. See Figure 11.6 for an image of the WHO ladder.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0727-1.jpg" alt="The WHO Pain Ladder, a three-step guide for pain management. Step 1 (Mild Pain): Non-opioid +/- Adjuvant. Step 2 (Moderate Pain): Opioid for mild to moderate pain +/- Non-opioid +/- Adjuvant. Step 3 (Severe Pain): Opioid for moderate to severe pain +/- Non-opioid +/- Adjuvant." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                        </figure>
                        <p>For example, if a patient reports a pain level of "2," then a nurse typically starts at the lowest rung of the WHO ladder and administers a prescribed nonopioid via the oral route. If the nonopioid is not effective, then a prescribed adjuvant medication may be administered, or the nurse may decide to step up a rung on the ladder and administer a prescribed oral opioid for mild to moderate pain. On the other hand, if a patient reports severe pain, the nurse may start at the top rung of the ladder and administer a prescribed opioid for moderate to severe pain via the intravenous route for rapid relief.</p>

                        <h3>Nonopioid Analgesics</h3>
                        <p>Nonopioid analgesics include acetaminophen and NSAIDs.</p>
                        <h4>Acetaminophen</h4>
                        <p>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is used to treat mild pain and fever but does not have anti-inflammatory properties. Acetaminophen is safe for all ages and can be administered using various routes, such as orally, rectally, and intravenously. Many over-the-counter (OTC) medications contain acetaminophen, along with other medications. See Figure 11.7 for an image of acetaminophen (Tylenol) and acetaminophen and diphenhydramine (Tylenol PM).</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0729-1.jpg" alt="Bottles of Extra Strength Tylenol and Tylenol PM." class="content-image" style="max-width: 450px;">
                            <figcaption>Figure 11.7 Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and Acetaminophen with Benadryl (Tylenol PM)</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>A potential severe side effect of acetaminophen is hepatotoxicity (severe liver damage). Severe liver damage may occur if an adult patient takes more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen in 24 hours (or 3,200 mg for older adults or 2,000 mg for chronic alcoholics) or consumes three or more alcoholic drinks every day while using acetaminophen.</p>
                        <p>Because some medications are combined with acetaminophen or are prescribed "as needed," the nurse must calculate the cumulative dose of acetaminophen over the previous 24-hour period before administering an additional dose. For example, Percocet 5/325 contains a combination of oxycodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg and may be prescribed as "1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed for pain." If two tablets are truly administered every four hours over a 24-hour period, this would add up to 3,900 mg of acetaminophen, exceeding the recommended guidelines for a geriatric patient, with the potential for causing liver damage.</p>
                        
                        <h4>NSAIDs</h4>
                        <p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) provide mild to moderate pain relief and also reduce fever and inflammation by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. They can also be used as an adjuvant with opioids for severe pain. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and ketorolac. All NSAIDs, except aspirin, increase the risk of heart attack, heart failure, and stroke, with the risk being higher if the patient takes more than is directed or takes it for longer than directed. Common side effects include dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting, so it is helpful to administer this medication with food.</p>
                        <p>Older adults and those taking NSAIDs concurrently with other drugs, such as warfarin or corticosteroids, are at elevated risk for gastrointestinal bleeding. Renal failure can also occur with NSAIDs.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Opioid Analgesics</h3>
                        <p>Opioids are used to treat moderate to severe pain and work by blocking the release of neurotransmitters involved in the processing of pain. Different opioids have different amounts of analgesia, ranging from codeine used to treat mild to moderate pain, up to morphine, used to treat severe pain and considered to be at the top of the WHO ladder. See Table 11.4a for a summary of common opioids. As always, check a drug reference for current dosage ranges before administering medications.</p>

                        <p>Morphine is also commonly used to treat cancer pain and end-of-life pain because there is no "ceiling effect," meaning the higher the dose, the higher the level of analgesia. Morphine is administered via various routes of administration, including orally, rectally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and intravenously. See Figure 11.8 for an image of a vial of morphine for injection or intravenous use.</p>

                        <p>Other types of opioids can be administered through the skin, such as the fentanyl transdermal patch. See Figure 11.9 for an image of a fentanyl transdermal patch.</p>

                        <h3>Alternative Routes of Administration of Opioids</h3>
                        <p>Analgesic medications can be administered via several routes, including orally, rectally, subcutaneously, and intravenously. Intramuscular routes are typically avoided. Other routes of administration include patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), intrathecally, and by epidural.</p>
                        
                        <h4>PATIENT CONTROLLED ANALGESIA</h4>
                        <p><strong>Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)</strong> is a method of pain management that allows hospitalized patients with severe pain to safely self-administer opioid medications using a programmed pump according to their level of discomfort. See Figure 11.10 for an image of a PCA pump. A computerized pump contains a syringe of pain medication and is connected directly to a patient's intravenous (IV) line. Pain medication includes morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl. Doses of medication can be self-administered as needed by the patient by pressing a button. However, the pump is programmed to only allow administration of medication every set number of minutes with a maximum dose of medication every hour. These pump settings, and the design of the system requiring the patient to be alert enough to press the button, are safety measures to prevent overmedication that can cause sedation and respiratory depression. For this reason, no one but the patient should press the button for administration of medication (not even the nurse.)</p>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>INTRATHECAL PUMP</h4>
                        <p>Another type of pump used to deliver pain medication is the intrathecal pump. This pump is surgically implanted under the skin and delivers small quantities of pain medication, such as morphine, directly into the spinal fluid. It is used to treat pain and muscle spasticity when other methods have not effectively treated the pain. It is typically used for patients with severe chronic pain, such as cancer pain, back pain, or nerve pain. However, the FDA urges cautious use because it has received numerous Medical Device Reports (MDRs) describing adverse events with implanted pumps. These reports describe pump failures, dosing errors, and other potential safety issues. Patient symptoms described in these reports include pain, opioid withdrawal, fever, vomiting, muscle spasm, cognitive changes, weakness, and cardiac and respiratory distress.</p>

                        <h4>EPIDURAL</h4>
                        <p>A third route of alternative administration of pain medication is epidural anesthesia. See Figure 11.11 for an image of an epidural anesthesia. Morphine is administered into the spinal fluid via an epidural catheter for severe pain management associated with surgical procedures or during labor and delivery. It is also used to treat chronic pain that has not responded to other treatments. Epidural administration of 5 mg of morphine provides adequate postoperative analgesia for up to 24 hours.</p>

                        <h3>Adverse Effects of Opioids</h3>
                        <h4>RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION</h4>
                        <p>The most serious potential adverse effect of opioids is respiratory depression. Respiratory depression is usually preceded by sedation. The nurse must carefully monitor patients receiving opioids for oversedation, which results in decreased respiratory rate. Patients at greatest risk are those who have never received an opioid and are receiving their first dose, those receiving an increased dose of opioids, or those taking benzodiazepines or other sedatives concurrently with opioids. If a patient develops opioid-induced respiratory depression, the opioid is reversed with naloxone (Narcan) that immediately reverses all analgesic effect. See Figure 11.12 for an image of a naloxone rescue kit to treat respiratory depression caused by opioids.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Opioids can cause several other common adverse effects, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and pruritus (itching).</p>

                        <h3>Adjuvant Medications</h3>
                        <p>Adjuvants are medications that are not classified as analgesics but have been found to contribute to analgesic effects, especially when used in addition to opioids. Two common examples of adjuvant medications are amitriptyline and gabapentin.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Nonpharmacological Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Nonpharmacological interventions can be used with or without pharmacologic interventions and often provide tremendous benefits to the patient. A variety of techniques can be selected by the patient that best fit their needs and goals. Nonpharmacological interventions should be documented in the plan of care and their effectiveness evaluated in terms of their ability to meet the patient's goals for pain relief.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Nurses play an essential role in performing comprehensive pain assessment. Assessments include asking questions about the presence of pain, as well as observing for nonverbal indicators of pain, such as grimacing, moaning, and touching the painful area. It is especially important to observe for nonverbal indicators of pain in patients unable to self-report their pain, such as infants, children, patients who have a cognitive disorder, patients at end of life, non-English speaking patients, or patients who tend to be stoic due to cultural beliefs. See Figure 11.14 for an image of a patient who is expressing pain nonverbally.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0746-1.jpg" alt="A patient expressing pain through nonverbal cues, such as a grimace and clutching their head." class="content-image" style="max-width: 400px;">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Recall that pain is defined as whatever the person experiencing it says it is. Subjective assessment includes asking questions regarding the severity rating, as well as obtaining comprehensive information by using the "PQRSTU" or "OLDCARTES" methods for assessing a chief complaint. For some patients who are unable to quantify the severity of their pain, a visual scale like the FACES scale is the best way to perform subjective assessment regarding the severity of pain.</p>
                        <p>Objective data includes observations of nonverbal indications of pain, such as restlessness, facial grimacing and wincing, moaning, and rubbing or guarding painful areas. For patients who cannot verbalize their pain, using a scale like the FLACC, COMFORT, or PAINAD is helpful to standardize observations across different staff members. Keep in mind that patients experiencing acute pain will also likely have vital signs changes, such as increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased respiratory rate.</p>
                        <p>It is important to assess the impact of pain on a patient's daily functioning. This can be accomplished by asking what effect the pain has on their ability to bathe, dress, prepare food, eat, walk, and complete other daily activities. Assessing the impact of pain on daily functioning is a new standard of care that assists the interdisciplinary team in tailoring treatment goals and interventions that are customized to the patient's situation. For example, for some patients, chronic pain affects their ability to be employed, so effective pain management is vital so they can return to work. For other patients receiving palliative care, the ability to sit up and eat a meal with loved ones without pain is an important goal.</p>
                        <p>When performing a patient assessment, any new complaints of pain or pain that is unresponsive to the current treatment plan should be reported to the health care provider. Instances of sudden, severe pain or chest pain require immediate notification or contact of emergency services.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>Commonly used NANDA-I nursing diagnoses for pain include Acute Pain (duration less than 3 months) and Chronic Pain. See Table 11.5 for more information regarding these diagnoses. For more information about defining characteristics and related factors for other NANDA-I nursing diagnoses, refer to a current nursing diagnosis resource.</p>

                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>An overall goal when providing pain management is, "The patient will report that the pain management treatment plan achieves their comfort-function goals."</p>
                        <p>SMART outcomes are customized to the patient's unique situation. An example of a SMART goal is, "The patient will notify the nurse promptly for pain intensity level that is greater than their comfort-function goal throughout shift."</p>

                        <h3>Planning Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions have been described throughout this chapter. See the following boxes for a summarized list of interventions for acute and chronic pain management.</p>

                        <h3>Implementing Pharmacological Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Patients should be involved and engaged in their plan of care to treat pain. By demonstrating empathy and collaborating with patients and the interdisciplinary team, it is more likely the treatment plan will be effective based on the patient's goals.</p>
                        <p>When administering analgesic medication, holistic nursing care is important. Begin by considering the patient's goals for pain relief and ask if they have been met effectively by previously administered medications. If they have not been met, it may be necessary to advocate for additional or alternative medication with the health care provider. It is also important to consider if the patient is experiencing any side effects that may impact the patient's desire to take additional pain medication.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>It is vital for the nurse to regularly evaluate if the established interventions are effectively meeting the pain management and function goals established collaboratively with the patient. Additionally, when administering analgesics, the patient should be reassessed in an hour (or other time frame based on the onset and peak of the medication) to determine if the medication was effective. If interventions are not effective, then follow-up interventions are required, which may include contacting the health care provider.</p>
                        <p>For patients living with chronic pain, it can be helpful for them or their caregiver to maintain a pain journal. In the journal they can document activities that precipitated pain, medications taken to manage the pain, and whether these medications were effective in helping them to meet their functional goals. This journal is shared with the health care provider during follow-up visits to enhance the treatment plan.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mrs. Jamison is a 34-year-old woman admitted through the emergency department with kidney stones. As you reposition her in bed, she is visibly grimacing and audibly moaning. She rates her pain at an "8 out of 10" although she reports her pain has "improved" since admission with the IV morphine delivered via PCA pump. You recheck her vital signs and her blood pressure is elevated at 150/90 and her heart rate is 120.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse notes that Mrs. Jamison demonstrates signs of discomfort with visible grimacing, audible moaning, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate. She rates her pain at "8 out of 10."</p>
                        <p>Based on the assessment information that has been gathered, the following nursing care plan is created for Mrs. Jamison.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Acute Pain related to physical injury agent as evidenced by change in physiological parameters and self-report of pain rated as "8 out of 10."</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will report that the pain management treatment plan achieves her comfort-function goal.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcomes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mrs. Jamison will verbalize pain reduction to a self-reported tolerable level of "4" or less on a 0-10 scale by the end of the shift.</li>
                            <li>Mrs. Jamison's blood pressure and heart rate will return to baseline levels by the end of the shift.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will perform a comprehensive pain assessment and identify the patient's expectation regarding pain management. The nurse will encourage the patient to use breathing techniques and relaxation methods to facilitate pain management. The nurse will notify the provider of unrelieved pain and request additional prescriptions for medication as needed.</p>
                        <h4>Sample Documentation:</h4>
                        <p>Mrs. Jamison was admitted with acute pain related to kidney stones and is receiving Morphine via PCA pump. At 1400, her blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 and her heart rate elevated at 120. She reported pain as an "8 out of 10." She was visibly grimacing and audibly moaning when repositioned in bed. Dr. Smith was notified at 1400 and a new prescription received. Ketorolac 30 mg IV was administered at 1415. At 1515, the patient stated her pain had decreased to a "3 out of 10" level and this level was "satisfactory." Her blood pressure also decreased to 135/76 and her heart rate decreased to 88.</p>
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>Within one hour of administration of Ketorolac, Mrs. Jamison verbalized pain reduction to her reported satisfactory level of "3," and her blood pressure and heart rate decreased to her baseline levels. SMART outcomes were "met."</p>

                        <p>Joe is a 68-year-old male who was recently diagnosed for colon cancer last week and underwent a colon resection three days ago. In the change of shift report, you hear that he is receiving morphine by PCA pump for pain, but he is not using it very often. Staff reports he "needs much encouragement" to get out of bed and participate in self-cares. He has crackles in his lung bases and his oxygen saturation is 88% on room air.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What additional assessments (subjective and objective) will you perform on Joe?</li>
                            <li>List the top three priority nursing diagnoses for Joe.</li>
                            <li>Joe states, "I don't want to use morphine. I am afraid I will become addicted to it like my friend did after he came home from the war." How will you respond to therapeutically address his concerns, yet also teach Joe about good pain management?</li>
                            <li>What are common side effects of opioids and how will you plan to manage these side effects for Joe?</li>
                            <li>Emotional issues could also be affecting Joe's perception of pain. What will you further physically assess and therapeutically address?</li>
                            <li>After providing patient education about morphine and the PCA pump, you check on Joe later in the day and notice he has had five self-doses every hour with 15 attempts in the past hour. The pump is set for a maximum of 6 doses per hour. What further assessments will you perform?</li>
