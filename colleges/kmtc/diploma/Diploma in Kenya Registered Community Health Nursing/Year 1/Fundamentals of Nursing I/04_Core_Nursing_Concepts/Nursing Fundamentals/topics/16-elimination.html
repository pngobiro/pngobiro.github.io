                        <p>Let's begin by reviewing the basic anatomy and physiology of the urinary and gastrointestinal systems.</p>
                        <h3>Urinary System</h3>
                        <p>The urinary system, also referred to as the renal system or urinary tract, consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The kidneys filter blood in the nephrons and remove waste in the form of urine. Urine exits the kidney via the ureters and enters the urinary bladder, where it is stored until it is expelled by urination (also referred to as voiding). See Figure 16.1 for an image of the male urinary system. The female urinary system is similar except for a smaller urethra.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-1043-1.png" alt="An anatomical illustration of the male urinary system, showing the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, with surrounding organs like the adrenal glands and rectum for context." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 16.1 Male Urinary System</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>A healthy adult with normal kidney function produces 800-2,000 mL of urine per day, depending on fluid intake, as well as the amount of fluid lost through sweating and breathing. The bladder typically holds about 360-480 mL of urine. As the bladder fills, it sends signals to the brain that it is time to urinate. The urinary tract includes two sets of muscles that work together as a sphincter, closing off the urethra to keep urine in the bladder until the brain sends signals to urinate. Urination occurs when the brain sends signals to the wall of the bladder to contract and squeeze urine out of the bladder and through the urethra. Frequency of urination depends on how quickly the kidneys produce urine and how much urine a person's bladder can comfortably hold.</p>
                        <p>Normal urine should be clear, pale to light yellow in color, and not foul-smelling. However, some foods or medications may change the smell or color of urine. For instance, phenazopyridine (Pyridium), a common medication prescribed to treat the pain, frequency, and burning associated with urinary tract infections, can cause urine to appear orange.</p>
                        <p>Nurses frequently monitor and document a patient's urine output as part of the overall plan of care. It can be collected by placing a collection hat in the patient's toilet and then measured in a graduated cylinder. If the patient has an indwelling catheter, the urine is emptied every shift from the catheter bag and measured in a graduated cylinder. For infants and toddlers, the number of daily wet diapers provides a general measure of urine output. For more specific measurement of urine output during hospitalization, wet diapers are weighed.</p>
                        <p>Terms commonly used to document conditions related to the urinary tract are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Anuria:</strong> Absence of urine output, typically found during kidney failure, defined as less than 50 mL of urine over a 24-hour period.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dysuria:</strong> Painful or difficult urination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> The need to urinate several times during the day or at night (nocturia) in normal or less-than-normal volumes. It may be accompanied by a feeling of urgency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hematuria:</strong> Blood in the urine, either visualized or found during microscopic analysis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oliguria:</strong> Decreased urine output, defined as less than 500 mL of urine in adults in a 24-hour period. In hospitalized patients, oliguria is further defined as less than 0.5 mL of urine per kilogram per hour for adults and children or less than 1 mL of urine per kilogram per hour for infants. New oliguria should be reported to the health care provider because it can indicate dehydration, fluid retention, or decreasing kidney function.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nocturia:</strong> The need to get up at night on a regular basis to urinate. Nocturia often causes sleep deprivation that affects a person's quality of life.</li>
                            <li><strong>Polyuria:</strong> Greater than 2.5 liters of urine output over 24 hours, also referred to as diuresis. Urine is typically clear with no color. New polyuria should be reported to the health care provider because it can be a sign of many medical conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pyuria:</strong> At least ten white blood cells in each cubic millimeter of urine in a urine sample, typically indicating infection. In severe infections, pus may be visible in the urine. See Figure 16.2 for an image of pyuria for a patient with urosepsis.</li>
                            <li><strong>Urgency:</strong> A sensation of an urgent need to void. Urgency can cause urge incontinence if the patient is not able to reach the bathroom quickly.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Gastrointestinal System</h3>
                        <p>The gastrointestinal (GI) system includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus. See Figure 16.3 for an image of the gastrointestinal system. Ingested food and liquid are pushed through the GI tract by <strong>peristalsis</strong>, the involuntary contraction and relaxation of muscle creating wave-like movements of the intestines. The stomach mixes food and liquid with digestive enzymes and then empties into the small intestine. The muscles of the small intestine mix food with enzymes and bile from the pancreas, liver, and intestine and push the mixture forward for further digestion. Bacteria in the GI tract, called normal flora or microbiome, also assist with digestion. The walls of the small intestine absorb water and the digested nutrients into the bloodstream. As peristalsis continues, the waste products of the digestive process move into the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and changes the waste from liquid into stool. The rectum, at the lower end of the large intestine, stores stool until it is pushed out of the anus during a bowel movement.</p>

                        <p>This section will focus on common alterations in bowel elimination, including constipation, diarrhea, and bowel incontinence. These alterations are common symptoms of several diseases and conditions of the gastrointestinal system. Nurses provide care to help manage these alterations.</p>
                        <p>Terms related to alterations in bowel elimination include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Black stools:</strong> Black-colored stools can be side effects of iron supplements or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol).</li>
                            <li><strong>Rectal bleeding:</strong> Rectal bleeding refers to bright red blood in the stools, also referred to as hematochezia. It is a sign of bleeding from the lower GI tract. Rectal bleeding can range in severity from minimal drops of blood on the toilet tissue caused by hemorrhoids to severe bleeding in large amounts that are life-threatening and require emergency care. New bleeding should always be reported to the health care provider.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tarry stools:</strong> Stools that are black, sticky, and appear like tar are referred to as <strong>melena</strong>. Melena is typically caused by bleeding in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, or the first part of the small intestine, or due to the patient swallowing blood. The blood appears darker and tarry-looking because it undergoes digestion on its way through the GI tract. Bleeding from the upper part of the GI tract can also range from mild to life-threatening, depending upon the cause, and should always be reported to the health care provider.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Life Span Considerations</h3>
                        <h4>Newborns and Infants</h4>
                        <p><strong>Meconium</strong> refers to the first bowel movement of a newborn that appears sticky and black to dark green in color. See Figure 16.4 for an image of meconium. The stool of a breastfed baby usually appears like a curdled yellow, while that of a formula-fed baby is more pasty. Breastfed babies often have bowel movements after every feeding. Formula-fed babies tend to have fewer bowel movements.</p>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Toddlers</h4>
                        <p>Toddlers usually begin the process of toilet training between 2 and 3 years old. <strong>Enuresis</strong> is the term used to describe incontinence when sleeping (i.e., bedwetting). Enuresis in children is considered normal unless it continues past 7 or 8 years of age, when it should be addressed with a pediatrician. Toddlers often have undigested food in their bowel movements due to the intestinal system not fully digesting some foods, such as corn or grapes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Children</h4>
                        <p>School-aged children may be at risk for developing constipation due to delaying bowel movements during school times until they are in the privacy of their homes.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Adults</h4>
                        <p>Adult females often develop urinary incontinence related to pregnancy and delivery, menopause, or vaginal hysterectomy. Adults males may have urgency and urinary retention with possible overflow urinary incontinence as their prostate enlarges. Adults over the age of 30 may develop nocturia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Older Adults</h4>
                        <p>Peristalsis typically slows as aging occurs. Older adults should be encouraged to increase fluids, fiber, and activity, as appropriate, to prevent constipation. If a patient is not able to meet the goal of a bowel movement with soft, formed stools every three days, then a bowel management program should be initiated.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>A urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common infection that occurs when bacteria, typically from the rectum, enter the urethra and infect the urinary tract. Infections can affect several parts of the urinary tract, but the most common type is a bladder infection (cystitis). Kidney infections (pyelonephritis) are more serious than a bladder infection because they can have long-lasting effects on the kidneys.</p>
                        <p>Some people are at higher risk of getting a UTI. UTIs are more common in females because their urethras are shorter and closer to the rectum, which makes it easier for bacteria to enter the urinary tract. Other factors that can increase the risk of UTIs include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A previous UTI</li>
                            <li>Sexual activity, especially with a new sexual partner</li>
                            <li>Pregnancy</li>
                            <li>Age (Older adults and young children are at higher risk.)</li>
                            <li>Structural problems in the urinary tract, such as prostate enlargement</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Symptoms of a UTI include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pain or burning while urinating (dysuria)</li>
                            <li>Frequent urination (frequency)</li>
                            <li>Urgency with small amounts of urine</li>
                            <li>Bloody urine</li>
                            <li>Pressure or cramping in the groin or lower abdomen</li>
                            <li>Confusion or altered mental status in older adults</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Symptoms of a more serious kidney infection (pyelonephritis) include fever above 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C), shaking chills, lower back pain or flank pain, and nausea or vomiting. It is important to remember that older adults with a UTI may not exhibit these symptoms but often demonstrate an increased level of confusion. Sometimes UTIs can spread to the blood (septicemia), leading to life-threatening infection called sepsis.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Antibiotics are prescribed for urinary tract infections. Nurses provide important patient education to patients with a UTI, such as the importance of finishing their antibiotic therapy as prescribed, even if they begin to feel better after a few days. Patients should also be encouraged to drink extra fluids to help flush bacteria from the urinary tract. Additional patient education regarding preventing future UTIs includes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Urinate after sexual activity.</li>
                            <li>Stay well-hydrated and urinate regularly.</li>
                            <li>Take showers instead of baths.</li>
                            <li>Minimize douching, sprays, or powders in the genital area.</li>
                            <li>Teach girls when potty training to wipe front to back.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine. Although abnormal, it is a common symptom that can seriously affect the physical, psychological, and social well-being of affected individuals of all ages. It has been estimated that 1 in 5 women develop urinary incontinence, but many are too embarrassed to discuss the condition with their health care providers.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Urinary Incontinence</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Stress urinary incontinence</strong> is the involuntary loss of urine with intraabdominal pressure (e.g., laughing and coughing) or physical exertion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Urge urinary incontinence</strong> (also referred to as "overactive bladder") is urine leakage caused by the sensation of a strong desire to void (urgency).</li>
                            <li><strong>Mixed urinary incontinence</strong> is a mix of urinary frequency, urgency, and stress incontinence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overflow incontinence</strong> occurs when small amounts of urine leak from a bladder that is always full. This condition tends to occur in males with enlarged prostates.</li>
                            <li><strong>Functional incontinence</strong> occurs in older adults who have normal bladder control but have a problem getting to the toilet because of arthritis or other disorders that make it hard to move quickly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Assessment of Incontinence</h3>
                        <p>Assessment begins with screening questions during a health history. If a patient responds "Yes," it is helpful to encourage them to start a voiding diary to record their urination habits and activities.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Nurses should use therapeutic communication with patients experiencing urinary incontinence to help them feel comfortable in expressing their fears, worries, and embarrassment. Bladder control training includes pelvic muscle exercises (Kegel exercises), timed voiding, and lifestyle changes. Protective products may be needed to protect the skin from breakdown.</p>

                        <p><strong>Urinary retention</strong> is a condition when the patient cannot empty all of the urine from their bladder. It can be acute or chronic. Urinary retention is caused by a blockage or the bladder not being able to create a strong enough force to expel all the urine. It increases the patient's risk for developing a urinary tract infection (UTI). See Figure 16.5 for an image of an enlarged prostate gland blocking the flow of urine.</p>

                        <p>The patient may experience associated symptoms such as rectal pressure, abdominal cramps, bloating, distension, and straining. <strong>Fecal impaction</strong> can occur when stool accumulates in the rectum.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Treatment typically includes a prescribed daily bowel regimen, such as oral stool softeners and a mild stimulant laxative. Patients should be educated about the importance of increased fluids, dietary fiber, and increased activity to prevent constipation.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Intestinal Obstruction or Paralytic Ileus</h3>
                        <p><strong>Intestinal obstruction</strong> is a partial or complete blockage of the intestines so that contents of the intestine cannot pass through it. It can be caused by <strong>paralytic ileus</strong>, a condition where peristalsis is not propelling the contents through the intestines, or by a mechanical cause, such as fecal impaction. Patients who have undergone abdominal surgery or received general anesthesia are at increased risk for paralytic ileus.</p>

                        <p><strong>Diarrhea</strong> is defined as having more than three unformed stools in 24 hours. It can cause dehydration, skin breakdown, and electrolyte imbalances. Diarrhea is caused by increased peristalsis causing the stool to move too quickly through the large intestines so that water is not effectively reabsorbed.</p>
                        <p>Many conditions can cause diarrhea, such as infectious processes, food poisoning, medications (such as antibiotics and laxatives), food intolerances, allergies, anxiety, and medical conditions like irritable bowel disease.

She records Aubrey's complaint that her "tummy hurts a lot when that happens." The nurse assesses Aubrey's abdomen and finds it rounded and firm with decreased bowel sounds present in all four quadrants.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Constipation related to insufficient fluid and fiber intake as manifested by decreased stool frequency, hypoactive bowel sounds, straining with defecation, hard dry stools, and patient reports "my tummy hurts a lot when that happens."</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will have soft bowel movements without difficulty.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> The patient will have a soft, formed stool every 24-48 hours.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will provide education to the patient and her mother regarding the importance of adequate fluid sources and fiber intake in addition to medications prescribed by the provider. The nurse will encourage water for hydration and provide education regarding beverage sources that may contribute to constipation. The nurse will describe the value of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in diet and describe strategies for encouraging toddler consumption of these foods. The nurse will encourage scheduling regular times to attempt elimination. The nurse will provide positive reinforcement to the child regarding using of the toilet regularly for bowel elimination and encourage the mother to track bowel movements and intake using an elimination diary.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse calls Aubrey's mother in two days. The mother reports that Aubrey had a soft, formed bowel movement on each of the past two days. The SMART outcome was initially "met." The nurse encourages the mother to continue the planned interventions and to follow-up with the provider at the next clinic visit.</p>

                            <li>Mrs. Gonzalez is a 57-year-old woman who presents to her internal medicine provider for her annual physical. The patient notes that she has been having recent increasing bouts of urinary incontinence. She reports feeling embarrassed by this condition and states, "I guess this is just a part of getting older." As the nurse providing care for Mrs. Gonzalez, what patient education and interventions might be beneficial?</li>
