                        <p>Strong communication skills are essential to provide safe, quality, patient-centered care. Nurses develop therapeutic relationships with patients and family members each day to ensure that health care concerns and needs are addressed. If communication breaks down, information exchange stops and needs go unidentified. Nurses optimize communication channels with patients and families by establishing trust and actively listening to health care concerns. Additionally, the nurse is vital for ensuring that information transfer occurs within the multidisciplinary team. Communication with other health care team members is professional, organized, accurate, complete, and concise. This chapter will review methods for establishing good communication.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Effective communication is one of the Standards of Professional Performance established by the American Nurses Association. The standard states, "The registered nurse communicates effectively in all areas of practice." There are several concepts related to effective communication such as demonstrating appropriate verbal and nonverbal communication, using assertive communication, being aware of personal space, and overcoming common barriers to effective communication.</p>
                        <h3>Types of Communication</h3>
                        <h4>Verbal Communication</h4>
                        <p>Effective communication requires each interaction to include a sender of the message, a clear and concise message, and a receiver who can decode and interpret that message. The receiver also provides a feedback message back to the sender in response to the received message. See Figure 2.1 for an image of effective communication between a sender and receiver.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0106-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating the communication process between a sender and a receiver. It shows a cyclical flow of message and feedback, with both parties encoding and decoding information." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 2.1 Effective Communication</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Nurses assist patients and their family members to understand health care needs and treatments by using verbal, nonverbal, and written communication. Effective verbal communication is defined as an exchange of information using words understood by the receiver in a way that conveys professional caring and respect. Nurses who speak using extensive medical jargon or slang may create an unintended barrier to their own verbal communication processes. When communicating with others, it is important for the nurse to assess the receiver's preferred method of communication and individual receiver characteristics that might influence communication, and subsequently adapt communication to meet the receiver's needs. For example, the nurse may adapt postsurgical verbal instruction for a pediatric versus an adult patient. Although the information requirements regarding signs of infection, pain management, etc., might be similar, the way in which information is provided may be quite different based on developmental level. Regardless of the individual adaptations that are made, the nurse must be sure to always verify patient understanding.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Nonverbal Communication</h4>
                        <p>In addition to communicating verbally, the nurse must also be aware of messages sent by nonverbal communication. Nonverbal communication can have a tremendous impact on the communication experience and may be much more powerful than the verbal message itself. You may have previously learned that 80% of communication is nonverbal communication (see Figure 2.2). The importance of nonverbal communication during communication has also been described in percentages of 55, 38, and 7, meaning 55% of communication is body language, 38% is tone of voice, and 7% is the actual words spoken.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0108-1.jpg" alt="A pie chart showing the constituents of communication. 7% is Verbal (words only), 38% is Vocal (tone, inflection), and 55% is Non-Verbal (body language)." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Nonverbal communication includes body language and facial expressions, tone of voice, and pace of the conversation. For example, compare the nonverbal communication messages in Figures 2.3 and 2.4. What nonverbal cues do you notice about both toddlers?</p>
                        <figure>

                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Nurses should be attentive to their nonverbal communication cues and the messages they provide to patients and their families. Nurses should be purposeful in their use of nonverbal communication that conveys a feeling of caring. What nonverbal cues do you notice about the nurse in Figure 2.5 that provide a perception of professional caring?</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0111-1.jpg" alt="A nurse communicating with a patient. The nurse is leaning forward, making eye contact, and has a caring expression, demonstrating positive nonverbal communication." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Nurses use nonverbal communication such as directly facing patients at eye level, leaning slightly forward, and making eye contact to communicate they care about what the person is telling them and they have their full attention.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0111-2.jpg" alt="SURETY model for nonverbal communication: Sit at an angle, Uncross legs and arms, Relax, Eye contact, Touch, Your intuition." class="content-image">
                        </figure>
                        <p>An acronym called SURETY can be used to promote nonverbal communication. SURETY stands for Sit at an angle to the patient; Uncross your arms and legs; Relax; Eye contact; Touch; and Your intuition. It is also helpful to be aware that initial or sensitive communication exchanges are best received by the patient if the nurse and patient are at eye level. Bringing a chair to the patient's bedside can help to facilitate engagement in the communication exchange. SOLER is common mnemonic used to facilitate nonverbal communication (sit with open posture and lean in with good eye contact in a relaxed manner).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Communication Styles</h3>
                        <p>In addition to verbal and nonverbal communication, people communicate with others using three styles. A passive communicator puts the rights of others before their own. Passive communicators tend to be apologetic or sound tentative when they speak and often do not speak up if they feel as if they are being wronged. Aggressive communicators, on the other hand, come across as advocating for their own rights despite possibly violating the rights of others. They tend to communicate in a way that tells others their feelings don't matter. However, assertive communicators respect the rights of others while also standing up for their own ideas and rights when communicating. An assertive person is direct, but not insulting or offensive. Assertive communication refers to a way of conveying information that describes the facts and the sender's feelings without disrespecting the receiver's feelings. Using "I" messages such as, "I feel...," "I understand...," or "Help me to understand..." are strategies for assertive communication. This method of communicating is different from aggressive communication that uses "you" messages and can feel as if the sender is verbally attacking the receiver rather than dealing with the issue at hand. For example, instead of saying to a coworker, "Why is it always so messy in your patients' rooms? I dread following you on the next shift!," an assertive communicator would use "I" messages to say, "I feel frustrated spending the first part of my shift decluttering our patients' rooms. Help me understand why it is a challenge to keep things organized during your shift?"</p>
                        <p>Using assertive communication is an effective way to solve problems with patients, coworkers, and health care team members.</p>

                        <h3>Personal Space</h3>
                        <p>While being aware of verbal and nonverbal messages and communicating assertively, it is also important to be aware of others' personal space. Proxemics is the study of personal space and provides guidelines for professional communication. The public zone is over 10 feet of distance between people and generally avoids physical contact. The social zone is four to 10 feet of distance between people. It is used during social interactions and business settings. The personal zone is 18 inches to four feet of space and is generally reserved for friends and family. Less than 18 inches is reserved for close relationships but may be invaded when in crowds or playing sports. Nurses usually communicate within the social zone to maintain professional boundaries. However, when assessing patients and performing procedures, nurses often move into a patient's personal zone. Nurses must be aware of patients' feelings of psychological discomfort that can occur when invading this zone. Additionally, cultural considerations may impact the appropriateness of personal space when providing patient care. See Figure 2.6 for an example of personal space zones.</p>

                        <h3>Overcoming Common Barriers to Communication</h3>
                        <p>It is important for you to reflect on personal factors that influence your ability to communicate effectively. There are many factors that can cause the message you are trying to communicate to become distorted and not perceived by the receiver in the way you intended. It is important to seek feedback that your message is clearly understood. Nurses must be aware of these potential barriers and try to reduce their impact by continually seeking feedback and checking understanding.</p>
                        <p>Common barriers to communication in health care and strategies to overcome them are described in the following box.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Common Barriers to Communication in Health Care</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Jargon:</strong> Avoid using medical terminology, complicated, or unfamiliar words. When communicating with patients, explain information in plain language that is easy to understand by those without a medical or nursing background.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lack of attention:</strong> Nurses are typically very busy with several tasks to complete for multiple patients. It is easy to become focused on the tasks instead of the patient. When entering a patient's room, it is helpful to pause, take a deep breath, and mindfully focus on the patient in front of you to give them your full attention. Patients should feel as if they are the center of your attention when you are with them, no matter how many other things you have going on.</li>
                                <li><strong>Noise and other distractions:</strong> Health care environments can be very noisy with people talking in the room or hallway, the TV blaring, alarms beeping, and pages occurring overhead. Create a calm, quiet environment when communicating with patients by closing doors to the hallway, reducing the volume of the TV, or moving to a quieter area, if possible.</li>
                                <li><strong>Light:</strong> A room that is too dark or too light can create communication barriers. Ensure the lighting is appropriate according to the patient's preference.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hearing and speech problems:</strong> If your patient has hearing or speech problems, implement strategies to enhance communication. See the "Adapting Your Communication" section below for strategies to address hearing and speech problems.</li>
                                <li><strong>Language differences:</strong> If English is not your patient's primary language, it is important to seek a medical interpreter and to also provide written handouts in the patient's preferred language when possible. Most agencies have access to an interpreter service available by phone if they are not available on-site.</li>
                                <li><strong>Differences in cultural beliefs:</strong> The norms of social interaction vary greatly in different cultures, as well as the ways that emotions are expressed. For example, the concept of personal space varies among cultures, and some patients are stoic about pain whereas others are more verbally expressive. Read more about caring for diverse patients in the "Diversity" chapter.</li>
                                <li><strong>Psychological barriers:</strong> Psychological states of the sender and the receiver affect how the message is sent, received, and perceived. For example, if nurses are feeling stressed and overwhelmed with required tasks, the nonverbal communication associated with their messages such as lack of eye contact, a hurried pace, or a short tone can affect how the patient perceives the message. If a patient is feeling stressed, they may not be able to "hear" the message or they may perceive it differently than it was intended. It is important to be aware of signs of the stress response in ourselves and our patients and implement appropriate strategies to manage the stress response. See the box below for more information about strategies to manage the stress response.</li>
                                <li><strong>Physiological barriers:</strong> It is important to be aware of patients' potential physiological barriers when communicating. For example, if a patient is in pain, they are less likely to hear and remember what was said, so pain relief should be provided as needed before providing patient education. However, it is also important to remember that sedatives and certain types of pain medications often impair the patient's ability to receive and perceive messages so health care documents cannot be signed by a patient after receiving these types of medications.</li>
                                <li><strong>Physical barriers for nonverbal communication:</strong> Providing information via e-mail or text is often less effective than face-to-face communication. The inability to view the nonverbal communication associated with a message such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and general body language often causes misinterpretation of the message by the receiver. When possible, it is best to deliver important information to others using face-to-face communication so that nonverbal communication is included with the message.</li>
                                <li><strong>Differences in perception and viewpoints:</strong> Everyone has their own beliefs and perspectives and wants to feel "heard." When patients feel their beliefs or perspectives are not valued, they often become disengaged from the conversation or the plan of care. Nurses should provide health care information in a nonjudgmental manner, even if the patient's perspectives, viewpoints, and beliefs are different from their own.</li>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Managing the Stress Response</h4>
                            <p>The stress response is a common psychological barrier to effective communication. It can affect the message sent by the sender or how it is received by the receiver. The stress response is a common reaction to life events, such as a nurse feeling stressed by being overwhelmed with tasks to complete for multiple patients, or a patient feeling stressed when admitted to a hospital or receiving a new diagnosis. Symptoms of the stress response include irritability, sweaty palms, a racing heart, difficulty concentrating, and impaired sleep. It is important to recognize symptoms of the stress response in ourselves and our patients and use strategies to manage the stress response when communicating. Strategies to manage the stress response are as follows:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>Use relaxation breathing.</strong> Become aware of your breathing. Take a deep breath in your nose and blow it out through your mouth. Repeat this process at least three times in succession and then as often as needed throughout the day.</li>
                                <li><strong>Make healthy diet choices.</strong> Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and junk food because these items can increase feelings of anxiety or being on edge.</li>
                                <li><strong>Make time for exercise.</strong> Exercise stimulates the release of natural endorphins that reduce the body's stress response and also helps to improve sleep.</li>
                                <li><strong>Get enough sleep.</strong> Set aside at least 30 minutes before going to bed to wind down from the busyness of the day. Avoid using electronic devices like cell phones before bedtime because the backlight can affect sleep.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use progressive relaxation.</strong> There are several types of relaxation techniques that focus on reducing muscle tension and using mental imagery to induce calmness. Progressive relaxation generally includes the following steps:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Start by lying down somewhere comfortable and firm, like a rug or mat on the floor. Get yourself comfortable.</li>
                                        <li>Relax and try to let your mind go blank. Breathe slowly, deeply, and comfortably, while gradually and consciously relaxing all your muscles, one by one.</li>
                                        <li>Work around the body one main muscle area at a time, breathing deeply, calmly, and evenly. For each muscle group, clench the muscles tightly and hold for a few seconds, and then relax them completely. Repeat the process, noticing how it feels. Do this for each of your feet, calves, thighs, buttocks, stomach, arms, hands, shoulders, and face.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                        <p>Therapeutic communication is a type of professional communication used by nurses with patients and defined as, "The purposeful, interpersonal information-transmitting process through words and behaviors based on both parties' knowledge, attitudes, and skills, which leads to patient understanding and participation." Therapeutic communication techniques used by nurses have roots going back to Florence Nightingale, who insisted on the importance of building trusting relationships with patients and believed in the therapeutic healing that resulted from nurses' presence with patients. Since then, several professional nursing associations have highlighted therapeutic communication as one of the most vital elements in nursing.</p>

                            <p>Ms. Z. is a nursing student who enjoys interacting with patients. When she goes to patients' rooms, she greets them and introduces herself and her role in a calm tone. She kindly asks patients about their problems and notices their reactions. She does her best to solve their problems and answer their questions. Patients perceive that she wants to help them. She treats patients professionally by respecting boundaries and listening to them in a nonjudgmental manner. She addresses communication barriers and respects patients' cultural beliefs. She notices patients' health literacy and ensures they understand her messages and patient education. As a result, patients trust her and feel as if she cares about them, so they feel comfortable sharing their health care needs with her.</p>

                        <h3>Active Listening and Attending Behaviors</h3>
                        <p>Listening is obviously an important part of communication. There are three main types of listening: competitive, passive, and active. Competitive listening happens when we are focused on sharing our own point of view instead of listening to someone else. Passive listening occurs when we are not interested in listening to the other person and we assume we understand what the person is communicating correctly without verifying. During active listening, we are communicating verbally and nonverbally that we are interested in what the other person is saying while also actively verifying our understanding with the speaker. For example, an active listening technique is to restate what the person said and then verify our understanding is correct. This feedback process is the main difference between passive listening and active listening.</p>

                        <h3>Touch</h3>
                        <p>Touch is a powerful way to professionally communicate caring and empathy if done respectfully while being aware of the patient's cultural beliefs. Nurses commonly use professional touch when assessing, expressing concern, or comforting patients. For example, simply holding a patient's hand during a painful procedure can be very effective in providing comfort. See Figure 2.7 for an image of a nurse using touch as a therapeutic technique when caring for a patient.</p>

                        <h3>Therapeutic Techniques</h3>
                        <p>Therapeutic communication techniques are specific methods used to provide patients with support and information while focusing on their concerns. Nurses assist patients to set goals and select strategies for their plan of care based on their needs, values, skills, and abilities. It is important to recognize the autonomy of the patient to make their own decisions, maintain a nonjudgmental attitude, and avoid interrupting. Depending on the developmental stage and educational needs of the patient, appropriate terminology should be used to promote patient understanding and rapport. When using therapeutic communication, nurses often ask open-ended statements and questions, repeat information, or use silence to prompt patients to work through problems on their own. Table 2.3a describes a variety of therapeutic communication techniques.</p>

Active listening involves showing interest in what patients have to say, acknowledging that you're listening and understanding, and engaging with them throughout the conversation. Nurses can offer general leads such as "What happened next?" to guide the conversation or propel it forward.</td>

                        <p>In addition to the therapeutic techniques listed in Table 2.3a, nurses and nursing students should genuinely communicate with empathy. Communicating honestly, genuinely, and authentically is powerful. It opens the door to creating true connections with others. Communicating with empathy has also been described as providing "unconditional positive regard." Research has demonstrated that when health care teams communicate with empathy, there is improved patient healing, reduced symptoms of depression, and decreased medical errors.</p>
                        <p>Nurses and nursing students must be aware of potential barriers to communication. In addition to considering common communication barriers discussed in the previous section, there are several nontherapeutic responses to avoid. These responses often block the patient's communication of their feelings or ideas. See Table 2.3b for a description of nontherapeutic responses.</p>

Judgmental messages contain terms such as "should," "shouldn't," "ought to," "good," "bad," "right," or "wrong." Agreeing or disagreeing sends the subtle message that nurses have the right to make value judgments about the patient's decisions. Approving implies that the behavior being praised is the only acceptable one, and disapproving implies that the patient must meet the nurse's expectations or standards. Instead, the nurse should help the patient explore their own beliefs and decisions. For example, it is nontherapeutic to state, "You shouldn't consider elective surgery; there are too many risks involved." A more therapeutic response would be, "So you are considering elective surgery. Tell me more about it..." gives the patient a chance to express their ideas or feelings without fear of being judged.</td>

To discover reasons for the patient's anger or dissatisfaction, the nurse should listen without criticism, avoid being defensive or accusatory, and attempt to defuse anger. For example, it is not therapeutic to state, "No one here would intentionally lie to you." Instead, a more therapeutic response would be, "You believe people have been dishonest with you. Tell me more about what happened." (After obtaining additional information, the nurse may elect to follow the chain of command at the agency and report the patient's concerns for follow-up.)</td>

                        <h3>Strategies for Effective Communication</h3>
                        <p>In addition to using therapeutic communication techniques, avoiding nontherapeutic responses, and overcoming common barriers to communication, there are additional strategies for promoting effective communication when providing patient-centered care. Specific questions to ask patients are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What concerns do you have about your plan of care?</li>
                            <li>What questions do you have about your medications?</li>
                            <li>Did I answer your question(s) clearly or is there additional information you would like?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Listen closely for feedback from patients. Feedback provides an opportunity to improve patient understanding, improve the patient-care experience, and provide high-quality care. Other suggestions for effective communication with hospitalized patients include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Round with the providers and read progress notes from other health care team members to ensure you have the most up-to-date information about the patient's treatment plan and progress. This information helps you to provide safe patient care as changes occur and also to accurately answer the patient's questions.</li>
                            <li>Review information periodically with the patient to improve understanding.</li>
                            <li>Use patient communication boards in their room to set goals and communicate important reminders with the patient, family members, and other health care team members. This strategy can reduce call light usage for questions related to diet and activity orders and also gives patients and families the feeling that they always know the current plan of care. However, keep patient confidentiality in mind regarding information to publicly share on the board that visitors may see.</li>
                            <li>Provide printed information on medical procedures, conditions, and medications. It helps patients and family members to have multiple ways to provide information.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Adapting Your Communication</h3>
                        <p>When communicating with patients and family members, take note of your audience and adapt your message based on their characteristics such as age, developmental level, cognitive abilities, and any communication disorders. For patients with language differences, it is vital to provide trained medical interpreters when important information is communicated.</p>
                        <p>Adapting communication according to the patient's age and developmental level includes the following strategies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When communicating with children, speak calmly and gently. It is often helpful to demonstrate what will be done during a procedure on a doll or stuffed animal. To establish trust, try using play or drawing pictures.</li>
                            <li>When communicating with adolescents, give freedom to make choices within established limits.</li>
                            <li>When communicating with older adults, be aware of potential vision and hearing impairments that commonly occur and address these barriers accordingly. For example, if a patient has glasses and/or hearing aids, be sure these devices are in place before communicating. See the following box for evidence-based strategies for communication with patients who have impaired hearing and vision.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Patients with communication disorders require additional strategies to ensure effective communication. For example, aphasia is a communication disorder that results from damage to portions of the brain that are responsible for language. Aphasia usually occurs suddenly, often following a stroke or head injury, and impairs the patient's expression and understanding of language. Global aphasia is caused by injuries to multiple language-processing areas of the brain, including those known as Wernicke's and Broca's areas. These brain areas are particularly important for understanding spoken language, accessing vocabulary, using grammar, and producing words and sentences. Individuals with global aphasia may be unable to say even a few words or may repeat the same words or phrases over and over again. They may have trouble understanding even simple words and sentences.</p>
                        <p>The most common type of aphasia is Broca's aphasia. People with Broca's aphasia often understand speech and know what they want to say, but frequently speak in short phrases that are produced with great effort. For example, they may intend to say, "I would like to go to the bathroom," but instead the words, "Bathroom, Go," are expressed. They are often aware of their difficulties and can become easily frustrated. See the hyperlink in the box below for evidence-based strategies to enhance communication with a person with impaired speech.</p>

                                <li>Phrase questions so the patient can answer using a simple "Yes" or "No," being aware that patients with expressive aphasia may provide automatic responses that are incorrect</li>
                                <li>Monitor the patient for frustration, anger, depression, or other responses to impaired speech capabilities</li>
                                <li>Provide alternative methods of speech communication (e.g., writing tablet, flash cards, eye blinking, communication board with pictures and letters, hand signals or gestures, and computer)</li>
                                <li>Adjust your communication style to meet the needs of the patient (e.g., stand in front of the patient while speaking, listen attentively, present one idea or thought at a time, speak slowly but avoid shouting, use written communication, or solicit family's assistance in understanding the patient's speech)</li>
                                <li>Ensure the call light is within reach and central call light system is marked to indicate the patient has difficulty with speech</li>

                        <h3>Maintaining Patient Confidentiality</h3>
                        <p>When communicating with patients, their friends, their family members, and other members of the health care team, it is vital for the nurse to maintain patient confidentiality. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides standards for ensuring privacy of patient information that are enforceable by law. Nurses must always be aware of where and with whom they share patient information. For example, information related to patient care should not be discussed in public areas, paper charts must be kept in secure areas, computers must be logged off when walked away from, and patient information should only be shared with those directly involved in patient care. For more information about patient confidentiality, see the "Legal Considerations & Ethics" section in the "Scope of Practice" chapter.</p>

                        <p>Nurses routinely report information to other health care team members, as well as urgently contact health care providers to report changes in patient status.</p>
                        <p>Standardized methods of communication have been developed to ensure that information is exchanged between health care team members in a structured, concise, and accurate manner to ensure safe patient care. One common format used by health care team members to exchange patient information is ISBARR, a mnemonic for the components of Introduction, Situation, Background, Assessment, Request/Recommendations, and Repeat back.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Introduce your name, role, and the agency from which you are calling.</li>

                            <p><strong>I:</strong> "Hello Dr. Smith, this is Jane White, RN from the Med Surg unit."</p>
                            <p><strong>S:</strong> "I am calling to tell you about Ms. White in Room 210, who is experiencing an increase in pain, as well as redness at her incision site. Her recent vital signs were BP 160/95, heart rate 90, respiratory rate 22, O2 sat 96%, and temperature 38 degrees Celsius. She is stable but her pain is worsening."</p>
                            <p><strong>B:</strong> "Ms. White is a 65-year-old female, admitted yesterday post hip surgical replacement. She has been rating her pain at 3 or 4 out of 10 since surgery with her scheduled medication, but now she is rating the pain as a 7, with no relief from her scheduled medication of Vicodin 5/325 mg administered an hour ago. She is scheduled for physical therapy later this morning and is stating she won't be able to participate because of the pain this morning."</p>
                            <p><strong>A:</strong> "I just assessed the surgical site and her dressing was clean, dry, and intact, but there is 4 cm redness surrounding the incision, and it is warm and tender to the touch. There is moderate serosanguinous drainage. Otherwise, her lungs are clear and her heart rate is regular."</p>
                            <p><strong>R:</strong> "I am calling to request an order for a CBC and increased dose of pain medication."</p>

                        <h3>Handoff Reports</h3>
                        <p>Handoff reports are defined by The Joint Commission as "a transfer and acceptance of patient care responsibility achieved through effective communication. It is a real-time process of passing patient specific information from one caregiver to another, or from one team of caregivers to another, for the purpose of ensuring the continuity and safety of the patient's care." In 2017, The Joint Commission issued a sentinel alert about inadequate handoff communication that has resulted in patient harm such as wrong-site surgeries, delays in treatment, falls, and medication errors. Strategies for improving handoff communication have been implemented at agencies across the country.</p>
                        <p>Although many types of nursing shift-to-shift handoff reports have been used over the years, evidence strongly supports that bedside handoff reports increase patient safety, as well as patient and nurse satisfaction, by effectively communicating current, accurate patient information in real time. See Figure 2.9 for an image illustrating two nurses participating in a handoff report. Bedside reports typically occur in hospitals and include the patient, along with the off-going and the oncoming nurses in a face-to-face handoff report conducted at the patient's bedside. HIPAA rules must be kept in mind if visitors are present or the room is not a private room. Family members may be included with the patient's permission. See a sample checklist for a bedside handoff report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in Figure 2.10. Although a bedside handoff report is similar to an ISBARR report, it contains additional information to ensure continuity of care across nursing shifts. For example, the "assessment" portion of the bedside handoff report includes detailed pertinent data the oncoming nurse needs to know, such as current head-to-toe assessment findings to establish a baseline; information about equipment such as IVs, catheters, and drainage tubes; and recent changes in medications, lab results, diagnostic tests, and treatments.</p>

                        <p>Transfer reports are provided by nurses when transferring a patient to another unit or to another agency. Transfer reports contain similar information as bedside handoff reports, but are even more detailed when the patient is being transferred to another agency. Checklists are often provided by agencies to ensure accurate, complete information is shared.</p>

                        <h3>Using Technology to Access Information</h3>
                        <p>Most patient information in acute care, long-term care, and other clinical settings is now electronic and uses intranet technology for secure access by providers, nurses, and other health care team members to maintain patient confidentiality. Intranet refers to a private computer network within an institution. An electronic health record (EHR) is a real-time, patient-centered record that makes information available instantly and securely to authorized users. Computers used to access an EHR can be found in patient rooms, on wheeled carts, in workstations, or even on handheld devices. See Figure 2.11 for an image of a nurse documenting in an EHR.</p>

                        <p>The EHR for each patient contains a great deal of information. The most frequent pieces of information that nurses access include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>History and Physical (H&P):</strong> A history and physical (H&P) is a specific type of documentation created by the health care provider when the patient is admitted to the facility. An H&P includes important information about the patient's current status, medical history, and the treatment plan in a concise format that is helpful for the nurse to review. Information typically includes the reason for admission, health history, surgical history, allergies, current medications, physical examination findings, medical diagnoses, and the treatment plan.</li>
                            <li><strong>Provider orders:</strong> This section includes the prescriptions, or medical orders, that the nurse must legally implement or appropriately communicate according to agency policy if not implemented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medication Administration Records (MARs):</strong> Medications are charted through electronic medication administration records (MARs). These records interface the medication orders from providers with pharmacists and are also the location where nurses document medications administered.</li>
                            <li><strong>Treatment Administration Records (TARs):</strong> In many facilities, treatments are documented on a treatment administration record.</li>
                            <li><strong>Laboratory results:</strong> This section includes results from blood work and other tests performed in the lab.</li>
                            <li><strong>Diagnostic test results:</strong> This section includes results from diagnostic tests ordered by the provider such as X-rays, ultrasounds, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Progress notes:</strong> This section contains notes created by nurses and other health care providers regarding patient care. It is helpful for the nurse to review daily progress notes by all team members to ensure continuity of care.</li>

                        <h3>Legal Documentation</h3>
                        <p>Nurses and health care team members are legally required to document care provided to patients. In a court of law, the rule of thumb used is, "If it wasn't documented, it wasn't done." Documentation should be objective, factual, professional, and use proper medical terminology, grammar, and spelling. All types of documentation must include the date, time, and signature of the person documenting. Any type of documentation in the EHR is considered a legal document and must be completed in an accurate and timely manner. Abbreviations should be avoided in legal documentation.</p>
                        <p>Documentation is used for many purposes. It is used to ensure continuity of care across health care team members and across shifts; monitor standards of care for quality assurance activities; and provide information for reimbursement purposes by insurance companies, Medicare, and Medicaid. Documentation may also be used for research purposes or, in some instances, for legal concerns in a court of law.</p>
                        <p>Documentation by nurses includes recording patient assessments, writing progress notes, and creating or addressing information included in nursing care plans. Nursing care plans are further discussed in the "Planning" section of the "Nursing Process" chapter.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Common Types of Documentation</h3>
                        <p>Common formats used to document patient care include charting by exception, focused DAR notes, narrative notes, SOAPIE progress notes, patient discharge summaries, and Minimum Data Set (MDS) charting.</p>

                        <h4>Charting by Exception</h4>
                        <p>Charting by exception (CBE) documentation was designed to decrease the amount of time required to document care. CBE contains a list of normal findings. After performing an assessment, nurses confirm normal findings on the list found on assessment and write only brief progress notes for abnormal findings or to document communication with other team members.</p>

                        <h4>Focused DAR Notes</h4>
                        <p>Focused DAR notes are a type of progress note that are commonly used in combination with charting by exception documentation. DAR stands for Data, Action, and Response. Focused DAR notes are brief. Each note is focused on one patient problem for efficiency in documenting and reading.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data:</strong> This section contains information collected during the patient assessment, including vital signs and physical examination findings found during the "Assessment" phase of the nursing process. The Assessment phase is further discussed in the "Nursing Process" chapter.</li>
                            <li><strong>Action:</strong> This section contains the nursing actions that are planned and implemented for the patient's focused problem. This section correlates to the "Planning" and "Implementation" phases of the nursing process and are further discussed in the "Nursing Process" chapter.</li>
                            <li><strong>Response:</strong> This section contains information about the patient's response to the nursing actions and evaluates if the planned care was effective. This section correlates to the "Evaluation" phase of the nursing process that is further discussed in the "Nursing Process" chapter.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Narrative Notes</h4>
                        <p>Narrative notes are a type of progress note that chronicles assessment findings and nursing activities for the patient that occurred throughout the entire shift or visit. View sample narrative note documentation according to body system in each assessment chapter of the Open RN Nursing Skills textbook.</p>

                        <h4>SOAPIE Notes</h4>
                        <p>SOAPIE is a mnemonic for a type of progress note that is organized by six categories: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan, Interventions, and Evaluation. SOAPIE progress notes are written by nurses, as well as other members of the health care team.</p>

                            <li><strong>Subjective:</strong> This section includes what the patient said, such as, "I have a headache." It can also contain information related to pertinent medical history and why the patient is in need of care.</li>
                            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> This section contains the observable and measurable data collected during a patient assessment, such as the vital signs, physical examination findings, and lab/diagnostic test results.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> This section contains the interpretation of what was noted in the Subjective and Objective sections, such as a nursing diagnosis in a nursing progress note or the medical diagnosis in a progress note written by a health care provider.</li>
                            <li><strong>Plan:</strong> This section outlines the plan of care based on the Assessment section, including goals and planned interventions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interventions:</strong> This section describes the actions implemented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> This section describes the patient response to interventions and if the planned outcomes were met.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Patient Discharge Summary</h4>
                        <p>When a patient is discharged from an agency, a discharge summary is documented in the patient record, along with clear verbal and written patient education and instructions provided to the patient. Discharge summary information is frequently provided in a checklist format to ensure accuracy and includes the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Time of departure and method of transportation out of the hospital (e.g., wheelchair)</li>
                            <li>Name and relationship of person accompanying the patient at discharge</li>
                            <li>Condition of the patient at discharge</li>
                            <li>Patient education completed and associated educational materials or other information provided to the patient</li>
                            <li>Discharge instructions on medications, treatments, diet, and activity</li>
                            <li>Follow-up appointments or referrals given</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>See Figure 2.12 for an image of a nurse providing discharge instructions to a patient. Discharge teaching typically starts at admission and continues throughout the patient's stay.</p>

                        <h4>Minimum Data Set (MDS) Charting</h4>
                        <p>In long-term care settings, additional documentation is used to provide information for reimbursement by private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set (MDS) is a federally mandated assessment tool created by registered nurses in skilled nursing facilities to track a patient's goal achievement, as well as to coordinate the efforts of the health care team to optimize the resident's quality of care and quality of life. This tool also guides nursing care plan development.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Hernandez is a 47-year-old patient admitted to the neurological trauma floor as the result of a motor vehicle accident two days ago. The patient sustained significant facial trauma in the accident and his jaw is wired shut. His left eye is currently swollen, and he had significant bruising to the left side of his face. The nurse completes a visual assessment and notes that the patient has normal extraocular movement, peripheral vision, and pupillary constriction bilaterally. Additional assessment reveals that Mr. Hernandez also sustained a fracture of the left arm and wrist during the accident. His left arm is currently in a cast and sling. He has normal movement and sensation with his right hand. Mrs. Hernandez is present at the patient's bedside and has provided additional information about the patient. She reports that Mr. Hernandez's primary language is Spanish but that he understands English well. He has a bachelor's degree in accounting and owns his own accounting firm. He has a history of elevated blood pressure, but is otherwise healthy.</p>
                        <p>The nurse notes that the patient's jaw is wired and he is unable to offer a verbal response. He does understand English well, has appropriate visual acuity, and is able to move his right hand and arm.</p>
                        <p>Based on the assessment information that has been gathered, the nurse plans several actions to enhance communication. Adaptive communication devices such as communication boards, symbol cards, or electronic messaging systems will be provided. The nurse will eliminate distractions such as television and hallway noise to decrease sources of additional stimuli in the communication experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sample Documentation</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Hernandez has impaired verbal communication due to facial fracture and inability to enunciate words around his wired jaw. He understands both verbal and written communication. Mr. Hernandez has left sided facial swelling, but no visual impairment. He has a left arm fracture but is able to move and write with his right hand. The patient is supplied with communication cards and marker board. He responds appropriately with written communication and is able to signal his needs.</p>

                                <p>You are caring for Mr. Curtis, an 87-year-old patient newly admitted to the medical surgical floor with a hip fracture. You are preparing to complete his admission history and need to collect relevant health information and complete a physical exam. You approach the room, knock at the door, complete hand hygiene, and enter. Upon entry, you see Mr. Curtis is in bed surrounded by multiple family members. The television is on in the background and you also note the sound of meal trays being delivered in the hallway.</p>
                                <p>Based on the described scenario, what actions might be implemented to aid in your communication with Mr. Curtis?</p>
