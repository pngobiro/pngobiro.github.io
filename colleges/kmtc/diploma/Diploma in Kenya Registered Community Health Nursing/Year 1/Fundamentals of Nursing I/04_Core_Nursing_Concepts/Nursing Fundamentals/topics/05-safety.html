                        <p>A national focus on reducing medical errors has been in place since 1999 when the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released a report titled <em>To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System</em>. This historic report broke the silence surrounding health care errors and encouraged safety to be built into the processes of providing patient care. It was soon followed by the establishment of several safety initiatives by The Joint Commission, including the release of annual National Patient Safety Goals. Additionally, the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) Institute was developed to promote emphasis on high-quality, safe patient care in nursing. This chapter will discuss several safety initiatives that promote a safe health care environment.</p>

                        <h3>Safety: A Basic Need</h3>
                        <p>Safety is a basic foundational human need and always receives priority in patient care. Nurses typically use Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to prioritize urgent patient needs, with the bottom two rows of the pyramid receiving top priority. See Figure 5.1 for an image of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Safety is intertwined with basic physiological needs.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0309-1.jpg" alt="A pyramid diagram of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. From bottom to top: Physiological Needs, Safety Needs, Love and Belonging, Esteem, and Self-Actualization." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Consider the following scenario: You are driving back from a relaxing weekend at the lake and come upon a fiery car crash. You run over to the car to help anyone inside. When you get to the scene, you notice that the lone person in the car is not breathing. Your first priority is not to initiate rescue breathing inside the burning car, but to move the person to a safe place where you can safely provide CPR.</p>
                        <p>In nursing, the concept of patient safety is central to everything we do in all health care settings. As a nurse, you play a critical role in promoting patient safety while providing care. You also teach patients and their caregivers how to prevent injuries and remain safe in their homes and in the community. Safe patient care also includes measures to keep you safe in the health care environment; if you become ill or injured, you will not be able to effectively care for others.</p>
                        <p>Safe patient care is a commitment to providing the best possible care to every patient and their caregivers in every moment of every day. Patients come to health care facilities expecting to be kept safe while they are treated for illnesses and injuries. Unfortunately, you may have heard stories about situations when that did not happen. Medical errors can be devastating to patients and their families. Consider the true patient story in the following box that illustrates factors affecting patient safety.</p>

                        <h3>Never Events</h3>
                        <p>The event described in the Josie King story is considered a "never event." <strong>Never events</strong> are adverse events that are clearly identifiable, measurable, serious (resulting in death or significant disability), and preventable. In 2007 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) discontinued payment for costs associated with never events, and this policy has been adopted by most private insurance companies. Never events are publicly reported, with the goal of increasing accountability by health care agencies and improving the quality of patient care. The current list of never events includes seven categories of events:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Surgical or procedural event, such as surgery performed on the wrong body part</li>
                            <li>Product or device, such as injury or death from a contaminated drug or device</li>
                            <li>Patient protection, such as patient suicide in a health care setting</li>
                            <li>Care management, such as death or injury from a medication error</li>
                            <li>Environmental, such as death or injury as the result of using restraints</li>
                            <li>Radiologic, such as a metallic object in an MRI area</li>
                            <li>Criminal, such as death or injury of a patient or staff member resulting from physical assault on the grounds of a health care setting</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Sentinel Events</h3>
                        <p><strong>Sentinel events</strong> are similar to never events but are not necessarily preventable. They are defined as an "unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physiological or psychological injury, or the risk thereof." For example, injury or death from a properly prescribed and administered medication is a sentinel event. The Joint Commission mandates reporting of sentinel events and the performance of a <strong>root cause analysis</strong> by the health care agency. Root cause analysis is a structured method used to analyze serious adverse events to identify underlying problems that increase the likelihood of errors, while avoiding the trap of focusing on mistakes by individuals. A multidisciplinary team analyzes the sequence of events leading up to the error with the goal of identifying how and why the event occurred. The ultimate goal of root cause analysis is to prevent future harm by eliminating hidden problems within a health care system that contribute to adverse events. For example, when a medication error occurs, a root cause analysis goes beyond focusing on the mistake by the nurse and looks at other system factors that contributed to the error, such as similar-looking drug labels, placement of similar-looking medications next to each other in a medication dispensing machine, or vague instructions in a provider order.</p>
                        <p>Root cause analysis uses human factors science as part of the investigation. <strong>Human factors</strong> focus on the interrelationships among humans, the tools and equipment they use in the workplace, and the environment in which they work. Safety in health care is ultimately dependent on humans - the doctors, nurses, and health care professionals - providing the care.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Near Misses</h3>
                        <p>In addition to investigating sentinel events and never events, agencies use root cause analysis to investigate near misses. <strong>Near misses</strong> are defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as, "An error that has the potential to cause an adverse event (patient harm) but fails to do so because of chance or because it is intercepted." Errors and near misses are rarely the result of poor motivation or incompetence of the health care professional, but are often caused by key contributing factors such as poor communication, less-than-optimal teamwork, memory overload, reliance on memory for complex procedures, and lack of standardization of policies and procedures. In an effort to prevent near misses, medical errors, sentinel events, and never events, several safety strategies have been developed and implemented in health care organizations across the country. These strategies will be discussed throughout the remainder of the chapter.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Safety strategies have been developed based on research to reduce the likelihood of errors and to create safe standards of care. Examples of safety initiatives include strategies to prevent medication errors, standardized checklists, and structured team communication tools.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Medication Errors</h3>
                        <p>Several initiatives have been developed nationally to prevent medication errors, such as the establishment of a "Do Not Use List of Abbreviations," a "List of Error-Prone Abbreviations," "Frequently Confused Medication List," "High-Alert Medications List," and the "Do Not Crush List." Additionally, it is considered a standard of care for nurses to perform three checks of the rights of medication administration whenever administering medication.</p>

                        <h3>Checklists</h3>
                        <p>Performance of complex medical procedures is often based on memory, even though humans are prone to short-term memory loss, especially when we are multitasking or under stress. The point-of-care checklist is an example of a patient care safety initiative that reduces this reliance on fallible memory. For example, a surgical checklist developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) has been adopted by most surgical providers around the world as a standard of care. It has significantly decreased injuries and deaths caused by surgeries by focusing on teamwork and communication. The Association of PeriOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) combined recommendations from The Joint Commission and the WHO to create a specific surgical checklist for nurses. See Figure 5.2 for an image of the WHO surgical checklist.</p>

                        <h3>Team Communication</h3>
                        <p>Nurses routinely communicate with multidisciplinary health care team members and contact health care providers to report changes in patient status. Serious patient harm can occur when patient information is absent, incomplete, erroneous, or delayed during team communication. Standardized methods of communication have been developed to ensure that accurate information is exchanged among team members in a structured and concise manner.</p>
                        
                        <h4>ISBARR</h4>
                        <p>A common format for communication between health care team members is ISBARR, a mnemonic for the components of Introduction, Situation, Background, Assessment, Request/Recommendations, and Repeat back. See Figure 5.3 for an image of an ISBARR reference card.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Introduce your name, role, and the agency from which you are calling.</li>
                            <li><strong>Situation:</strong> Provide the patient's name and location, why you are calling, recent vital signs, and the status of the patient.</li>
                            <li><strong>Background:</strong> Provide pertinent background information about the patient such as admitting medical diagnoses, code status, recent relevant lab or diagnostic results, and allergies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Share abnormal assessment findings and your concerns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Request/Recommendations:</strong> State what you would like the provider to do, such as reassess the patient, order a lab/diagnostic test, prescribe/change medication, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repeat back:</strong> If you are receiving new orders from a provider, repeat them to confirm accuracy. Be sure to document communication with the provider in the patient's chart.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>HANDOFF REPORTS</h4>
                        <p><strong>Handoff reports</strong> are a specific type of team communication as patient care is transferred. Handoff reports are defined by The Joint Commission as, "A transfer and acceptance of patient care responsibility achieved through effective communication. It is a real-time process of passing patient specific information from one caregiver to another, or from one team of caregivers to another, for the purpose of ensuring the continuity and safety of the patient's care." Handoff reports occur during multiple stages of patient care, such as between nurses at the end of shifts, when a patient is transferred from one unit to another within a health care agency, or when a patient is transferred to a different facility. In 2017 The Joint Commission issued a sentinel alert about inadequate handoff communication resulting in patient harm such as wrong-site surgeries, delays in treatment, falls, and medication errors. Strategies to improve handoff communication, such as bedside handoff report checklists, have been implemented at agencies across the country.</p>
                        <p>Bedside handoff reports typically occur between nurses during inpatient care as the off-going and the incoming nurses communicate current, up-to-date details about the patient's care. The report is optimally conducted at the bedside and includes the patient. Family members may be included during the report with the patient's permission. Although a bedside handoff report is similar to an ISBARR report, it contains additional information to ensure continuity of care across nursing shifts, such as current head-to-toe assessment findings to establish baseline status; information about equipment such as IVs, catheters, and drainage tubes; and recent changes in medications, lab results, diagnostic tests, and treatments.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In addition to implementing safety strategies to improve safe patient care, leaders of a health care agency must also establish a culture of safety. A <strong>culture of safety</strong> reflects the behaviors, beliefs, and values within and across all levels of an organization as they relate to safety and clinical excellence, with a focus on people. In 2017 The Joint Commission released a sentinel event regarding the essential role of leadership in establishing a culture of safety. Three components of a culture of safety are the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Just Culture:</strong> A culture where people feel safe raising questions and concerns and report safety events in an environment that emphasizes a nonpunitive response to errors and near misses. Clear lines are drawn between human error, at-risk, and reckless behaviors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporting Culture:</strong> People realize errors are inevitable and are encouraged to speak up for patient safety by reporting errors and near misses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Learning Culture:</strong> People regularly collect information and learn from errors and successes while openly sharing data and information and applying best evidence to improve work processes and patient outcomes.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association further describes a culture of safety as one that includes openness and mutual respect when discussing safety concerns and solutions without shifting to individual blame, a learning environment with transparency and accountability, and reliable teams. In contrast, complexity, lack of clear measures, hierarchical authority, the "blame game," and lack of leadership are examples of barriers that do not promote a culture of safety. See the following box for an example of safety themes established during a health care institution's implementation of a culture of safety.</p>
                        
                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Safety Themes in a Culture of Safety</h4>
                            <p>Kaiser Permanente implemented a culture of safety in 2001 that focused on instituting the following six strategic themes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Safe culture:</strong> Creating and maintaining a strong patient safety culture, with patient safety and error reduction embraced as shared organizational values.</li>
                                <li><strong>Safe care:</strong> Ensuring that the actual and potential hazards associated with high-risk procedures, processes, and patient care populations are identified, assessed, and managed in a way that demonstrates continuous improvement and ultimately ensures that patients are free from accidental injury or illness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Safe staff:</strong> Ensuring that staff possess the knowledge and competence to perform required duties safely and contribute to improving system safety performance.</li>
                                <li><strong>Safe support systems:</strong> Identifying, implementing, and maintaining support systems—including knowledge-sharing networks and systems for responsible reporting—that provide the right information to the right people at the right time.</li>
                                <li><strong>Safe place:</strong> Designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the environment of health care to enhance its efficiency and effectiveness.</li>
                                <li><strong>Safe patients:</strong> Engaging patients and their families in reducing medical errors, improving overall system safety performance, and maintaining trust and respect.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </aside>
                        
                        <p>A strong safety culture encourages all members of the health care team to identify and reduce risks to patient safety by reporting errors and near misses so that root cause analysis can be performed and identified risks are removed from the system. However, in a poorly defined and implemented culture of safety, staff often conceal errors due to fear or shame. Nurses have been traditionally trained to believe that clinical perfection is attainable and that "good" nurses do not make errors. Errors are perceived as being caused by carelessness, inattention, indifference, or uninformed decisions. Although expecting high standards of performance is appropriate and desirable, it can become counterproductive if it creates an expectation of perfection that impacts the reporting of errors and near misses. If employees feel shame when they make an error, they may feel pressure to hide or cover up errors. Evidence indicates that approximately three of every four errors are detected by those committing them, as opposed to being detected by an environmental cue or another person. Therefore, employees need to be able to trust that they can fully report errors without fear of being wrongfully blamed. This provides the agency with the opportunity to learn how to further improve processes and prevent future errors from occurring. For many organizations, the largest barrier in establishing a culture of safety is the establishment of trust. A model called "Just Culture" has successfully been implemented in many agencies to decrease the "blame game," promote trust, and improve the reporting of errors.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Just Culture</h3>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association (ANA) officially endorses the Just Culture model. In 2019 the ANA published a position statement on Just Culture, stating, "Traditionally, healthcare's culture has held individuals accountable for all errors or mishaps that befall patients under their care. By contrast, a Just Culture recognizes that individual practitioners should not be held accountable for system failings over which they have no control. A Just Culture also recognizes many individual or 'active' errors represent predictable interactions between human operators and the systems in which they work. However, in contrast to a culture that touts 'no blame' as its governing principle, a Just Culture does not tolerate conscious disregard of clear risks to patients or gross misconduct (e.g., falsifying a record or performing professional duties while intoxicated)."</p>
                        <p>The Just Culture model categorizes human behavior into three causes of errors. Consequences of errors are based on whether the error is a simple human error or caused by at-risk or reckless behavior.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Simple human error:</strong> A simple human error occurs when an individual inadvertently does something other than what should have been done. Most medical errors are the result of human error due to poor processes, programs, education, environmental issues, or situations. These errors are managed by correcting the cause, looking at the process, and fixing the deviation. For example, a nurse appropriately checks the rights of medication administration three times, but due to the similar appearance and names of two different medications stored next to each other in the medication dispensing system, administers the incorrect medication to a patient. In this example, a root cause analysis reveals a system issue that must be modified to prevent future patient errors (e.g., change the labelling and storage of look alike-sound alike medication).</li>
                            <li><strong>At-risk behavior:</strong> An error due to at-risk behavior occurs when a behavioral choice is made that increases risk where the risk is not recognized or is mistakenly believed to be justified. For example, a nurse scans a patient's medication with a bar code scanner prior to administration, but an error message appears on the scanner. The nurse mistakenly interprets the error to be a technology problem and proceeds to administer the medication instead of stopping the process and further investigating the error message, resulting in the wrong dosage of a medication being administered to the patient. In this case, ignoring the error message on the scanner can be considered "at-risk behavior" because the behavioral choice was considered justified by the nurse at the time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reckless behavior:</strong> Reckless behavior is an error that occurs when an action is taken with conscious disregard for a substantial and unjustifiable risk. For example, a nurse arrives at work intoxicated and administers the wrong medication to the wrong patient. This error is considered due to reckless behavior because the decision to arrive intoxicated was made with conscious disregard for substantial risk.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These examples show three different causes of medication errors that would result in different consequences to the employee based on the Just Culture model. Under the Just Culture model, after root cause analysis is completed, system-wide changes are made to decrease factors that contributed to the error. Managers appropriately hold individuals accountable for errors if they were due to simple human error, at-risk behavior, or reckless behaviors.</p>
                        <p>If an individual commits a simple human error, managers console the individual and consider changes in training, procedures, and processes. In the "simple human error" above, system-wide changes would be made to change the label and location of the medication to prevent future errors from occurring with the same medication.</p>
                        <p>Individuals committing at-risk behavior are held accountable for their behavioral choice and often require coaching with incentives for less risky behaviors and situational awareness. In the "at-risk behavior" example above where the nurse ignored an error message on the bar code scanner, mandatory training on using a bar code scanner and responding to errors would be implemented, and the manager would track the employee's correct usage of the bar code scanner for several months following training.</p>
                        <p>If an individual demonstrates reckless behavior, remedial action and/or punitive action is taken. In the "reckless behavior" example above, the manager would report the nurse's behavior to the state's Board of Nursing with mandatory substance abuse counseling to maintain their nursing license. Employment may be terminated with consideration of patterns of behavior.</p>
                        <p>A Just Culture in which employees aren't afraid to report errors is a highly successful way to enhance patient safety, increase staff and patient satisfaction, and improve outcomes. Success is achieved through good communication, effective management of resources, and an openness to changing processes to ensure the safety of patients and employees. The infographic in Figure 5.4 illustrates the components of a culture of safety and Just Culture.</p>

                        <p>The principles of culture of safety, including Just Culture, Reporting Culture, and Learning Culture are also being adopted in nursing education. It's understood that mistakes are part of learning and that a shared accountability model promotes individual- and system-level learning for improved patient safety. Under a shared accountability model, students are responsible for the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>being fully prepared for clinical experiences, including laboratory and simulation assignments</li>
                            <li>being rested and mentally ready for a challenging learning environment</li>
                            <li>accepting accountability for their part in contributing to a safe learning environment</li>
                            <li>behaving professionally</li>
                            <li>reporting their own errors and near mistakes</li>
                            <li>keeping up-to-date with current evidence-based practice</li>
                            <li>adhering to ethical and legal standards</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Students know they will be held accountable for their actions, but will not be blamed for system faults that lie beyond their control. They can trust that a fair process will be used to determine what went wrong if a patient care error or near miss occurs. Student errors and near misses are addressed based on an investigation determining if it was simple human error, an at-risk behavior, or reckless behavior. For example, a simple human error by a student can be addressed with coaching and additional learning opportunities to remedy the knowledge deficit. However, if a student acts with recklessness (for example, repeatedly arrives to clinical unprepared despite previous faculty feedback or falsely documents an assessment or procedure), they are appropriately and fairly disciplined, which may include dismissal from the program.</p>

                        <p>Every year, national patient safety goals are published by The Joint Commission to improve patient safety. National Patient Safety Goals are goals and recommendations tailored to seven different types of health care agencies based on patient safety data from experts and stakeholders. The seven health care areas include ambulatory health care settings, behavioral health care settings, critical access hospitals, home care, hospital settings, laboratories, nursing care centers, and office-based surgery settings. These goals are updated annually based on safety data and include evidence-based interventions. It is important for nurses and nursing students to be aware of the current National Patient Safety Goals for the settings in which they provide patient care and use the associated recommendations.</p>

                        <p>"Prevent residents from falling" is one of the National Patient Safety Goals for nursing care centers. Patient falls, whether in the nursing care center, home, or hospital, are very common and can cause serious injury and death. Older adults have the highest risk of falling. Each year, 3 million older people are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries, and over 800,000 patients a year are hospitalized because of a head injury or hip fracture resulting from a fall. Many older adults who fall, even if they're not injured, become afraid of falling. This fear may cause them to limit their everyday activities. However, when a person is less active, they become weaker, which further increases their chances of falling.</p>
                        <p>Many conditions contribute to patient falls, including the following:</p>

                        <p>Most falls are caused by a combination of risk factors. The more risk factors a person has, the greater their chances of falling. Many risk factors can be changed or modified to help prevent falls.</p>
                        <p>The Centers for Disease Control has developed a program called "STEADI - Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths & Injuries" to help reduce the risk of older adults from falling at home. Three screening questions to determine risk for falls are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking?</li>
                            <li>Do you have worries about falling?</li>
                            <li>Have you fallen in the past year? If yes, how many times? Were you injured?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the individual answers "Yes" to any of these questions, further assessment of risk factors is performed.</p>

                        <h3>Fall Assessment Tools</h3>
                        <p>By virtue of being ill, all hospitalized patients are at risk for falls, but some patients are at higher risk than others. Assessment is an ongoing process with the goal of identifying a patient's specific risk factors and implementing interventions in their care plan to decrease their risk of falling. Commonly used fall assessment tools used to identify patients at high risk for falls are the Morse Fall Scale and the Hendrich II Fall Risk Model. Key risk factors for falls in hospitalized patients are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>History of falls:</strong> All patients with a recent history of falls, such as a fall in the past three months, should be considered at higher risk for future falls.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mobility problems and use of assistive devices:</strong> Patients who have problems with their gait or require an assistive device (such as a cane or a walker) for mobility are more likely to fall.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Patients on a large number of prescription medications or patients taking medicines that could cause sedation, confusion, impaired balance, or orthostatic blood pressure changes are at higher risk for falls.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mental status:</strong> Patients with delirium, dementia, or psychosis may be agitated and confused, putting them at risk for falls.</li>
                            <li><strong>Incontinence:</strong> Patients who have urinary frequency or who have frequent toileting needs are at higher fall risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>Equipment:</strong> Patients who are tethered to equipment such as an IV pole or a Foley catheter are at higher risk of tripping.</li>
                            <li><strong>Impaired vision:</strong> Patients with impaired vision or those who require glasses but who are not wearing them are at a higher fall risk because of their decreased recognition of an environmental hazard.</li>
                            <li><strong>Orthostatic hypotension:</strong> Patients whose blood pressure drops upon standing often experience light-headedness or dizziness that can cause falls.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Interventions to Prevent Falls</h3>
                        <p>Universal fall precautions are established for all patients to reduce their risk for falling. In addition to universal fall precautions, a care plan is created based on the patient's fall risk assessment findings to address their specific risks and needs.</p>
                        <h4>Universal Fall Precautions</h4>
                        <p>Falls are the most commonly reported patient safety incidents in the acute care setting. Hospitals pose an inherent fall risk due to the unfamiliarity of the environment and various hazards in the hospital room that pose a risk. During inpatient care, nurses assess their patients' risk for falling during every shift and implement interventions to reduce the risk of falling. Universal fall precautions have been developed that apply to all patients all the time. Universal fall precautions are called "universal" because they apply to all patients, regardless of fall risk, and revolve around keeping the patient's environment safe and comfortable.</p>
                        <p>Universal fall precautions include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Familiarize the patient with the environment.</li>
                            <li>Have the patient demonstrate call light use.</li>
                            <li>Maintain the call light within reach. See Figure 5.5 for an image of a call light.</li>
                            <li>Keep the patient's personal possessions within safe reach.</li>
                            <li>Have sturdy handrails in patient bathrooms, rooms, and hallways.</li>
                            <li>Place the hospital bed in the low position when a patient is resting. Raise the bed to a comfortable height when the patient is transferring out of bed.</li>
                            <li>Keep the hospital bed brakes locked.</li>
                            <li>Keep wheelchair wheels in a "locked" position when stationary.</li>
                            <li>Keep no-slip, comfortable, and well-fitting footwear on the patient.</li>
                            <li>Use night lights or supplemental lighting.</li>
                            <li>Keep floor surfaces clean and dry. Clean up all spills promptly.</li>
                            <li>Keep patient care areas uncluttered.</li>
                            <li>Follow safe patient handling practices.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Interventions Based on Risk Factors</h4>
                        <p>Patients at elevated risk for falling require multiple, individualized interventions, in addition to universal fall precautions. There are many interventions available to prevent falls and fall-related injuries based on the patient's specific risk factors. See Table 5.6a for interventions categorized by risk factor.</p>

                        <h3>Definition of Restraints</h3>
                        <p><strong>Restraints</strong> are devices used in health care settings to prevent patients from causing harm to themselves or others when alternative interventions are not effective. A restraint is a device, method, or process that is used for the specific purpose of restricting a patient's freedom of movement without the permission of the person. See Figure 5.6 for an image of a simulated patient with restraints applied.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Restraints include mechanical devices such as a tie wrist device, chemical restraints, or seclusion. The Joint Commission defines <strong>chemical restraint</strong> as a drug used to manage a patient's behavior, restrict the patient's freedom of movement, or impair the patient's ability to appropriately interact with their surroundings that is not standard treatment or dosage for the patient's condition. It is important to note that the definition states the medication "is not standard treatment or dosage for the patient's condition." <strong>Seclusion</strong> is defined as the confinement of a patient in a locked room from which they cannot exit on their own. It is generally used as a method of discipline, convenience, or coercion. Seclusion limits freedom of movement because, although the patient is not mechanically restrained, they cannot leave the area.</p>
                        <p>Although restraints are used with the intention to keep a patient safe, they impact a patient's psychological safety and dignity and can cause additional safety issues and death. A restrained person has a natural tendency to struggle and try to remove the restraint and can fall or become fatally entangled in the restraint. Furthermore, immobility that results from the use of restraints can cause pressure injuries, contractures, and muscle loss. Restraints take a large emotional toll on the patient's self-esteem and may cause humiliation, fear, and anger.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Restraint Guidelines</h3>
                        <p>The American Nurses Association (ANA) has established evidence-based guidelines that state a restraint-free environment is the standard of care. The ANA encourages the participation of nurses to reduce patient restraints and seclusion in all health care settings. Restraining or secluding patients is viewed as contrary to the goals and ethical traditions of nursing because it violates the fundamental patient rights of autonomy and dignity. However, the ANA also recognizes there are times when there is no viable option other than restraints to keep a patient safe, such as during an acute psychotic episode when patient and staff safety are in jeopardy due to aggression or assault. The ANA also states that restraints may be justified in some patients with severe dementia or delirium when they are at risk for serious injuries such as a hip fracture due to falling.</p>
                        <p>The ANA provides the following guidelines: "When restraint is necessary, documentation should be done by more than one witness. Once restrained, the patient should be treated with humane care that preserves human dignity. In those instances where restraint, seclusion, or therapeutic holding is determined to be clinically appropriate and adequately justified, registered nurses who possess the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage the situation must be actively involved in the assessment, implementation, and evaluation of the selected emergency measure, adhering to federal regulations and the standards of The Joint Commission (2009) regarding appropriate use of restraints and seclusion." Nursing documentation typically includes information such as patient behavior necessitating the restraint, alternatives to restraints that were attempted, the type of restraint used, the time it was applied, the location of the restraint, and patient education regarding the restraint.</p>
                        <p>Any health care facility that accepts Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement must follow federal guidelines for the use of restraints. These guidelines include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a restraint is the only viable option, it must be discontinued at the earliest possible time.</li>
                            <li>Orders for the use of seclusion or restraint can never be written as a standing order or PRN (as needed).</li>
                            <li>The treating physician must be consulted as soon as possible if the restraint or seclusion is not ordered by the patient's treating physician.</li>
                            <li>A physician or licensed independent practitioner must see and evaluate the need for the restraint or seclusion within one hour after the initiation.</li>
                            <li>After restraints have been applied, the nurse should follow agency policy for frequent monitoring and regularly changing the patient's position to prevent complications. Nurses must also ensure the patient's basic needs (i.e., hydration, nutrition, and toileting) are met. Some agencies require a 1:1 patient sitter when restraints are applied.</li>
                            <li>Each written order for a physical restraint or seclusion is limited to 4 hours for adults, 2 hours for children and adolescents ages 9 to 17, or 1 hour for patients under 9. The original order may only be renewed in accordance with these limits for up to a total of 24 hours. After the original order expires, a physician or licensed independent practitioner (if allowed under state law) must see and assess the patient before issuing a new order.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Side Rails and Enclosed Beds</h3>
                        <p>Side rails and enclosed beds may also be considered a restraint, depending on the purpose of the device. Recall the definition of a restraint as "a device, method, or process that is used for the specific purpose of restricting a patient's freedom of movement or access to movement without the permission of the person." If the purpose of raising the side rails is to prevent a patient from voluntarily getting out of bed or attempting to exit the bed, then use of the side rails would be considered a restraint. On the other hand, if the purpose of raising the side rails is to prevent the patient from inadvertently falling out of bed, then it is not considered a restraint. If a patient does not have the physical capacity to get out of bed, regardless if side rails are raised or not, then the use of side rails is not considered a restraint.</p>

                        <h3>Hand Mitts</h3>
                        <p>A hand mitt is a large, soft glove that covers a confused patient's hand to prevent them from inadvertently dislodging medical equipment. Hand mitts are considered a restraint by The Joint Commission if used under these circumstances:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are pinned or otherwise attached to the bed or bedding</li>
                            <li>Are applied so tightly that the patient's hands or finger are immobilized</li>
                            <li>Are so bulky that the patient's ability to use their hands is significantly reduced</li>
                            <li>Cannot be easily removed intentionally by the patient in the same manner it was applied by staff, considering the patient's physical condition and ability to accomplish the objective</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It is important for the nurse to be aware of current best practices and guidelines for restraint use because they are continuously changing. For example, meal trays on chairs were previously used in long-term care facilities to prevent residents from getting out of the chair and falling. However, by the definition of a restraint, this action is now considered a restraint and is no longer used. Instead, several alternative interventions to restraints are now being used.</p>

                        <h3>Alternatives to Restraints</h3>
                        <p>Many alternatives to using restraints in long-term care centers have been developed. Most interventions focus on the individualization of patient care and elimination of medications with side effects that cause aggression and the need for restraints. Common interventions used as alternatives to restraints include routine daily schedules, regular feeding times, easing the activities of daily living, and reducing pain.</p>
                        <p>Diversionary techniques such as television, music, games, or looking out a window can also be used to help to calm a restless patient. Encouraging restless patients to spend time in a supervised area, such as a dining room, lounge, or near the nurses' station, helps to prevent their desire to get up and move around. If these techniques are not successful, bed and chair alarms or the use of a sitter at the bedside are also considered alternatives to restraints.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>To promote safety for patients of all ages, nurses should be knowledgeable about safety risks according to age and developmental stages because the types and frequencies of accidents vary among age groups. Information from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) regarding safety tips for each age group is summarized in the following subsections.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Infants and Preschoolers</h3>
                        <p>Drowning is the leading cause of death in children aged 1-3 years. Motor vehicle accidents, falls, choking, and accidental poisoning are also safety concerns for this age group. Infants and toddlers are curious, but they lack the judgement to recognize the dangers of their actions, so childproofing the home and providing adult supervision are essential for this developmental age group. See Figure 5.7 for an image of an infant car seat used to protect infants in the event of a motor vehicle accident. Nurses help educate parents about the proper use, positioning, and installation of car seats.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0347-1.jpg" alt="A newborn baby properly secured in an infant car seat." class="content-image" style="max-width: 400px;">
                            <figcaption>Figure 5.7 Infant Car Seat</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>School-Aged Children</h3>
                        <p>In children aged 4-11, motor vehicle injuries are a major cause of unintentional injury, along with drowning and poisoning. This age group is more aware of dangers and limitations, but adult supervision is still important. The nurse should educate parents of school-aged children about safety seats, booster seats, or shoulder seat belts while riding in the car.</p>
                        <p>Bicycle accidents are also a common concern in this age group. Many bike accidents involve the head or face because of the lack of helmet use. Nurses provide health teaching to school-aged children regarding bicycle safety and helmet use. See Figure 5.8 for an image of a girl wearing a bike helmet.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0349-1.jpg" alt="A young girl wearing a bicycle helmet." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Because this age group is beginning to enjoy more independence, basic instructions and education on how to recognize and respond to potentially dangerous situations with strangers should also be provided. Parents should also be educated about the AMBER alert system that can be activated if a child is missing and believed to be kidnapped or in danger. This AMBER alert system uses the resources of law enforcement and the media to notify the public about a possible abduction or a missing child in danger.</p>
                        <p>Nurses must also be aware of signs of maltreatment and child abuse because millions of children are affected each year. Child abuse includes physical, sexual, emotional abuse, and neglect. According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), after abuse or violence, many children develop mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. These children may also have serious medical problems, learning problems, and problems getting along with friends and family members. Every state has laws that require health care professionals to report suspected child abuse no matter what form this abuse takes.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Child_Abuse_Resource_Center/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about trauma and child abuse at the AACAP Trauma and Child Abuse Resource Center.</a></p>
                        
                        <h3>Adolescents</h3>
                        <p>Motor vehicle accidents are the number one cause of death for adolescents. Teens aged 16-19 are three times more likely to be in a fatal crash than drivers older than age 20. Adolescent males are twice as likely to die in a motor vehicle accident than females of the same age. Texting while driving is a common cause of distracted driving and accidents in adolescents. Because much of an adolescent's time is spent away from the home, it is difficult for parents to control many of the decisions that adolescents make. Nurses educate teenagers to use seat belts, obey speed limits, and never use a cell phone or text while driving. See Figure 5.9 for an image reminding teenage drivers to not text and drive.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) may occur in this age group due to participation in sports and recreation-related activities. TBI results from a blow, jolt, or hit to the head that causes a disruption in blood function or flow to the brain. Nurses should always be alert for indications of a concussion when a sports injury has occurred. Signs of a concussion requiring immediate medical attention include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Headache, vomiting, balance problems, fatigue, or drowsiness</li>
                            <li>A dazed and confused appearance or difficulty concentrating or remembering; confusion</li>
                            <li>Emotional irritability, nervousness, or a change in personality</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The CDC has comprehensive information and education materials for parents, coaches, players, and health care providers as part of their "Heads Up" program.</p>
                        <p>Substance abuse is another significant concern in the adolescent population and includes substances such as tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, prescription medication, over-the-counter medications, and bath salts. The National Institutes of Health provides many resources for educating teens and their parents about substance abuse.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Adults</h3>
                        <p>Intimate partner violence and substance abuse are common safety issues in the adult population.</p>
                        <h4>Intimate Partner Violence</h4>
                        <p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is widespread in the United States and is the most prevalent adult safety issue. Intimate partner violence includes physical or sexual violence, stalking, and psychological or coercive aggression by current or former intimate partners. Victims can be female or male, and sexual orientation can be heterosexual or LGBTQ+. The nurse is often the initial health care professional in contact with a victim of IPV. Prompt recognition of a potential or actual threat to patient and staff safety is crucial. It is often the nurse's assessment that plays an important role in identifying a patient experiencing IPV. Compassion and understanding are important to show to this vulnerable population. Effective communication is necessary to help victims come forward and share their experiences of abuse. IPV is a complex issue, and the patient may not initially consider leaving the abuser as an option. See Figure 5.10 for an image of a sign in a community demonstrating support against domestic violence.</p>

                        <h4>Substance Abuse</h4>
                        <p><strong>Substance abuse</strong> is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a maladaptive pattern of using alcohol and/or drugs despite it causing persistent social, occupational, psychological, or physical problems that can be physically hazardous. Substance abuse continues to be a safety issue that affects adults across all socioeconomic levels. In America over 450,000 people died between 1999 and 2018 as a result of an opioid overdose. The abuse of prescription pain medication (such as oxycontin and fentanyl) and heroin is a national crisis that plagues social and economic welfare. Substance abuse not only affects an individual, but also causes harm to their family members. Early identification of substance abuse, rehabilitation interventions, and continued support are key for helping the individual, as well as their family members, in the recovery process. See Figure 5.11 for an image of a heroin needle found in a community setting.</p>

                        <h3>Older Adults</h3>
                        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, falls and motor vehicle accidents are leading causes of injury in older adults. However, several other issues pose significant hazards for this population, such as fires, accidental overdosing on medications (due to poor eyesight and confusion), elder abuse, and financial exploitation. In most reported cases of elder abuse, a caregiver or a person in trusted relationship is the perpetrator. For various reasons such as fear and disappointment, most of these cases go unreported. Abuse, including neglect and exploitation, is experienced by about 1 in 10 people aged 60 and older who live at home. From 2002 to 2016, more than 643,000 older adults were treated in the emergency department for nonfatal assaults and over 19,000 homicides occurred.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Financial Exploitation of an Older Adult</h4>
                            <p>Consider the story of John, a 92-year-old male who lost his wife over a year ago and has been lonely ever since. He lives alone in a large home in the country. John hired a repairman to fix his roof. The repairman befriended John, bringing him homemade cookies and pies and even running errands for him. The repairman often stayed for coffee, and the two of them spent time talking about fishing and gardening. The repairman convinced John to take out a reverse mortgage to pay for additional improvements on his home. Then, knowing John's bank account numbers and login information, the repairman stole $250,000 that John received for his reverse mortgage.</p>

                        <p>Most victims of elder abuse are frequently seen in the emergency department several times before they are admitted to the hospital. Nurses must be alert to any indications of elder abuse, such as suspicious injuries or behaviors, and report suspected incidents to local adult protective services agencies. Commons signs of elder abuse or maltreatment include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bruises, cuts, burns, or broken bones that are unexplainable or suspiciously explained</li>
                            <li>Malnourishment or weight loss</li>
                            <li>Poor hygiene, an unkempt appearance, unclean clothing, or dirty, matted hair</li>
                            <li>Foul odor from clothing or body</li>
                            <li>Anxiety, depression, or confusion</li>
                            <li>Unexplained transactions or loss of money</li>
                            <li>Withdrawal from family members or friends</li>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>In addition to promoting safety for patients and their families, it is important for nurses to be aware of safety risks in the environments and to take measures to protect themselves. Common safety risks to nurses include sharps injuries, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, lifting injuries, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
                        
                        <h3>Workplace Safety</h3>
                        <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines a healthy environment as a place of physical, mental, and social well-being supporting optimal health and safety. The American Nurses Association (ANA) created the Nurses' Bill of Rights, a document that sets forth seven basic principles concerning expectations for workplace environments. One of the ANA principles states, "Nurses have the right to a work environment that is safe for themselves and their patients." Environmental Health is also one of the ANA Standards of Professional Performance. This standard includes "creating a safe and healthy workplace and professional environment."</p>
                        
                        <h4>Preventing Sharps Injuries and Blood-Borne Pathogen Exposure</h4>
                        <p>Exposure to sharps and blood-borne pathogens is a critical safety issue that nurses face in the workplace. Blood-borne pathogen exposure can cause life-threatening illnesses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Regulations and laws, such as the Blood-borne Pathogen Standard from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act of 2002, have been effective in significantly reducing sharps injuries and blood exposures among health care workers. Areas covered by these regulations include sharps disposal practices, evaluation and selection of safety-engineered sharps devices and personal protective equipment (PPE), training, record keeping for needlestick injuries, hepatitis B vaccination, and post exposure follow-up. Medical device manufacturers have also played an important role in reducing sharps injury risks to health care workers by developing innovative safety-engineered technology, such as needleless IV access devices. While substantial progress has been made to reduce injuries, preventable sharps injuries and blood exposures continue to occur in health care settings. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 385,000 sharps-related injuries occur annually among health care workers in hospitals, but it has been estimated that as many as half of injuries go unreported. See Figure 5.12 of a sharps container used to prevent sharps-related injuries.</p>

                        <p>If you do experience a sharps injury or are exposed to the blood or other body fluid of a patient, follow agency and school policy and immediately follow these steps:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Wash needlesticks and cuts with soap and water.</li>
                            <li>Flush splashes to the nose, mouth, or skin with water.</li>
                            <li>Irrigate eyes with clean water, saline, or sterile irrigants.</li>
                            <li>Report the incident to your supervisor.</li>
                            <li>Immediately seek medical treatment.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Safe Patient Handling</h4>
                        <p>Back injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders can be caused by one bad patient lift or from the daily wear and tear of manually lifting patients. At least 56% of nurses have reported pain from musculoskeletal disorders that were exacerbated by requirements of their job. Consequences of these injuries can be devastating to nurses and their careers; musculoskeletal injuries related to patient handling are responsible for more lost work time, long-term medical care needs, and permanent disabilities than any other work-related injury. Even using proper body mechanics and the use of gait belts can result in patient handling injuries in nurses and health care workers. The ANA has established safe patient handling and mobility initiatives with the goal of complete elimination of manual patient handling. See Figure 5.13 for an example of safe patient handling equipment.</p>

                        <h4>Personal Protective Equipment</h4>
                        <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to their workers and ensure its proper use. In health care settings, the use of PPE includes gloves, gowns, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators according to a patient's condition. Health care workers rely on personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their patients from being infected and infecting others. It is vital to follow agency procedures regarding PPE and transmission precautions to avoid exposure to infectious disease. See Figure 5.14 for an image of health care team members wearing PPE. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic created global shortages of PPE, resulting in many nurses and health care workers being exposed to the fatal disease. The ANA continues to advocate for adequate PPE for nurses in their work environments.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Olson is a 64-year-old patient admitted to the medical surgical floor with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient has severe macular degeneration and limited visual acuity. He is alert and oriented but notes that he has suffered a "few stumbles" at home over the last few weeks. He ambulates without assistance but relies heavily on tactile cues to help provide guidance.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse notes that Mr. Olson's macular degeneration and limited visual acuity pose a significant safety risk. He has reported "stumbling" at home and uses tactile cues to establish room boundaries.</p>
                        <p>Based on the assessment information that has been gathered, the following nursing care plan is created for Mr. Olson.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> Risk for Injury related to physical barrier associated with alteration in visual acuity.</p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will be free from injury or falls.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mr. Olson will be free from injury throughout his hospitalization.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will provide the patient with education regarding the room layout and tactile boundary cues. The nurse will keep the patient's room free from clutter and provide appropriate lighting. The nurse will instruct the patient to utilize the call light and request assistance when ambulating throughout the room. The nurse will provide the patient with nonskid footwear to enhance safety during ambulation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Documentation</h4>
                        <p>Mr. Olson is at risk for injury as a result of his decreased visual acuity and hospitalization in an unfamiliar environment. The patient has been provided education and safety equipment to decrease his risk of injury. The patient has received education regarding the room layout and has been encouraged to request assistance when ambulating about the room.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>During the patient's hospitalization, Mr. Olson utilizes the recommended safety equipment and requests assistance when ambulating and no falls occurred. SMART outcome was "met."</p>

                        <h3>Handoff Report</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Moore is a 72-year-old widower recovering in the hospital after sustaining injuries he received from a fall he sustained at home. He fractured his right hip and underwent surgical repair two days ago. He is receiving IV fluids and morphine for pain control. He has a history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. He wears glasses and hearing aids.</p>
                        <p>Per recommendations from the physical therapist, he is able to transfer with one assist with a walker, but is weak on his right side. He has an order to ambulate at least 100 feet four times daily with a wheeled walker. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 165 pounds. Prior to the fall, he lived at home alone independently, and he is looking forward to returning home.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>The nurse collects the following assessment findings:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vital Signs: Blood pressure 90/60, heart rate 56, respiratory rate 18, temperature 37 degrees Celsius, pulse oximetry reading 92%, current pain level 0</li>
                            <li>Alert and oriented x3 to person, place, and time</li>
                            <li>Lungs clear</li>
                            <li>Cardiovascular Assessment: Heart rate is regular, capillary refill less than 3 seconds in fingers and toes, pedal pulses 2+</li>
                            <li>Right lower extremity strength is 1+ (weak)</li>
                            <li>Ambulates with walker with assistance; gait is unsteady</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Critical Thinking Questions</h4>
                        <ol>

                            <li>Use half side rails to prevent falls from the bed.</li>
                            <li>Monitor gait, balance, and fatigue with ambulation and encourage resting as needed.</li>
                            <li>Place personal items within easy reach of the patient at the bedside.</li>
                            <li>Provide an elevated toilet seat.</li>
                            <li>Encourage the use of prescribed glasses and hearing aids when walking.</li>
                            <li>Obtain orthostatic blood pressures daily and notify the provider as indicated.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the patient wears shoes that fit properly, are fastened securely, and have no-skid soles.</li>
                            <li>Suggest home adaptations to improve safety after discharge, such as adjusting the toilet seat height, installing grab bars in the bathroom, and using a rubber mat in the shower.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Critical Thinking Question</h4>
                        <ol start="3">
                            <li>What additional interventions could be implemented for Mr. Moore to reduce his risk of falls that target his specific risk factors?</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Implementation of Interventions</h3>
                        <p>The following day, upon entering the room, you find Mr. Moore has climbed out of bed and is on his way to the bathroom. He states, "I need to go to the bathroom for a bowel movement and didn't have time to ring the call light and wait." You assist him with his walker, but he seems unsteady on his feet as he walks toward the bathroom.</p>
                        <p>You're not sure if he will make it to the toilet without falling. He says, "We need to hurry or I'm not going to make it."</p>
                        
                        <h4>Critical Thinking Question:</h4>

                            <li>What is the best response?</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>The nurse evaluates Mr. Moore's progress based on the established expected outcomes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mr. Moore will not experience a fall during hospitalization: <strong>Outcome Met</strong>.</li>
                            <li>Mr. Moore will use his assistive device (walker) correctly during hospitalization: <strong>Outcome Partially Met</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Mr. Moore forgets to call for assistance and uses a walker when he needs to go to the bathroom. A "stop" sign has been placed within patient view to remind him to use the call light before getting up. In addition to hourly rounding, toileting will be performed at scheduled intervals every two hours. An icon has been posted on the doorframe to alert staff that the patient is at high risk for falls. In addition to the bed being kept low and locked, a mat will be placed next to the bed at night. If Mr. Moore continues to forget to call for assistance, a bed alarm will be placed to alert staff of movement so that quick assistance can be offered.</p>
