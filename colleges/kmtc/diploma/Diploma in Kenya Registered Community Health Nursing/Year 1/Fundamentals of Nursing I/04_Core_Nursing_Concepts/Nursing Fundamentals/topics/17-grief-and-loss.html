                        <p>Have you ever experienced the loss of something important to you like a job, a relationship with a friend or significant other, or a pet? We all experience loss and grief at some point in our lives, with the ultimate loss being death. Nurses are typically the first line of support as they assist patients and their family members to cope with serious illness, feelings of loss, and the end of life.</p>
                        <p>This chapter is based on a curriculum established by the End-of-Life Nursing Care Consortium (ELNEC), an international educational project sponsored by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. The ELNEC project gives nurses and other health care professionals the knowledge and skills required to provide specialized care and positively impact the lives of patients and families facing serious illness and/or the end of life. This chapter will discuss concepts related to grief and loss and evidence-based interventions advocated by the ELNEC.</p>

                        <span class="heading-text">17.2 Basic Concepts</span>
                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Three major concepts associated with grieving are loss, grief, and mourning. <strong>Loss</strong> is the absence of a possession or future possession with the response of grief and the expression of mourning. The feeling of loss can be associated with the loss of health, changes in relationships and roles, and eventually the loss of life. After a patient dies, the family members and other survivors experience loss.</p>
                        <p><strong>Grief</strong> is the emotional response to a loss, defined as the individualized and personalized feelings and responses that an individual makes to real, perceived, or anticipated loss. These feelings may include anger, frustration, loneliness, sadness, guilt, regret, and peace. Grief affects survivors physically, psychologically, socially, and spiritually. The grief process is not orderly and predictable. Emotional oscillation is normal and expected. There are times when the person experiencing the loss feels in control and accepting, and there are other times when the loss feels unbearable and they feel out of control. See Figure 17.1 for an image of an individual experiencing grief.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-1104-1.jpg" alt="A person sits with their head in their hands, expressing feelings of grief and loss." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Mourning</strong> is the outward, social expression of loss. Individuals outwardly express loss based on their cultural norms, customs, and practices, including rituals and traditions. Some cultures may be very emotional and verbal in their expression of loss, such as wailing or crying loudly. Other cultures are stoic and show very little reaction to loss. Culture also dictates how long one mourns and how the mourners "should" act. The expression of loss is also affected by an individual's personality and previous life experiences.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Types of Grief</h3>
                        <p>There are five different categories of grief: anticipatory grief, acute grief, normal grief, disenfranchised grief, and complicated grief.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Anticipatory Grief</h4>
                        <p><strong>Anticipatory grief</strong> is defined as grief before a loss, associated with diagnosis of an acute, chronic, and/or terminal illness experienced by the patient, family, or caregivers. Examples of anticipatory grief include actual or fear of potential loss of health, independence, body part, financial stability, choice, or mental function.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Acute Grief</h4>
                        <p><strong>Acute grief</strong> begins immediately after the death of a loved one and includes the separation response and response to stress. During this period of acute grief, the bereaved person may be confused and/or uncertain about their identity or social role. They may disengage from their usual activities and experience disbelief and shock that their loved one is gone. See Figure 17.2 for an image of a sculpture depicting acute grief.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-1106-1.jpg" alt="A sculpture showing a figure in a state of intense sorrow and shock, representing acute grief." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Normal Grief</h4>
                        <p><strong>Normal grief</strong> includes the common feelings, behaviors, and reactions to loss. Normal grief reactions to a loss can include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Physical symptoms</strong> such as hollowness in the stomach, tightness in the chest, weakness, heart palpitations, sensitivity to noise, breathlessness, tension, lack of energy, and dry mouth</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional symptoms</strong> such as numbness, sadness, fear, anger, shame, loneliness, relief, emancipation, yearning, anxiety, guilt, self-reproach, helplessness, and abandonment</li>
                            <li><strong>Cognitive symptoms</strong> such as a state of depersonalization, confusion, inability to concentrate, dreams of the deceased, idealization of the deceased, or a sense of presence of the deceased</li>
                            <li><strong>Behavioral signs</strong> such as impaired work performance, crying, withdrawal, overreactivity, changed relationships, or avoidance of reminders of the deceased</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Disenfranchised Grief</h4>
                        <p><strong>Disenfranchised grief</strong> is grief over any loss that is not validated or recognized. Those affected by this type of grief do not feel the freedom to openly acknowledge their grief. Individuals at risk for disenfranchised grief are those who have lost loved ones to stigmatized illnesses or events, such as AIDS. Mothers and/or fathers may grieve over terminated pregnancies or stillborn babies. The loss of a previously severed relationship or divorce can contribute to this type of grief because the individual may not be able to mourn openly due to the circumstances surrounding the relationship.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Complicated Grief</h4>
                        <p><strong>Complicated grief</strong> is seen in 10-20% of individuals experiencing the death of a romantic partner and with higher estimates for parents who have lost a child. According to the ELNEC, there are four types of complicated grief, including chronic grief, delayed grief, exaggerated grief, and masked grief. Risk factors for developing complicated grief include sudden or traumatic death, suicide, homicide, a dependent relationship with the deceased, chronic illness, death of a child, multiple losses, unresolved grief from prior losses, concurrent stressors, witnessing a difficult dying process such as pain and suffering, lack of support systems, and lack of a faith system.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Chronic Grief:</strong> Normal grief reactions that do not subside and continue over very long periods of time.</li>
                            <li><strong>Delayed Grief:</strong> Normal grief reactions that are suppressed or postponed by the survivor consciously or unconsciously to avoid the pain of the loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exaggerated Grief:</strong> An intense reaction to grief that may include nightmares, delinquent behaviors, phobias, and thoughts of suicide.</li>
                            <li><strong>Masked Grief:</strong> Grief that occurs when the survivor is not aware of behaviors that interfere with normal functioning as a result of the loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Stages of Grief</h3>
                        <p>There are several stages of grief that may occur following a loss. Famed Swiss psychiatrist Elizabeth Kubler-Ross identified five main stages of grief in her book <em>On Death and Dying</em>. Patients and families may experience these stages along a continuum, move randomly and repeatedly from stage to stage, or skip stages altogether. There is no one correct way to grieve, and an individual's specific needs and feelings must remain central to care planning.</p>
                        <p>Kubler-Ross identified that patients and families demonstrate various characteristic responses to grief and loss. These stages include denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance, commonly referred to by the mnemonic "DABDA." See Figure 17.3 for an illustration of the Kubler-Ross Grief Cycle.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-1109-1.jpg" alt="A graph of the Kübler-Ross Grief Cycle, showing a curve that moves through stages: Shock, Denial, Frustration, Depression, Experiment, Decision, and Integration, with axes for Morale/Competence and Time." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Denial</h4>
                        <p><strong>Denial</strong> occurs when the individual refuses to acknowledge the loss or pretends it isn't happening. This stage is characterized by an individual stating, "This can't be happening." The feeling of denial is self-protective as an individual attempts to numb overwhelming emotions as they process the information. See Figure 17.4 for an image of a person reacting with denial.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-1110-1.jpg" alt="A person with a disgusted expression, holding up their hands in a gesture of denial." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Anger</h4>
                        <p><strong>Anger</strong> in the grief process often masks pain and sadness. The subject of anger can be quite variable; anger can be directed to the individual who was lost, internalized to self, or projected toward others. See Figure 17.5 for an image of a patient experiencing anger.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-1112-1.jpg" alt="An older man with an angry and frustrated expression on his face." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Bargaining</h4>
                        <p><strong>Bargaining</strong> can occur during the grief process in an attempt to regain control of the loss. When individuals enter this phase, they are looking to find ways to change or negotiate the outcome by making a deal.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Depression</h4>
                        <p>Feelings of <strong>depression</strong> can occur with intense sadness over the loss of a loved one or the situation. Depression can cause loss of interest in activities, people, or relationships that previously brought one satisfaction. See Figure 17.6 for an image of a patient demonstrating feelings of depression.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-1114-1.jpg" alt="A person sitting with their head down, conveying a strong sense of depression and sadness." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Acceptance</h4>
                        <p><strong>Acceptance</strong> refers to an individual understanding the loss and knowing it will be hard but acknowledging the new reality. The acceptance phase does not mean absence of sadness but is the acknowledgement of one's capabilities in coping with the grief experience. See Figure 17.7 of an image of a patient who has reached acceptance.</p>

                        <h3>Grief Tasks</h3>
                        <p>Other experts also describe the grieving process in terms of tasks that one must accomplish. These tasks include notification and shock, experiencing the loss, and reintegration.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Notification and shock:</strong> This phase occurs when a person first learns of the loss and experiences feelings of numbness or shock. The first task for the person to complete is to acknowledge the reality of the loss.</li>
                            <li><strong>Experiencing the loss:</strong> The second task involves experiencing the loss emotionally and cognitively. The person must work through the pain by reacting to, expressing, and experiencing the pain of separation and grief.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reintegration:</strong> The third task involves reorganization and restructuring of family systems and relationships by adjusting to the environment without the deceased.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Palliative Care and Hospice</h3>
                        <p><strong>Palliative care</strong> is a broad philosophy of care defined by the World Health Organization as improving the quality of life of patients with life-limiting illnesses, as well as their family members, through the prevention and relief of physical, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering. <strong>Hospice care</strong> is a type of palliative care that addresses care for patients who are terminally ill when a health care provider has determined they are expected to live six months or less. In hospice, curative treatments are stopped, and the focus is on providing comfort. See Figure 17.8 for an image of a patient receiving hospice care.</p>

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h3>Ethical and Legal Considerations</h3>
                        <p>A <strong>do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order</strong> is a medical order that instructs health care professionals not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if a patient's breathing stops or their heart stops beating. <strong>Advance directives</strong> include the health care power of attorney and living will. The <strong>health care power of attorney</strong> legally identifies a trusted individual to serve as a decision maker for health issues when the patient is no longer able to speak for themselves. A <strong>living will</strong> is a legal document that describes the patient's wishes if they are no longer able to speak for themselves due to injury, illness, or a persistent vegetative state.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Care of the Family</h3>
                        <p>When caring for a patient who is nearing the end of life, the family members require nursing care as well. <strong>Fading away</strong> is a transition that families make when they realize their seriously ill family member is dying. Nurses can assist patients and family members during the fading away transition by being present and actively listening.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Caregiver Support</h3>
                        <p>It is important for nurses to assess the caregiver when seeing them with the patient and provide encouragement. It is helpful to acknowledge their work is very difficult and to praise them for their efforts. See Figure 17.9 for an image of a mother acting as caregiver and supporting her son's health.</p>

                        <p>When assessing patients, family members, and caregivers, it is important to respect their values, beliefs, and traditions related to health, illness, family caregiver roles, and decision-making. See Figure 17.10 for an image of a community grieving.</p>

                        <h3>A Good Death</h3>
                        <p>Research has found several themes that define a "good death" when nurses and the interdisciplinary team are caring for dying patients and their families:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patient preferences are met.</li>
                            <li>The patient is pain-free with emotional well-being.</li>
                            <li>Dignity and respect are demonstrated for the patient.</li>
                            <li>The patient has a sense of life completion.</li>
                            <li>Spirituality and religious comfort are provided.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Bereavement</h3>
                        <p><strong>Bereavement</strong> includes grief (the inner feelings) and mourning (the outward reactions) after a loved one has died. A bereavement period is the time it takes for the mourner to feel the pain of the loss, mourn, grieve, and adjust to the world without the presence of the deceased. See Figure 17.12 for an image depicting bereavement by family members.</p>

                        <h3>Self-Care</h3>
                        <p>It is important for nurses to recognize that providing end-of-life care can have a significant impact on them. <strong>Compassion fatigue</strong> is a state of chronic and continuous self-sacrifice and/or prolonged exposure to difficult situations that affect a health care professional's physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. <strong>Burnout</strong> can be manifested physically and psychologically with a loss of motivation. See Figure 17.17 for an image depicting a nurse experiencing burnout.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Grief can be manifested by physical, emotional, and cognitive symptoms. Physical symptoms can occur, such as feeling ill, headaches, tremors, muscle aches, exhaustion, insomnia, loss of appetite, or weight loss or gain. Cognitive symptoms may occur, such as lack of concentration, confusion, and hallucinations. Emotional symptoms, such as anxiety, guilt, anger, fear, sadness, helplessness, or feelings of relief may occur.</p>
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>See Table 17.3 for definitions and selected defining characteristics of the NANDA-I diagnoses Grieving and Complicated Grieving.</p>

                        <p>Goal setting and outcome identification for patients and family members experiencing grief are customized to the specific situation and focus on grief resolution.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Planning and Implementing Interventions</h3>
                        <p>The most important intervention that nurses can provide is active listening and offering a supportive presence. Interventions to facilitate grief resolution focus on coping enhancement, anticipatory grieving interventions, and grief work facilitation.</p>

                        <p>Recognizing approaching death allows the patient, family members, and interdisciplinary team to prepare for the actively dying phase. The nurse has two primary responsibilities at this time: providing symptom management and preparing the family for what to expect as death is approaching.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Managing Common Symptoms During the Dying Process</h3>
                        <p>Pain, dyspnea, and terminal secretions are common symptoms. Opioids like morphine can be used to manage pain and "air hunger." Anticholinergic medications can be used to dry terminal secretions, also known as the "death rattle." The "Rule of Double Effect" morally justifies administering medication to relieve suffering, even if it unintentionally hastens death.</p>

                        <h3>Phases of Dying</h3>
                        <p>There are typically four phases that a person progresses through when dying. These phases include actively dying, transitioning, imminent death, and death.</p>
                        <p>Death will occur at any point during the imminent phase due to multisystem organ failure. See Table 17.5 for typical signs that indicate that death is imminent.</p>

                        <h3>Death and Postmortem Care</h3>
                        <p><strong>Clinical death</strong> occurs when blood circulation ceases, the heart stops beating, and respirations stop. Within 4-6 minutes, CPR can be performed to attempt resuscitation. After this time window, <strong>biological death</strong> occurs. The nurse should listen to the apical heartbeat for one full minute to ensure and document that death has occurred.</p>
                        <p>Care following a patient's death requires sensitivity for the dignity of the deceased, as well as time for the care of family members. Medical supplies and equipment tubes should be removed unless a coroner must approve of such measures. Bathing, dressing, and positioning the body show respect and provide dignity for the patient and family.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Yun is a 34-year-old man presenting to his physician's office with complaints of difficulty concentrating, sadness, and anxiety. The patient recently experienced the loss of his wife in a motor vehicle accident and reports difficulty sleeping and weight loss of greater than 15 pounds in the previous month. He reports feeling "hopeless" and "angry at God" for the loss that he has experienced. He states he used to attend religious services with his wife, but "That was really more of 'her' thing. I really don't know what to believe anymore."</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse notes that the patient is experiencing difficulty concentrating, feelings of sadness and hopelessness, and reported anxiety. He self-reports feeling hopeless, feelings of anger toward God, and uncertainty in his belief system.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Ineffective Coping related to inability to deal with a situation as manifested by unintended weight loss, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, and drinking 5-6 alcoholic beverages daily to "numb myself."</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will demonstrate improved coping.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mr. Yun will verbalize three positive coping behaviors by the end of the teaching session.</p>
