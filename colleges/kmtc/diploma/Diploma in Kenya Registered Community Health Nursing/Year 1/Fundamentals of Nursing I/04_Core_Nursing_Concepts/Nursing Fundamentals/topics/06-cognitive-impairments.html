                        <p>Cognition is the term used to describe our ability to think. As humans, we are continually receiving input from the world around us and making decisions about how to respond. Some of these decisions are made with awareness, while others are reflexive responses. Infants develop cognitively based on their experiences with their environment. Cognitive processes continue to develop throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood as we learn how to adapt and use knowledge to solve problems and reach desired outcomes.</p>
                        <p>Many factors can influence an individual's continuously-evolving cognitive function from fetal development through adulthood. For example, diseases and health conditions can impair a person's cognitive development and functioning during childhood and beyond. Impaired ability to think and make decisions can be temporarily affected by things such as infection, alcohol, drugs and medications, poor oxygenation, stress, or grief. Sensory deficits and sensory overload can also affect the ability to process information. (See the "Sensory Impairments" chapter for more information on this topic.)</p>
                        <p>Nurses monitor for changes in mental status and report them to health care providers to assist in the diagnosis and treatment for underlying causes of impairment. This chapter will review cognitive development, as well as common acute and chronic cognitive impairments in adults.</p>

                        <p>Before learning about cognitive impairment, it is important to understand the physiological processes of normal growth and development. <strong>Growth</strong> includes physical changes that occur during the development of an individual beginning at the time of conception. <strong>Development</strong> encompasses these biological changes, as well as social and cognitive changes that occur continuously throughout our lives. Cognition starts at birth and continues throughout the life span. See Figure 6.1 for an image of the human life cycle.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0381-1.jpg" alt="A series of images showing the human life cycle from infancy, to childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age." class="content-image">

                        <p>There are multiple factors that affect human cognitive development. While there are expected milestones along the way, cognitive development encompasses several different skills that develop at different rates. Cognition takes the form of many paths leading to unique developmental ends. Each human has their own individual experience that influences development of intelligence and reasoning as they interact with one another. With these unique experiences, everyone has a memory of feelings and events that is exclusive to them.</p>
                        <h3>Developmental Stages</h3>
                        <p>As newborns, we learn behavior and communication to help us to interact with the world around us and to fulfill our needs. For example, crying provides communication to cue parents or caregivers about a newborn's needs. The human brain undergoes tremendous development throughout the first year of life. As infants receive and experience input from the environment, they begin to interact with the individuals around them as they learn and grow.</p>
                        <p>Jean Piaget, a well-known cognitive development theorist, noted that children explore the world as they attempt to make sense of their experiences. His theory explains that humans move from one stage to another as they seek cognitive equilibrium and mental balance. There are four stages in Piaget's theory of development that occur in children from all cultures:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first stage is the <strong>Sensorimotor period</strong>. It extends from birth to approximately two years and is a period of rapid cognitive growth. During this period, infants develop an understanding of the world by coordinating sensory experiences (seeing, hearing) with motor actions (reaching, touching). The main development during the sensorimotor stage is the understanding that objects exist and events occur in the world independently of one's own actions. Infants develop an understanding of what they want and what they must do to have their needs met. They begin to understand language used by those around them to make needs met.</li>
                            <li>Infants progress from the Sensorimotor period to a <strong>Pre-Operational period</strong> in their toddler years. This continues through early school age years. This is the time frame when children learn to think in images and symbols. Play is an important part of cognitive development during this period.</li>
                            <li>Older school age children (age 7 years to 11 years) enter a <strong>Concrete Operations period</strong>. They learn to think in terms of processes and can understand that there is more than one perspective when discussing a concept. This stage is considered a major turning point in the child's cognitive development because it marks the beginning of logical or operational thought.</li>
                            <li>Adolescents transition to the <strong>Formal Operations stage</strong> around age 12 as they become self-conscious and egocentric. As adolescents enter this stage, they gain the ability to think in an abstract manner by manipulating ideas in their head. Moving toward adulthood, this further develops into the ability to critically reason.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cognitive impairments in children range from mild impairment in these specific operations to profound intellectual impairments leading to minimal independent functioning. <strong>Cognitive impairment</strong> is a term used to describe impairment in mental processes that drive how an individual understands and acts in the world, affecting the acquisition of information and knowledge. The following areas are domains of cognitive functioning:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Attention</li>
                            <li>Decision-making</li>
                            <li>General knowledge</li>
                            <li>Judgment</li>
                            <li>Language</li>
                            <li>Memory</li>
                            <li>Perception</li>
                            <li>Planning</li>
                            <li>Reasoning</li>
                            <li>Visuospatial</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Intellectual disability</strong> (formerly referred to as mental retardation) is a diagnostic term that describes intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits identified during the developmental period. In the United States, the developmental period refers to the span of time prior to the age 18. Children with intellectual disabilities may demonstrate a delay in developmental milestones (e.g., sitting, speaking, walking) or demonstrate mild cognitive impairments that may not be identified until school age. Intellectual disability is typically nonprogressive and lifelong. It is diagnosed by multidisciplinary clinical assessments and standardized testing and is treated with a multidisciplinary treatment plan that maximizes quality of life. See Figure 6.2 for an image of an adolescent with an intellectual disability participating in a Special Olympics event.</p>

                        <h3>Adults and Older Adults</h3>
                        <p>There are several physical changes that occur in the brain due to aging. The structure of neurons change, including a decreased number and length of dendrites, loss of dendritic spines, a decrease in the number of axons, an increase in axons with segmental demyelination, and a significant loss of synapses. Loss of synapse is a key marker of aging in the nervous system. These physical changes occur in older adults experiencing cognitive impairments, as well as in those who do not. See Figure 6.3 of an older adult experiencing typical physical changes of aging.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0386-1.jpg" alt="Portrait of an older adult woman, showing typical physical changes of aging." class="content-image" style="max-width: 400px;">

                        </figure>
                        <p>It is a common myth that all individuals experience cognitive impairments as they age. Many people are afraid of growing older because they fear becoming forgetful, confused, and incapable of managing their daily life leading to incorrect perceptions and ageism. <strong>Ageism</strong> refers to stereotyping older individuals because of their age. Losing language skills, becoming unable to make decisions appropriately, and being disoriented to self or surroundings are not normal aging changes.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Dementia, Delirium, and Depression</h3>
                        <p>If changes in cognition in adults do occur, a complete assessment is required to determine the underlying cause of the change and if it is caused by an acute or chronic condition. For example, dementia is a chronic condition that affects cognition whereas depression and delirium can cause acute confusion with a similar clinical appearance to dementia.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Dementia</h4>
                        <p><strong>Dementia</strong> is a chronic condition of impaired cognition, caused by brain disease or injury, and marked by personality changes, memory deficits, and impaired reasoning. Dementia can be caused by a group of conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontal-temporal dementia, and Lewy body disease. Clinical manifestations of dementia include forgetfulness, impaired social skills, and impaired decision-making and thinking abilities that interfere with daily living. It is gradual, progressive, and irreversible. While dementia is not reversible, appropriate assessment and nursing care improve the safety and quality of life for those affected by dementia.</p>
                        <p>As dementia progresses and cognition continues to deteriorate, nursing care must be individualized to meet the needs of the patient and family. Providing patient safety and maintaining quality of life while meeting physical and psychosocial needs are important aspects of nursing care. Unsafe behaviors put individuals with dementia at increased risk for injury. These unsafe or inappropriate behaviors often occur due to the patient having a need or emotion without the ability to express it, such as pain, hunger, anxiety, or the need to use the bathroom. The patient's family/caregivers require education and support to recognize that behaviors are often a symptom of dementia and/or a communication of a need and to help them to best meet the needs of their family member.</p>

                        <h4>Delirium</h4>
                        <p><strong>Delirium</strong> is an acute state of cognitive impairment that typically occurs suddenly due to a physiological cause, such as infection, hypoxia, electrolyte imbalances, drug effects, or other acute brain injury. Sensory overload, excess stress, and sleep deprivation can also cause delirium. Hospitalized older adults are at increased risk for developing delirium, especially if they have been previously diagnosed with dementia. One third of patients aged 70 years or older exhibit delirium during their hospitalization. Delirium is the most common surgical complication for older adults, occurring in 15 to 25% of patients after major elective surgery and up to 50% of patients experiencing hip-fracture repair or cardiac surgery.</p>
                        <p>The symptoms of delirium usually start suddenly, over a few hours or a few days, and they often come and go. Common symptoms include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Changes in alertness (usually most alert in the morning and decreased at night)</li>
                            <li>Changing levels of consciousness</li>
                            <li>Confusion</li>
                            <li>Disorganized thinking or talking in a way that do not make sense</li>
                            <li>Disrupted sleep patterns or sleepiness</li>
                            <li>Emotional changes: anger, agitation, depression, irritability, overexcitement</li>
                            <li>Hallucinations and delusions</li>
                            <li>Incontinence</li>
                            <li>Memory problems, especially with short-term memory</li>
                            <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Delirium and dementia have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. They can also occur together.</p>
                        <p>Nurses must closely monitor the cognitive function of all patients and promptly report any changes in mental status to the health care provider. The provider will take a medical history, perform a physical and neurological examination, perform mental status testing, and may order diagnostic tests based on the patient's medical history. After the cause of delirium is determined, treatment is targeted to the cause to reverse the effects. See Figure 6.4 for an illustration of an older adult experiencing delirium.</p>

                        <p>General interventions to prevent and treat delirium in older adults are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Control the environment. Make sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, have clocks or calendars in view, and encourage family members to visit.</li>
                            <li>Ensure a safe environment with the call light within reach and side rails up as indicated.</li>
                            <li>Administer prescribed medications, including those that control aggression or agitation, and pain relievers if there is pain.</li>
                            <li>Ensure the patient has their glasses, hearing aids, or other assistive devices for communication in place. Lack of assistive sensory devices can worsen delirium.</li>
                            <li>Avoid sedatives. Sedatives can worsen delirium.</li>
                            <li>Assign the same staff for patient care when possible.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Depression</h4>
                        <p><strong>Depression</strong> is a brain disorder with a variety of causes, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. It is a commonly untreated condition in older adults that can result in impaired cognition and difficulty in making decisions. It is likely to occur in response to major life events involving health and loved ones. Having other chronic health problems, such as diabetes, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cancer, heart disease, and kidney disease, increases the likelihood for depression in older adults and can cause the loss of their ability to maintain independence. See Figure 6.5 for an illustration of an older adult experiencing symptoms of depression.</p>

                            <li>Feeling sad or "empty"</li>

                            <li>Overeating or not wanting to eat at all</li>
                            <li>Not being able to sleep or sleeping too much</li>
                            <li>Feeling very tired</li>
                            <li>Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty</li>
                            <li>Aches, pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems</li>
                            <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Depression is treatable with medication and psychotherapy. However, older adults have an increased risk for suicide, with the suicide rates for individuals over age 85 years the second highest rate overall. Nurses should provide appropriate screening to detect potential signs of depression as an important part of promoting health for older adults.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Comparison of Three Conditions</h3>
                        <p>When an older adult presents with confusion, determining if it is caused by delirium, dementia, depression, or a combination of these conditions can pose many challenges to the health care team. It is helpful to know the patient's baseline mental status from a family member, caregiver, or previous health care records. If a patient's baseline mental status is not known, it is an important patient safety consideration to assume that confusion is caused by delirium with a thorough assessment for underlying causes. See Table 6.2 for a comparison of symptoms of dementia, delirium, and depression.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p><strong>Alzheimer's disease</strong> is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and eventually the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia. In most people with Alzheimer's disease, symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. One in ten Americans age 65 and older has Alzheimer's disease.</p>
                        <p>Scientists continue to unravel the complex brain changes involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. It is thought that changes in the brain may begin a decade or more before memory and other cognitive problems appear. Abnormal deposits of proteins form amyloid plaques and tau tangles throughout the brain. Previously healthy neurons stop functioning, lose connections with other neurons, and die. The damage initially appears to take place in the hippocampus and cortex, the parts of the brain essential in forming memories. As more neurons die, additional parts of the brain are affected and begin to shrink. By the final stage of Alzheimer's, damage is widespread, and brain tissue has shrunk significantly. See Figure 6.6 for an image of the changes occurring in the brain during Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                        <h3>Symptoms of Early Alzheimer's Disease</h3>
                        <p>There are ten symptoms of early Alzheimer's disease:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Forgetting recently learned information that disrupts daily life.</strong> This includes forgetting important dates or events, asking the same questions over and over, and increasingly needing to rely on memory aids (e.g., reminder notes or electronic devices) or family members for things they used to handle on their own. This is different than a typical age-related change of sometimes forgetting names or appointments, but remembering them later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Challenges in planning or solving problems.</strong> This includes changes in an individual's ability to develop and follow a plan or work with numbers. For example, they may have trouble following a familiar recipe or keeping track of monthly bills. They may have difficulty concentrating and take much longer to do things than they did before. This is different from a typical age-related change of making occasional errors when managing finances or household bills.</li>
                            <li><strong>Difficulty completing familiar tasks.</strong> This includes trouble driving to a familiar location, organizing a grocery list, or remembering the rules of a favorite game. This symptom is different from a typical age-related change of occasionally needing help to use microwave settings or to record a TV show.</li>
                            <li><strong>Confusion with time or place.</strong> This includes losing track of dates, seasons, and the passage of time. Individuals may have trouble understanding something if it is not happening immediately. Sometimes they may forget where they are or how they got there. This symptom is different from a typical age-related change of forgetting the date or day of the week but figuring it out later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships.</strong> Vision problems that include difficulty judging distance, determining color or contrast, or causing issues with balance or driving can be symptoms of Alzeheimer's. This is different from a typical age-related change of blurred vision related to presbyopia or cataracts. (See the "Sensory Impairments" chapter for more information on common vision problems.)</li>
                            <li><strong>New problems with words in speaking or writing.</strong> Individuals with Alzheimer's may have trouble following or joining a conversation. They may stop in the middle of a conversation and have no idea how to continue or they may repeat themselves. They may struggle with vocabulary, have trouble naming a familiar object, or use the wrong name (e.g., calling a "watch" a "hand-clock"). This is different from a typical age-related change of having trouble finding the right word.</li>
                            <li><strong>Misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps.</strong> A person with Alzheimer's disease may put things in unusual places. They may lose things and be unable to go back over their steps to find them again. They may accuse others of stealing, especially as the disease progresses. This is different from a typical age-related change of misplacing things from time to time and retracing steps to find them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decreased or poor judgment.</strong> Individuals with Alzheimer's may experience changes in judgment or decision-making. For example, they may use poor judgment when dealing with money or pay less attention to grooming or keeping themselves clean. This is different from a typical age-related change of making a bad decision or mistake once in a while, like neglecting to change the oil in the car.</li>
                            <li><strong>Withdrawal from work or social activities.</strong> A person living with Alzheimer's disease may experience changes in the ability to hold or follow a conversation. As a result, he or she may withdraw from hobbies, social activities, or other engagements. They may have trouble keeping up with a favorite team or activity. This is different from a typical age-related change of sometimes feeling uninterested in family or social obligations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Changes in mood and personality.</strong> Individuals living with Alzheimer's may experience mood and personality changes. They can become confused, suspicious, depressed, fearful, or anxious. They may be easily upset at home, with friends, or when out of their comfort zone. This is different from a typical age-related change of developing very specific ways of doing things and becoming irritable when a routine is disrupted.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Three Stages of Dementia</h3>
                        <p>There are three stages of dementia: early, moderate, and advanced. Early stages of dementia include the ten symptoms previously discussed. Patients with moderate dementia require additional assistance with reminders to eat, wash, and use the restroom. They may not recognize family and friends. Behavioral symptoms such as wandering, getting lost, hallucinations, delusions, and repetitive behavior may occur. Patients living at home may engage in risky behavior, such as leaving the house in clothing inappropriate for weather conditions or leaving on the stove burners. Patients with advanced dementia require full assistance in washing, dressing, eating, and toileting. They often have urinary and bowel incontinence. Their gait becomes shuffled or unsteady. There may be increased aggressive behavior, disinhibition, or inappropriate laughing. Eventually they have difficulty eating, swallowing, and speaking, and seizures may develop. See Figure 6.7 of a patient with dementia requiring assistance with dressing.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>There is no single diagnostic test that can determine if a person has Alzheimer's disease. Health care providers use a patient's medical history, mental status tests, physical and neurological exams, and diagnostic tests to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. During the neurological exam, reflexes, coordination, muscle tone and strength, eye movement, speech, and sensation are tested.</p>
                        <p>Mental status testing evaluates memory, thinking, and simple problem-solving abilities. Some tests are brief, whereas others can be more time-intensive and complex. These tests give an overall sense of whether a person is aware of their symptoms; knows the date, time, and place where they are; can remember a short list of words; and if they can follow instructions and do simple calculations. The Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and Mini-Cog test are two commonly used assessments.</p>
                        <p>During the MMSE, a health professional asks a patient a series of questions designed to test a range of everyday mental skills. The maximum MMSE score is 30 points. A score of 20 to 24 suggests mild dementia, 13 to 20 suggests moderate dementia, and less than 12 indicates severe dementia. On average, the MMSE score of a person with Alzheimer's declines about two to four points each year.</p>

                        <p>During the Mini-Cog, a person is asked to complete two tasks: remember and then later repeat the names of three common objects and draw a face of a clock showing all 12 numbers in the right places with the time indicated as specified by the examiner. The results of this brief test determine if further evaluation is needed. In addition to assessing mental status, the health care provider evaluates a person's sense of well-being to detect depression or other mood disorders that can cause memory problems, loss of interest in life, and other symptoms that can overlap with dementia.</p>

                        <p>Diagnostic testing for Alzheimer's disease may include structural imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). These tests are primarily used to rule out other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to Alzheimer's but require different treatment. For example, structural imaging can reveal brain tumors, evidence of strokes, damage from head trauma, or a buildup of fluid in the brain.</p>

                        <h3>Treatments</h3>
                        <p>While there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, there are medications to help lessen symptoms of memory loss and confusion and interventions to manage common symptomatic behaviors.</p>
                        <h4>Medications</h4>
                        <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two types of medications, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, to treat the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (memory loss, confusion, and problems with thinking and reasoning). As Alzheimer's progresses, brain cells die and connections among cells are lost, causing cognitive symptoms to worsen. While current medications cannot stop the damage Alzheimer's causes to brain cells, they may help lessen or stabilize symptoms for a limited time by affecting certain chemicals involved in carrying messages among the brain's nerve cells. Sometimes both types of medications are prescribed together.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cholinesterase inhibitors</strong> are prescribed to treat early to moderate symptoms of Alzheimer's disease related to memory, thinking, language, judgment, and other thought processes. Cholinesterase inhibitors prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is vital for learning and memory. It supports communication among nerve cells by keeping acetylcholine high and delays or slows the worsening of symptoms. Effectiveness varies from person to person, and the medications are generally well-tolerated. If side effects occur, they commonly include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and increased frequency of bowel movements. These three cholinesterase inhibitors are commonly prescribed:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Donepezil (Aricept), approved to treat all stages of Alzheimer's disease</li>
                            <li>Galantamine (Razadyne), approved for mild-to-moderate stages</li>
                            <li>Rivastigmine (Exelon), approved for mild-to-moderate stages</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Memantine</strong> (Namenda) and a combination of memantine and donepezil (Namzaric) are approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimer's. Memantine is prescribed to improve memory, attention, reasoning, language, and the ability to perform simple tasks. Memantine regulates the activity of glutamate, a chemical involved in information processing, storage, and retrieval. It improves mental function and the ability to perform daily activities for some people, but it can cause side effects, including headache, constipation, confusion, and dizziness.</p>
                        <p>Other medications may be prescribed to treat specific symptoms of depression, anxiety, or psychosis. However, the decision to use an antipsychotic drug must be considered with extreme caution. Research has shown that these drugs are associated with an increased risk of stroke and death in older adults with dementia. The FDA has ordered manufacturers to label such drugs with a "Black Box" warning about their risks and a reminder that they are not approved to treat dementia symptoms. Individuals with dementia should use antipsychotic medications only under one of the following conditions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Behavioral symptoms are due to mania or psychosis.</li>
                            <li>The symptoms present a danger to the person or others.</li>
                            <li>The person is experiencing inconsolable or persistent distress, a significant decline in function, or substantial difficulty receiving needed care.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Antipsychotic medications should not be used to sedate or restrain persons with dementia. The minimum dosage should be used for the minimum amount of time possible, and nurses should carefully monitor for adverse side effects and report them to the health care provider.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Interventions for Symptomatic Behavior</h4>
                        <p>Many people find the behavioral changes caused by Alzheimer's disease to be the most challenging and distressing effect of the disease. The chief cause of behavioral symptoms is the progressive deterioration of brain cells. However, medication, environmental influences, and some medical conditions can also cause symptoms or make them worse.</p>
                        <p>In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, people may experience behavior and personality changes, such as irritability, anxiety, and depression. In later stages, other symptoms may occur, including the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aggression and anger</li>
                            <li>Anxiety and agitation</li>
                            <li>General emotional distress</li>
                            <li>Physical or verbal outbursts</li>
                            <li>Restlessness, pacing, or shredding paper or tissues</li>
                            <li>Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that are not really there)</li>
                            <li>Delusions (firmly held beliefs in things that are not true)</li>
                            <li>Sleep issues and sundowning</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Sundowning</strong> is restlessness, agitation, irritability, or confusion that typically begins or worsens as daylight begins to fade and can continue into the night, making it hard for patients with Alzheimer's to sleep. Being too tired can increase late-afternoon and early-evening restlessness. Tips to manage sundowning are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Take them outside or expose them to bright light in the morning to reset their circadian rhythm.</li>
                            <li>Do not plan too many activities during the day. A full schedule can be overtiring.</li>
                            <li>Make early evening a quiet time of day. Play soothing music or ask a family member or friend to call during this time.</li>
                            <li>Close the curtains or blinds at dusk to minimize shadows and the confusion they may cause.</li>
                            <li>Reduce noise, clutter, or the number of people in the room.</li>
                            <li>Do not serve coffee, cola, or other drinks with caffeine late in the day.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS</h5>
                        <p>Aggressive behaviors may be verbal or physical. They can occur suddenly, with no apparent reason, or result from a frustrating situation. While aggression can be hard to cope with, understanding this is a symptom of Alzheimer's disease and the person with Alzheimer's or dementia is not acting this way on purpose can help. See Figure 6.8 for an image of a resident with dementia demonstrating aggressive verbal behavior.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0404-1.jpg" alt="An older resident with dementia exhibiting aggressive verbal behavior towards a caregiver." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Aggression can be caused by many factors including physical discomfort, environmental factors, and poor communication. If the person with Alzheimer's is aggressive, consider what might be contributing to the change in behavior.</p>
                        <h6>Physical Discomfort</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the person able to let you know that he or she is experiencing physical pain? It is not uncommon for persons with Alzheimer's or other dementias to have urinary tract or other infections. Due to their loss of cognitive function, they are unable to articulate or identify the cause of physical discomfort and, therefore, may express it through physical aggression.</li>
                            <li>Is the person tired because of inadequate rest or sleep?</li>
                            <li>Is the person hungry or thirsty?</li>
                            <li>Are medications causing side effects? Side effects are especially likely to occur when individuals are taking multiple medications for several health conditions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Environmental Factors</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Is the person overstimulated by loud noises, an overactive environment, or physical clutter? Large crowds or being surrounded by unfamiliar people - even within one's own home - can be overstimulating for a person with dementia.</li>
                            <li>Does the person feel lost?</li>
                            <li>What time of day is the person most alert? Most people function better during a certain time of day; typically mornings are best. Consider the time of day when making appointments or scheduling activities. Choose a time when you know the person is most alert and best able to process new information or surroundings.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Poor Communication</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are your instructions simple and easy to understand?</li>
                            <li>Are you asking too many questions or making too many statements at once?</li>
                            <li>Is the person picking up on your own stress or irritability?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Techniques for Response</h6>
                        <p>There are many therapeutic methods for a nurse or caregiver to respond to aggressive behaviors displayed by a person with dementia. The following are some methods that can be used with aggressive behavior:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Begin by trying to identify the immediate cause of the behavior. Think about what happened right before the reaction that may have triggered the behavior. Rule out pain as the cause of the behavior. Pain can trigger aggressive behavior for a person with dementia.</li>
                            <li>Focus on the person's feelings, not the facts. Look for the feelings behind the specific words or actions.</li>
                            <li>Don't get upset. Be positive and reassuring and speak slowly in a soft tone.</li>
                            <li>Limit distractions. Examine the person's surroundings, and adapt them to avoid future triggers.</li>
                            <li>Implement a relaxing activity. Try music, massage, or exercise to help soothe the person.</li>
                            <li>Shift the focus to another activity. The immediate situation or activity may have unintentionally caused the aggressive response, so try a different approach.</li>
                            <li>Take a break if needed. If the person is in a safe environment and you are able, walk away and take a moment for emotions to cool.</li>
                            <li>Ensure safety! Make sure you and the person are safe. If these interventions do not successfully calm down the person, seek assistance from others. If it is an emergency situation, call 911 and be sure to tell the responders the person has dementia that causes them to act aggressively.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When educating caregivers about responding to aggressive behaviors, encourage them to share their experience with others, such as face-to-face support groups, where they can share response strategies they have tried and also get more ideas from other caregivers.</p>
                        
                        <h5>ANXIETY AND AGITATION</h5>
                        <p>A person with Alzheimer's may feel anxious or agitated. They may become restless, causing a need to move around or pace or become upset in certain places or when focused on specific details. See Figure 6.9 for an illustration of an older adult feeling the need to move around. Anxiety and agitation can be caused by several medical conditions, medication interactions, or by any circumstances that worsen the person's ability to think. Ultimately, the person with dementia is biologically experiencing a profound loss of their ability to negotiate new information and stimuli. It is a direct result of the disease. Situations that may lead to agitation can include moving to a new residence or nursing home; changes in environment, such as travel, hospitalization, or the presence of houseguests; changes in caregiver arrangements; misperceived threats; or fear and fatigue resulting from trying to make sense out of a confusing world.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Interventions to prevent and treat agitation include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create a calm environment and remove stressors. This may involve moving the person to a safer or quieter place or offering a security object, rest, or privacy. Providing soothing rituals and limiting caffeine use are also helpful.</li>
                            <li>Avoid environmental triggers. Noise, glare, and background distraction (such as having the television on) can act as triggers.</li>
                            <li>Monitor personal comfort. Check for pain, hunger, thirst, constipation, full bladder, fatigue, infections, and skin irritation. Make sure the room is at a comfortable temperature. Be sensitive to the person's fears, misperceived threats, and frustration with expressing what is wanted.</li>
                            <li>Simplify tasks and routines.</li>
                            <li>Find outlets for the person's energy. The person may be looking for something to do. Provide an opportunity for exercise such as going for a walk or putting on music and dancing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>Techniques for Response</h6>
                        <p>If a patient with dementia becomes anxious or agitated, consider these potential interventions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Back off and ask permission before performing care tasks. Use calm, positive statements, slow down, add lighting, and provide reassurance. Offer guided choices between two options when possible. Focus on pleasant events and try to limit stimulation.</li>
                            <li>Use effective language. When speaking, try phrases such as, "May I help you? Do you have time to help me? You're safe here. Everything is under control. I apologize. I'm sorry that you are upset. I know it's hard. I will stay with you until you feel better."</li>
                            <li>Listen to the person's frustration. Find out what may be causing the agitation, and try to understand.</li>
                            <li>Check yourself. Do not raise your voice, show alarm or offense, or corner, crowd, restrain, criticize, ignore, or argue with the person. Take care not to make sudden movements out of the person's view.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the person's anxiety or agitation does not improve using these techniques, notify the provider to rule out physiological causes or medication-related side effects.</p>

                        <h5>HALLUCINATIONS</h5>
                        <p>When a person with dementia experiences hallucinations, they may see, hear, smell, taste, or feel something that isn't there. Some hallucinations may be frightening, while others may involve ordinary visions of people, situations, or objects from the past. Alzheimer's and other dementias are not the only cause of hallucinations. Other causes of hallucinations include schizophrenia; physical problems, such as kidney or bladder infections, dehydration, or intense pain; alcohol or drug abuse; eyesight or hearing problems; and medications. See Figure 6.10 for an illustration of hallucinations experienced by a person with dementia.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0411-1.jpg" alt="An illustration of a patient with dementia seeing things that are not there, representing hallucinations." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                        </figure>
                        <p>If a person with dementia begins hallucinating, notify the health care provider to rule out other possible causes and to determine if medication is needed. It may also help to have the person's eyesight or hearing checked. If these strategies fail and symptoms are severe, medication may be prescribed. While antipsychotic medications can be effective in some situations, they are associated with an increased risk of stroke and death in older adults with dementia and must be used carefully.</p>
                        <h6>Techniques for Response</h6>
                        <p>When responding to a patient with dementia experiencing hallucinations, be cautious. First, assess the situation and determine whether the hallucination is a problem for the person or for you. Is the hallucination upsetting? Is it leading the person to do something dangerous? Is the sight of an unfamiliar face causing the person to become frightened? If so, react calmly and quickly with reassuring words and a comforting touch. Do not argue with the person about what he or she sees or hears. If the behavior is not dangerous, there may not be a need to intervene.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Offer reassurance.</strong> Respond in a calm, supportive manner. You may want to respond with, "Don't worry. I'm here. I'll protect you. I'll take care of you." Gentle patting may turn the person's attention toward you and reduce the hallucination.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acknowledge the feelings</strong> behind the hallucination and try to find out what the hallucination means to the individual. You might want to say, "It sounds as if you're worried" or "This must be frightening for you."</li>
                            <li><strong>Use distractions.</strong> Suggest a walk or move to another room. Frightening hallucinations often subside in well-lit areas where other people are present. Try to turn the person's attention to music, conversation, or activities they enjoy.</li>
                            <li><strong>Respond honestly.</strong> If the person asks you about a hallucination or delusion, be honest. For example, if he or she asks, "Do you see the spider on the wall?," you can respond, "I know you see something, but I don't see it." This way you're not denying what the person sees or hears and avoiding escalating their agitation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Modify the environment.</strong> Check for sounds that might be misinterpreted, such as noise from a television or an air conditioner. Look for lighting that casts shadows, reflections, or distortions on the surfaces of floors, walls, and furniture. Turn on lights to reduce shadows. Cover mirrors with a cloth or remove them if the person thinks that he or she is looking at a stranger.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>SUNDOWNING</h5>
                        <p><strong>Sundowning</strong> is increased confusion, anxiety, agitation, pacing, and disorientation in patients with dementia that typically begins at dusk and continues throughout the night. Although the exact cause of sundowning and sleep disorders in people with Alzheimer's disease is unknown, these changes result from the disease's impact on the brain. There are several factors that may contribute to sleep disturbances and sundowning:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mental and physical exhaustion from a full day trying to keep up with an unfamiliar or confusing environment.</li>
                            <li>An upset in the "internal body clock," causing a biological mix-up between day and night.</li>
                            <li>Reduced lighting causing shadows and misinterpretation is seen, causing agitation.</li>
                            <li>Nonverbal behaviors of others, especially if stress or frustration is present.</li>
                            <li>Disorientation due to the inability to separate dreams from reality when sleeping.</li>
                            <li>Decreased need for sleep, a common condition among older adults.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are several interventions that nurses and caregivers can implement to help manage sleep issues and sundowning:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promote plenty of rest.</li>
                            <li>Encourage a regular routine of waking up, eating meals, and going to bed.</li>
                            <li>When possible and appropriate, include walks or time outside in the sunlight.</li>
                            <li>Make notes about what happens before sundowning events and try to identify triggers.</li>
                            <li>Reduce stimulation during the evening hours (e.g., TV, doing chores, loud music, etc.). These distractions may add to the person's confusion.</li>
                            <li>Offer a larger meal at lunch and keep the evening meal lighter.</li>
                            <li>Keep the home environment well-lit in the evening. Adequate lighting may reduce the person's confusion.</li>
                            <li>Do not physically restrain the person; it can make agitation worse.</li>
                            <li>Try to identify activities that are soothing to the person, such as listening to calming music, looking at photographs, or watching a favorite movie.</li>
                            <li>Take a walk with the person to help reduce his or her restlessness.</li>
                            <li>Consider the best times of day for administering medication; consult with the prescribing provider or pharmacist as needed.</li>
                            <li>Limit daytime naps if the person has trouble sleeping at night.</li>
                            <li>Reduce or avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine that can affect the ability to sleep.</li>
                            <li>Discuss the situation with the provider when behavioral interventions and environmental changes do not work. Additional medications may be prescribed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Caregiver Role Strain</h3>
                        <p>Eighty-three percent of the help provided to people living with dementia in their homes in the United States comes from family members, friends, or other unpaid caregivers. Approximately one quarter of dementia caregivers are also "sandwich generation" caregivers - meaning that they care not only for an aging parent, but also for children under age 18. Dementia can take a devastating toll on caregivers. Compared with caregivers of people without dementia, twice as many caregivers of people with dementia indicate substantial emotional, financial, and physical difficulties. See Figure 6.11 of an image of a caregiver daughter caring for her mother with dementia.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0415-1.jpg" alt="A daughter caregiver providing support to her mother with dementia." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The caregivers of patients with dementia frequently report experiencing high levels of stress that often eventually impact their health and well-being. Nurses should monitor caregivers for these symptoms of stress:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Denial</strong> about the disease and its effect on the person who has been diagnosed. For example, the caregiver might say, "I know Mom is going to get better."</li>
                            <li><strong>Anger</strong> at the person with Alzheimer's or frustration that he or she can't do the things they used to be able to do. For example, the caregiver might say, "He knows how to get dressed - he's just being stubborn."</li>
                            <li><strong>Social withdrawal</strong> from friends and activities. For example, the caregiver may say, "I don't care about visiting with my friends anymore."</li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety</strong> about the future and facing another day. For example, the caregiver might say, "What happens when he needs more care than I can provide?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Depression</strong> or decreased ability to cope. For example, the caregiver might say, "I just don't care anymore."</li>
                            <li><strong>Exhaustion</strong> that makes it difficult for them to complete necessary daily tasks. For example, the caregiver might say, "I'm too tired to prepare meals."</li>
                            <li><strong>Sleeplessness</strong> caused by concerns. For example, the caregiver might say, "What if she wanders out of the house or falls and hurts herself?"</li>
                            <li><strong>Irritability, moodiness, or negative responses.</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Lack of concentration</strong> that makes it difficult to perform familiar tasks. For example, the caregiver might say, "I was so busy; I forgot my appointment."</li>
                            <li><strong>Health problems</strong> that begin to take a mental and physical toll. For example, the caregiver might say, "I can't remember the last time I felt good."</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nurses should monitor for these signs of caregiver stress and provide information about community resources. (See additional information about community resources below.) Caregivers should be encouraged to take good care of themselves by visiting their health care provider, eating well, exercising, and getting plenty of rest. It is helpful to remind them that "taking care of yourself and being healthy can help you be a better caregiver." It is helpful to teach them relaxation techniques, such as relaxation breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization, and meditation.</p>
                        <p>Caregivers should also be educated about additional care options, such as adult day care, respite care, residential facilities, or hospice care. <strong>Adult day centers</strong> offer people with dementia and other chronic illnesses the opportunity to be social and to participate in activities in a safe environment, while also giving their caregivers the opportunity to work, run errands, or take a break. <strong>Respite care</strong> can be provided at home (by a volunteer or paid service) or in a care setting, such as adult day care or residential facility, to provide the caregiver a much-needed break. If the person with Alzheimer's or other dementia prefers a communal living environment or requires more care than can be safely provided at home, a residential facility may be the best option for providing care. Different types of facilities provide different levels of care, depending on the person's needs. <strong>Hospice care</strong> focuses on providing comfort and dignity at the end of life; it involves care and support services that can be of great benefit to people in the final stages of dementia and their families.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>This section outlines the steps of the nursing process when providing care for adults with cognitive impairments.</p>
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Nurses provide care for older adults in a wide variety of settings including acute care facilities, clinics, adult day care facilities, retirement communities, long-term care facilities, private homes, and community-based residential facilities (CBRF). It is vital for nurses to notice any signs of changing mental status based on the patient's baseline. Any new or sudden changes that indicate possible delirium should be urgently reported to the health care provider for further assessment of potential underlying health conditions.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/patient-safety/settings/hospital/resource/delirium/delirium-eval-bundle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View the Delirium Evaluation Bundle</a> shared by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).</p>
                        <p>When assessing an adult patient with a previously diagnosed cognitive impairment, there are several assessments to include on admission. Their medical history should be reviewed and a medication reconciliation completed. A general survey provides a quick, overall assessment of the way an individual interacts with their environment and their overall mobility status. A comprehensive neurological assessment should be performed to establish a patient's baseline neurological status. After a baseline status is determined, routine focused neurological assessments are performed to monitor for changes, such as asking the patient to state their name, place, and the date, as appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Read more information about performing a neurological exam in the "Neurological Assessment" chapter of the Open RN Nursing Skills textbook.</p>
                        <p>Additional assessments include functional status and the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). A decline in the ability to perform self-care and maintain ADLs can affect the individual's well-being. Functional declines can bring about feelings of inadequacy and lead to depression. The ability to live independently relies on maintenance of self-care skills, including bathing, dressing, and toileting. Other factors that must be considered include the ability to adequately handle finances; maintain a clean, safe environment; and to shop and prepare meals. When deficits in these areas occur, resources should be recommended to assist the individual to meet these needs.</p>
                        <p>Cognitive changes including disorientation, poor judgment, loss of language skill, and memory impairment should be assessed objectively using standardized tools. Common standardized tools used to assess a patient's mental status include the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and the Mini-Cog. See Figure 6.12 for an image of one of the questions included on the MMSE.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <h4>Cultural Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Nurses provide culturally competent care for all individuals. Being aware of personal biases related to ageism and cognitive impairments is necessary when providing care for older adults experiencing confusion, memory deficits, and impaired judgment. Ageism is the stereotyping and discrimination against individuals or groups on the basis of their age. Ageism can take many forms, including prejudicial attitudes, discriminatory practices, or institutional policies and practices that perpetuate stereotypical beliefs. Ageism is widely prevalent and stems from the assumption that all members of a group (i.e., older adults) are the same. Ageism has harmful effects on the health of older adults; research has shown that older adults with negative attitudes about aging may live 7.5 years less than those with positive attitudes. Some of this prejudice arises from observable biological declines and may be distorted by awareness of disorders such as dementia, which may be mistakenly thought to reflect normal aging. Socially ingrained ageism can become self-fulfilling by promoting stereotypes of social isolation, physical and cognitive decline, lack of physical activity, and economic burden in older adults.</p>
                        <p>These biases in health care personnel, patients, and family members can prevent early recognition and treatment of health problems like dementia, delirium, and depression.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>Commonly used NANDA-I nursing diagnoses for older adults experiencing cognitive impairment include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-Care Deficit</li>
                            <li>Risk for Injury</li>
                            <li>Impaired Memory</li>
                            <li>Impaired Coping</li>
                            <li>Social Isolation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A common NANDA-I diagnosis related to cognitive impairment caused by dementia is <em>Self-Care Deficit</em>, defined as, "The inability to independently perform or complete cleansing activities; to put on or remove clothing; to eat; or to perform tasks associated with bowel and bladder elimination." An associated condition with this nursing diagnosis is "Alteration in cognitive functioning."</p>
                        <p>An example of a related PES statement is, "<em>Self-Care Deficit related to altered cognitive functioning as evidenced by impaired ability to access the bathroom, to put clothing on lower extremities, and to maintain appearance.</em>"</p>
                        
                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>An example of an overall goal for an older adult experiencing cognitive impairment due to dementia is, "The patient will perform self-care activities within the level of their own ability daily."</p>
                        <p>An example of a SMART expected outcome for a patient with cognitive impairment resulting in Self Care Deficit is, "The patient will remain free of body odor during their hospital stay."</p>

                        <h3>Planning Interventions</h3>
                        <p>There are many nursing interventions that can be implemented for older adults with impaired cognitive function based on their individual needs. Interventions focus on maintaining safety, meeting physical and psychological needs, and promoting quality of life. As always, refer to an evidence-based nursing care planning resource when customizing interventions for specific patients. For interventions targeted for common symptoms of dementia, see the "Alzheimer's Disease" section in this chapter. See Table 6.4 for general nursing interventions to implement for patients with cognitive impairments.</p>

                        <h3>Implementing Interventions</h3>
                        <p>When implementing interventions for patients with cognitive impairments, patient safety receives priority. Implement fall precautions, wandering precautions, and environmental safety precautions as appropriate.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>It is important to routinely evaluate the effectiveness of customized interventions for patients with cognitive impairments. Review the SMART outcomes established for each specific patient to determine if interventions are effectively promoting safety while also maintaining their physiological and psychological needs and promoting quality of life. Modify the care plan when needed to meet these outcome criteria.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mrs. Vang is an 83-year-old resident that was recently admitted to a long-term memory care facility. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease last year. She is alert to self but often has periods where she is uncooperative and is unable to follow commands. She has experienced a decline in the ability to provide self-care and wanders and paces at night. She recently fell when wandering outside of her room at night.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Mrs. Vang is alert to self only and does not follow commands during the assessment. She is unable to provide self-care despite cueing.</p>
                        <p>Based on the assessment information that has been gathered, the following nursing care plan is created for Mrs. Vang:</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Wandering related to separation from familiar environment as manifested by frequent movement from place to place and pacing.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will remain safe and free from falls.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mrs. Vang will experience reduced episodes of wandering within 72 hours.</p>

                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will provide orientation cues, such as family pictures in the patient room, as appropriate. The nurse will encourage a daily routine by all caregivers to prevent discomfort issues related to thirst, hunger, or lack of sleep. The nurse will encourage patient autonomy and provide choices in decisions as appropriate. The nurse will provide opportunities for reminiscence and cultivate therapeutic communication using touch and validation of emotional communication. The nurse will place a bed alarm to alert staff at night when the patient is getting out of bed. The nurse will implement a wander guard ankle bracelet to notify staff if the patient wanders near an exit door.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Documentation:</h4>
                        <p>Mrs. Vang has impaired thought processes as a result of her Alzheimer's disease. A care routine has been established. The patient receives appropriate visual cues and reorientation to the environment. Safety interventions have been implemented, and the patient is being monitored for signs of increasing confusion or mental decline.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>Mrs. Vang has remained safe within the care environment and demonstrated no additional decline in thought processes. Her wandering at night has decreased and the bed alarm alerts staff when she gets out of bed. SMART outcome "met."</p>
