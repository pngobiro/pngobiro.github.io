                            <li>When given instruction to titrate medications independently, the nursing student should recognize that this is outside of their scope of practice and training. The nursing student should inform the nurse that within the student role, they are not able to complete this action because it is outside of their practice scope. The nursing student should also report this instruction promptly to their instructor so that appropriate follow-up can be taken regarding re-education and review of the principles of safe delegation.</li>
                            <li>It is important to acknowledge that the conversation that is occurring in the breakroom is a violation of HIPAA. If a staff member is not involved in patient care, disclosure of patient care information is a violation of patient privacy and confidential health information. It is important to voice one's concern regarding the disclosure of private health information and remind all staff of the importance of adherence to HIPAA requirements within a health care setting.</li>

                        <p>It is important to take action to limit the distractions within the environment when communicating with Mr. Curtis. Upon entry into the room and initial discussion, it would be helpful to identify a few key family members who might contribute to the admission history and excuse the others for a short period of time. Additionally, it is important prior to beginning an interaction that Mr. Curtis consent to discuss admission details in front of the family members who are present. Other factors to consider include limitation to noise distraction within the environment. For example, closing the door to the hallway and turning off the television may be helpful. If Mr. Curtis uses any assistive devices, such as hearing aids or eye glasses, these should also be encouraged. Finally, it is important that the nurse consider strategies to enhance communication. Sitting across from Mr. Curtis, making eye contact, and creating an open, approachable, nonhurried demeanor can help to facilitate the information exchange.</p>

                        <p>It is important to demonstrate professional respect for a patient's cultural beliefs, background, and practices when providing care. You can ensure appropriate actions are taken by introducing yourself with name and role, asking preference on how the individual would like to be addressed, attending to personal space of the patient, following patient and family lead for eye contact behaviors, using inclusive language, etc. It is important to note the patient's language of preference and enact interpreter services if a communication barrier is noted. Additionally, it is important to be honest regarding individual level of understanding about one's cultural beliefs. Ask polite questions and seek clarification to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
