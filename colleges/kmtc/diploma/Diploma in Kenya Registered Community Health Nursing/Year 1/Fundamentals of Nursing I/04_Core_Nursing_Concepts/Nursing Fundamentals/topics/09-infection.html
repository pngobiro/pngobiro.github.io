                        <p>Have you ever wondered how nurses can be exposed to patients with communicable diseases day after day and not become ill? There are many factors that affect the body's ability to defend against infection and place some individuals at greater risk of developing an infection. When an infection does occur, early recognition is important to prevent it from spreading within the individual, as well as to others. Protecting people from developing an infection, as well as preventing the spread of infection, is a major concern for nurses. This chapter will discuss the physiology of the inflammation and infectious processes and nursing interventions to prevent the spread of infection.</p>

                        <h3>Normal Flora and Microbiome</h3>
                        <p>Microorganisms occur naturally and are present everywhere in our environment. Some microorganisms live on the skin, in the nasopharynx, and in the gastrointestinal tract, but don't become an infection unless the host becomes susceptible. These microorganisms are called <strong>normal flora</strong>. Over the past several years, it has been discovered that every human being carries their own individual suite of microorganisms in and on their body referred to as their <strong>microbiome</strong>. A person's microbiome is acquired at birth and evolves over their lifetime. It is different across body sites and between individuals. A person's gut microbiome has recently been found to impact their immune system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Pathogens</h3>
                        <p>Microorganisms that cause disease are called <strong>pathogens</strong>. There are four common types of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Viruses</h4>
                        <p><strong>Viruses</strong> are made up of a piece of genetic code, such as DNA or RNA, and are protected by a coating of protein. After a host (i.e., the person) becomes infected by a virus, the virus invades the body's cells and uses the components of the cell to replicate and produce more viruses. After the virus replication cycle is complete, the new viruses are released into the body, causing damage or destruction of the host's cells.</p>
                        <p>Antiviral medications can be used to treat some viral infections. Antibiotics do not kill viruses and are ineffective as a treatment for viral infections. See Figure 9.1 for an image of a virus.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0519-1.jpg" alt="A 3D medical animation of the coronavirus, showing its characteristic spike proteins on the surface." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Bacteria</h4>
                        <p><strong>Bacteria</strong> are microorganisms made of a single cell. They are very diverse, have a variety of shapes and features, and have the ability to live in any environment, including your body. However, not all bacteria cause infections. Those that cause infection are called pathogenic bacteria. See Figure 9.2 for an image of a bacterium called Escherichia coli (E. coli).</p>
                        <p>A patient is susceptible to bacterial infections when their immune system is compromised by chronic diseases or certain types of medications. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. However, some strains of bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, making them difficult to treat. For example, infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) are resistant to many types of antibiotics and have the capability of producing severe and life-threatening infections. MRSA infections usually require IV antibiotics and may require treatment for long periods of time.</p>

                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0520-1.jpg" alt="A micrograph of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, showing their rod-like shape." class="content-image">

                        </figure>

                        <h4>Fungi</h4>
                        <p>There are millions of different fungal species on Earth. Fungi can be found everywhere in the environment, including indoors, outdoors, and on human skin, but only about 300 species cause infection when they overgrow. Candida albicans is a type of fungus that can cause oral thrush and vaginal yeast infections, especially in susceptible patients or those taking antibiotics. See Figure 9.3 for an image of oral thrush.</p>
                        <p>Fungi cells contain a nucleus and other components protected by a membrane and a thick cell wall. This structure can make them harder to kill. Some new strains of fungal infections are proving to be especially dangerous, such as Candida auris, which is difficult to diagnose and treat, and can cause outbreaks in health care facilities.</p>

                        <h4>Parasites</h4>
                        <p><strong>Parasites</strong> are organisms that behave like tiny animals, living in or on a host, and feeding at the expense of the host. Three main types of parasites can cause disease in humans. These include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Protozoa:</strong> Single-celled organisms that can live and multiply in your body</li>
                            <li><strong>Helminths:</strong> Multi-celled organisms that can live inside or outside your body and are commonly known as worms</li>
                            <li><strong>Ectoparasites:</strong> Multi-celled organisms that live on or feed off skin, including ticks and mosquitos</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Parasites can be spread several ways, including through contaminated soil, water, food, and blood, as well as through sexual contact and insect bites. See Figure 9.4 for an image of a helminth infection causing intestinal obstruction in a child.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>There are two basic ways the body defends against pathogens: nonspecific innate immunity and specific adaptive immunity.</p>
                        <h3>Nonspecific Innate Immunity</h3>
                        <p><strong>Nonspecific innate immunity</strong> is a system of defenses in the body that targets invading pathogens in a nonspecific manner. It is called "innate" because it is present from the moment we are born. Nonspecific innate immunity includes physical defenses, chemical defenses, and cellular defenses.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Physical Defenses</h4>
                        <p>Physical defenses are the body's most basic form of defense against infection. They include physical barriers to microbes, such as skin and mucous membranes, as well as mechanical defenses that physically remove microbes and debris from areas of the body where they might cause harm or infection. In addition, a person's microbiome provides physical protection against disease as normal flora compete with pathogens for nutrients and cellular-binding sites.</p>
                        
                        <h5>SKIN</h5>
                        <p>One of the body's most important physical barriers is the skin barrier, which is composed of three layers of closely packed cells. See Figure 9.5 for an illustration of the layers of skin. The topmost layer of skin called the epidermis consists of cells that are packed with keratin. Keratin makes the skin's surface mechanically tough and resistant to degradation by bacteria. Infections can occur when the skin barrier is broken, allowing the entry of opportunistic pathogens that infect the skin tissue surrounding the wound and possibly spread to deeper tissues.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0526-1.jpg" alt="A cross-section diagram of the skin showing its layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, along with structures like hair follicles and glands." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 9.5 Layers of Skin</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <h5>MUCUS MEMBRANES</h5>
                        <p>The mucous membranes lining the nose, mouth, lungs, and urinary and digestive tracts provide another nonspecific barrier against potential pathogens. Mucous membranes consist of a layer of epithelial cells bound by tight junctions. The epithelial cells secrete a moist, sticky substance called mucous. Mucous covers and protects the fragile cell layers beneath it and also traps debris, including microbes. Mucus secretions also contain antimicrobial peptides.</p>
                        <p>In many regions of the body, mechanical actions flush mucus (along with trapped or dead microbes) out of the body or away from potential sites of infection. For example, in the respiratory system, inhalation can bring microbes, dust, mold spores, and other small airborne debris into the body. This debris becomes trapped in the mucus lining the respiratory tract. The epithelial cells lining the upper parts of the respiratory tract have hair-like appendages known as cilia. Movement of the cilia propels debris-laden mucus out and away from the lungs. The expelled mucus is then swallowed and destroyed in the stomach, coughed up, or sneezed out. This system of removal is often called the <strong>mucociliary escalator</strong>. Disruption of the mucociliary escalator by the damaging effects of smoking can lead to increased colonization of bacteria in the lower respiratory tract and frequent infections, which highlights the importance of this physical barrier to host defenses. See Figure 9.6 for an image of a magnified mucociliary escalator.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0528-1.jpg" alt="A scanning electron micrograph (SEM) showing the cilia of the bronchiolar epithelium, which form the mucociliary escalator." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Like the respiratory tract, the digestive tract is a portal of entry through which microbes enter the body, and the mucous membranes lining the digestive tract provide a nonspecific physical barrier against ingested microbes. The intestinal tract is lined with epithelial cells, interspersed with mucus-secreting goblet cells. This mucus mixes with material received from the stomach, trapping foodborne microbes and debris, and the mechanical action of <strong>peristalsis</strong> (a series of muscular contractions in the digestive tract) moves this mixture through the intestines and excretes it in feces. For this reason, feces can contain microorganisms that can cause the spread of infection; therefore, good hand hygiene is vital.</p>
                        
                        <h5>ENDOTHELIA</h5>
                        <p>The epithelial cells lining the urogenital tract, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and other tissues are known as endothelia. These tightly packed cells provide an effective frontline barrier against invaders. The endothelia of the blood-brain barrier, for example, protects the central nervous system (CNS) from microorganisms. Infection of the CNS can quickly lead to serious and often fatal inflammation. The protection of the blood-brain barrier keeps the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord sterile. See Figure 9.7 for an illustration of the blood-brain barrier.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0530-1.jpg" alt="An illustration of the protective barriers of the brain, highlighting the blood-brain barrier which restricts passage of substances from the bloodstream into the brain." class="content-image" style="max-width: 450px;">

                        <h4>Mechanical Defenses</h4>
                        <p>In addition to physical barriers that keep microbes out, the body has several mechanical defenses that physically remove pathogens from the body and prevent them from taking up residence. For example, the flushing action of urine and tears serves to carry microbes away from the body. The flushing action of urine is responsible for the normally sterile environment of the urinary tract. The eyes have additional physical barriers and mechanical mechanisms for preventing infections. The eyelashes and eyelids prevent dust and airborne microorganisms from reaching the surface of the eye. Any microbes or debris that make it past these physical barriers are flushed out by the mechanical action of blinking, which bathes the eye in tears, washing debris away. See Figure 9.8 for an image of an infant's eyelashes that prevent dust from reaching the surface of the eye.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0531-1.jpg" alt="A close-up photograph of a 2-month-old baby's eyelashes, illustrating them as a mechanical defense for the eyes." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>MICROBIOME</h4>
                        <p>Normal flora that contribute to an individual's microbiome serve as an important first-line defense against invading pathogens. Through their occupation of cellular binding sites and competition for available nutrients, normal flora prevent the early steps of pathogen attachment and proliferation required for the establishment of an infection. For example, in the vagina, normal flora compete with opportunistic pathogens like Candida albicans. This competition prevents yeast infection by limiting the availability of nutrients and inhibiting the growth of Candida, keeping its population in check. Similar competitions occur between normal flora and potential pathogens on the skin, in the upper respiratory tract, and in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
                        <p>The importance of the normal flora in host defenses is highlighted by a person's increased susceptibility to infectious diseases when their microbiome is disrupted or eliminated. For example, treatment with antibiotics can significantly deplete the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract, providing an advantage for pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium difficile (C-diff) to colonize and cause diarrheal infection. Diarrhea caused by C-diff can be severe and potentially lethal. In fact, a recent strategy for treating recurrent C-diff infections is fecal transplantation that involves the transfer of fecal material from a donor into the intestines of the patient as a method of restoring their normal flora.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Chemical Defenses</h3>
                        <p>In addition to physical defenses, our nonspecific innate immune system uses several chemical mediators that inhibit microbial invaders. The term chemical mediators encompasses a wide array of substances found in various fluids and tissues throughout the body. For example, sebaceous glands in the dermis secrete an oil called sebum that is released onto the skin surface through hair follicles. Sebum provides an additional layer of defense by helping seal off the pore of the hair follicle and preventing bacteria on the skin's surface from invading sweat glands and surrounding tissue. Environmental factors can affect these chemical defenses of the skin. For example, low humidity in the winter makes the skin more dry and susceptible to pathogens normally inhibited by the skin's low pH. Application of skin moisturizer restores moisture and essential oils to the skin and helps prevent dry skin from becoming infected.</p>
                        <p>Examples of other chemical defenses are enzymes, pH level, and chemical mediators. Enzymes in saliva and the digestive tract eliminate most pathogens that manage to survive the acidic environment of the stomach. In the urinary tract, the slight acidity of urine inhibits the growth of potential pathogens in the urinary tract. The respiratory tract also uses various chemical mediators in the nasal passages, trachea, and lungs that have antibacterial properties.</p>
                        
                        <h4>PLASMA PROTEIN MEDIATORS</h4>
                        <p>In addition to physical, mechanical, and chemical defenses, there are also nonspecific innate immune factors in plasma, the fluid portion of blood, such as acute-phase proteins, complement proteins, and cytokines. These plasma protein mediators contribute to the inflammatory response.</p>
                        <p>An example of an acute-phase protein is C-reactive protein. High levels of C-reactive protein indicate a serious infection or other medical condition that causes inflammation is occurring.</p>
                        <p>Complement proteins are always present in the blood and tissue fluids, allowing them to be activated quickly. They aid in the destruction of pathogens by piercing their outer membranes (cell lysis) or by making them more attractive to phagocytic cells such as macrophages.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cytokines</strong> are proteins that affect interaction and communication between cells. When a pathogen enters the body, the first immune cell to notice the pathogen is like the conductor of an orchestra. That cell directs all the other immune cells by creating and sending out messages (cytokines) to the rest of the organs or cells in the body to respond to and initiate inflammation. Too many cytokines can have a negative effect and result in what's known as a <strong>cytokine storm</strong>. A cytokine storm is a severe immune reaction in which the body releases too many cytokines into the blood too quickly. A cytokine storm can occur as a result of an infection, autoimmune condition, or other disease. Signs and symptoms include high fever, inflammation, severe fatigue, and nausea. A cytokine storm can be severe or life-threatening and lead to multiple organ failure. For example, many COVID-19 complications and deaths were caused by a cytokine storm.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Inflammation</h3>
                        <p><strong>Inflammation</strong> is a response triggered by a cascade of chemical mediators and occurs when pathogens successfully breach the nonspecific innate immune system or when an injury occurs. Although inflammation is often perceived as a negative consequence of injury or disease, it is a necessary process that recruits cellular defenses needed to eliminate pathogens, remove damaged and dead cells, and initiate repair mechanisms. Excessive inflammation, however, can result in local tissue damage, and in severe cases, such as sepsis, it can become deadly.</p>
                        <p>An immediate response to tissue injury is acute inflammation. Vasoconstriction occurs to minimize blood loss if injury has occurred. Vasoconstriction is followed by vasodilation with increased permeability of the blood vessels due to the release of histamine by mast cells. Histamine contributes to the five observable signs of the inflammatory response: erythema (redness), edema (swelling), heat, pain, and altered function. It is also associated with an influx of phagocytes at the site of injury and/or infection. See Figure 9.9 for an illustration of the inflammatory response, with (a) demonstrating when mast cells detect injury to nearby cells and release histamine, initiating an inflammatory response and (b) illustrating where histamine increases blood flow to the wound site and the associated increased vascular permeability allows fluid, proteins, phagocytes, and other immune cells to enter infected tissue. These events result in the swelling and reddening of the injured site. The increased blood flow to the injured site causes it to feel warm. Inflammation is also associated with pain due to these events stimulating nerve pain receptors in the tissue. Increasing numbers of neutrophils are then recruited to the area to fight pathogens. As the fight rages on, white blood cells are recruited to the area, and pus forms from the accumulation of neutrophils, dead cells, tissue fluids, and lymph. Typically, after a few days, macrophages clear out this pus. During injury, if this nonspecific inflammatory process does not successfully kill the pathogens, infection occurs.</p>

                        <h3>Fever</h3>
                        <p>A fever is part of the inflammatory response that extends beyond the site of infection and affects the entire body, resulting in an overall increase in body temperature. Like other forms of inflammation, a fever enhances the nonspecific innate immune defenses by stimulating white blood cells to kill pathogens. The rise in body temperature also inhibits the growth of many pathogens. During fever, the patient's skin may appear pale due to vasoconstriction of the blood vessels in the skin to divert blood flow away from extremities, minimize the loss of heat, and raise the body's core temperature. The hypothalamus also stimulates the shivering of muscles to generate heat and raise the core temperature.</p>
                        <p>A low-level fever is thought to help an individual overcome an illness. However, in some instances, this immune response can be too strong, causing tissue and organ damage and, in severe cases, even death. For example, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are capable of producing superantigens that cause toxic shock syndrome and scarlet fever, respectively. Both of these conditions are associated with extremely high fevers in excess of 42°C (108°F) that must be managed to prevent tissue injury and death.</p>
                        <p>When a fever breaks, the hypothalamus stimulates vasodilation, resulting in a return of blood flow to the skin and a subsequent release of heat from the body. The hypothalamus also stimulates sweating, which cools the skin as the sweat evaporates.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Specific Adaptive Immunity</h3>
                        <p>Now that we have discussed several nonspecific innate defenses against a pathogen, let's discuss specific adaptive immunity. <strong>Specific adaptive immunity</strong> is the immune response that is activated when the nonspecific innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. There are two types of adaptive responses: the cell-mediated immune response, which is carried out by T cells, and the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies.</p>
                        <p><strong>B cells</strong> mature in the bone marrow. B cells make Y-shaped proteins called <strong>antibodies</strong> that are specific to each pathogen and lock onto its surface and mark it for destruction by other immune cells. The five classes of antibodies are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. They also turn into memory B cells.</p>
                        <p><strong>T cells</strong> mature in the thymus. T cells are categorized into three classes: helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells stimulate B cells to make antibodies and help killer cells develop. Killer T cells directly kill cells that have already been infected by a pathogen. T cells also use cytokines as messenger molecules to send chemical instructions to the rest of the immune system to ramp up its response.</p>
                        <p>Specific adaptive immunity also creates memory cells for each specific pathogen that provides the host with long-term protection from reinfection with that pathogen. On reexposure, these memory cells facilitate an efficient and quick immune response. For example, when an individual recovers from chicken pox, the body develops a memory of the varicella-zoster virus that will specifically protect it from reinfection if it is exposed to the virus again.</p>
                        <p>See Figure 9.10 for an illustration of innate immunity and specific adaptive immunity that occurs in response to a pathogen entering the body through the nose.</p>

                        <p>An <strong>infection</strong> is the invasion and growth of a microorganism within the body. Infection can lead to <strong>disease</strong> that causes signs and symptoms resulting in a deviation from the normal structure or functioning of the host. Infection occurs when nonspecific innate immunity and specific adaptive immunity defenses are inadequate to protect an individual against the invasion of a pathogen. The ability of a microorganism to cause disease is called <strong>pathogenicity</strong>, and the degree to which a microorganism is likely to become a disease is called <strong>virulence</strong>. Virulence is a continuum. On one end of the spectrum are organisms that are not harmful, but on the other end are organisms that are highly virulent. Highly virulent pathogens will almost always lead to a disease state when introduced to the body, and some may even cause multi-organ and body system failure in healthy individuals. Less virulent pathogens may cause an initial infection, but may not always cause severe illness. Pathogens with low virulence usually result in mild signs and symptoms of disease, such as a low-grade fever, headache, or muscle aches, and some individuals may even be asymptomatic.</p>
                        <p>An example of a highly virulent microorganism is Bacillus anthracis, the pathogen responsible for anthrax. The most serious form of anthrax is inhalation anthrax. After B. anthracis spores are inhaled, they germinate. An active infection develops, and the bacteria release potent toxins that cause edema (fluid buildup in tissues), hypoxia (a condition preventing oxygen from reaching tissues), and necrosis (cell death and inflammation). Signs and symptoms of inhalation anthrax include high fever, difficulty breathing, vomiting, coughing up blood, and severe chest pains suggestive of a heart attack. With inhalation anthrax, the toxins and bacteria enter the bloodstream, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death of the patient.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Primary Pathogens Versus Opportunistic Pathogens</h3>
                        <p>Pathogens can be classified as either primary pathogens or opportunistic pathogens. A <strong>primary pathogen</strong> can cause disease in a host regardless of the host's microbiome or immune system. An <strong>opportunistic pathogen</strong>, by contrast, can cause disease only in situations that compromise the host's defenses, such as the body's protective barriers, immune system, or normal microbiome. Individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections include the very young, the elderly, women who are pregnant, patients undergoing chemotherapy, people with immunodeficiencies (such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]), patients who are recovering from surgery, and those who have nonintact skin (such as a severe wound or burn).</p>
                        <p>An example of a primary pathogen is enterohemorrhagic E. coli that produces a toxin that leads to severe and bloody diarrhea, inflammation, and renal failure, even in patients with healthy immune systems. Staphylococcus epidermidis, on the other hand, is an opportunistic pathogen that is a frequent cause of health-care acquired infection. S. epidermidis, often referred to as "staph," is a member of the normal flora of the skin. However, in hospitals, it can grow in biofilms that form on catheters, implants, or other devices that are inserted into the body during surgical procedures. Once inside the body, it can cause serious infections such as endocarditis.</p>
                        <p>Other members of normal flora can cause opportunistic infections. For example, some microorganisms that reside harmlessly in one location of the body can cause disease if they are passed to a different body system. For example, E. coli is normally found in the large intestine, but can cause a urinary tract infection if it enters the bladder.</p>
                        <p>Normal flora can also cause disease when a shift in the environment of the body leads to overgrowth of a particular microorganism. For example, the yeast Candida is part of the normal flora of the skin, mouth, intestine, and vagina, but its population is kept in check by other organisms of the microbiome. When an individual takes antibiotics, bacteria that would normally inhibit the growth of Candida can be killed off, leading to a sudden growth in the population of Candida. An overgrowth of Candida can manifest as oral thrush (growth on mouth, throat, and tongue) or a vaginal yeast infection. Other scenarios can also provide opportunities for Candida to cause infection. For example, untreated diabetes can result in a high concentration of glucose in a patient's saliva that provides an optimal environment for the growth of Candida, resulting in oral thrush. Immunodeficiencies, such as those seen in patients with HIV, AIDS, and cancer, also lead to Candida infections.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Stages of Pathogenesis</h3>
                        <p>To cause disease, a pathogen must successfully achieve four stages of pathogenesis to become an infection: exposure, adhesion (also called colonization), invasion, and infection. The pathogen must be able to gain entry to the host, travel to the location where it can establish an infection, evade or overcome the host's immune response, and cause damage (i.e., disease) to the host. In many cases, the cycle is completed when the pathogen exits the host and is transmitted to a new host.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Exposure</h4>
                        <p>An encounter with a potential pathogen is known as <strong>exposure</strong>. The food we eat and the objects we touch are all ways that we can come into contact with potential pathogens. Yet, not all contacts result in infection and disease. For a pathogen to cause disease, it needs to be able to gain access into host tissue. An anatomic site through which pathogens can pass into host tissue is called a <strong>portal of entry</strong>. Portals of entry are locations where the host cells are in direct contact with the external environment, such as the skin, mucous membranes, respiratory, and digestive systems. Portals of entry are illustrated in Figure 9.11.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0544-1.jpg" alt="A diagram showing various portals of entry for pathogens into the human body, including the eyes, nose, mouth, skin, and urogenital tract." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Adhesion</h4>
                        <p>Following initial exposure, the pathogen adheres at the portal of entry. The term <strong>adhesion</strong> refers to the capability of pathogenic microbes to attach to the cells of the body, also referred to as colonization.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Invasion</h4>
                        <p>After successful adhesion, the invasion proceeds. <strong>Invasion</strong> means the spread of a pathogen throughout local tissues or the body. Pathogens may also produce virulence factors that protect them against immune system defenses and determine the degree of tissue damage that occurs. Intracellular pathogens like viruses achieve invasion by entering the host's cells and reproducing.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Infection</h4>
                        <p>Following invasion, successful multiplication of the pathogen leads to infection. Infections can be described as local, secondary, or systemic, depending on the extent of the infection.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>local infection</strong> is confined to a small area of the body, typically near the portal of entry. For example, a hair follicle infected by Staphylococcus aureus infection may result in a boil around the site of infection, but the bacterium is largely contained to this small location. Other examples of local infections that involve more extensive tissue involvement include urinary tract infections confined to the bladder or pneumonia confined to the lungs. Localized infections generally demonstrate signs of inflammation, such as redness, swelling, warmth, pain, and purulent drainage. However, extensive tissue involvement can also cause decreased functioning of the organ affected.</p>
                        <p>In a <strong>secondary infection</strong> a localized pathogen, or the toxins it produces, can spread to a secondary location. For example, a dental hygienist nicking a patient's gum with a sharp tool can cause a local infection in the gum by Streptococcus bacteria found in the oral normal flora. The Streptococcus bacteria may then gain access to the bloodstream and make their way to other locations within the body such as the heart valves, resulting in a secondary infection.</p>
                        <p>When an infection becomes disseminated throughout the body, it is called a <strong>systemic infection</strong>. For example, infection by the varicella-zoster virus typically gains entry through a mucous membrane of the upper respiratory system. It then spreads throughout the body, resulting in a classic red rash associated with chicken pox. Because these lesions are not sites of initial infection, they are signs of a systemic infection. Systemic infections can cause fever, increased heart and respiratory rates, lethargy, malaise, anorexia, and tenderness and enlargement of the lymph nodes.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes a primary infection can lead to a secondary infection by an opportunistic pathogen. For example, when a patient experiences a primary infection from influenza, it can damage and decrease the defense mechanisms of the lungs, making the patient more susceptible to a secondary pneumonia by a bacterial pathogen like Haemophilus influenzae. Additionally, treatment of the primary infection may lead to a secondary infection caused by an opportunistic pathogen. For example, antibiotic therapy targeting the primary infection alters the normal flora and creates an opening for opportunistic pathogens like Clostridium difficile or Candida Albicans to cause a secondary infection.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Bacteremia, SIRS, Sepsis, and Septic Shock</h3>
                        <p>When infection occurs, pathogens can enter the bloodstream. The presence of bacteria in blood is called <strong>bacteremia</strong>. If bacteria are both present and multiplying in the blood, it is called <strong>septicemia</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)</strong> is an exaggerated inflammatory response that affects the entire body. It is the body's reaction to a noxious stressor, including causes such as infection and acute inflammation, but other conditions can trigger it as well. Signs of SIRS are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Body temperature over 38 or under 36 degrees Celsius</li>
                            <li>Heart rate greater than 90 beats/minute</li>
                            <li>Respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths/minute or PaCO2 less than 32 mmHg</li>
                            <li>White blood cell count greater than 12,000 or less than 4,000 / microliters or over 10% of immature forms (bands)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Even though the purpose of SIRS is to defend against a noxious stressor, the uncontrolled release of massive amounts of cytokines, called cytokine storm, can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sepsis</strong> refers to SIRS that is caused by an infection. Sepsis occurs when an existing infection triggers an exaggerated inflammatory reaction throughout the body. If left untreated, sepsis causes tissue and organ damage. It can quickly spread to multiple organs and is a life-threatening medical emergency.</p>
                        <p>Sepsis causing damage to one or more organs (such as the kidneys) is called <strong>severe sepsis</strong>. Severe sepsis can lead to <strong>septic shock</strong>, a life-threatening decrease in blood pressure (systolic pressure < 90 mm Hg) that prevents cells and other organs from receiving enough oxygen and nutrients, causing multi-organ failure and death. See Figure 9.12 for an illustration of the progression of sepsis from SIRS to septic shock.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0549-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart showing the progression from SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) to Sepsis, then to Severe Sepsis, and finally to Septic Shock." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Unfortunately, almost any type of infection in any individual can lead to sepsis. Infections that lead to sepsis most often start in the lungs, urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, or skin. Some people are especially at risk for developing sepsis, such as adults over age 65; children younger than one year old; people who are immunocompromised or have chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, cancer, and kidney disease; and survivors of a previous sepsis episode.</p>
                        <p>In addition to exhibiting signs of SIRS, patients with sepsis may also have additional signs such as elevated fever and shivering, confusion, shortness of breath, pain or discomfort, and clammy or sweaty skin. Diligent nursing care is vital for recognizing when patients with a diagnosed infection are developing sepsis. It is important to know the early signs of SIRS and sepsis and to act quickly by notifying the health care provider and/or following sepsis protocols in place at your health care facility.</p>

                        <h3>Toxins</h3>
                        <p>Some pathogens release toxins that are biological poisons that assist in their ability to invade and cause damage to tissues. For example, Botulinum toxin (also known as botox) is a neurotoxin produced by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium botulinum that is an acutely toxic substance because it blocks the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The toxin's blockage of acetylcholine results in muscle paralysis with the potential to stop breathing due to its effect on the respiratory muscles. This condition is referred to as botulism, a type of food poisoning that can be caused by improper sterilization of canned foods. However, because of its paralytic action, low concentrations of botox are also used for beneficial purposes such as cosmetic procedures to remove wrinkles and in the medical treatment of overactive bladder.</p>
                        <p>Another type of neurotoxin is tetanus toxin, which is produced by the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium tetani. Tetanus toxin inhibits the release of GABA, resulting in permanent muscle contraction. The first symptom of tetanus is typically stiffness of the jaw. Violent muscle spasms in other parts of the body follow, typically culminating with respiratory failure and death. Because of the severity of tetanus, it is important for nurses to encourage individuals to regularly receive tetanus vaccination boosters throughout their lifetimes.</p>

                        <h3>Stages of Disease</h3>
                        <p>When a pathogen becomes an infection-causing disease, there are five stages of disease, including the incubation, prodromal, illness, decline, and convalescence periods. See Figure 9.13 for an illustration of the stages of disease.</p>

                        <h4>Incubation Period</h4>
                        <p>The <strong>incubation period</strong> occurs after the initial entry of the pathogen into the host when it begins to multiply, but there are insufficient numbers of the pathogen present to cause signs and symptoms of disease. Incubation periods can vary from a day or two in acute disease to months or years in chronic disease, depending upon the pathogen. Factors involved in determining the length of the incubation period are diverse and can include virulence of the pathogen, strength of the host immune defenses, site of infection, and the amount of the pathogen received during exposure. During this incubation period, the patient is unaware that a disease is beginning to develop.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Prodromal Period</h4>
                        <p>The <strong>prodromal period</strong> occurs after the incubation period. During this phase, the pathogen continues to multiply, and the host begins to experience general signs and symptoms of illness caused from activation of the nonspecific innate immunity, such as not feeling well (malaise), low-grade fever, pain, swelling, or inflammation. These signs and symptoms are often too general to indicate a particular disease is occurring.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Acute Phase</h4>
                        <p>Following the prodromal period is the period of <strong>acute illness</strong>, during which the signs and symptoms of a specific disease become obvious and can become severe. This period of acute illness is followed by the period of <strong>decline</strong> as the immune system overcomes the pathogen. The number of pathogen particles begins to decline and thus the signs and symptoms of illness begin to decrease. However, during the decline period, patients may become susceptible to developing secondary infections because their immune systems have been weakened by the primary infection.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Convalescent Period</h4>
                        <p>The final period of disease is known as the <strong>convalescent period</strong>. During this stage, the patient generally returns to normal daily functioning, although some diseases may inflict permanent damage that the body cannot fully repair. For example, if a strep infection becomes systemic and causes a secondary infection of the patient's heart valves, the heart valves may never return to full function and heart failure may develop.</p>
                        <p>Infectious diseases can be contagious during all five of the periods of disease. The transmissibility of an infection during these periods depends upon the pathogen and the mechanisms by which the disease develops and progresses. For example, with many viral diseases associated with rashes (e.g., chicken pox, measles, rubella, roseola), patients are contagious during the incubation period up to a week before the rash develops. In contrast, with many respiratory infections (e.g., colds, influenza, diphtheria, strep throat, and pertussis) the patient becomes contagious with the onset of the prodromal period. Depending upon the pathogen, the disease, and the individual infected, transmission can still occur during the periods of decline, convalescence, and even long after signs and symptoms of the disease disappear. For example, an individual recovering from a diarrheal disease may continue to carry and shed the pathogen in feces for a long time, posing a risk of transmission to others through direct or indirect contact.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Types of Infection</h3>
                        <h4>Acute vs. Chronic</h4>
                        <p><strong>Acute, self-limiting infections</strong> develop rapidly and generally last only 10-14 days. Colds and ear infections are considered acute, self-limiting infections. See Figure 9.14 for an image of an individual with an acute, self-limiting infection. Conversely, <strong>chronic infections</strong> may persist for months. Hepatitis and mononucleosis are examples of chronic infections.</p>

                        <h4>Healthcare-Associated Infections</h4>
                        <p>An infection that is contracted in a health care facility or under medical care is known as a <strong>healthcare-associated infection (HAI)</strong>, formerly referred to as a nosocomial infection. On any given day, about one in 31 hospital patients has at least one healthcare-associated infection. HAls increase the cost of care and delay recovery and are associated with permanent disability, loss of wages, and even death.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has established these goals to reduce these common healthcare-associated infections in health care institutions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI)</li>
                            <li>Reduce catheter-associated urinary tracts infections (CAUTI)</li>
                            <li>Reduce the incidence of invasive health care-associated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)</li>
                            <li>Reduce hospital-onset MRSA bloodstream infections</li>
                            <li>Reduce hospital-onset Clostridium difficile infections</li>
                            <li>Reduce the rate of Clostridium difficile hospitalizations</li>
                            <li>Reduce surgical site infections (SSI)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Blood-borne Pathogens</h4>
                        <p>Blood-borne pathogens are potentially present in a patient's blood and body fluids, placing other patients and health care providers at risk for infection if they are exposed. The most common blood-borne pathogens include hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p>
                        <p>When a nurse or other health care worker experiences exposure due to a needlestick injury or the splashing of body fluids, it should be immediately reported so that careful monitoring can occur. When the source of the exposure is known, the health care worker and patient are initially tested. Repeat testing and medical prophylaxis may be warranted for the health care worker, depending on the results.</p>
                        <p>Needlesticks and sharps injuries are the most common causes of blood-borne pathogen exposure for nurses. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed a comprehensive Sharps Injury Prevention Program to decrease needle and sharps injury in health care workers.</p>
                        <p>Needles are also used in the community, such as at home, work, in airports, or public restrooms as individuals use needles to administer prescribed medications or to inject illegal drugs. Nurses can help prevent needlestick and sharps injuries in their community by implementing a community needle disposal program.</p>
                        <p>Read more about needlestick and sharps injury prevention in the "Aseptic Technique" chapter in Open RN Nursing Skills.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. They either kill bacteria or stop them from reproducing, allowing the body's natural defenses to eliminate the pathogens. Used properly, antibiotics can save lives. However, growing antibiotic resistance is curbing the effectiveness of these drugs. Taking an antibiotic as directed, even after symptoms disappear, is key to curing an infection and preventing the development of resistant bacteria.</p>
                        <p>Antibiotics do not work against viral infections such as colds or influenza. Antiviral drugs, which fight infection either by inhibiting a virus's ability to reproduce or by strengthening the body's immune response to the infection, are used for some viral infections. There are several different classes of drugs in the antiviral family, and each is used for specific kinds of viral infections.</p>
                        <p>Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal and yeast infections. Antiparasitic medication is used to treat parasites, and anthelmintic medication is used to treat worm infections.</p>
                        <p>Read more about antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal, and antihelminthic medication in the "Antimicrobials" chapter in Open RN Nursing Pharmacology.</p>

                        <h3>Antibiotic Stewardship</h3>
                        <p>Microorganisms can quickly develop new features that make them resistant to the drugs that were once able to kill them. People infected with antibiotic-resistant organisms are more likely to have longer, more expensive hospital stays and may be more likely to die as a result of an infection.</p>
                        <p>Misuse of antimicrobials is one of the world's most pressing public health problems because of these consequences. Many factors contribute to resistance, including overprescription of antibiotics for nonbacterial infections, use of inappropriate antibiotics for the infectious microorganism, and lack of completion of prescribed antibiotic therapy. Some infections, such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), are becoming increasingly hard to treat and some microorganisms cannot be effectively destroyed by any known antibiotic.</p>
                        <p><strong>Antimicrobial stewardship</strong> is a coordinated program that promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials (including antibiotics), improves patient outcomes, reduces microbial resistance, and decreases the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed core elements for antibiotic stewardship to serve as a guide to improve antibiotic use for improved patient safety and outcomes. See Figure 9.15 for an image from the CDC explaining antibiotic resistance.</p>

                        <p>The nurse plays an important role in antimicrobial stewardship through patient education. For example, many patients expect to receive an antibiotic when they seek treatment for an illness or symptom. However, because antibiotics are only effective in treating bacteria, the patient should be educated regarding effective treatment for the type of pathogen causing their symptoms. If an antibiotic is prescribed, patients should be advised to complete the entire course of therapy or contact their provider if they are unable to do so. For example, patients often feel better after a few days of treatment and decide not to take the remaining medication, or they may experience side effects from the antibiotic (such as nausea and diarrhea) and stop taking the medication. All of these behaviors can lead to antibiotic resistance and should be addressed when providing patient education regarding prescribed antibiotic therapy.</p>

                        <p>In addition to recognizing signs of infection and educating patients about the treatment of their infection, nurses also play an important role in preventing the spread of infection. A cyclic process known as the <strong>chain of infection</strong> describes the transmission of an infection. By implementing interventions to break one or more links in the chain of infection, the spread of infection can be stopped. See Figure 9.16 for an illustration of the links within the chain of infection. These links are described as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Infectious Agent:</strong> A causative organism, such as bacteria, virus, fungi, parasite.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reservoir:</strong> A place where the organism grows, such as in blood, food, or a wound.</li>
                            <li><strong>Portal of Exit:</strong> The method by which the organism leaves the reservoir, such as through respiratory secretions, blood, urine, breast milk, or feces.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mode of Transmission:</strong> The vehicle by which the organism is transferred such as physical contact, inhalation, or injection. The most common vehicles are respiratory secretions spread by a cough, sneeze, or on the hands. A single sneeze can send thousands of virus particles into the air.</li>
                            <li><strong>Portal of Entry:</strong> The method by which the organism enters a new host, such as through mucous membranes or nonintact skin.</li>
                            <li><strong>Susceptible Host:</strong> The susceptible individual the organism has invaded.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0562-1.jpg" alt="A circular diagram illustrating the six links in the chain of infection: Infectious Agent, Reservoir, Portal of Exit, Mode of Transmission, Portal of Entry, and Susceptible Host." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>For a pathogen to continue to exist, it must put itself in a position to be transmitted to a new host, leaving the infected host through a portal of exit. Similar to portals of entry, the most common portals of exit include the skin and the respiratory, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tracts. Coughing and sneezing can expel thousands of pathogens from the respiratory tract into the environment. Other pathogens are expelled through feces, urine, semen, and vaginal secretions. Pathogens that rely on insects for transmission exit the body in the blood extracted by a biting insect.</p>
                        <p>The pathogen enters a new individual via a portal of entry, such as mucous membranes or nonintact skin. If the individual has a weakened immune system or their natural defenses cannot fend off the pathogen, they become infected.</p>

                        <h3>Interventions to Break the Chain of Infection</h3>
                        <p>Infections can be stopped from spreading by interrupting this chain at any link. Chain links can be broken by disinfecting the environment, sterilizing medical instruments and equipment, covering coughs and sneezes, using good hand hygiene, implementing standard and transmission-based precautions, appropriately using personal protective equipment, encouraging patients to stay up-to-date on vaccines (including the flu shot), following safe injection practices, and promoting the optimal functioning of the natural immune system with good nutrition, rest, exercise, and stress management.</p>

                        <h4>Disinfection and Sterilization</h4>
                        <p><strong>Disinfection</strong> and <strong>sterilization</strong> are used to kill microorganisms and remove harmful pathogens from the environment and equipment to decrease the chance of spreading infection. Disinfection is the removal of microorganisms. However, disinfection does not destroy all spores and viruses. Sterilization is a process used on equipment and the environment to destroy all pathogens, including spores and viruses. Sterilization methods include steam, boiling water, dry heat, radiation, and chemicals. Because of the harshness of these sterilization methods, skin can only be disinfected and not sterilized.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions</h4>
                        <p>To protect patients and health care workers from the spread of pathogens, the CDC has developed precautions to use during patient care that address portals of exit, methods of transmission, and portals of entry. These precautions include standard precautions and transmission-based precautions.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Standard Precautions</h5>
                        <p><strong>Standard precautions</strong> are used when caring for all patients to prevent healthcare-associated infections. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), standard precautions are the minimum infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status of the patient, in any setting where health care is delivered. These precautions are based on the principle that all blood, body fluids (except sweat), nonintact skin, and mucous membranes may contain transmissible infectious agents. These standards reduce the risk of exposure for the health care worker and protect the patient from potential transmission of infectious organisms. See Figure 9.17 for an image of some of the components of standard precautions.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Current standard precautions according to the CDC include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Appropriate hand hygiene</li>
                            <li>Use of personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, gowns, masks, eyewear) whenever infectious material exposure may occur</li>
                            <li>Appropriate patient placement and care using transmission-based precautions when indicated</li>
                            <li>Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette</li>
                            <li>Proper handling and cleaning of environment, equipment, and devices</li>
                            <li>Safe handling of laundry</li>
                            <li>Sharps safety (i.e., engineering and work practice controls)</li>
                            <li>Aseptic technique for invasive nursing procedures such as parenteral medication administration</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h6>HAND HYGIENE</h6>
                        <p><strong>Hand hygiene</strong>, although simple, is still the best and most effective way to prevent the spread of infection. The 2021 National Patient Safety Goals from The Joint Commission encourages infection prevention strategy practices such as implementing the hand hygiene guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. Accepted methods for hand hygiene include using either soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. It is essential for all health care workers to use proper hand hygiene at the appropriate times, such as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Immediately before touching a patient</li>
                            <li>Before performing an aseptic task or handling invasive devices</li>
                            <li>Before moving from a soiled body site to a clean body site on a patient</li>
                            <li>After touching a patient or their immediate environment</li>
                            <li>After contact with blood, body fluids, or contaminated surfaces (with or without glove use)</li>
                            <li>Immediately after glove removal</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hand hygiene also includes health care workers keeping their nails short with tips less than 0.5 inches and no nail polish. Nails should be natural, and artificial nails or tips should not be worn. Artificial nails and chipped nail polish have been associated with a higher level of pathogens carried on the hands of the nurse despite hand hygiene.</p>
                        
                        <h6>RESPIRATORY HYGIENE/COUGH ETIQUETTE</h6>
                        <p>Respiratory hygiene is targeted at patients, accompanying family members and friends, and staff members with undiagnosed transmissible respiratory infections. It applies to any person with signs of illness, including cough, congestion, or increased production of respiratory secretions when entering a health care facility. The elements of respiratory hygiene include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Education of health care facility staff, patients, and visitors</li>
                            <li>Posted signs, in language(s) appropriate to the population served, with instructions to patients and accompanying family members or friends</li>
                            <li>Source control measures for a coughing person (e.g., covering the mouth/nose with a tissue when coughing and prompt disposal of used tissues, or applying surgical masks on the coughing person to contain secretions)</li>
                            <li>Hand hygiene after contact with one's respiratory secretions</li>
                            <li>Spatial separation, ideally greater than 3 feet, of persons with respiratory infections in common waiting areas when possible</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Health care personnel are advised to wear a mask and use frequent hand hygiene when examining and caring for patients with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection. Health care personnel who have a respiratory infection are advised to stay home or avoid direct patient contact, especially with high-risk patients. If this is not possible, then a mask should be worn while providing patient care.</p>
                        
                        <h6>PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT</h6>
                        <p><strong>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</strong> includes gloves, gowns, face shields, goggles, and masks used to prevent the spread of infection to and from patients and health care providers. See Figure 9.18 for an image of a nurse wearing PPE. Depending upon the anticipated exposure and type of pathogen, PPE may include the use of gloves, a fluid-resistant gown, goggles or a face shield, and a mask or respirator. When used while caring for a patient with transmission-based precautions, PPE supplies are typically stored in an isolation cart next to the patient's room.</p>

                        <h5>Transmission-Based Precautions</h5>
                        <p>In addition to standard precautions, <strong>transmission-based precautions</strong> are used for patients with documented or suspected infection of highly-transmissible pathogens, such as C. difficile (C-diff), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), measles, and tuberculosis (TB). For patients with these types of pathogens, standard precautions are used along with specific transmission-based precautions.</p>
                        <p>There are three categories of transmission-based precautions: contact precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions. Transmission-based precautions are used when the route(s) of transmission of a specific disease are not completely interrupted using standard precautions alone.</p>
                        <p>Some diseases, such as tuberculosis, have multiple routes of transmission so more than one transmission-based precaution category must be implemented. See Table 9.6 outlining the categories of transmission precautions with associated PPE and other precautions. When possible, patients with transmission-based precautions should be placed in a single occupancy room with dedicated patient care equipment (e.g., blood pressure cuffs, stethoscope, and thermometer stay in the patient's room). A card is posted outside the door alerting staff and visitors to required precautions before entering the room. See Figure 9.19 for an example of signage used for a patient with contact precautions. Transport of the patient and unnecessary movement outside the patient room should be limited. When transmission-based precautions are implemented, it is also important for the nurse to make efforts to counteract possible adverse effects of these precautions on patients, such as anxiety, depression, perceptions of stigma, and reduced contact with clinical staff.</p>

                        <h6>PATIENT TRANSPORT</h6>
                        <p>Several principles are used to guide transport of patients requiring transmission-based precautions. In the inpatient and residential settings, these principles include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limit transport for essential purposes only, such as diagnostic and therapeutic procedures that cannot be performed in the patient's room</li>
                            <li>When transporting, use appropriate barriers on the patient consistent with the route and risk of transmission (e.g., mask, gown, covering the affected areas when infectious skin lesions or drainage is present)</li>
                            <li>Notify health care personnel in the receiving area of the impending arrival of the patient and of the precautions necessary to prevent transmission</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h6>ENTERIC PRECAUTIONS</h6>
                        <p>Enteric precautions are used when there is the presence, or suspected presence, of gastrointestinal pathogens such as Clostridium difficile (C-diff) or norovirus. These pathogens are present in feces, so health care workers should always wear a gown in the patient room to prevent inadvertent fecal contamination of their clothing from contact with contaminated surfaces.</p>
                        <p>In addition to contact precautions, enteric precautions include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Using only soap and water for hand hygiene. Do not use hand sanitizer because it is not effective against C-diff.</li>
                            <li>Using a special disinfecting process. Special disinfecting should be used after patient discharge and includes disinfection of the mattress.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h6>REVERSE ISOLATION</h6>
                        <p>Reverse isolation, also called neutropenic precautions, is used for patients who have compromised immune systems and low neutrophil levels. This type of isolation protects the patient from pathogens in their environment. In addition to using contact precautions to protect the patient, reverse isolation precautions include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Meticulous hand hygiene by all visitors, staff, and the patient</li>
                            <li>Frequently monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection and sepsis</li>
                            <li>Not allowing live plants, fresh flowers, fresh raw fruits or vegetables, sushi, deli foods, or cheese into the room due to bacteria and fungi</li>
                            <li>Placement in a private room or a positive pressure room</li>
                            <li>Limited transport and movement of the patient outside of the room</li>
                            <li>Masking of the patient for transport with a surgical mask</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h6>PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ISOLATION</h6>
                        <p>Although the use of transmission-based precautions is needed to prevent the spread of infection, it is important for nurses to be aware of the potential psychological impact on the patient. Research has shown that isolation can cause negative impact on patient mental well-being and behavior, including higher scores for depression, anxiety, and anger among isolated patients. It has also been found that health care workers spend less time with patients in isolation, resulting in a negative impact on patient safety.</p>
                        <p>Patient and family education at the time of instituting transmission-based precautions is a critical component of the process to reduce anxiety and distress. Patients often feel stigmatized when placed in isolation, so it is important for them to understand the rationale of the precautions to keep themselves and others free from the spread of disease. Preparing patients emotionally will also help decrease their anxiety and help them cope with isolation. It is also important to provide distractions from boredom, such as music, television, video games, magazines, or books, as appropriate.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Aseptic and Sterile Techniques</h4>
                        <p>In addition to using standard precautions and transmission-based precautions, <strong>aseptic technique</strong> (also called medical asepsis) is used to prevent the transfer of microorganisms from one person or object to another during a medical procedure. For example, a nurse administering parenteral medication or performing urinary catheterization uses aseptic technique. When performed properly, aseptic technique prevents contamination and transfer of pathogens to the patient from caregiver hands, surfaces, and equipment during routine care or procedures. It is important to remember that potentially infectious microorganisms can be present in the environment, on instruments, in liquids, on skin surfaces, or within a wound.</p>
                        <p>There is often misunderstanding between the terms aseptic technique and sterile technique in the health care setting. Both asepsis and sterility are closely related with the shared concept being the removal of harmful microorganisms that can cause infection. In the most simplistic terms, aseptic technique involves creating a protective barrier to prevent the spread of pathogens, whereas <strong>sterile technique</strong> is a purposeful attack on microorganisms. Sterile technique (also called surgical asepsis) seeks to eliminate every potential microorganism in and around a sterile field while also maintaining objects as free from microorganisms as possible. Sterile fields are implemented during surgery, as well as during nursing procedures such as the insertion of a urinary catheter, changing dressings on open wounds, and performing central line care. See Figure 9.20 for an image of a sterile field during surgery. Sterile technique requires a combination of meticulous hand washing, creating and maintaining a sterile field, using long-lasting antimicrobial cleansing agents such as Betadine, donning sterile gloves, and using sterile devices and instruments.</p>

                        <h4>Other Hygienic Patient Care Interventions</h4>
                        <p>In addition to implementing standard and transmission-based precautions and utilizing aseptic and sterile technique when performing procedures, nurses implement many interventions to place a patient in the best health possible to prevent an infection or treat infection. These interventions include actions like encouraging rest and good nutrition, teaching stress management, providing good oral care, encouraging daily bathing, and changing linens. It is also important to consider how gripper socks, mobile devices, and improper glove usage can contribute to the transmission of pathogens.</p>
                        
                        <h6>ORAL CARE</h6>
                        <p>Patient hygiene is important in the prevention and spread of infection. Although oral care may be given a low priority, research has found that poor oral care is associated with the spread of infection, poor health outcomes, and poor nutrition. Oral care should be performed in the morning, after meals, and before bed.</p>
                        
                        <h6>DAILY BATHING</h6>
                        <p>Daily bathing is another intervention that may be viewed as time-consuming and receive low priority, but it can have a powerful impact on decreasing the spread of infection. Studies have shown a significant decrease in healthcare-associated infections with daily bathing using chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) wipes or solution. The use of traditional soap and water baths do not reduce infection rates as significantly as CHG products, and wash basins have also been shown to be a reservoir for pathogens.</p>
                        
                        <h6>LINENS</h6>
                        <p>Changing bed linens, towels, and a gown regularly eliminates potential reservoirs of bacteria. Fresh linens also promote patient comfort.</p>
                        
                        <h6>GRIPPER SOCKS</h6>
                        <p>Have you ever thought about what happens to the bed linens when a patient returns from a walk in the hallway with gripper socks and gets back into bed with these socks? Research demonstrates that pathogens from the floor are transferred to the patient bed linens from the gripper socks. Nurses should remove gripper socks that were used for walking before patients climb into bed. They should also throw the socks away when the patient is discharged instead of sending them home.</p>
                        
                        <h6>CELLULAR PHONES AND MOBILE DEVICES</h6>
                        <p>Research has shown that cell phones and mobile devices carry many pathogens and are dirtier than a toilet seat or the bottom of a shoe. Patients, staff, and visitors routinely bring these mobile devices into health care facilities, which can cause the spread of disease. Nurses should frequently wipe mobile devices with disinfectant. They should encourage patients and visitors to disinfect phones frequently and avoid touching the face after having touched a mobile device.</p>
                        
                        <h6>GLOVES</h6>
                        <p>Although gloves are used to prevent the spread of infection, they can also contribute to the spread of infection if used improperly. For example, research has shown that hand hygiene opportunities are being missed because of the overuse of gloves. For example, a nurse may don gloves to suction a patient but neglect to remove them and perform hand hygiene before performing the next procedure on the same patient. This can potentially cause the spread of secondary infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that gloves should be worn when there is an expected risk of exposure to blood or body fluids or to protect the hands from chemicals and hazardous drugs, but hand hygiene is the best method of disease prevention and is preferred over wearing gloves when the exposure risk is minimal. Nurses have the perception that wearing gloves provides extra protection and cleanliness. However, the opposite is true. Nonsterile gloves have a high incidence of contamination with a range of bacteria, which means that a gloved hand is dirtier than a washed hand. Research has shown that nearly 40% of the times that gloves are used in patient care, there is cross contamination. The most striking example of cross contamination includes situations when gloves are used for toileting a patient and not being removed before touching other surfaces or the patient.</p>
                        <p>Glove-related contact dermatitis has also become an important issue in recent years as more and more nurses are experiencing damage to the hands. Contact dermatitis can develop from repeated use of gloves and develops as dry, itchy, irritated areas on the skin of the hands. See Figure 9.21 for an image of contact dermatitis from gloves. Because the skin is the first line of defense in preventing pathogens from entering the body, maintaining intact skin is very important to prevent nurses from exposure to pathogens.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>When assessing an individual who is feeling ill but has not yet been diagnosed with an infection, general symptoms associated with the prodromal period of disease may be present due to the activation of the immune system. These symptoms include a feeling of malaise (not feeling well), headache, fever, and lack of appetite. As an infection moves into the acute phase of disease, more specific symptoms and signs related to the specific type of infection will occur.</p>
                        <p>A fever is a common sign of inflammation and infection. A temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees F) is generally considered a low-grade fever, and a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius (101 degrees F) is considered a fever. As discussed earlier in this chapter, fever is part of the nonspecific innate immune response and can be beneficial in destroying pathogens. However, extremely elevated temperatures can cause cell and organ damage, and prolonged fever can cause dehydration.</p>
                        <p>Infection raises the metabolic rate, causing an increased heart rate. The respiratory rate may also increase as the body rids itself of carbon dioxide created during increased metabolism. However, be aware that an elevated heart rate above 90 and a respiratory rate above 20 are also criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in patients with an existing infection.</p>
                        <p>As an infection develops, the lymph nodes that drain that area often become enlarged and tender. The swelling indicates that the lymphocytes and macrophages in the lymph node are fighting the infection. If a skin infection is developing, general signs of inflammation, such as redness, warmth, swelling, and tenderness, will occur at the site. As white blood cells migrate to the site, purulent drainage may occur.</p>
                        <p>Some viruses, bacteria, and toxins cause gastrointestinal inflammation, resulting in loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>
                        <p>See Table 9.7a for a comparison of expected findings on physical assessment versus unexpected findings indicating a new infectious process that requires notification of the health care provider.</p>

                        <h4>Life Span Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Infants do not have well-developed immune systems, placing this group at higher risk of infection. Breastfeeding helps protect infants from some infectious diseases by providing passive immunity until their immune system matures. New mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their newborns.</p>
                        <p>On the other end of the continuum, the immune system gradually decreases in effectiveness with age, making older adults also more vulnerable to infection. Early detection of infection can be challenging in older adults because they may not have a fever or increased white blood cell count (WBC), but instead develop subtle changes like new mental status changes. The most common infections in older adults are urinary tract infections (UTI), bacterial pneumonia, influenza, and skin infections.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Diagnostic Tests</h4>
                        <p>Several types of diagnostic tests may be ordered by a health care provider when a patient is suspected of having an infection, such as complete blood count with differential, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), serum lactate levels, and blood cultures (if sepsis is suspected). Other cultures may be obtained based on the site of the suspected infection.</p>
                        
                        <h5>CBC WITH DIFFERENTIAL</h5>
                        <p>When an infection is suspected, a complete blood count with differential is usually obtained.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>complete blood count (CBC)</strong> includes the red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), platelets, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values. A <strong>differential</strong> provides additional information, including the relative percentages of each type of white blood cell. See Figure 9.22 for an illustration of a complete blood count with differential.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>When there is an infection or an inflammatory process somewhere in the body, the bone marrow produces more WBCs (also called leukocytes), releasing them into the blood where they move to the site of infection or inflammation. An increase in white blood cells is known as leukocytosis and is a sign of the inflammatory response. The normal range of WBC varies slightly from lab to lab but is generally 4,500-11,000 for adults, reported as 4.5-11.0 x 10<sup>9</sup> per liter (L).</p>
                        <p>There are five types of white blood cells, each with different functions. The differential blood count gives the relative percentage of each type of white blood cell and also reveals abnormal white blood cells. The five types of white blood cells are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Neutrophils</li>
                            <li>Eosinophils</li>
                            <li>Basophils</li>
                            <li>Lymphocytes</li>
                            <li>Monocytes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Neutrophils</strong> make up the largest number of circulating WBCs. They move into an area of damaged or infected tissue where they engulf and destroy bacteria or sometimes fungi. An elevated neutrophil count is called neutrophilia, and decreased neutrophil count is called neutropenia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eosinophils</strong> respond to infections caused by parasites, play a role in allergic reactions (hypersensitivities), and control the extent of immune responses and inflammation. Elevated levels of eosinophils are referred to as eosinophilia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Basophils</strong> make up the fewest number of circulating WBCs and are thought to be involved in allergic reactions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lymphocytes</strong> include three types of cells, although the differential count does not distinguish among them:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>B lymphocytes (B cells)</strong> produce antibodies that target and destroy bacteria, viruses, and other "non-self" foreign antigens.</li>
                            <li><strong>T lymphocytes (T cells)</strong> mature in the thymus and consist of a few different types. Some T cells help the body distinguish between "self" and "non-self" antigens; some initiate and control the extent of an immune response, boosting it as needed and then slowing it as the condition resolves; and other types of T cells directly attack and neutralize virus-infected or cancerous cells.</li>
                            <li><strong>Natural killer cells (NK cells)</strong> directly attack and kill abnormal cells such as cancer cells or those infected with a virus.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Monocytes</strong>, similar to neutrophils, move to an area of infection and engulf and destroy bacteria. They are associated with chronic rather than acute infections. They are also involved in tissue repair and other functions involving the immune system.</p>
                        <p>Care must be taken when interpreting the results of a differential. A health care provider will consider an individual's signs and symptoms and medical history, as well as the degree to which each type of cell is increased or decreased. A number of factors can cause a transient rise or drop in the number of any type of cell. For example, bacterial infections usually produce an increase in neutrophils, but a severe infection, like sepsis, can use up the available neutrophils, causing a low number to be found in the blood. Eosinophils are often elevated in parasitic and allergic responses. Acute viral infections often cause an increased level of lymphocytes (referred to as lymphocytosis).</p>

                        <h5>ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR)</h5>
                        <p>An <strong>erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)</strong> is a test that indirectly measures inflammation. This test measures how quickly erythrocytes or red blood cells (RBCs) settle at the bottom of a test tube that contains a blood sample. When a sample of blood is placed in a tube, the red blood cells normally settle out relatively slowly, leaving a small amount of clear plasma. The red cells settle at a faster rate when there is an increased level of proteins, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), that increases in the blood in response to inflammation. The ESR test is not diagnostic; it is a nonspecific test indicating the presence or absence of an inflammatory condition.</p>
                        
                        <h5>C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP)</h5>
                        <p><strong>C-Reactive Protein (CRP)</strong> levels in the blood increase when there is a condition causing inflammation somewhere in the body. CRP is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation and one of the most sensitive acute phase reactants, meaning it is released into the blood within a few hours after the start of an infection or other cause of inflammation. The level of CRP can jump as much as a thousand-fold in response to a severe bacterial infection, and its rise in the blood can precede symptoms of fever or pain.</p>

                        <h5>LACTATE</h5>
                        <p>Serum <strong>lactate</strong> levels are measured when sepsis is suspected in a patient with an existing infection. Sepsis can quickly lead to septic shock and death due to multi-organ failure so early recognition is crucial.</p>
                        <p>Lactate is one of the substances produced by cells as the body turns food into energy (i.e., cellular metabolism), with the highest level of production occurring in the muscles. Normally, the level of lactate in blood is low. Lactate is produced in excess by muscle cells and other tissues when there is insufficient oxygen at the cellular level.</p>
                        <p>Lactic acid can accumulate in the body and blood when it is produced faster than the liver can break it down, which can lead to lactic acidosis. Excess lactate may be produced due to several medical conditions that cause decreased transport of oxygen to the tissues, such as sepsis, hypovolemic shock, heart attack, heart failure, or respiratory distress.</p>
                        
                        <h5>BLOOD CULTURE</h5>
                        <p>Blood cultures are ordered when sepsis is suspected. In many facilities, lab personnel draw the blood samples for blood cultures to avoid contamination of the sample. With some infections, pathogens are only found in the blood intermittently, so a series of three or more blood cultures, as well as blood draws from different veins, may be performed to increase the chance of finding the infection.</p>
                        <p>Blood cultures are incubated for several days before being reported as negative. Some types of bacteria and fungi grow more slowly than others and/or may take longer to detect if initially present in low numbers.</p>
                        <p>A positive result indicates bacteria have been found in the blood (bacteremia). Other types of pathogens, such as a fungus or a virus, may also be found in a blood culture. When a blood culture is positive, the specific microbe causing the infection is identified and susceptibility testing is performed to inform the health care provider which antibiotics or other medications are most likely to be effective for treatment.</p>
                        <p>It is important for nurses to remember that when new orders for both antibiotics and a blood culture are received, antibiotics should not be administered until after the blood culture is drawn. Administering antibiotics before the blood culture is drawn will impact the results and adversely affect the treatment plan.</p>
                        
                        <h5>CULTURES AND OTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTS</h5>
                        <p>Several types of swabs and cultures may be ordered based on the site of a suspected infection, such as a nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, sputum culture, urine culture, and wound culture. If a lower respiratory tract infection is suspected, a chest X-ray may be ordered.</p>
                        
                        <h5>THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING</h5>
                        <p>When antibiotics are prescribed to treat an infection, some types of antibiotics require blood tests to ensure the dosage of the medication reaches and stays within therapeutic ranges in the blood. These tests are often referred to as peak and/or trough levels. The nurse must be aware of these orders because they impact the timing of administration of antibiotics.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>There are many NANDA-I nursing diagnoses applicable to infection. Nursing diagnoses associated with actual infections are customized based on the signs and symptoms of the specific infection (e.g., a patient with pneumonia may have an actual nursing diagnosis of Ineffective Airway Clearance). Review a nursing care planning source for a list of current NANDA-I approved nursing diagnoses based on the type of infection occurring.</p>
                        <p>Two common risk diagnoses are <em>Risk for Infection</em> for patients at risk for developing an infection and <em>Risk for Shock</em> for patients with an existing infection who are at risk for developing sepsis and septic shock. See Table 9.7b for the risk diagnoses of <em>Risk for Infection</em> and <em>Risk for Shock</em>.</p>

                        <h4>Examples</h4>
                        <p>For example, a nurse caring for a patient with an open wound assesses the wound regularly because patients with nonintact skin are always at increased risk for developing infection. A sample PES statement would be the following: "<em>Risk for Infection as evidenced by alteration in skin integrity and insufficient knowledge to avoid exposure to pathogens.</em>" The nurse plans to provide patient education regarding care of the wound to prevent bacterial contamination during dressing changes.</p>
                        <p>Whenever caring for a patient with an existing infection, nurses know it is important to closely monitor for signs of developing SIRS and sepsis. A sample PES statement for a patient with an existing infection is as follows: "<em>Risk for Shock as evidenced by the associated condition of infection.</em>"</p>
                        <p>Note: Recall that in NANDA-I risk diagnoses, there are no etiological factors because a vulnerability reflects the potential for developing a problem. Read more about creating PES statements for risk diagnoses in the "Nursing Process" chapter.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                        <p>An example of a broad goal for all patients is the following: "The patient will remain free from infection during their health care stay."</p>
                        <p>An example of a SMART expected outcome to prevent infection is: "The patient will demonstrate how to perform dressing changes using aseptic technique prior to discharge from the hospital."</p>

                        <h3>Implementing Interventions</h3>
                        <p>When caring for a patient with an active infection, transmission-based precautions may be required based on the specific type of pathogen. Antibiotics and/or other antimicrobials are administered as prescribed, and the patient and family are instructed how to take prescribed antibiotics with measures to prevent antibiotic resistance (i.e., complete prescribed length of therapy even if they feel better in a few days).</p>
                        <p>If cultures have been obtained, it is important to monitor and report new results to the provider to ensure the prescribed antibiotic therapy is appropriate based on susceptibility results.</p>
                        <p>It is important to continually monitor patients with an existing infection for signs of SIRS/sepsis:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Carefully monitor vital signs. Immediately notify the provider for two or more of the following indicators that suggest SIRS: heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute, temperature greater than 38 degrees C or less than 36 degrees C, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, respiratory rate greater than 20, or a white blood cell count greater than 12,000 or less than 4,000. Anticipate new orders for a lactate level and blood cultures for early diagnosis of sepsis.</li>
                            <li>Monitor for signs of new decreased mental status, especially in older adults, that can indicate decreased oxygenation or tissue perfusion associated with sepsis and septic shock.</li>
                            <li>For patients presenting with early signs of shock, administer oxygen immediately to maintain oxygen saturation greater than 90%. Administer prescribed antibiotics within an hour after diagnosis for improved survival. Be aware that IV fluids and vasopressor medications may be required to treat shock.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>It is always important to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions used to prevent and treat infection. Evaluation helps the nurse determine whether the established outcomes have been met and if the planned interventions are still appropriate for the patient at the time of implementation. If outcomes are not met, interventions may need to be added or revised to help the patient meet their goals.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mrs. Charles is a 74-year-old woman admitted to the medical surgical floor with pneumonia. She has a history of right sided hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body) and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) as a result of a cerebral vascular accident three years ago. Upon assessment, the patient has a RR of 22, and rhonchi in her upper lobes. Her oxygenation saturation is 89% on room air, and she is utilizing accessory muscles during respiration.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse notes that the patient demonstrates tachypnea, hypoxemia, and abnormal breath sounds. She has a history of hemiplegia and dysphagia.</p>
                        <p>Based on the assessment information that has been gathered, the following nursing care plan is created for Mrs. Charles.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Ineffective Airway Clearance related to excessive mucus as evidenced by adventitious breath sounds and alteration in respiratory rate.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will maintain patent airway at all times.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mrs. Charles will effectively clear secretions throughout the hospitalization.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will assess the patient's respiratory rate, rhythm, and depth of respiration. The nurse will assess and instruct the patient on the methods of appropriate cough and deep breathing. The nurse will auscultate lung fields to identify areas of worsening airflow. The nurse will elevate the patient's head of bed and encourage hydration to thin secretions. The nurse will instruct the patient regarding proper deep breathing exercises and encourage assisted ambulation to mobilize secretions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Documentation:</h4>
                        <p>Mrs. Charles has ineffective airway clearance as a result of aspiration pneumonia secondary to dysphagia. The patient has rhonchi in bilateral upper lobes, decreased oxygenation, and tachypnea. In order to enhance airway clearance and mobilize secretions, the patient has received instruction to maintain fluid intake, increase ambulation, and cough and deep breathe. The patient will maintain an elevated head of bed to encourage ease of respiration and will be assessed frequently for worsening respiratory status.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>During the patient's hospitalization, she maintains a patent airway and effectively clears secretions resulting in improved respiratory effort and overall function. The SMART outcome was "met."</p>

                        <p>Ms. Jamison is a 37-year-old patient presenting to the emergency department with an ongoing fever and chills for the last three days. She recently received treatment for a urinary tract infection but confesses that she stopped her antibiotic regimen when her symptoms resolved. Upon assessment, her vital signs are T-101.6 F, HR 115, RR 20, BP 96/54. The admitting physician has ordered a Basic Metabolic Profile, Complete Blood Cell Count, and Urinalysis. The results are still pending. Based upon what is known about Ms. Jamison at this time, how would you characterize her condition? What characteristics lead you to suspect your diagnosis?</p>

                            <dd>A localized pathogen that spreads to a secondary location.</dd>
                            <dt>Sepsis</dt>
                            <dd>An existing infection that triggers an exaggerated inflammatory reaction called SIRS throughout the body. If left untreated, sepsis causes tissue damage and quickly spreads to multiple organs. It is a life-threatening medical emergency.</dd>
                            <dt>Septicemia</dt>
                            <dd>Bacteria that are both present and multiplying in the blood.</dd>
                            <dt>Septic shock</dt>
                            <dd>Severe sepsis that leads to a life-threatening decrease in blood pressure (systolic pressure &lt;90 mm Hg), preventing cells and other organs from receiving enough oxygen and nutrients. It can cause multi-organ failure and death.</dd>
                            <dt>Specific adaptive immunity</dt>
                            <dd>The immune response that is activated when the nonspecific innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. There are two types of adaptive responses: the cell-mediated immune response, which is carried out by T cells, and the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies.</dd>
                            <dt>Standard precautions</dt>
                            <dd>The minimum infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care, regardless of suspected or confirmed infection status of the patient, in any setting where health care is delivered.</dd>
                            <dt>Sterile technique</dt>
                            <dd>A process, also called surgical asepsis, used to eliminate every potential microorganism in and around a sterile field while also maintaining objects as free from microorganisms as possible. It is the standard of care for surgical procedures, invasive wound management, and central line care. Sterile technique requires a combination of meticulous hand washing, creating a sterile field, using long-lasting antimicrobial cleansing agents such as Betadine, donning sterile gloves, and using sterile devices and instruments.</dd>
                            <dt>Sterilization</dt>
                            <dd>A process used to destroy all pathogens from inanimate objects, including spores and viruses.</dd>

                            <dd>An infection that becomes disseminated throughout the body.</dd>
                            <dt>Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)</dt>
                            <dd>An exaggerated inflammatory response to a noxious stressor (including, but not limited to, infection and acute inflammation) that affects the entire body.</dd>
                            <dt>T cells</dt>
                            <dd>Immune cells that mature in the thymus. T cells are categorized into three classes: helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells stimulate B cells to make antibodies and help killer cells develop. Killer T cells directly kill cells that have already been infected by a pathogen. T cells also use cytokines as messenger molecules to send chemical instructions to the rest of the immune system to ramp up its response.</dd>
                            <dt>Transmission-based precautions</dt>
                            <dd>Precautions used for patients with documented or suspected infection, or colonization, of highly-transmissible pathogens, such as C. difficile (C-diff), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), measles, and tuberculosis (TB). Three categories of transmission-based precautions are contact precautions, droplet precautions, and airborne precautions.</dd>
