                        <ul>
                            <li>Demonstrate principles of holistic care by incorporating cultural, religious, and spiritual influences on patient health</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>Spirituality includes a sense of connection to something bigger than oneself and typically involves a search for meaning and purpose in life. People may describe a spiritual experience as sacred or transcendent or simply feel a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness. Some people's spiritual life is linked to a religious association with a church, temple, mosque, or synagogue, whereas others pray and find comfort in a personal relationship with God or a higher power and still others find meaning through their connections to nature or art. A person's definition of spirituality and sense of purpose often change throughout one's lifetime as it evolves based on personal experiences and relationships.</p>
                        <p>Over the past decade, research has demonstrated the importance of spirituality in health care. Spiritual distress is very common in patients and their family members experiencing serious illness, injury, or death, and nurses are on the front lines as they assist these individuals to cope. Addressing a patient's spirituality and providing spiritual care have been shown to improve patients' health and quality of life, including how they experience pain, cope with stress and suffering associated with serious illness, and approach end of life.</p>
                        <p>Consensus-driven recommendations define a spiritual care model where all clinicians address spiritual issues and work with trained chaplains who are spiritual care specialists. By therapeutically using presence, unconditional acceptance, and compassion, nurses often provide spiritual care and help patients find hope and meaning in their life experiences. The Interprofessional Spiritual Care Education Curriculum (ISPEC), developed by George Washington University for health care professionals, is an education initiative to improve spiritual care for seriously ill patients in the United States and internationally. This chapter will introduce concepts included in the ISPEC curriculum, review religious beliefs and practices of various world religions, and discuss therapeutic interventions that nurses can use to promote patients' and their own spiritual well-being.</p>

                        <h3>Spiritual Distress</h3>
                        <p>When patients are initially diagnosed with an illness or experience a serious injury, they often grapple with the existential question, "Why is this happening to me?" This question is often a sign of spiritual distress. <strong>Spiritual distress</strong> is defined by NANDA-I as, "A state of suffering related to the inability to experience meaning in life through connections with self, others, the world, or a superior being." Nurses can help relieve this suffering by therapeutically responding to patients' signs of spiritual distress and advocating for their spiritual needs throughout their health care experience.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Spirituality</h3>
                        <p>Provision 1 of the ANA Code of Ethics states, "The nurse practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and unique attributes of every person" and "optimal nursing care enables the patient to live with as much physical, emotional, social, and religious or spiritual wellbeing as possible and reflects the patient's own values."</p>
                        <p><strong>Spiritual well-being</strong> is a pattern of experiencing and integrating meaning and purpose in life through connectedness with self, others, art, music, literature, nature, and/or a power greater than oneself. <strong>Spirituality</strong> is defined by the Interprofessional Spiritual Care Education Curriculum (ISPEC) as, "A dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity through which persons seek ultimate meaning, purpose, and transcendence and experience relationship to self, family, others, community, society, nature, and the significant or sacred."</p>
                        <p>Spiritual needs and spirituality are often mistakenly equated with religion, but spirituality is a broader concept. Elements of spirituality include faith, meaning, love, belonging, forgiveness, and connectedness. Spirituality and spiritual values in the context of nursing are closely intertwined with the concept of caring. See Figure 18.1 for an illustration of spirituality.</p>

                        <p>An integrative review of nursing research and resources was completed in 2014 to describe the impact of spirituality and spiritual support in nursing. See the following box for discussion of findings from this integrative review.</p>

                        <aside class="callout note" role="note">
                            <h4 class="callout-title">Integrative Review of Spirituality in Nursing</h4>
                            <p>An integrative review of nursing literature selected 26 articles published between 1999 and 2013 to describe the experiences of spirituality and the positive impact of spiritual support in nursing literature. Spirituality was described as the integration of body, mind, and spirit into a harmonious whole (often referred to as holistic care). Spirituality was associated with the development of inner strength, looking into one's own soul, believing there is more to life than worldly affairs, and trying to understand who we are and why we are on this earth.</p>
                            <p><strong>Transcendence</strong> was described as an understanding of being part of a greater picture or of something greater than oneself, such as the awe one can experience when walking in nature. It was also expressed as a search for the sacred through subjective feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Spirituality was found to have a positive effect on patients' health and promoted recovery by viewing life from different perspectives and looking beyond one's own anxiety to develop an understanding of illness and change.</p>
                            <p>Relationships and connectedness were also found to be powerful spiritual interventions that contributed to an individual's spirituality. This included embracing, crying together, gift giving, having coffee together, and visiting each other. Laughter, happy thoughts, and the smiles of others were considered comforting. Being with others was described as a primary spiritual need, and conversation was unnecessary. Spirituality brought about the realization that the relationship with family and friends is important and involves finding a healthy balance in relationships among friends, family, society, and a higher power. Presence was the most influential element in positively influencing recovery. The presence of family and friends was a calming experience that brought forth comfort, peace, happiness, joy, acceptance, and hope.</p>
                            <p>Nurses facilitate their patients' search for meaning by enabling them to express personal beliefs, as well as by supporting them in taking part in their religious and cultural practices. Furthermore, nurses assess and meet their patients' spiritual needs by using active listening when talking, asking questions, and picking up patient cues. Active listening requires nurses to be fully present, especially when patients appear depressed or upset.</p>
                            <p>Nurses were found to use their own spirituality when helping patients achieve spiritual well-being. A desire to help others in need is an important part of spirituality, which is also described as discovering meaning and purpose in life and offering the gift of self to others. Helping others also brings a sense of self-worth, personal fulfilment, and satisfaction.</p>

                        <h3>Spiritual Assessment</h3>
                        <p>The Joint Commission requires that health care organizations provide a spiritual assessment when patients are admitted to a hospital. Spiritual assessment can include questions such as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Who or what provides you with strength or hope?</li>
                            <li>How do you express your spirituality?</li>
                            <li>What spiritual needs can we advocate for you during this health care experience?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to performing a routine spiritual assessment on admission, nurses often notice other cues related to a patient's spiritual distress or desire to enhance their spiritual well-being. When these cues are identified, spiritual care should be provided to relieve suffering and promote spiritual health. There are several nursing interventions that can be implemented, in addition to contacting the health care agency's chaplain or the patient's clergy member.</p>
                        <p>Many hospitals, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospices employ professionally trained <strong>chaplains</strong> to assist with the spiritual, religious, and emotional needs of patients, family members, and staff. In these settings, chaplains support and encourage people of all religious faiths and cultures and customize their approach to each individual's background, age, and medical condition. Chaplains can meet with any individual regardless of their belief, or lack of belief, in a higher power and can be very helpful in reducing anxiety and distress. A nurse can make a referral for a chaplain without a provider order. See Figure 18.2 for an image of a hospital chaplain offering support to a patient.</p>

                        <p>A chaplain assists patients and their family members to develop a spiritual view of their serious illness, injury, or death, which promotes coping and healing. A spiritual view of life and death includes elements such as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Suffering occurs at physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual levels. Sociocultural factors, religious beliefs, family values and dynamics, and other environmental factors affect a person's response to suffering.</li>
                            <li>Hope is a desire or goal for a particular event or outcome.</li>
                            <li>Mystery is knowing there is truth beyond understanding and explanation.</li>
                            <li>Peacemaking is the creation of a space for nurturing and healing.</li>
                            <li>Forgiveness is an internal process releasing intense emotions attached to past incidents.</li>
                            <li>Prayer is an expression of one's spirituality through a personalized interaction or organized form of petitioning and worship.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Religious Classifications</h3>
                        <p>For centuries, humankind has sought to understand and explain the "meaning of life." <strong>Religion</strong> is a unified system of beliefs, values, and practices that a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant. Spiritual practices often unite a moral community called a church. Some people associate religion with a place of worship, a practice, or a concept that guides one's daily life. See Figure 18.3 for an illustration of symbols from many worldwide religions.</p>

                        <h3>Religions</h3>
                        <p>Monotheism includes the religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. People who practice Judaism are called Jews, people who practice Christianity are called Christians, and people who practice Islam are called Muslims. Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe in many of the same historical sacred stories, referred to by Christians as the "Old Testament."</p>

                        <h4>Judaism</h4>
                        <p>After their exodus from slavery in Egypt in the thirteenth century B.C., Jews became a nomadic society worshipping only one God. The Jewish covenant, a promise of a special relationship with Yahweh (God), is an important element of Judaism. The sacred text of Judaism is the Torah. Jews emphasize moral behavior and action in life. Jewish religious services are held in a synagogue. See Figure 18.4 for an image of the Torah and the Star of David.</p>

                        <h4>Christianity</h4>
                        <p>Christianity began over 2,000 years ago in Palestine with the birth of a Jew named Jesus Christ. Jesus was a charismatic leader and believed by Christians to be the son of God. The sacred text for Christians is the Bible. Christians attend religious services in a church or cathedral. See Figure 18.5 for an image of a sculpture depicting Jesus Christ crucified on a cross.</p>

                        <h4>Hinduism</h4>
                        <p>Hinduism originated in the Indus River Valley about 4,500 years ago. Hindus believe in a divine power that can manifest as different entities. Multiple sacred texts, collectively called the Vedas, contain hymns and rituals. Hindus believe in dharma (one's duty) and karma (spiritual ramifications of one's actions). See Figure 18.7 for a statue of Shiva in a yogic meditation.</p>

                        <h4>Buddhism</h4>
                        <p>Buddhism is a philosophy founded by Siddhartha Gautama around 500 B.C.E. After achieving enlightenment, he became known as Buddha or "enlightened one." Buddha's teachings encourage Buddhists to lead a moral life by accepting the four Noble Truths and following the "middle way." See Figure 18.8 for a statue of the enlightenment of Buddha.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Agencies often provide a standardized spiritual assessment tool. If not, the FICA or HOPE models can be used to guide open-ended questions about a patient's beliefs and practices.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>FICA:</strong> F-Faith/beliefs, I-Importance/influence, C-Community, A-Address</li>
                            <li><strong>HOPE:</strong> H-Sources of hope, O-Organized religion, P-Personal spirituality/practices, E-Effects on medical care</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nurses should also observe for cues of spiritual distress, such as questioning the meaning of life or suffering.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>Common NANDA-I diagnoses related to spiritual health include <em>Readiness for Enhanced Spiritual Well-Being, Impaired Religiosity</em>, and <em>Spiritual Distress</em>.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>Goals and SMART outcomes are customized for each patient. For a patient with <em>Spiritual Distress</em>, a sample goal is, "The patient will demonstrate improved spiritual health," and a SMART outcome could be, "The patient will express a purpose in life by discharge."</p>

                        <h3>Planning and Implementing Interventions</h3>
                        <p>When providing spiritual care, the RN must not impose their personal beliefs on the patient. Key interventions include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Taking cues from the patient and letting them lead the conversation.</li>
                            <li>Asking how you can support them spiritually.</li>
                            <li>Supporting patients within their own faith tradition.</li>
                            <li>Listening without interjecting personal stories.</li>
                            <li>Praying with a patient if requested and comfortable, or finding someone who will.</li>
                            <li>Sharing an encouraging thought or word.</li>
                            <li>Using therapeutic presence and touch.</li>
