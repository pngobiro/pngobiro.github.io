                        <p>The human body maintains a delicate balance of fluids and electrolytes to help ensure proper functioning and homeostasis. When fluids or electrolytes become imbalanced, individuals are at risk for organ system dysfunction. If an imbalance goes undetected and is left untreated, organ systems cannot function properly and ultimately death will occur. Nurses must be able to recognize subtle changes in fluid or electrolyte balances in their patients so they can intervene promptly. Timely assessment and intervention prevent complications and save lives.</p>

                        <p>Before learning about how to care for patients with fluid and electrolyte imbalances, it is important to understand the physiological processes of the body's regulatory mechanisms. The body is in a constant state of change as fluids and electrolytes are shifted in and out of cells within the body in an attempt to maintain a nearly perfect balance. A slight change in either direction can have significant consequences on various body systems.</p>
                        <h3>Body Fluids</h3>
                        <p>Body fluids consist of water, electrolytes, blood plasma and component cells, proteins, and other soluble particles called solutes. Body fluids are found in two main areas of the body called intracellular and extracellular compartments. See Figure 15.1 for an illustration of intracellular and extracellular compartments.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0952-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating fluid compartments in the human body, showing that intracellular fluid makes up a larger percentage of total body water than extracellular fluid (interstitial fluid and plasma)." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 15.1 Intracellular and Extracellular Compartments</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Intracellular fluids (ICF)</strong> are found inside cells and are made up of protein, water, electrolytes, and solutes. The most abundant electrolyte in intracellular fluid is potassium. Intracellular fluids are crucial to the body's functioning. In fact, intracellular fluid accounts for 60% of the volume of body fluids and 40% of a person's total body weight!</p>
                        <p><strong>Extracellular fluids (ECF)</strong> are fluids found outside of cells. The most abundant electrolyte in extracellular fluid is sodium. The body regulates sodium levels to control the movement of water into and out of the extracellular space due to osmosis.</p>
                        <p>Extracellular fluids can be further broken down into various types. The first type is known as <strong>intravascular fluid</strong> that is found in the vascular system that consists of arteries, veins, and capillary networks. Intravascular fluid is whole blood volume and also includes red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, and platelets. Intravascular fluid is the most important component of the body's overall fluid balance.</p>
                        <p>Loss of intravascular fluids causes the nursing diagnosis Deficient Fluid Volume, also referred to as <strong>hypovolemia</strong>. Intravascular fluid loss can be caused by several factors, such as excessive diuretic use, severe bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, and inadequate oral fluid intake. If intravascular fluid loss is severe, the body cannot maintain adequate blood pressure and perfusion of vital organs. This can result in hypovolemic shock and cellular death when critical organs do not receive an oxygen-rich blood supply needed to perform cellular function.</p>
                        <p>A second type of extracellular fluid is <strong>interstitial fluid</strong> that refers to fluid outside of blood vessels and between the cells. For example, if you have ever cared for a patient with heart failure and noticed increased swelling in the feet and ankles, you have seen an example of excess interstitial fluid referred to as edema.</p>
                        <p>The remaining extracellular fluid, also called <strong>transcellular fluid</strong>, refers to fluid in areas such as cerebrospinal, synovial, intrapleural, and gastrointestinal system.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Fluid Movement</h3>
                        <p>Fluid movement occurs inside the body due to osmotic pressure, hydrostatic pressure, and osmosis. Proper fluid movement depends on intact and properly functioning vascular tissue lining, normal levels of protein content within the blood, and adequate hydrostatic pressures inside the blood vessels. Intact vascular tissue lining prevents fluid from leaking out of the blood vessels. Protein content of the blood (in the form of albumin) causes <strong>oncotic pressure</strong> that holds water inside the vascular compartment. For example, patients with decreased protein levels (i.e., low serum albumin) experience edema due to the leakage of intravascular fluid into interstitial areas because of decreased oncotic pressure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hydrostatic pressure</strong> is defined as pressure that a contained fluid exerts on what is confining it. In the intravascular fluid compartment, hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted by blood against the capillaries. Hydrostatic pressure opposes oncotic pressure at the arterial end of capillaries, where it pushes fluid and solutes out into the interstitial compartment. On the venous end of the capillary, hydrostatic pressure is reduced, which allows oncotic pressure to pull fluids and solutes back into the capillary. See Figure 15.2 for an illustration of hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure in a capillary.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0955-1.jpg" alt="A diagram of capillary microcirculation, showing the forces of hydrostatic pressure pushing fluid out at the arterial end and oncotic pressure pulling fluid in at the venous end." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 15.2 Capillary Microcirculation</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Filtration</strong> occurs when hydrostatic pressure pushes fluids and solutes through a permeable membrane so they can be excreted. An example of this process is fluid and waste filtration through the glomerular capillaries in the kidneys. This filtration process within the kidneys allows excess fluid and waste products to be excreted from the body in the form of urine.</p>
                        <p>Fluid movement is also controlled through <strong>osmosis</strong>. Osmosis is water movement through a semipermeable membrane, from an area of lesser solute concentration to an area of greater solute concentration, in an attempt to equalize the solute concentrations on either side of the membrane. Only fluids and some particles dissolved in the fluid are able to pass through a semipermeable membrane; larger particles are blocked from getting through. Because osmosis causes fluid to travel due to a concentration gradient and no energy is expended during the process, it is referred to as <strong>passive transport</strong>. See Figure 15.3 for an illustration of osmosis where water has moved to the right side of the membrane to equalize the concentration of solutes on that side with the left side.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0956-1.jpg" alt="A diagram illustrating osmosis. A semipermeable membrane separates two solutions of different solute concentrations. Water moves from the lower concentration side to the higher concentration side, equalizing the concentrations." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Figure 15.3 Osmosis</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Osmosis causes fluid movement between the intravascular, interstitial, and intracellular fluid compartments based on solute concentration. For example, recall a time when you have eaten a large amount of salty foods. The sodium concentration of the blood becomes elevated. Due to the elevated solute concentration within the bloodstream, osmosis causes fluid to be pulled into the intravascular compartment from the interstitial and intracellular compartments to try to equalize the solute concentration. As fluid leaves the cells, they shrink in size. The shrinkage of cells is what causes many symptoms of dehydration, such as dry, sticky mucous membranes. Because the brain cells are especially susceptible to fluid movement due to osmosis, a headache may occur if adequate fluid intake does not occur.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Solute Movement</h3>
                        <p>Solute movement is controlled by diffusion, active transport, and filtration. <strong>Diffusion</strong> is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration to equalize the concentration of solutes throughout an area. (Note that diffusion is different from osmosis because osmosis is the movement of fluid whereas diffusion is the movement of solutes.) See Figure 15.4 for an image of diffusion. Because diffusion travels down a concentration gradient, the solutes move freely without energy expenditure. An example of diffusion is the movement of inhaled oxygen molecules from alveoli to the capillaries in the lungs so that they can be distributed throughout the body.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0957-1.png" alt="A diagram showing simple diffusion, where solute molecules move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration across a membrane." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Active transport</strong>, unlike diffusion, involves moving solutes and ions across a cell membrane from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. Because active transport moves solutes against a concentration gradient to prevent an overaccumulation of solutes in an area, energy is required for this process to take place. An example of active transport is the sodium-potassium pump, which uses energy to maintain higher levels of sodium in the extracellular fluid and higher levels of potassium in the intracellular fluid. See Figure 15.5 for an image of diffusion and the sodium-potassium pump regulating sodium and potassium levels in the extracellular and intracellular compartments. Recall that sodium (Na+) is the primary electrolyte in the extracellular space and potassium (K+) is the primary electrolyte in the intracellular space.</p>

                        <h3>Fluid and Electrolyte Regulation</h3>
                        <p>The body must carefully regulate intravascular fluid accumulation and excretion to prevent fluid volume excesses or deficits and maintain adequate blood pressure. Water balance is regulated by several mechanisms including ADH, thirst, and the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS).</p>
                        <p>Fluid intake is regulated by thirst. As fluid is lost and the sodium level increases in the intravascular space, <strong>serum osmolality</strong> increases. Serum osmolality is a measure of the concentration of dissolved solutes in the blood. Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus sense increased serum osmolarity levels and trigger the release of ADH (antidiuretic hormone) in the kidneys to retain fluid. The osmoreceptors also produce the feeling of thirst to stimulate increased fluid intake. However, individuals must be able to mentally and physically respond to thirst signals to increase their oral intake. They must be alert, fluids must be accessible, and the person must be strong enough to reach for fluids. When a person is unable to respond to thirst signals, dehydration occurs. Older individuals are at increased risk of dehydration due to age-related impairment in thirst perception. The average adult intake of fluids is about 2,500 mL per day from both food and drink. An increased amount of fluids is needed if the patient has other medical conditions causing excessive fluid loss, such as sweating, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)</strong> plays an important role in regulating fluid output and blood pressure. See Figure 15.6 for an illustration of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). When there is decreased blood pressure (which can be caused by fluid loss), specialized kidney cells make and secrete renin into the bloodstream. Renin acts on angiotensinogen released by the liver and converts it to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II does a few important things. First, angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction to increase blood flow to vital organs. It also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone.</p>
                        <p>Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that triggers increased sodium reabsorption by the kidneys and subsequent increased serum osmolality in the bloodstream. As you recall, increased serum osmolality causes osmosis to move fluid into the intravascular compartment in an effort to equalize solute particles. The increased fluids in the intravascular compartment increase circulating blood volume and help raise the person's blood pressure. An easy way to remember this physiological process is "aldosterone saves salt" and "water follows salt."</p>

                        <p>Fluid output occurs mostly through the kidneys in the form of urine. Fluid is also lost through the skin as perspiration, through the gastrointestinal tract in the form of stool, and through the lungs during respiration. Forty percent of daily fluid output occurs due to these "insensible losses" through the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs and cannot be measured. The remaining 60% of daily fluid output is in the form of urine. Normally, the kidneys produce about 1,500 mL of urine per day when fluid intake is adequate. Decreased urine production is an early sign of dehydration or kidney dysfunction. It is important for nurses to assess urine output in patients at risk. If a patient demonstrates less than 30 mL/hour (or 0.5 mL/kg/hour) of urine output over eight hours, the provider should be notified for prompt intervention. See Figure 15.7 for an illustration of an average adult's daily water balance of 2,500 mL fluid intake balanced with 2,500 mL fluid output.</p>

                        <h3>Fluid Imbalance</h3>
                        <p>Two types of fluid imbalances are excessive fluid volume (also referred to as hypervolemia) and deficient fluid volume (also referred to as hypovolemia). These imbalances primarily refer to imbalances in the extracellular compartment, but can cause fluid movement in the intracellular compartments based on the sodium level of the blood.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Excessive Fluid Volume</h4>
                        <p><strong>Excessive fluid volume</strong> (also referred to as <strong>hypervolemia</strong>) occurs when there is increased fluid retained in the intravascular compartment. Patients at risk for developing excessive fluid volume are those with the following conditions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Heart Failure</li>
                            <li>Kidney Failure</li>
                            <li>Cirrhosis</li>
                            <li>Pregnancy</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Symptoms of fluid overload include pitting edema, ascites, and dyspnea and crackles from fluid in the lungs. Edema is swelling in dependent tissues due to fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces. Ascites is fluid retained in the abdomen.</p>
                        <p>Treatment depends on the cause of the fluid retention. Sodium and fluids are typically restricted and diuretics are often prescribed to eliminate the excess fluid.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Deficient Fluid Volume</h4>
                        <p><strong>Deficient fluid volume</strong> (also referred to as <strong>hypovolemia</strong> or dehydration) occurs when loss of fluid is greater than fluid input. Common causes of deficient fluid volume are diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating, fever, and poor oral fluid intake. Individuals who have a higher risk of dehydration include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Older adults</li>
                            <li>Infants and children</li>
                            <li>Patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and kidney disease</li>
                            <li>Patients taking diuretics and other medications that cause increased urine output</li>
                            <li>Individuals who exercise or work outdoors in hot weather</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In adults, symptoms of dehydration are as follows:</p>

                        <p>When patients experience deficient fluid volume, intravenous (IV) fluids are often prescribed. IV fluid restores fluid to the intravascular compartment, and some IV fluids are also used to facilitate the movement of fluid between compartments due to osmosis. There are three types of IV fluids: isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Isotonic Solutions</h4>
                        <p><strong>Isotonic solutions</strong> are IV fluids that have a similar concentration of dissolved particles as blood. An example of an isotonic IV solution is 0.9% Normal Saline (0.9% NaCl). Because the concentration of the IV fluid is similar to the blood, the fluid stays in the intravascular space and osmosis does not cause fluid movement between compartments. See Figure 15.8 for an illustration of isotonic IV solution administration with no osmotic movement of fluid with cells. Isotonic solutions are used for patients with fluid volume deficit (also called hypovolemia) to raise their blood pressure. However, infusion of too much isotonic fluid can cause excessive fluid volume (also referred to as hypervolemia).</p>

                        <h4>Hypotonic Solutions</h4>
                        <p><strong>Hypotonic solutions</strong> have a lower concentration of dissolved solutes than blood. An example of a hypotonic IV solution is 0.45% Normal Saline (0.45% NaCl). When hypotonic IV solutions are infused, it results in a decreased concentration of dissolved solutes in the blood as compared to the intracellular space. This imbalance causes osmotic movement of water from the intravascular compartment into the intracellular space. For this reason, hypotonic fluids are used to treat cellular dehydration. See Figure 15.9 for an illustration of the osmotic movement of fluid into a cell when a hypotonic IV solution is administered, causing lower concentration of solutes (pink molecules) in the bloodstream compared to within the cell.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0968-1.jpg" alt="A diagram showing a red blood cell in a hypotonic solution. Water flows into the cell, causing it to swell, because the solute concentration is higher inside the cell." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>However, if too much fluid moves out of the intravascular compartment into cells, cerebral edema can occur. It is also possible to cause worsening hypovolemia and hypotension if too much fluid moves out of the intravascular space and into the cells. Therefore, patient status should be monitored carefully when hypotonic solutions are infused.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Hypertonic Solutions</h4>
                        <p><strong>Hypertonic solutions</strong> have a higher concentration of dissolved particles than blood. An example of hypertonic IV solution is 3% Normal Saline (3% NaCl). When infused, hypertonic fluids cause an increased concentration of dissolved solutes in the intravascular space compared to the cells. This causes the osmotic movement of water out of the cells and into the intravascular space to dilute the solutes in the blood. See Figure 15.10 for an illustration of osmotic movement of fluid out of a cell when hypertonic IV fluid is administered due to a higher concentration of solutes (pink molecules) in the bloodstream compared to the cell.</p>

                        <p>When administering hypertonic fluids, it is essential to monitor for signs of hypervolemia such as breathing difficulties and elevated blood pressure. Additionally, if hypertonic solutions with sodium are given, the patient's serum sodium level should be closely monitored.</p>

                        <p>Electrolytes play an important role in bodily functions and fluid regulation. There is a very narrow target range for normal electrolyte values, and slight abnormalities can have devastating consequences. For this reason, it is crucial to understand normal electrolyte ranges, causes of electrolyte imbalances, signs and symptoms of imbalances, and appropriate treatments.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sodium</h3>
                        <p>Sodium levels in the blood typically range from 136-145 mEq/L. Sodium is the most abundant electrolyte in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump. Sodium plays an important role in maintaining adequate fluid balance in the intravascular and interstitial spaces.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hypernatremia</strong> refers to an elevated sodium level in the blood. Typically, hypernatremia is caused by excess water loss due to lack of fluid intake, vomiting, or diarrhea. Symptoms of hypernatremia include confusion, irritability, lethargy, seizures, severe thirst, and sticky mucous membranes. Treatment for hypernatremia includes decreasing sodium intake, increasing oral water intake, and rehydrating with a hypotonic IV solution.</p>

                        <p><strong>Hyponatremia</strong> refers to a decreased sodium level in the blood. Hyponatremia can be caused by excess water intake or excessive administration of hypotonic IV solutions. Symptoms of hyponatremia are headache, confusion, seizures, and coma. Treatment for hyponatremia depends on the cause and often consists of limiting water intake or discontinuing administration of hypotonic IV fluids. If hyponatremia is severe, a hypertonic IV saline solution may be prescribed to gradually raise the patient's sodium level.</p>

                        <h3>Potassium</h3>
                        <p>Potassium levels normally range from 3.5 to 5.1 mEq/L. Potassium is the most abundant electrolyte in intracellular fluid and is maintained inside the cell by the sodium-potassium pump. Potassium is regulated by aldosterone in the kidneys and is obtained in the diet through consumption of foods such as bananas, oranges, and tomatoes. See Figure 15.13 for an illustration of potassium regulation by aldosterone.</p>

                        <p>Potassium is necessary for normal cardiac function, neural function, and muscle contractility. Abnormal potassium levels can cause significantly abnormal heart rhythms and contractility. Potassium is poorly conserved by the body and much is lost with urine output.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hyperkalemia</strong> refers to increased potassium levels in the blood. Hyperkalemia can be caused by kidney failure, metabolic acidosis, and administration of potassium-sparing diuretics or oral/intravenous potassium supplements. Signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia are generally cardiac in nature and include irritability, cramping, diarrhea, and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities. As hyperkalemia worsens, ECG abnormalities may progress to cardiac dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hypokalemia</strong> refers to decreased potassium level in the blood. Hypokalemia can be caused by excessive vomiting, diarrhea, potassium-wasting diuretics, and insulin use, as well as lack of potassium in the diet. Signs and symptoms of hypokalemia include weakness, arrhythmias, lethargy, and a thready pulse.</p>

                        <h3>Calcium</h3>
                        <p>Calcium levels normally range from 8.6-10.2 mg/dL. Calcium circulates in the bloodstream, but the majority is stored in bones. Calcium is important for bone and teeth structure, nerve transmission, and muscle contraction. Calcium excretion and reabsorption are regulated by the parathyroid hormone (PTH) that is secreted from the parathyroid glands near the thyroid. See Figure 15.14 for an illustration of the parathyroid glands.</p>

                        <p><strong>Hypercalcemia</strong> refers to an increased calcium level. It can be caused by prolonged immobilization, some cancers, and hyperparathyroidism. Signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia often impact the gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal systems, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, and muscle weakness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hypocalcemia</strong> refers to a decreased calcium level in the blood. It can be caused by hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and renal disease. Signs and symptoms include paresthesias, muscle cramps, tetany, Chvostek's sign, and Trousseau's sign.</p>

                        <h3>Phosphorus</h3>
                        <p>Phosphorus levels typically range from 2.5-4.0 mg/dL. Phosphorus is stored in the bones and is important in energy metabolism, RNA and DNA formation, nerve function, and muscle contraction. <strong>Hyperphosphatemia</strong> can be caused by kidney disease, crush injuries, or overuse of phosphate-containing enemas and is usually asymptomatic. <strong>Hypophosphatemia</strong> can be caused by acute alcohol abuse, burns, diuretic use, and starvation and is also usually asymptomatic.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Magnesium</h3>
                        <p>Magnesium levels typically range from 1.5-2.4 mEq/L. Magnesium is essential for normal cardiac, nerve, muscle, and immune system functioning. <strong>Hypermagnesemia</strong> is usually the result of renal failure or excess magnesium replacement. Signs and symptoms include bradycardia, weak pulse, lethargy, tremors, and hyporeflexia. <strong>Hypomagnesemia</strong> typically results from inadequate magnesium in the diet, diuretic use, or from alcohol use disorder. Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, lethargy, weakness, leg cramps, tremor, and tetany.</p>

                        <p>As with electrolytes, correct balance of acids and bases in the body is essential to proper body functioning. Even a slight variance outside of normal can be life-threatening, so it is important to understand normal acid-base values, as well their causes and how to correct them. The kidneys and lungs work together to correct slight imbalances as they occur. As a result, the kidneys compensate for shortcomings of the lungs, and the lungs compensate for shortcomings of the kidneys.</p>

                        <h3>Respiratory Acidosis</h3>
                        <p>Respiratory acidosis develops when carbon dioxide (CO2) builds up in the body (referred to as hypercapnia), causing the blood to become increasingly acidic. Respiratory acidosis is identified when reviewing ABGs and the pH level is below 7.35 and the PaCO2 level is above 45. It is typically caused by a medical condition that decreases the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide at the alveolar level, such as an acute asthma exacerbation, COPD, or an acute heart failure exacerbation causing pulmonary edema. It can also be caused by decreased ventilation from anesthesia, alcohol, or administration of medications such as opioids and sedatives.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Respiratory Alkalosis</h3>
                        <p>Respiratory alkalosis develops when the body removes too much carbon dioxide through respiration, resulting in increased pH and an alkalotic state. When reviewing ABGs, respiratory alkalosis is identified when pH levels are above 7.45 and the PaCO2 level is below 35. Respiratory alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation that can occur due to anxiety, panic attacks, pain, fear, head injuries, or mechanical ventilation. Treatment of respiratory alkalosis involves treating the underlying cause of the hyperventilation, such as patient reassurance and breathing retraining.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Metabolic Acidosis</h3>
                        <p>Metabolic acidosis occurs when there is an accumulation of acids (hydrogen ions) and not enough bases (HCO3) in the body. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a pH level below 7.35 and an HCO3 level below 22 when reviewing ABGs. A common cause of metabolic acidosis is diabetic ketoacidosis, where acids called ketones build up in the blood when blood sugar is extremely elevated. Another common cause of metabolic acidosis in hospitalized patients is lactic acidosis, which can be caused by impaired tissue oxygenation. Nurses may first suspect that a patient has metabolic acidosis due to rapid breathing that occurs as the lungs try to remove excess CO2 in an attempt to resolve the acidosis.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Metabolic Alkalosis</h3>
                        <p>Metabolic alkalosis occurs when there is too much bicarbonate (HCO3) in the body or an excessive loss of acid (H+ ions). Metabolic alkalosis is defined by a pH above 7.45 and an HCO3 level above 26 on ABG results. Metabolic alkalosis can be caused by gastrointestinal loss of hydrogen ions, such as prolonged vomiting or nasogastric suctioning. Nurses may first suspect that a patient has metabolic alkalosis due to a decreased respiratory rate as the lungs try to retain additional CO2.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The nursing process is used continuously when caring for individuals who have fluid, electrolyte, or acid-base imbalances, or at risk for developing them, because their condition can change rapidly. This systematic approach to nursing care ensures that subtle cues or changes are not overlooked and that appropriate outcomes and interventions are implemented according to the patient's current condition.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>A thorough assessment provides valuable information about a patient's current fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance, as well as risk factors for developing imbalances. Focused assessments such as trends in weight, 24-hour intake and output, vital signs, pulses, lung sounds, skin, and mental status are used to determine fluid balance, electrolyte, and acid-base status. See Figure 15.15 for an image of edema.</p>

                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>An overall goal for a patient with <em>Excess Fluid Volume</em> is, "Patient will achieve fluid balance." An example of a SMART outcome is, "The patient will maintain clear lung sounds with no evidence of dyspnea over the next 24 hours."</p>
                        
                        <h3>Planning Interventions and Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Evidence-based interventions should be planned according to the patient's history and specific fluid, electrolyte, or acid-base imbalance present. The effectiveness of interventions must be continuously evaluated, and the plan of care modified as needed.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Hernandez is a 54-year-old patient admitted to the medical telemetry floor with a diagnosis of heart failure exacerbation. He tells the nurse, "My breathing has gotten worse the past last three days and I have a lot of swelling in my feet."</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Vital signs at the start of shift were blood pressure 154/94, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 24, and oxygen saturation 88%. On assessment, the nurse finds fine crackles in bilateral posterior lower lung bases, an S3 heart sound, and 2+ pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities midway to the knee. The nurse reviews the patient's chart and discovers Mr. Hernandez has gained 10 pounds since his previous office visit last week.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Excess Fluid Volume related to compromised regulatory mechanism as evidenced by fine crackles in bilateral posterior lung bases, S3 heart sound, weight gain of 10 pounds in the past week, and the patient states, "My breathing has gotten worse the past last three days and I have a lot of swelling in my feet."</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will demonstrate stabilization in fluid volume.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcomes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mr. Hernandez's vital signs and weight will return to his baseline in the next 48 hours.</li>
                            <li>Mr. Hernandez will verbalize three rules of dietary and fluid restriction to follow at home following his educational session.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse will weigh the patient daily and analyze weight trends and 24-hour intake and output. The nurse will closely monitor lung sounds, respiratory rate, and oxygenation status. The nurse will establish a 24-hour schedule for fluid intake and educate the patient regarding fluid restriction. The nurse will closely monitor lab results, especially sodium and potassium, and monitor for symptoms of fluid shifts. The nurse will provide patient education regarding fluid and sodium restrictions.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>By the end of the shift, the second SMART outcome was "met" when Mr. Hernandez was able to report back three rules of dietary and fluid restrictions after the patient education session. The first SMART outcome was not yet met but will be reevaluated every shift for the next 24 hours.</p>
