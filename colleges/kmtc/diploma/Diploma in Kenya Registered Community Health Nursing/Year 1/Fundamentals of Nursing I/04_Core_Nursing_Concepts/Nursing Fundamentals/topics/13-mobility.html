This basic mobility task can be impaired during recovery from major surgery or for patients with chronic musculoskeletal conditions. Mobility, which includes moving one's extremities, changing positions, sitting, standing, and walking, helps avoid degradation of many body systems and prevents complications associated with immobility. Nurses assist patients to be as mobile as possible, based on their individual circumstances, to achieve their highest level of independence, prevent complications, and promote a feeling of well-being. This chapter will discuss nursing assessments and interventions related to promoting mobility.</p>

                        <h3>Musculoskeletal Anatomy, Physiology, and Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Before discussing the concept of mobility, it is important to understand the anatomy of the musculoskeletal system, common musculoskeletal conditions, and the components of a musculoskeletal system assessment. Read more about these topics in the "Musculoskeletal Assessment" chapter in Open RN Nursing Skills.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Mobility and Immobility</h3>
                        <p><strong>Mobility</strong> is the ability of a patient to change and control their body position. Physical mobility requires sufficient muscle strength and energy, along with adequate skeletal stability, joint function, and neuromuscular synchronization. Anything that disrupts this integrated process can lead to impaired mobility or immobility. Mobility exists on a continuum ranging from no impairment (i.e., the patient can make major and frequent changes in position without assistance) to being completely immobile (i.e., the patient is unable to make even slight changes in body or extremity position without assistance). See Figure 13.1 for an image of a patient with impaired physical mobility requiring assistance with a wheelchair.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0813-1.jpg" alt="An elderly patient in a wheelchair being assisted by a caregiver, illustrating impaired physical mobility." class="content-image">

                        <p><strong>Functional mobility</strong> is the ability of a person to move around in their environment, including walking, standing up from a chair, sitting down from standing, and moving around in bed. The three main areas of functional mobility are the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bed Mobility:</strong> The ability of a patient to move around in bed, including moving from lying to sitting and sitting to lying.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transferring:</strong> The action of a patient moving from one surface to another. This includes moving from a bed into a chair or moving from one chair to another.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ambulation:</strong> The ability to walk. This includes assistance from another person or an assistive device, such as a cane, walker, or crutches.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Immobility can be caused by several physical and psychological factors, including acute and chronic diseases, traumatic injuries, and chronic pain.</p>
                        <p>Several neurological and musculoskeletal disorders can adversely affect mobility, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Traumatic injuries, such as skeletal fractures, head injuries, or spinal injuries, also impair mobility. Diseases that cause fatigue, such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and depression, or conditions that cause pain also affect the patient's desire to move.</p>

                        <h3>Effects of Immobility</h3>
                        <p>Patients who spend an extended period of time in bed as they recover from surgery, injury, or illness can develop a variety of complications due to loss of muscle strength (estimated at a rate of 20% per week of immobility). Regardless of the cause, immobility can cause degradation of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal functioning. Promoting mobility can prevent these complications from occurring. Findings from a literature review demonstrated several benefits of mobilization, including less delirium, pain, urinary discomfort, urinary tract infection, fatigue, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pneumonia, as well as an improved ability to void. Mobilization also decreased depression, anxiety, and symptom distress, while enhancing comfort, satisfaction, quality of life, and independence. See Table 13.2a for a summary of the effects of immobility on these body systems. Decreased mobility is also a major risk factor for skin breakdown, as indicated on the Braden Scale. See Figure 13.2 for an image of a patient with impaired mobility who developed a DVT.</p>

                        <p>Strategies to promote patient mobility can be divided into two categories: those used when the patient is in bed and those used when the patient is able to get out of bed. In-bed interventions to enhance mobility include performing repositioning activities, completing range of motion exercises, and assisting the patient to dangle on the edge of a bed. Out-of-bed interventions to enhance mobility include transferring the patient from bed to chair and assisting with ambulation. Unfortunately, ambulation of patients has been identified as the most frequently missed element of inpatient nursing care with rates as high as 76-88% of the time. Before discussing these interventions to promote mobility, let's review the assessments that a nurse must perform prior to safely implementing mobilization interventions.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Assessing Mobility Status and the Need for Assistance</h3>
                        <p>A patient's mobility status and their need for assistance affect nursing care decisions, such as handling and transferring procedures, ambulation, and implementation of fall precautions. Initial mobility assessments are typically performed on admission to a facility by a physical therapist (PT). See Table 13.2b for an example of common types of assistance required.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the amount of assistance required, physical therapists may determine a patient's weight-bearing status. For example, patients with lower extremity fractures or those recovering from knee or hip replacement often progress through stages of weight-bearing activity. See Table 13.2c for common weight-bearing prescriptions.</p>

                        <p>In addition to reviewing orders regarding weight-bearing and assistance required, all staff should assess patient mobility before and during interventions, such as transferring from surface to surface or during ambulation. Staff may frequently rely on the patient's or a family member's report on the patient's ability to stand, transfer, and ambulate, but this information can be unreliable. For example, the patient may have unrecognized physical deconditioning from the disease or injury that necessitated hospitalization, or they may have developed new cognitive impairments related to the admitting diagnosis or their current medications.</p>
                        <p>Several objective screening tests, such as the Timed Get Up and Go Test, have traditionally been used by nurses to assess a patient's mobility status. The Timed Get Up and Go Test begins by having the patient stand up from an armchair, walk three yards, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. As the patient performs these maneuvers, their posture, body alignment, balance, and gait are analyzed. However, this test and other tests do not provide guidance on what the nurse should do if the patient can't maintain seated balance, bear weight, or stand and walk. The Banner Mobility Assessment Tool (BMAT) was developed to provide guidance regarding safe patient handling and mobility (SPHM). It is used as a nurse-driven bedside assessment of patient mobility and walks the patient through a four-step functional task list and identifies the mobility level the patient can achieve. It then provides guidance regarding the SPHM technology needed to safely lift, transfer, and mobilize the patient.</p>

He needed to have a bowel movement but didn't want to use a bedpan. The nurse wasn't comfortable getting him up to use the bathroom because he hadn't yet been evaluated by physical therapy, and a physical therapist wasn't available until the following morning. Per agency policy, the nurse used the BMAT and determined the patient was currently at Mobility Level 3. He was transferred to the toilet using a nonpowered stand aid. Both the patient and nurse were relieved and satisfied with the outcome.</p>

                        <h3>Safe Patient Handling</h3>
                        <p>Assisting patients with decreased immobility poses an increased risk of injury to health care workers. A focus on safe patient handling and mobility (SPHM) in acute and long-term care over the past decade has resulted in decreased staff lifting injuries for the first time in 30 years. Nonetheless, nurses still suffer more musculoskeletal disorders from lifting than other employees in the manufacturing and construction industries. Many employers and nurses previously believed that lifting injuries could be prevented by using proper body mechanics, but evidence contradicts this assumption. <strong>Body mechanics</strong> involves the coordinated effort of muscles, bones, and one's nervous system to maintain balance, posture, and alignment when moving, transferring, and positioning patients. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) calculates maximum loads for lifting, pushing, pulling, and carrying for all types of employees. For example, a maximum load for employees lifting a box with handles is 50 pounds (23 kg), but this weight is decreased when the lifter has to reach, lift from near the floor, or assume a twisted or awkward position. Because patients don't come in simple shapes and may sit or lie in awkward positions, move unexpectedly, or have wounds or devices that interfere with lifting, the safe lifting load for patients is less than this maximum 50 pound load. Although using proper body mechanics and good lifting techniques are important, they don't prevent lifting injuries in these patient circumstances. Factors that increase risk for lifting injuries in nurses are exertion, frequency, posture, and duration of exposure. Combinations of these factors, such as high exertion while in an awkward posture (for example, holding a patient's leg while bent over and twisted), unpredictable patient movements, and extended reaching, intensify the risk.</p>
                        <p>In 2013 the American Nurses Association (ANA) published Safe Patient Handling and Mobility (SPHM) standards.</p>

                        <h3>Assistive Devices</h3>
                        <p>There are several types of assistive devices that a nurse may incorporate during safe patient handling and mobility. An <strong>assistive device</strong> is an object or piece of equipment designed to help a patient with activities of daily living, such as a walker, cane, gait belt, or mechanical lift. Assistive devices include other items described below.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Gait Belts</h4>
                        <p><strong>Gait belts</strong> should be used to ensure stability when assisting patients to stand, ambulate, or transfer from bed to chair. A gait belt is a 2-inch-wide (5 mm) belt, with or without handles, that is placed around a patient's waist and fastened with a buckle. The gait belt should be applied on top of clothing or a gown to protect the patient's skin. See Figure 13.3 for an image of a gait belt.</p>

                        <h4>Slider Boards</h4>
                        <p>A <strong>slider board</strong> (also called a transfer board) is used to transfer an immobile patient from one surface to another while the patient is lying supine (e.g., from a stretcher to hospital bed). See Figure 13.4 for an image of a patient being transferred by logrolling off a slider board with several assistants.</p>

                        <h4>Sit to Stand Lifts</h4>
                        <p><strong>Sit to Stand Lifts</strong> (also referred to as Sara Lifts, Lift Ups, Stand Assist, or Stand Up Lifts) are mobility devices that assist weight-bearing patients who are unable to transition from a sitting position to a standing position using their own strength. They are used to safely transfer patients who have some muscular strength but not enough strength to safely change positions by themselves. Some sit to stand lifts use a mechanized lift whereas others are nonmechanized. See Figure 13.5 for an image of a nurse assisting a patient to stand with a sit to stand lift.</p>

                        <h4>Mechanical Lifts</h4>
                        <p>A <strong>mechanical lift</strong> is a hydraulic lift with a sling used to move patients who cannot bear weight or have a medical condition that does not allow them to stand or assist with moving. It can be a portable device or permanently attached to the ceiling. See Figure 13.6 for an image of a mechanical lift.</p>

                        <h3>Early Mobility Protocols</h3>
                        <p>Many hospitals use nurse-driven mobility protocols to encourage early mobility of patients in intensive care units and after surgery. The purpose of early mobility protocols is to maintain the patient's baseline mobility and functional capacity, decrease the incidence of delirium, and decrease hospital length of stay. Protocols include a coordinated approach by the multidisciplinary team and may include respiratory therapists, physical therapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, and the health care provider who focus on getting the patient out of bed faster.</p>
                        <p>When early mobility protocols are in place, nurses use a screening tool to determine whether a patient is clinically ready to attempt the protocol. This algorithm begins by reviewing the patient's neurological criteria, such as, does the patient open his or her eyes in response to verbal stimulation? If the patient meets neurological criteria, they are assessed against additional criteria for respiratory, circulatory, neurological, and other considerations. If the patient clears these criteria, a registered nurse may carefully initiate an early mobilization protocol in collaboration with a physical therapist. See Figure 13.7 for an example of an early mobilization protocol used for patients in an ICU.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0831-1.jpg" alt="A flowchart for an early mobilization protocol in an ICU, with steps for assessing neurological, respiratory, and circulatory readiness before proceeding with mobility activities." class="content-image">

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Example of Early Mobilization Protocol</h4>
                            <p>Here is an example of using an early mobilization protocol in an intermediate care unit with patient care technicians (PCT). Three PCTs collaborate with nurses from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Each PCT has eight patients and is responsible for mobilizing patients during each 12-hour shift. Each patient care technician discusses each patient's level of activity with the RN at the beginning of the shift and determines how many times each patient will be mobilized throughout the day. Any concerns that arise during mobilization are shared with the nurse for appropriate follow-up.</p>

                        <h3>Range of Motion Exercises</h3>
                        <p>When patients are unable to ambulate or have injury to specific extremities, <strong>range of motion (ROM)</strong> exercises are often prescribed. ROM exercises facilitate movement of specific joints and promote mobility of the extremities. Because changes in joints can occur after three days of immobility, ROM exercises should be started as soon as possible. There are three types of ROM exercises: passive, active, and active assist. <strong>Passive range of motion</strong> is movement applied to a joint solely by another person or by a passive motion machine. When passive range of motion is applied, the joint of an individual receiving exercise is completely relaxed while the outside force moves the body part while they are lying in bed. For example, patients who undergo knee replacement surgery may be prescribed a passive motion machine that continuously flexes and extends the patient's knee while lying in bed. See Figure 13.8 for an image of a passive motion machine. <strong>Active range of motion</strong> is movement of a joint by the individual performing the exercise with no outside force aiding in the movement. <strong>Active assist range of motion</strong> is joint movement with partial assistance from an outside force. For example, during the recovery period after shoulder surgery, a patient attends physical therapy and receives 50% assistance in moving the arm with the help of a physical therapy assistant.</p>

                        <p>Patients may receive temporary ROM exercises due to injury, surgery, or other temporary conditions. These patients are expected to make a full recovery and over time will no longer need ROM to ensure the proper functioning of their joint. Other patients require long-term ROM exercises to prevent <strong>contractures</strong> that can occur in conditions such as spinal cord injury, stroke, neuromuscular diseases, or traumatic brain injury. A contracture is the lack of full passive range of motion due to joint, muscle, or soft tissue limitations. See Figure 13.9 for an image of a severe leg contracture in a patient with a terminal neurological condition.</p>
                        <figure>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Range of motion exercises are prescribed by a physical therapist and can be performed by physical therapy assistants, nursing assistants, patient technicians, and nurses based on agency policy. Guidelines for performing range of motion exercises include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A program of passive stretching should be started as early as possible in the course of neuromuscular disease to prevent contractures and become part of a regular morning and evening routine.</li>
                            <li>Proper technique is essential for passive stretching to be effective. With each stretch, the position should be held for a count of 15, and each exercise should be repeated 10 to 15 times during a session (or as prescribed). Stretching should be performed slowly and gently. An overly strenuous stretch may cause discomfort and reduce cooperation.</li>
                            <li>Written instructional materials should be provided to the patient and family as a supplement to verbal instructions and demonstrations by the physical therapist.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Limb positioning with assistive devices can also be used to prevent contracture formation. The limb should be placed in a resting position that opposes or minimizes flexion. Positioning aids include pillows, foot boots, handrolls, hand-wrist splints, heel or elbow protectors, abduction pillows, or a trapeze bar. See Figure 13.10 for an image of a brace used to prevent <strong>foot drop</strong> in a patient with multiple sclerosis. Foot drop is a complication of immobility that results in plantar flexion of the foot, interfering with the ability to complete weight bearing activities.</p>

                        <h3>Repositioning Patients</h3>
                        <p>Repositioning a bedridden patient maintains body alignment and prevents pressure injuries, foot drop, and contractures. Proper positioning also provides comfort for patients who have decreased mobility related to a medical condition or treatment. When repositioning a patient in bed, supportive devices such as pillows, rolls, and blankets can aid in providing comfort and safety. There are several potential positions that are determined based on the patient's medical condition, preferences, or treatment related to an illness. It is important to reposition patients appropriately to prevent neurological injury that can occur if a patient is inadvertently placed on their arm.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Supine Position</h4>
                        <p>In <strong>supine positioning</strong>, the patient lies flat on their back. Pillows or other devices may be used to prevent foot drop. Additional supportive devices, such as pillows under the arms, may be added for comfort. See Figure 13.11 for an image of a patient in the supine position.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0839-1.jpg" alt="A patient lying in the supine position in bed." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                        <h4>Prone Position</h4>
                        <p>In <strong>prone positioning</strong>, the patient lies on their stomach with their head turned to the side. Pillows may be placed under the lower legs to align the feet. See Figure 13.12 for an image of a patient in the prone position. Placing patients in the prone position may improve their oxygenation status in certain types of medical disorders, such as COVID-19.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0840-1.jpg" alt="A patient lying in the prone position in bed." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                        <h4>Lateral Position</h4>
                        <p>In <strong>lateral positioning</strong>, the patient lies on one side of their body with the top leg flexed over the bottom leg. This position helps relieve pressure on the coccyx. A pillow may be placed under the top arm for comfort. See Figure 13.13 for an image of a patient in the lateral position. The lateral position is often used for pregnant women to prevent inferior vena cava compression and enhance blood flow to the fetus.</p>

                        <h4>Sims Position</h4>
                        <p>In <strong>Sims positioning</strong>, the patient is positioned halfway between the supine and prone positions with their legs flexed. A pillow is placed under the top leg. Their arms should be comfortably placed beside them, not underneath. See Figure 13.14 for an image of a patient in Sims position. The Sims position is used during some procedures, such as the administration of an enema.</p>

                        <h4>Fowler's Position</h4>
                        <p>In <strong>Fowler's positioning</strong>, the head of bed is placed at a 45-to 90-degree angle. The bed can be positioned to slightly flex the hips to help prevent the patient from migrating downwards in bed. See Figure 13.15 for an image of a patient in Fowler's position. High Fowler's position refers to the bed being at a 90-degree angle. The Fowler's position is used to promote lung expansion and improve a patient's oxygenation. It is also used to prevent aspiration in patients while eating or receiving tube feeding.</p>

                        <p>In <strong>Semi-Fowler's positioning</strong>, the head of bed is placed at a 30- to 45-degree angle. The patient's hips may or may not be flexed. See Figure 13.16 for an image of a patient in Semi-Fowler's position. Semi-Fowler's position is used for the same purposes as Fowler's position but is generally better tolerated over long periods of time.</p>

                        <p>In <strong>Trendelenburg positioning</strong>, the head of the bed is placed lower than the patient's feet. This position may be used in certain situations to promote venous return to the head and heart, such as during severe hypotension and medical emergencies. See Figure 13.17 for an image of Trendelenburg position.</p>

                        <p>Patients who are feeling short of breath often naturally assume the <strong>tripod position</strong>. In the tripod position, the patient leans forward while sitting with their elbows on their knees or resting on a table. Patients experiencing breathing difficulties can be placed in this position to enhance lung expansion and air exchange. See Figure 13.18 for images of an individual demonstrating breathing difficulty who has assumed the tripod position.</p>

                        <h3>Moving a Patient Up in Bed</h3>
                        <p>When moving a patient up in bed, first determine the level of assistance needed to provide optimal patient care. It is vital to prevent friction and shear when moving a patient up in bed to prevent pressure injuries. If a patient is unable to assist with repositioning in bed, follow agency policy regarding using lifting devices and mechanical lifts. If the patient is able to assist with repositioning and minimal lifting by staff is required, use the following guidelines with assistance from another health care professional to help with the move and prevent injury. See Figure 13.19 for an image of moving a patient up in bed.</p>

                        <h3>Assisting Patients to Seated Position</h3>
                        <p>Prior to ambulating, repositioning, or transferring a patient from one surface to another (e.g., a bed to a wheelchair), it often necessary to move the patient to the side of the bed to avoid straining or excessive reaching by the health care professional. Positioning the patient to the side of the bed also allows the health care provider to have the patient as close as possible to their center of gravity for optimal balance during patient handling.</p>
                        <p>Patients who have been lying in bed may experience <strong>vertigo</strong>, a sensation of dizziness as if the room is spinning, or <strong>orthostatic hypotension</strong>, low blood pressure that occurs when a patient changes position from lying to sitting or sitting to standing and causes the patient to feel dizzy, faint, or light-headed. Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or more or a drop of diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more within 3 minutes of sitting or standing. For this reason, always begin a transfer or ambulation process by sitting the patient on the side of the bed for a few minutes with their legs dangling.</p>

                        <h3>Ambulating a Patient</h3>
                        <p><strong>Ambulation</strong> is the ability of a patient to safely walk independently, with assistance from another person, or with an assistive device, such as a cane, walker, or crutches. After a patient has been assessed and determined safe to ambulate, determine if assistive devices or the assistance of a second staff member is required. Assist the patient to sit on the side of the bed and assess for symptoms of vertigo or orthostatic hypotension before proceeding. Ensure the patient is wearing proper footwear, such as shoes or nonslip socks. Apply a gait belt snugly over their clothing and around their waist if any type of assistance is required. See Figure 13.21 for an image of applying a gait belt.</p>

                        <h3>Transfer From Bed to Chair or Wheelchair</h3>
                        <p>Patients often require assistance when moving from a bed to a chair or wheelchair. A patient must be cooperative and predictable, able to bear weight on both legs, and able to take small steps and pivot to safely transfer with a one-person assist. If any of these criteria are not met, a two-person transfer or mechanical lift is recommended. Always complete a mobility assessment and check the provider's or physical therapist's orders prior to transferring patients.</p>

                        <h3>Lowering A Patient to the Floor</h3>
                        <p>A patient may begin to fall while ambulating or while being transferred from one surface to another. If a patient begins to fall from a standing position, do not attempt to stop the fall or catch the patient because this can cause back injury. Instead, try to control their fall by lowering them to the floor.</p>

                        <h3>Preventing Falls</h3>
                        <p>Falls are a major safety concern in health care. Nurses are responsible for identifying, managing, and eliminating potential fall hazards for patients. All patient-handling activities (positioning, transfers, and ambulation) pose a risk to both patients and health care professionals. Older adults are often at increased risk for falls due to impaired mental status, decreased strength, impaired balance and mobility, and decreased sensory perception. Patients may also be at risk for falls due to gait problems, cognitive ability, visual problems, urinary frequency, generalized weakness, cognitive impairments, or medications that may cause hypotension or drowsiness.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>Because mobility issues are directly related to musculoskeletal disorders, perform a thorough assessment of the musculoskeletal system and its effect on the patient's mobility status. Assess muscle strength and coordination, and then assess mobility skills in the following order: mobility in bed, dangling on the bed with supported and unsupported sitting, weight-bearing while transferring from sitting to standing or to a chair, standing and walking with assistance, and walking independently.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Life Span Considerations</h3>
                        <p>At each stage of growth and development, the nurse assesses a patient's mobility and provides appropriate education. For example, infants move their limbs, hold their head up, roll, sit, crawl, stand, and then eventually walk. Parents are educated about these developmental milestones during well-child visits. When working with school-age children, nurses provide education to prevent injury that can occur with activity, such as using helmets and knee pads to prevent injury while bicycling and skateboarding. As teenagers become adults, the nurse provides education about the effects of alcohol and other drugs on balance and safety while driving. Older adults are at increased risk for immobility. Conditions such as osteoarthritis, orthostatic hypotension, inner ear dysfunction, osteoporosis resulting in hip fractures, stroke, and Parkinson's disease are among the most common causes of immobility in old age.</p>
                        <p>Hospitalization poses a risk for altered functional status of older adults due to acute illness, decreased mobility, and the negative effects of bedrest. The American Academy of Nursing issued a recommendation in 2014 stating, "Don't let older adults lie in bed or only get up to a chair during their hospital stay." This recommendation highlights the importance of implementing evidence-based measures to promote activity during hospitalization to prevent functional decline in older adults.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>There are several nursing diagnoses related to mobility. A commonly used NANDA-I nursing diagnosis is <em>Impaired Physical Mobility</em>. See Table 13.3 for the definition and selected defining characteristics of this diagnosis.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>A sample nursing diagnosis in PES format is, "<em>Impaired Physical Mobility related to decrease in muscle strength as evidenced by slow movement and alteration in gait.</em>"</p>
                        
                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>A sample overall goal for a patient with Impaired Physical Mobility is, "The patient will participate in activities of daily living to the fullest extent possible for their condition."</p>
                        <p>A sample SMART outcome is, "The patient will demonstrate appropriate use of adaptive equipment (e.g., a walker) for safe ambulation by the end of the shift."</p>
                        
                        <h3>Planning Interventions</h3>
                        <p>Nursing interventions promote a patient's mobility and prevent effects of immobility. To avoid or minimize complications of immobility, mobilize the patient as soon as possible and to the fullest extent possible. Mobilization efforts, ranging from dangling on the edge of the bed, sitting up in a chair, and assisting with early ambulation, depend on the patient's unique circumstances, such as their medical condition and surgery performed. For example, a patient undergoing a cardiac catheterization may be mobilized within a few hours following the procedure, whereas a patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty may begin mobilizing 24 hours following the surgery.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Implementing Interventions</h3>
                        <p>When implementing interventions to promote mobility, in addition to reviewing the current orders regarding assistance and weight-bearing, assess the patient's current status. For example, use the Banner Mobility Assessment Tool to determine the patient's current mobility status and needs for safe patient handling.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>Determine the patient's progress towards their specific SMART outcomes. Encourage their participation in the setting of realistic goals for mobility and modify these goals as needed for safety.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mrs. Howard is a 73-year-old woman who was recently admitted to the medical surgical floor with pneumonia. She has an underlying history of emphysema and has experienced a recent exacerbation in dyspnea during activity. This morning when being assisted to the bathroom, she reports, "I have to stop and catch my breath when walking." Vital signs this morning indicated oxygen saturation 91% and respiratory rate 18 on room air at rest. During report it was communicated that Mrs. Howard is able to ambulate with the assistance of one but only moves short distances around the room before she needs to stop and rest.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse identifies a relevant cue that the patient, diagnosed with pneumonia and a previous history of emphysema, is experiencing increased dyspnea when walking around the room that requires her to stop and rest. Vital signs at 0700 were reviewed, and it was noted that the patient's respiratory rate was 24 with oxygen saturation level 91% on room air at rest. The nurse gathers additional assessment data while the patient is walking and discovers her respiratory rate increases to 30 and her oxygen saturation level decreases to 85% after walking for 2 minutes. Additionally, the patient stops and catches her breath after walking approximately 10 feet, causing her to limit her mobility.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Impaired Physical Mobility r/t activity intolerance as manifested by decreased oxygen saturation, increased respirations, and patient report of "I have to stop and catch my breath while walking."</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will demonstrate improvement in mobility.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcomes:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mrs. Howard will ambulate 50 feet in the hallway within 24 hours.</li>
                            <li>Mrs. Howard will maintain an oxygen saturation level of 90% or higher while walking within 24 hours.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions:</h4>
                        <p>The nurse plans to administer oxygen to the patient via nasal cannula as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation level of 90% or higher. The nurse will teach the patient about the importance of balancing periods of activity with periods of rest and reinforce the use of pursed-lip breathing. The nurse will encourage patient ambulation and her active participation in completing ADLs. The nurse will collaborate with physical therapy to educate the patient regarding strengthening exercises and reinforce principles of progressive exercise. The nurse plans to further assess the patient's smoking history and promote smoking cessation.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Documentation</h4>
                        <p>At 0800 when assisting the patient to the bathroom, the patient reported, "I have to stop and catch my breath when walking." Vital signs at 0700 were respiratory rate 24 and oxygen saturation level 91% on room air at rest. At 0830, vital signs were reassessed while the patient was walking. Her respiratory rate increased to 30 and her oxygen saturation level decreased to 85% after 2 minutes of walking. The patient stopped to catch her breath after walking approximately 10 feet. Oxygen via nasal cannula at 1 L/min was applied to the patient before ambulating in the hallway at 1000. The patient's oxygen saturation level dropped to 88% after one minute of walking and the oxygen was increased to 2 L/min. The patient's oxygen saturation then remained at 90% for the remainder of the walk, and she was able to ambulate 50 feet. Pursed-lip breathing was demonstrated and reinforced during the walk. Physical therapy was contacted and an assessment scheduled for later this morning. The patient reports a smoking history of a pack per day for 50 years. She is interested in stopping smoking. A smoking cessation brochure was provided and discussed. Dr. Smith was notified of these events at 1030.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                        <p>Within 24 hours, Mrs. Howard successfully ambulated 50 feet in the hallway while maintaining oxygen saturation level of 90%. SMART outcomes were "met." Planned interventions will continue. SMART outcome is revised to, "Mrs. Howard will ambulate 100 feet in the hallway within 24 hours."</p>
