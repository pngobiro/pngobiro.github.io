                        <p>Our five basic senses of sight (vision), hearing (auditory), touch (tactile), smell (olfactory), and taste (gustatory) help us perceive and act in the world around us. See Figure 7.1 for an illustration of our five senses.</p>

                        <p>We may not often consider the importance of our sensory input. As nurses, we especially rely on our senses when providing patient care as we gather assessment data. We ask questions and listen to patient responses, we listen to their heart and lung sounds, we evaluate the appearance of their skin, we may smell an infectious process when changing a wound dressing, and we feel the sensation of pulses when assessing circulation.</p>
                        <p>When an individual experiences sensory impairment because of the loss of one or more senses or is affected by the amount of stimuli (too much or too little), their ability to safely function is impacted. Nurses identify patients' sensory impairments and implement interventions to improve their safety, functioning, and quality of life. The nurse's goal is to provide support and dignity to individuals and their families by using strategies and resources that will help them to engage with their surroundings and others to the best of their ability.</p>

                        <h3>Interpreting Sensations</h3>
                        <p>Before learning about sensory function, it is important to understand how the nervous system works. An intact nervous system is necessary for information to be delivered from the environment to the brain to trigger responses from the body. For neurons to transmit these messages, they are in the form of an action potential. Sensory receptors perceive a stimulus and then change the sensation to an electrical signal so that it can be transmitted to the brain and then out to the body. For example, a pain receptor perceives pain as your hand touches a hot tray. The signal is transmitted to the brain where it is interpreted, and then signals are quickly sent to the hand to pull away from the hot stimuli.</p>
                        <p>Our bodies interpret sensations through a process using reception, perception, and reaction. <strong>Reception</strong> is the first part of the sensory process when a nerve cell or sensory receptor is stimulated by a sensation. Sensory receptors are activated by mechanical, chemical, or temperature stimuli. In addition to our five senses, we also have <strong>somatosensation</strong>. Somatosensation refers to sensory receptors that respond to stimuli such as pain, pressure, temperature, and vibration. It also includes <strong>vestibular sensation</strong>, a sense of spatial orientation and balance, and <strong>proprioception</strong>, the sense of the position of our bones, joints, and muscles. Although these sensory systems are all very different, they share a common purpose. They change a stimulus into an electrical signal that is transmitted in the nervous system.</p>
                        <p>The sensory receptors for each of our senses work differently from one another. Light receptors, sound receptors, and touch receptors are each activated by different stimuli with specialized receptor specificity. For example, touch receptors are sensitive to pressure but do not have sensitivity to sound or light. Nerve impulses from sensory receptors travel along pathways to the spinal cord or directly to the brain. Some stimuli are also combined in the brain, such as our sense of smell that can affect our sense of taste.</p>
                        <p>As an individual becomes aware of a stimulus and it is transmitted to the brain, <strong>perception</strong> occurs. Perception is the interpretation of a sensation. All sensory signals, except olfactory system input, are transmitted to the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex of the brain. The thalamus, which is in the forebrain, acts as a relay station for sensory and motor signals. When a sensory signal leaves the thalamus, it is sent to the specific area of the cortex that processes that sense. However, conditions that affect a person's consciousness also affect the ability to perceive and interpret stimuli.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reaction</strong> is the response that individuals have to a perception of a received stimulus. The brain determines what sensations are significant because it is impossible to react to all stimuli that are constantly received from our environment. A healthy brain maintains a balance between sensory stimuli received and those reaching awareness. However, <strong>sensory overload</strong> can occur if the amount of stimuli the brain is receiving is overwhelming to an individual. <strong>Sensory deprivation</strong> can also occur if there are insufficient sensations from the environment.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Sensory Impairment</h3>
                        <p>Alterations in sensory function include sensory impairment, sensory overload, and sensory deprivation. <strong>Sensory impairment</strong> includes any type of difficulty that an individual has with one of their five senses. When an individual experiences loss of a sensory function, such as vision, the way they interact with the environment is affected. For example, when an individual gradually loses their vision, their reliance on other senses to receive information from the environment is often enhanced.</p>
                        <p>Safety is always a nursing consideration for a patient with a sensory impairment. Intact senses are required to make decisions about functioning safely within the environment. For example, an individual who has impaired hearing may not be able to hear a smoke alarm and requires visual indicators when the alarm is triggered.</p>
                        <p>Sensory impairments are very common in older adults. Most older adults develop impaired near vision called presbyopia. See Figure 7.2 for an image of simulated presbyopia.</p>
                        <p>Deficits in taste and smell are also prevalent in this age group. Additionally, kinesthetic impairment (an altered sense of touch) can occur in adults as young as 55. Kinesthetic impairment can cause difficulty in daily functioning, such as buttoning one's shirt or performing other fine motor tasks. These sensory losses can greatly impact how older adults live and function.</p>

                        <h4>Hearing Loss and Ear Problems</h4>
                        <p>Approximately one third of individuals aged 70 and older have hearing loss. Good hearing depends on a series of events that change sound waves in the air into electrical signals. The auditory nerve conducts these electrical signals from the ear to the brain through a series of steps. The structures of the ear, such as the tympanic membrane and cochlea, must be intact and functioning appropriately for conduction of sound to occur. Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) gradually occurs in most individuals as they age. Typically, low-pitched sounds are easiest to hear, but it often becomes increasingly difficult to hear normal conversation, especially over loud background noise. Hearing aids are commonly used to enhance hearing. See Figure 7.3 for an image of common hearing aids used to treat hearing loss.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0443-1.jpg" alt="A collection of various types of hearing aids, including behind-the-ear and in-the-ear models." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Hearing loss can be caused by other factors in addition to aging. A build-up of ear wax in the ear canal can cause temporary hearing loss. Sounds that are too loud or long-term exposure to loud noises can cause noise-induced hearing loss. For example, a loud explosion or employment using loud machinery without ear protection can damage the sensory hair cells in the ear. After these hair cells are damaged, the ability to hear is permanently diminished. <strong>Tinnitus</strong>, a medical term for ringing in the ears, can also occur. Some medications, such as high doses of aspirin or loop diuretics, can cause toxic effects to the sensory cells in the ear and lead to hearing loss or tinnitus. In addition to hearing loss, ear problems can also cause problems with balance, dizziness, and vertigo due to vestibular dysfunction.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Kinesthetic Impairments</h4>
                        <p>Kinesthetic impairments, such as peripheral neuropathy, affect the ability to feel sensations. Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy include sensations of pain, burning, tingling, and numbness in the extremities that decrease a person's ability to feel touch, pressure, and vibration. Position sense can also be affected and makes it difficult to coordinate complex movements, such as walking, fastening buttons, or maintaining balance when one's eyes are closed. Peripheral neuropathy is caused by nerve damage that commonly occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus or peripheral vascular disease. It can also be caused by physical injuries, infections, autoimmune diseases, vitamin deficiencies, kidney diseases, liver diseases, and some medications.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Life Span Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Impaired sensory functioning increases the risk for social isolation in older adults. For example, when individuals are not able to hear well, they may pretend to hear in an attempt to avoid embarrassment when asking for the information to be repeated. They may begin to avoid noisy environments or stop participating socially in conversations around them.</p>
                        <p>Infants and children are also at risk for vision and hearing impairments related to genetic or prenatal conditions. Early determination of sensory impairments is crucial so that problems can be addressed with accommodations to minimize the impact on a child's development. For example, a screening hearing test is completed on all newborns before discharge to evaluate for hearing impairments that can affect their speech development.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sensory Overload and Sensory Deprivation</h4>
                        <p>Stimuli are continually received from a variety of sources in our environment and from within our bodies. When an individual receives too many stimuli or cannot selectively filter out meaningful stimuli, <strong>sensory overload</strong> can occur. Symptoms of sensory overload include irritability, restlessness, covering ears or eyes to shield them from sensory input, and increased sensitivity to tactile input (i.e., scratchy fabric or sensations of medical equipment). Sensory overload affects an individual's ability to interpret stimuli from their environment and can lead to confusion and agitation. See Figure 7.4 of an image of a patient reacting to sensory overload.</p>
                        <p>The health care environment with its frequent noisy alarms, treatments, staff interruptions, and noisy hallway conversations can cause sensory overload for patients. Individuals have different tolerances for the amount of stimuli that will affect them adversely. Tolerance to stimuli is impacted by factors such as pain, stress levels, sleep patterns, physical health, and emotional health. When sensory overload occurs in a hospitalized patient, it can lead to delirium and acute confusion. It is important for the nurse to limit unnecessary awakenings and interactions with the health care team members when a patient is experiencing sensory overload.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Conversely, symptoms of <strong>sensory deprivation</strong> may occur when there are a lack of stimuli. People experiencing sensory deprivation often report perceptual disturbances such as hallucinations. Symptoms of sensory deprivation can mimic delirium, so it is important for a nurse to further investigate new perceptual disturbances.</p>

                        <p>This section outlines the steps of the nursing process when providing care for individuals with altered sensory function in any setting.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <p>When assessing a patient for sensory impairments, it is important to first establish a therapeutic relationship. Individuals may be hesitant to discuss sensory problems. By establishing a good rapport, patients are more likely to share their sensory concerns and effects on functioning. The health history should include questions regarding current status of sensory function, as well as risk for development of sensory impairment. For example, medications that can be ototoxic should be considered a risk factor for hearing impairment. Additionally, opioids and sedatives depress the central nervous system and can impair stimuli perception and reaction. Techniques to identify deficits in vision, hearing, smell, taste, and sensation are used during the physical exam.</p>
                        <p>Read additional information about assessment techniques using the following hyperlinks.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read about common disorders of the eyes and ears in the "Eye and Ear Assessment" chapter of the Open RN Nursing Skills textbook.</li>
                            <li>Read more about assessing sensory functioning in the "Neurological Assessment" chapter of the Open RN Nursing Skills textbook.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are several factors to consider when assessing a patient's sensory functioning, such as age, their perception of the impairment, and the impact of the sensory impairment on their daily functioning. Age is an important consideration because many sensory functions can be affected by the aging process. However, it should not be assumed that all sensory problems are a normal part of the aging process. It is important to assess the patient's perception of sensory impairment and its impact on their functioning, as well for any changes in recent behavior, mental status, emotional status, or cognitive function changes. For example, individuals experiencing hearing loss may be more irritable or anxious and avoid social gatherings due to their hearing impairment. If a patient is experiencing confusion, it is important to evaluate underlying factors that can cause confusion.</p>
                        <p>The environment is also an important consideration when assessing an individual's sensory functioning. It is important to understand the patient's daily activities and their ability to perform them; their work and living environment; their use of protective equipment, such as ear protection when working with loud equipment; and their adherence with routine screenings, such as vision and hearing exams. Individuals with sensory impairments are at increased risk for falls and injury, so it is important to encourage basic safety features in the environment, including adequate lighting, availability of handrails and grab bars, hazard-free walkways, and appropriate settings on water heater controls.</p>
                        <p>When sensory impairments are identified, they should be documented in the patient's chart and communicated to collaborative team members working with the individual. For example, when an individual has a hearing impairment, it is important to consider their alternative communication needs. They may use lipreading and require face-to-face views when communicating. The use of assistive devices for sensory functioning, such as glasses and hearing aids, should also be documented and communicated. It is important to ensure proper functioning of the devices for optimal patient outcomes. In fact, a hospitalized older adult is at greater risk for developing delirium when their typical glasses and hearing aids (i.e., their "eyes and ears") are not available, causing sensory deprivation.</p>
                        <p>See Table 7.3a for a comparison of expected versus unexpected findings on assessment, including those that require notification of the health care provider.</p>

                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>Commonly used NANDA-I nursing diagnoses for patients experiencing alterations in sensory function include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Risk for Injury</li>
                            <li>Risk for Falls</li>
                            <li>Impaired Verbal Communication</li>
                            <li>Social Isolation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A common NANDA diagnosis related to sensory alterations is <em>Risk for Injury</em>, which is defined as, "Susceptible to physical damage due to environmental conditions interacting with the individual's adaptive and defensive resources, which may compromise health." "Alteration in sensation" is an associated condition for this nursing diagnosis. For risk diagnoses, there are no related factors (etiological factors) because you are identifying a vulnerability in a patient for a potential problem that is not yet present. Additionally, the nurse cannot resolve sensory alteration, so it should not be listed as a related factor to which interventions are directed. Instead, the phrase "as evidenced by" is used to refer to the evidence of risk that exists.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, a sample NANDA-I diagnosis in current PES format would be as follows: "<em>Risk for Injury as evidenced by alteration in vision.</em>"</p>
                        
                        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                        <p>An overall goal for a patient at risk for injury related to alteration in sensation is as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient will remain free from injury.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An example of a "SMART" expected outcome for a patient with impaired vision is as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient will be able to verbalize the layout of the room within four hours of admission.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Planning Interventions</h3>
                        <p>There are many nursing interventions that can be implemented for individuals with impaired sensory function. To assist patients to communicate effectively and to promote their quality of life, it is important for the nurse to customize appropriate interventions based on their individual needs. As always, refer to an evidence-based nursing care planning resource when customizing interventions for specific patients. See Table 7.3b for basic nursing interventions to implement for a variety of sensory alterations.</p>

                        <h3>Patient Scenario</h3>
                        <p>Mr. Mitchell, age 87, is accompanied to the primary care clinic with his daughter Elise. Elise tells the nurse that her father has been increasingly withdrawn and she has difficulty getting in contact with him during the week by phone. She is concerned that he is experiencing depression. Mr. Mitchell is alert, well-groomed, and smiling. As the nurse begins the initial assessment interview, it is noted that Mitchell smiles and nods a lot, but does not answer direct questions appropriately. Elise has shared that she has not noted problems with her father's ability to care for himself; he is paying his own bills and orders groceries online for delivery.</p>
                        <p>When questioned further about his answers, Mr. Mitchell admits that he is unsure what was asked of him. He is embarrassed about this and avoids asking people to repeat themselves. He also explains that his father had a hearing device, and it always "rang loudly" so he has not considered this option.</p>
                        <p>The nurse performs a whisper test and discovers he is unable to report any of the six words whispered behind him. She notes that Mr. Mitchell is interested in improving his ability to hear and participate in conversations with others.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> The nurse performs a whisper test and discovers he is unable to report any of the six words whispered behind him. He is interested in improving his ability to hear and participate in conversations with others.</p>
                        <p>Based on the interview and assessment information, the following nursing care plan is created for Mr. Mitchell.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Readiness for Enhanced Communication as evidenced by expressed desire to enhance hearing and communication.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will experience enhanced communication with improved hearing.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Mr. Mitchell will attend an appointment arranged with an audiologist within two weeks.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Planning and Implementing Nursing Interventions</h4>
                        <p>The nurse provides education about available hearing devices and encourages the patient to attend an appointment with an audiologist. While speaking to the patient, she faces him directly and provides good lighting so that he can read her lips. She shuts the door to the exam room to provide a quiet environment and uses short, simple sentences. She does not interpret nodding to indicate understanding. She shares her assessment findings with the provider and requests a referral to an audiologist and then assists the patient in making the appointment. She asks the patient and his daughter if they have any questions before they leave the clinic.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Sample Documentation</h4>
                        <p>During the intake interview, the patient did not answer questions inappropriately or did not answer at all. Exhibited embarrassment when asking people to repeat their statements. Daughter states, "He is becoming increasingly withdrawn." Ear canals are clear without cerumen present. Unable to report six out of six words during the whisper test. Provided brief explanation of new technology available for hearing loss while standing directly in front of the patient, and he appeared to be able to slightly read lips. Encouraged consultation with an audiologist and notified the provider of assessment findings. Appointment made with the audiologist and communicated place, date, and time to the patient and his daughter.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                        <p>During the next clinic appointment in two weeks, Mr. Mitchell is wearing a hearing aid device and answers questions appropriately. He reports that he has been attending more social events "now that I can hear better." The SMART outcome was "met."</p>
