                        <p>The integumentary system includes skin, hair, and nails. The skin is the largest organ of the body and has many purposes. Our skin keeps us warm and contains nerve endings that control the ability to feel the sensations of hot, cold, pain, and pressure. Our skin also keeps harmful things out of the body, such as dirt, bacteria, and viruses, and keeps helpful things in like moisture. Maintaining intact skin is important to prevent infection and maintain health. This chapter will review the anatomy and physiology of the integumentary system, factors that affect healthy skin and healing, and interventions that nurses perform to repair and protect this vital organ.</p>

                        <h3>Skin</h3>
                        <p>Skin is made up of three layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. See Figure 10.1 for an illustration of skin layers. The <strong>epidermis</strong> is the thin, topmost layer of the skin. It contains sweat gland duct openings and the visible part of hair known as the hair shaft. Underneath the epidermis lies the <strong>dermis</strong> where many essential components of skin function are located. The dermis contains hair follicles (the roots of hair shafts), sebaceous oil glands, blood vessels, endocrine sweat glands, and nerve endings. The bottommost layer of skin is the <strong>hypodermis</strong> (also referred to as the subcutaneous layer). It mostly consists of adipose tissue (fat), along with some blood vessels and nerve endings. Beneath the hypodermis layer lies bone, muscle, ligaments, and tendons.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>There are several common skin disorders that a nurse may find when assessing a patient's skin.</p>

                        <h3>Hair</h3>
                        <p>Hair is a filament that grows from a hair follicle in the dermis of the skin. See Figure 10.2 for an illustration of a hair follicle. It consists mainly of tightly packed, keratin-filled cells called keratinocytes. The human body is covered with hair follicles except for the mucous membranes, lips, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. The part of the hair that is located within the follicle is called the hair root, the only living part of the hair. The part of the hair that is visible above the surface of the skin is the hair shaft. The shaft of the hair has no biochemical activity and is considered dead.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0613-1.jpg" alt="A cross-section diagram of a hair follicle, showing the hair shaft, root, bulb, and associated structures like the sebaceous gland and arrector pili muscle." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">
                            <figcaption>Figure 10.2 Hair Follicle</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Functions of Hair</h4>
                        <p>The functions of head hair are to provide insulation to retain heat and to protect the skin from damage by UV light. The function of hair in other locations on the body is debated. One idea is that body hair helps to keep us warm in cold weather. When the body is cold, the arrector pili muscles contract, causing hairs to stand up and trapping a layer of warm air above the epidermis. However, this action is more effective in mammals that have thick hair than it is in relatively hairless human beings.</p>
                        <p>Human hair has an important sensory function as well. Sensory receptors in the hair follicles can sense when the hair moves, whether it is because of a breeze or the touch of a physical object. Some hairs, such as the eyelashes, are especially sensitive to the presence of potentially harmful matter. The eyebrows protect the eyes from dirt, sweat, and rain. In addition, the eyebrows play a key role in nonverbal communication by expressing emotions such as sadness, anger, surprise, and excitement.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Nails</h3>
                        <p>Nails are accessory organs of the skin. They are made of sheets of dead keratinocytes and are found on the distal ends of the fingers and toes. The keratin in nails makes them hard but flexible. Nails serve a number of purposes, including protecting the fingers, enhancing sensations, and acting like tools. A nail has three main parts: root, plate, and free margin. Other structures around or under the nail include the nail bed, cuticle, and nail fold. See Figure 10.3 for an illustration of the structure of a nail. The top diagram in this figure shows the external, visible part of the nail and the cuticle. The bottom diagram shows internal structures in a cross-section of the nail and nail bed.</p>
                        <figure>

                        <h3>Impaired Skin and Tissue Integrity</h3>
                        <p>Skin integrity is a medical term that refers to skin health. <strong>Impaired skin integrity</strong> is a NANDA-I nursing diagnosis defined as, "Altered epidermis/or dermis." However, when deeper layers of the skin or integumentary structures are damaged, it is referred to as <strong>impaired tissue integrity</strong>. The NANDA-I definition of impaired tissue integrity is, "Damage to the mucous membrane, cornea, integumentary system, muscular fascia, muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage, joint capsule, and/or ligament."</p>
                        
                        <h3>Risk Factors Affecting Skin Health and Wound Healing</h3>
                        <p>There are several risk factors that place a patient at increased risk for altered skin health and delayed wound healing. Risk factors include impaired circulation and oxygenation, impaired immune function, diabetes, inadequate nutrition, obesity, exposure to moisture, smoking, and age. Each of these risk factors is discussed in more detail in the following subsections.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Impaired Circulation and Oxygenation</h4>
                        <p>Skin, like every other organ in the body, depends on good blood perfusion to keep it healthy and functioning correctly. Cardiovascular circulation delivers important oxygen, nutrients, infection-fighting cells, and clotting factors to tissues. These elements are needed by skin, tissues, and nerves to properly grow, function, and repair damage. Without good cardiovascular circulation, skin becomes damaged. Damage can occur from poor blood perfusion from the arteries, as well as from poor return of blood through the veins to the heart. Common medical conditions that decrease cardiovascular circulation include cardiac disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). PVD includes two medical conditions called arterial insufficiency and venous insufficiency.</p>
                        
                        <h5>ARTERIAL INSUFFICIENCY</h5>
                        <p><strong>Arterial insufficiency</strong> refers to a lack of adequately oxygenated blood movement in arteries to specific tissues. Arterial insufficiency can be a sudden, acute lack of oxygenated blood, such as when a blood clot in an artery blocks blood flow to a specific area. Arterial insufficiency can also be a chronic condition caused by peripheral vascular disease (PVD). As a person's arteries become blocked with plaque due to atherosclerosis, there is decreased blood flow to the tissues. Signs of arterial insufficiency are cool skin temperature, pale skin color, pain that increases with exercise, and possible arterial ulcers.</p>
                        <p>When oxygenated blood flow to tissues becomes inadequate, the tissue dies. This is called <strong>necrosis</strong>. Tissue death causes the skin and tissue to become <strong>necrotic</strong> (black). Necrotic tissue does not heal, so surgical debridement or amputation of the extremity becomes necessary for healing. See Figure 10.4 for images of an arterial insufficiency ulcer and necrotic toes.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0618-1.jpg" alt="A composite image showing an arterial insufficiency ulcer on an ankle on the left, and necrotic, blackened second toe on the right." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h5>VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY</h5>
                        <p><strong>Venous insufficiency</strong> occurs when the cardiovascular system cannot adequately return blood and fluid from the extremities to the heart. Venous insufficiency can cause stasis dermatitis when blood pools in the lower legs and leaks out into the skin and other tissues. Signs of venous insufficiency are edema, a brownish-leathery appearance to skin in the lower extremities, and venous ulcers that weep fluid. See Figure 10.5 for an image of stasis dermatitis.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0619-1.jpg" alt="Stasis dermatitis on a lower leg, showing brownish discoloration, scaling, and inflammation due to venous insufficiency." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Impaired Immune Function</h4>
                        <p>Skin contributes to the body's immune function and is also affected by the immune system. Intact skin provides an excellent first line of defense against foreign objects entering the body. This is why it is essential to keep skin intact. If skin does break down, the next line of defense is a strong immune system that attacks harmful invading organisms. However, if the immune system is not working well, the body is much more susceptible to infections. This is why maintaining intact skin, especially in the presence of an impaired immune system, is imperative to decrease the risk of infections.</p>
                        <p>Stress can cause an impaired immune response that results in delayed wound healing. Being hospitalized or undergoing surgery triggers the stress response in many patients. Medications, such as corticosteroids, also affect a patient's immune function and can impair wound healing. When assessing a chronic wound that is not healing as expected, it is important to consider the potential effects of stress and medications.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Diabetes</h4>
                        <p>Diabetes can cause wounds to develop, as well as cause delayed wound healing. Nurses provide vital patient education to patients with diabetes to help them effectively manage the disease and prevent complications.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Inadequate Nutrition</h4>
                        <p>A healthy diet is essential for maintaining healthy skin, as well as maintaining an appropriate weight. Nutrients that are particularly important for skin health include protein; vitamins A, C, D, and E; and minerals such as selenium, copper, and zinc.</p>
                        <p>Nutritional deficiencies can have a profound impact on wound healing and must be addressed for chronic wounds to heal. Protein is one of the most important nutritional factors affecting wound healing. For example, in patients with pressure injuries, 30 to 35 kcal/kg of calorie intake with 1.25 to 1.5 g/kg of protein and micronutrients supplementation are recommended daily. In addition, vitamin C and zinc have many roles in wound healing. It is important to collaborate with a dietician to identify and manage nutritional deficiencies when a patient is experiencing poor wound healing.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Obesity</h4>
                        <p>In the same way a balanced diet is vital for healthy skin, a healthy weight is also imperative. Obese individuals are at increased risk for fungal and yeast infections in skin folds caused by increased moisture and friction. See Figure 10.6 for an image of a fungal infection in the groin. Symptoms of yeast and fungal infection include redness and scaliness of the skin associated with itching.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0622-1.jpg" alt="A fungal infection (tinea cruris) in the groin area, showing a red, scaly rash." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>Obese patients also are at higher risk for wound complications due to a decreased supply of oxygenated blood flow to adipose tissue. Potential complications include infection, <strong>dehiscence</strong> (separation of the edges of a surgical wound), hematoma formation, pressure injuries, and venous ulcers. <strong>Evisceration</strong> is a rare but severe complication when an abdominal surgical incision separates and the abdominal organs protrude or come out of the incision. Nurses can educate patients about making healthy lifestyle choices to reduce obesity and the risk of dehiscence. See Figure 10.7 for an image of a dehiscence in an abdominal surgical wound of an obese patient.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0623-1.jpg" alt="A surgical wound on an abdomen showing dehiscence, where the edges of the incision have separated." class="content-image" style="max-width: 500px;">

                        </figure>
                        
                        <h4>Exposure to Moisture</h4>
                        <p>Healthy skin needs good moisture balance. If too much moisture (i.e., sweat, urine, or water) is left on the skin for extended periods of time, the skin will become soggy, wrinkly, and turn whiter than usual and is called <strong>maceration</strong>. A simple example of maceration is when you spend too much time in a bathtub and your fingers and toes turn white and get "pruny." See Figure 10.8 for an image of maceration. If healthy skin is exposed to moisture for an extended period of time, such as when a moist wound dressing is incorrectly applied on healthy skin, the skin will break down. This type of skin breakdown is called <strong>excoriation</strong>. Excoriation refers to redness and removal of the topmost surface of the skin. See Figure 10.9 for an image of excoriation.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0624-1.jpg" alt="A photograph of a foot showing severe maceration (trench foot), with white, wrinkled, and damaged skin from prolonged moisture exposure." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p>The opposite occurs when skin lacks proper moisture. Skin becomes flaky, itchy, and cracked when it becomes too dry. Conditions such as decreased moisture in the air during cold winter months or bathing in hot water can worsen skin dryness. Dry skin, especially when accompanied with cracking, breaks the protective barrier and increases the risk of infection. It is important for nurses to apply emollient cream to patients' areas of dry skin to maintain the protective skin barrier.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Smoking</h4>
                        <p>Smoking impacts the inflammatory phase of the wound healing process, which can result in poor wound healing and an increased risk of infection. Patients who smoke should be encouraged to stop smoking.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Age</h4>
                        <p>Older adults have thin, less elastic skin that is at increased risk for injury. They also have an altered inflammatory response that can impair wound healing. Nurses can educate older patients about the importance of exercise for skin health and improved wound healing as appropriate.</p>

                        <h3>Phases of Wound Healing</h3>
                        <p>When skin is injured, there are four phases of wound healing that take place: hemostasis, inflammatory, proliferative, and maturation. See Figure 10.10 for an illustration of wound healing demonstrating hemostasis/inflammation, proliferation, and maturation.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0627-1.jpg" alt="A diagram showing the three stages of tissue repair: Inflammation (clot forms), Proliferation (new tissue and blood vessels grow), and Maturation (scar tissue forms)." class="content-image">
                            <figcaption>Phases of Wound Healing</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>To illustrate the phases of wound healing, imagine that you accidentally cut your finger with a knife as you were slicing an apple for a snack. Immediately after the injury occurs, blood vessels constrict and clotting factors are activated. This is referred to as the <strong>hemostasis phase</strong>. Clotting factors are released to form clots and to stop the bleeding. Platelets release growth factors that alert various cells to start the repair process at the wound location. The hemostasis phase lasts up to 60 minutes, depending on the severity of the injury.</p>
                        <p>After the hemostasis phase, the <strong>inflammatory phase</strong> begins. Vasodilation occurs so that white blood cells in the bloodstream can move to the location of the wound and start cleaning the wound bed. The inflammatory process appears as edema (swelling), erythema (redness), and exudate. Exudate is fluid that oozes out of a wound and is commonly called pus or drainage.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>proliferative phase</strong> of wound healing begins within a few days after the injury and includes four important processes: epithelialization, angiogenesis, collagen formation, and contraction. <strong>Epithelialization</strong> refers to the development of new epidermis and granulation tissue. <strong>Granulation tissue</strong> is new connective tissue with new, fragile, thin-walled capillaries. Collagen is also formed to provide strength and integrity to the wound. At the end of the proliferation phase, the wound begins to contract in size.</p>
                        <p>Capillaries begin to develop within the wound 24 hours after injury during a process called <strong>angiogenesis</strong>. These capillaries bring more oxygen and nutrients to the wound for healing. When performing dressing changes, it is essential for the nurse to protect this granulation tissue and the associated new capillaries. Healthy granulation tissue appears pink due to the new capillary formation. It is moist, painless to the touch, and may appear "bumpy." Conversely, unhealthy granulation tissue is dark red and painful. It bleeds easily with minimal contact and may be covered by shiny white or yellow fibrous tissue, referred to as biofilm, that must be removed because it impedes healing. Unhealthy granulation tissue is often caused by an infection, so wound cultures should be obtained when infection is suspected.</p>
                        <p>During the <strong>maturation phase</strong>, collagen continues to be created to strengthen the wound. Collagen contributes strength to the wound to prevent it from reopening. A wound typically heals within 4-5 weeks and often leaves behind a scar. The scar tissue is initially firm, red, and slightly raised from the excess collagen deposition. Over time, the scar begins to soften, flatten, and become pale in about nine months.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Types of Wound Healing</h3>
                        <p>There are three types of wound healing: primary intention, secondary intention, and tertiary intention. Healing by <strong>primary intention</strong> means that the wound is sutured, stapled, glued, or otherwise closed so the wound heals beneath the closure. This type of healing occurs with clean-edged lacerations or surgical incisions, and the closed edges are referred to as <strong>approximated</strong>. See Figure 10.11 for an image of a surgical wound healing by primary intention with approximated edges.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0630-1.jpg" alt="A surgical incision on an abdomen healing by primary intention, with the edges approximated and held together by sutures." class="content-image">

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Secondary intention</strong> occurs when the edges of a wound cannot be approximated (brought together), so the wound heals by filling in from the bottom up with the production of granulation tissue. Examples of common wounds that heal by secondary intention are pressure injuries and skin tears. Wounds that heal by secondary infection are at higher risk for infection and must be protected from contamination. See Figure 10.12 for an image of a wound healing by secondary intention.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p><strong>Tertiary intention</strong> refers to the healing of a wound that has had to remain open or has been reopened, often due to severe infection. The wound is typically closed at a later date when infection has resolved. Wounds that heal by secondary and tertiary intention have delayed healing times and increased scar tissue.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Types of Wounds</h3>
                        <p>There are many common types of wounds that nurses care for, such as skin tears, venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and pressure injuries.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Wound Care</h3>
                        <p>Wound care includes assessing and cleansing wounds, performing dressing changes, and implementing interventions to promote wound healing. Assessing wounds and implementing interventions to promote wound healing are further discussed in the "Applying the Nursing Process" section later in this chapter.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The remainder of this chapter will focus on applying the nursing process to a specific type of wound called a pressure injury. <strong>Pressure injuries</strong> are defined as, "Localized damage to the skin or underlying soft tissue, usually over a bony prominence, as a result of intense and prolonged pressure in combination with shear." (Note that the 2016 NPUAP Pressure Injury Staging System now uses the term "pressure injury" instead of the historic term "pressure ulcer" because a pressure injury can occur without an ulcer present.) Pressure injuries commonly occur on the sacrum, heels, ischia, and coccyx and form when the skin layer of tissue gets caught between an external hard surface, such as a bed or chair, and the internal hard surface of a bone.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shear</strong> occurs when tissue layers move over the top of each other, causing blood vessels to stretch and break as they pass through the subcutaneous tissue. For example, when a patient slides down in bed, the outer layer of skin remains immobile because it remains attached to the sheets due to friction. However, the deeper layer of tissue (attached to bone) moves as the patient slides down. This opposing movement of the outer layer of skin and the underlying tissues causes the capillaries to stretch and tear, which then causes decreased blood flow and oxygenation of the surrounding tissues resulting in a pressure injury.</p>
                        <p><strong>Friction</strong> refers to rubbing the skin against a hard object, such as the bed or the arm of a wheelchair. This rubbing causes heat, which can remove the top layer of skin and often results in skin damage. See Figure 10.13 for an illustration of shear and friction forces in the development of pressure injuries.</p>

                        <p>Hospital-acquired or worsening pressure injuries during hospitalization are considered "never events" meaning they are a serious, preventable medical errors that should never occur and require reporting to The Joint Commission. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and many private insurers will no longer pay for additional costs associated with "never events." Pressure injuries can be prevented with diligent assessment and nursing interventions.</p>

                        <h3>Staging</h3>
                        <p>When assessed, pressure injuries are staged from 1 through 4 based on the extent of tissue damage. For example, Stage 1 pressure injuries have the least amount of tissue damage as evidenced by reddened, intact skin, whereas Stage 4 pressure injuries have the greatest amount of damage with deep, open ulcers affecting underlying tissue, muscle, ligaments, or tendons. See Figure 10.14 for images of four stages of pressure injuries. Each stage is further described in the following subsections.</p>

                        <h4>Stage 1 Pressure Injuries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Stage 1 pressure injuries</strong> are intact skin with a localized area of nonblanchable erythema where prolonged pressure has occurred. <strong>Nonblanchable erythema</strong> is a medical term used to describe an area of reddened skin that does not turn white when pressed. See Figure 10.15 for an illustration of a Stage 1 pressure injury.</p>

                        <h4>Stage 2 Pressure Injuries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Stage 2 pressure injuries</strong> are partial-thickness loss of skin with exposed dermis. The wound bed is viable and may appear like an intact or ruptured blister. See Figure 10.16 for an illustration of a Stage 2 pressure injury.</p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0637-1.jpg" alt="Stage 2 pressure injury with partial-thickness skin loss and exposed dermis." class="content-image" style="display:inline-block; max-width: 48%;">

                        <h4>Stage 3 Pressure Injuries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Stage 3 pressure injuries</strong> are full-thickness tissue loss in which fat is visible, but cartilage, tendon, ligament, muscle, and bone are not exposed. The depth of tissue damage varies by anatomical location. See Figure 10.17 for an illustration of a Stage 3 pressure injury.</p>
                        <p><strong>Undermining</strong> and <strong>tunneling</strong> may occur in Stage 3 and 4 pressure injuries. Undermining occurs when the tissue under the wound edge becomes eroded, resulting in a pocket beneath the skin. Tunneling refers to passageways underneath the skin surface that extend from a wound and can take twists and turns.</p>
                        <p><strong>Slough</strong> and <strong>eschar</strong> may also be present in Stage 3 and 4 pressure injuries. Slough is inflammatory exudate that is usually light yellow, soft, and moist. Eschar is dark brown/black, dry, thick, and leathery dead tissue. If slough or eschar obscures the wound so that tissue loss cannot be assessed, the pressure injury is referred to as unstageable. In most wounds, slough and eschar must be removed by debridement for healing to occur.</p>
                        <figure>
                             <img src="../assets/images/2025_09_27_36bad475e9ced59f00a8g-0638-1.jpg" alt="A composite image of a Stage 3 pressure injury, showing full-thickness skin loss with visible adipose tissue." class="content-image">

                        <h4>Stage 4 Pressure Injuries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Stage 4 pressure injuries</strong> are full-thickness tissue loss, like in Stage 3 pressure injuries, but also have exposed cartilage, tendon, ligament, muscle, or bone. <strong>Osteomyelitis</strong> (bone infection) may also be present. See Figure 10.18 for an illustration of a Stage 4 pressure injury.</p>

                        <h4>Unstageable Pressure Injuries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Unstageable pressure injuries</strong> are full-thickness skin and tissue loss in which the extent of tissue damage within the ulcer cannot be confirmed because it is obscured by slough or eschar. If slough or eschar were to be removed, a Stage 3 or Stage 4 pressure injury would likely be revealed. However, dry and adherent eschar on the heel or ischemic limb is not typically removed. See Figure 10.19 for an illustration of an unstageable pressure ulcer due to the presence of eschar (on the left side of the wound) and slough (on the right side of the wound).</p>

                        <h4>Deep Tissue Pressure Injuries</h4>
                        <p><strong>Deep tissue pressure injuries</strong> consist of persistent nonblanchable and deep red, maroon, or purple discoloration of an area. These discolorations typically reveal a dark wound bed or blood-filled blister. Be aware that the discoloration may appear differently in darkly pigmented skin. Deep tissue injury results from intense and/or prolonged pressure, as well as shear forces at the bone-muscle interface. The wound may evolve rapidly to reveal the actual extent of tissue injury, or it may resolve without tissue loss. See Figure 10.20 for an illustration of a deep tissue injury.</p>

                        <p>Several factors place a patient at risk for developing a pressure injury, in addition to shear and friction. These factors include decreased sensory perception, increased moisture, decreased activity, impaired mobility, and inadequate nutrition. The <strong>Braden Scale</strong> is a standardized, evidence-based assessment tool commonly used in health care to assess and document a patient's risk for developing pressure injuries. Risk factors are rated on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 being "completely limited" and 4 being "no impairment."

                        <h3>How to Score the Braden Scale</h3>
                        <p>Each risk factor on the Braden Scale is rated from 1 to 4 based on the patient's assessment findings. When using the Braden Scale, start with the first category and review each description listed across the row for each of the ratings from 1 to 4 , and choose the one that best describes the patient's current status. Continue this process for all rows. Add all six numbers to determine a total score, and then use the total score to determine if the patient is at mild, moderate, high, or severe risk for developing a pressure injury. The lower the score, the higher the risk of developing a pressure injury. Additionally, customized nursing interventions are implemented based on the rating in each category. The higher the score, the more aggressive actions are taken to prevent or heal a pressure injury. Descriptions of the ratings from 1-4 for each risk factor, along with targeted interventions for each rating, are further described in the following subsections.</p>

                        <h3>Assessment</h3>
                        <h4>Subjective Assessment</h4>
                        <p>During a subjective assessment of a patient's integumentary system, begin by asking about current symptoms such as itching, rashes, or wounds. If a patient has a wound, it is important to determine if a patient has pain associated with the wound so that pain management can be implemented. For patients with chronic wounds, it is also important to identify factors that delay wound healing, such as nutrition, decreased oxygenation, infection, stress, diabetes, obesity, medications, alcohol use, and smoking. See Table 10.6a for a list of suggested interview questions to use when assessing a patient with a wound.</p>
                        <p>If a patient has a chronic wound or is experiencing delayed wound healing, it is important for the nurse to assess the impact of the wound on their quality of life. Several studies have shown that patients with nonhealing wounds have a decreased quality of life. Reasons for this include the frequency and regularity of dressing changes, which affect daily routine; a feeling of continued fatigue due to lack of sleep; restricted mobility; pain; odor; and the side effects of multiple medications. The loss of independence associated with functional decline can also lead to changes in overall health and well-being. These changes include altered eating habits, depression, social isolation, and a gradual reduction in activity levels.</p>

                        <h4>Objective Assessment</h4>
                        <p>When performing an objective integumentary assessment on a patient receiving inpatient care, it is important to perform a thorough exam on admission to check for existing wounds, as well as to evaluate their risk of skin breakdown using the Braden Scale. Agencies are not reimbursed for care of pressure injuries received during a patient's stay, so existing wounds on admission must be well-documented. Routine skin assessment should continue throughout a patient's stay, usually on a daily or shift-by-shift basis based on the patient's condition. If a wound is present, it is assessed during every dressing change for signs of healing. See Table 10.6b for components to include in a wound assessment. See Figure 10.22 for a common tool used to document the location of a skin concern found during assessment.</p>

                        <h4>Life Span and Cultural Considerations</h4>
                        <h5>NEWBORNS AND INFANTS</h5>
                        <p>Newborn skin is thin and sensitive. It tends to be easy to scratch and bruise and is susceptible to rashes and irritation. Common rashes seen in newborns and infants include diaper rash (contact dermatitis), cradle cap (seborrheic dermatitis), newborn acne, and prickly heat.</p>
                        <h5>TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS</h5>
                        <p>Because of high levels of activity and increasing mobility, this age group is more prone to accidents. Issues like lacerations, abrasions, burns, and sunburns can occur frequently. It is important to be highly aware of the potential for accidents and implement safety precautions as needed.</p>
                        <h5>SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS</h5>
                        <p>Skin rashes tend to affect skin within this age group. Impetigo, scabies, and head lice are commonly seen and may keep children home from school. Acne vulgaris typically begins during adolescence and can alter physical appearance, which can be very upsetting to this age group. Another change during adolescence is the appearance of axillary, pubic, and other body hair. Also, as these children spend more time out of doors, sunburns are more common, and care should be given to encourage sunscreen and discourage the use of tanning beds.</p>
                        <h5>ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS</h5>
                        <p>As skin ages, many changes take place. Because aging increases the loss of subcutaneous fat and collagen breakdown, skin becomes thinner and wrinkles deepen. Decreased sweat gland activity leads to drier skin and pruritus (itching). Healing is slowed because of reduced circulation and the inability of proteins and proper nutrients to arrive at injury sites. Hair loses pigmentation and turns gray or white. Nails become thicker and are more difficult to cut. Age or liver spots become darker and more noticeable. The number of skin growths increases and includes skin tags and keratoses. There is often delayed wound healing in older adults.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Diagnoses</h3>
                        <p>There are several NANDA-I nursing diagnoses related to patients experiencing skin alterations or those at risk of developing a skin injury. See Table 10.6e for common NANDA-I nursing diagnoses and their definitions.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>A commonly used NANDA-I nursing diagnosis for patients experiencing alterations in the integumentary system is <em>Impaired Tissue Integrity</em>, defined as, "Damage to the mucous membrane, cornea, integumentary system, muscular fascia, muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage, joint capsule, and/or ligament."</p>
                        <p>To verify accuracy of this diagnosis for a patient, the nurse compares assessment findings with defining characteristics of that diagnosis. Defining characteristics for Impaired Tissue Integrity include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acute pain</li>
                            <li>Bleeding</li>
                            <li>Destroyed tissue</li>
                            <li>Hematoma</li>
                            <li>Localized area hot to touch</li>
                            <li>Redness</li>
                            <li>Tissue damage</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A sample NANDA-I diagnosis in current PES format would be: "<em>Impaired Tissue Integrity related to insufficient knowledge about protecting tissue integrity as evidenced by redness and tissue damage.</em>"</p>

                        <h3>Outcome Identification</h3>
                        <p>An example of a broad goal for a patient experiencing alterations in tissue integrity is:</p>
                        <ul><li>The patient will experience tissue healing.</li></ul>
                        <p>A sample SMART expected outcome for a patient with a wound is:</p>
                        <ul><li>The patient's wound will decrease in size and have increased granulation tissue within two weeks.</li></ul>
                        
                        <h3>Planning Interventions</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the interventions outlined under the "Braden Scale" section to prevent and treat pressure injury, see the following box for a list interventions to prevent and treat impaired skin integrity. As always, consult a current, evidence-based nurse care planning resource for additional interventions when planning patient care.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title">Selected Interventions to Prevent and Treat Impaired Skin Integrity</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Assess and document the patient's skin status routinely.</li>
                                <li>Use the Braden Scale to identify patients at risk for skin breakdown. Customize interventions to prevent and treat skin breakdown according to patient needs.</li>
                                <li>If a wound is present, evaluate the healing process at every dressing change. Note and document characteristics of the wound, including size, appearance, staging (if applicable), and drainage. Notify the provider of new signs of infection or lack of progress in healing.</li>
                                <li>Provide wound care treatments, as prescribed by the provider or wound care specialist, and monitor the patient's response toward expected outcomes.</li>

                                <li>Maintain non-touch or aseptic technique when performing wound dressing changes, as indicated.</li>
                                <li>Change wound dressings as needed to keep them clean and dry and prevent bacterial reservoir.</li>
                                <li>Monitor for signs of infection in an existing wound.</li>
                                <li>Apply lotion to dry areas to prevent cracking.</li>
                                <li>Apply lubricant to moisten lips and oral mucosa, as needed.</li>
                                <li>Keep skin free of excess moisture. Use moisture barrier ointments.</li>
                                <li>Educate the patient and/or family caregivers on caring for the wound and request return demonstrations, as appropriate.</li>
                                <li>Administer medications, as prescribed, and monitor for expected effects.</li>
                                <li>Consult with a wound specialist, as needed.</li>

                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                        <p>Before implementing interventions, it is important to assess the current status of the skin and risk factors present for skin breakdown and modify interventions based on the patient's current status. For example, if a patient's rash has resolved, some interventions may no longer be appropriate (such as applying topical creams). However, if a wound is showing signs of worsening or delayed healing, additional interventions may be required. As always, if the patient demonstrates new signs of localized or systemic infection, the provider should be notified.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>It is important to evaluate for healing when performing wound care. Use the following expected outcomes when evaluating wound healing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Resolution of periwound redness in 1 week</li>
                            <li>50% reduction in wound dimensions in 2 weeks</li>
                            <li>Reduction in volume of exudate</li>
                            <li>25% reduction in amount of necrotic tissue/eschar in 1 week</li>
                            <li>Decreased pain intensity during dressing changes</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If a patient is experiencing delayed wound healing or has a chronic wound, it is helpful to advocate for a referral to a wound care nurse specialist.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>Betty Pruitt is a 92-year-old female admitted to a skilled nursing facility after a fall at her daughter's home while transferring the patient from her bed to a wheelchair. Although no injury was sustained, it became clear to the family that they could no longer provide adequate care at home.</p>
                        <p>Ms. Pruitt's past medical history includes congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and moderate stage Alzheimer's disease. Her cognitive ability has significantly declined over the last six months. Patient's speech continues to be mostly clear and at times coherent but she tends to be quiet and does not express her needs adequately, even with prompting. She no longer has the ability to ambulate but can stand for short periods of time, requiring two people to transfer. She rarely changes body position without encouragement and assistance, spending most of her days in a recliner or bed. Betty is 69 inches tall and currently weighs 122 pounds, having lost 22 pounds over the last 3 months. BMI is 18. Family reports her appetite is poor, and she eats only in small amounts at meal times with feeding assistance. She does take liquids well and shows no swallowing difficulties at this time. Betty is incontinent of urine and stool most of the time but will use the toilet if offered and given transfer help. Unknown to the family, a skin assessment revealed a Stage III pressure injury on coccyx area. Wound measures 4 cm long, 4 cm wide, 3 cm deep, with adipose tissue visible. No undermining, tunneling, bone, muscle, or tendons visible. Scant amount of yellowish purulent drainage noted. Slight foul odor, with redness, and increased heat around the wound present.</p>
                        <p>A Braden Scale Risk Assessment was completed and revealed a total score of 12 (High Risk) with the following category scores: Sensory Perception-3, Moisture-2, Activity-2, Mobility-2, Nutrition-2, Friction & Shear-1.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Applying the Nursing Process</h3>
                        <p>Based on this information, the following nursing care plan was implemented for Ms. Pruitt.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nursing Diagnosis:</strong> <em>Impaired Tissue Integrity related to imbalanced nutritional state and associated with impaired mobility as evidenced by damaged tissue, redness, area hot to touch.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Overall Goal:</strong> The patient will experience wound healing demonstrated by decreased wound size and increased granulation tissue.</p>
                        <p><strong>SMART Expected Outcome:</strong> Ms. Pruitt will have a 50% reduction in wound dimensions (from 4 cm in diameter to 2 cm) within two weeks.</p>

                                    <tr><td>1. Assess and document wound characteristics every shift, including size (length × width × depth), stage (I-IV), location, exudate, presence of granulation tissue, and epithelization.</td><td>Consistent and accurate documentation of wounds is important in determining the progression of wound healing and effectiveness of treatments.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>2. Monitor for signs of infection (color, temperature, edema, moisture, pain, and appearance of surrounding skin).</td><td>Frequent monitoring for possible wound infection provides the ability to intervene quickly if changes in the wound are noted. Additionally, pain medications should be offered prior to dressing changes if pain is present.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>3. Cleanse wound per facility protocol or as ordered.</td><td>Removal of exudate, dirt, and slough promotes wound healing.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>4. Cleanse the periwound area (skin around the wound) with mild soap and water.</td><td>Decreasing the number of microorganisms around the wound may decrease the chance of wound infection.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>5. Apply and change wound dressings, per facility protocol or wound orders.</td><td>Dressings that maintain moisture in the wound keep periwound skin dry, absorb drainage, and pad the wound to protect from further injury assist in healing.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>6. Turn/reposition the patient every 2 hours and position with pillows as needed.</td><td>Frequent repositioning relieves pressure point areas from damage. Avoid positioning the patient directly on an injured area if possible.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>7. Consider the use of a specialty mattress, bed, or chair pad.</td><td>Specialty mattresses, beds, or pads offer added padding and support, while decreasing pressure areas.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>8. Use moisture barrier ointments (protective skin barriers).</td><td>Moisture barrier ointments can significantly decrease skin breakdown and pressure injury formation.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>9. Check incontinence pads frequently (every 2-3 hours) and change as needed to keep dry.</td><td>Frequent changing of soiled pads will prevent exposure to chemicals in urine and stool that erode the skin.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>10. Monitor nutritional status and obtain order for dietary consult if needed.</td><td>Optimizing nutritional intake, including calories, protein, and vitamins, is essential to promote wound healing.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>11. Offer nutritional supplements and water.</td><td>Nutritional supplements, such as protein shakes, can provide additional calories and protein without a large volume of intake needed. Water intake is essential for proper tissue hydration.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>12. Keep bed linens clean, dry, and wrinkle free.</td><td>Soiled, wet, or wrinkled sheets may contribute to skin breakdown.</td></tr>
                                    <tr><td>13. Use a minimum of two-person assistance and a draw sheet to pull the patient up in bed.</td><td>Carefully transferring patients avoids adverse effects of external mechanical forces (pressure, friction, and shear) from causing skin or tissue damage.</td></tr>

                        <h4>Interventions Implemented:</h4>
                        <p>After the admission assessment was completed, Ms. Pruitt became settled in her new room. The wound was assessed, documented, and cleaned. A specimen for wound culture was obtained and a wound dressing applied per protocol. The health care provider was notified of the wound. Requests were made for a wound culture, referrals to a wound care nurse specialist and a dietician, and a pressure-relieving mattress for the bed. A two-hour turning schedule was implemented, and the CNA was reminded to use two-person assistance with a lift sheet when repositioning the patient. A barrier cream was applied to protect the peri-area whenever a new incontinence pad was placed. The following documentation note was entered in the patient chart.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Documentation:</h4>
                        <p>On admission, a Stage III pressure injury was discovered on the patient's coccyx area. The wound measured 4 cm long, 4 cm wide, 3 cm deep, with adipose tissue visible. No undermining, tunneling, bone, muscle, or tendons visible. A small amount of yellow purulent drainage noted. Slight foul odor, with redness, and increased heat around the wound present. Wound was cleaned with normal saline and packed with moist gauze and covered with hydrogel dressing. Patient tolerated the procedure well and gave no evidence of pain. A pressure-relieving mattress was placed on the patient's bed and a two-hour turning schedule was implemented. Patient voided x1 and the pad was changed. Barrier cream was applied to the perineal area. Patient encouraged to rest until lunchtime and is resting.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Evaluation:</h4>
                        <p>After two weeks, the measurements of the wound were compared to those on admission and the wound decreased in size to less than 2 cm. The expected outcome was "met." A new expected outcome was established, "Mrs. Pruitt's wound will resolve within the next 2 weeks." The same planned interventions were continued to be implemented.</p>

                        <p>You are a nurse working in a long-term care facility. You have been assigned to care for Mr. Johns, a 74-year-old client recently diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, resulting in frequent incontinence. Mr. Johns suffered a CVA (stroke) six months ago and has difficulties ambulating and attending to his own needs because of weakness on his right side. Mr. Johns is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but has decreased sensation on his entire right side. He spends most of his time in bed or sitting at his bedside in a wheelchair due to his difficulty with ambulation. He eats about 50% of his meals. While assessing Mr. Johns, you note that he is thin for his height, incontinent of foul-smelling urine, and has a deepened reddened area on his sacrum.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>What additional information, including lab work, would you like to gather to further assess Mr. Johns' potential for pressure injury development?</li>
                            <li>What factors make him particularly vulnerable to the development of pressure injuries?</li>
