                        <p>This Nursing Fundamentals textbook is an open educational resource with CC-BY licensing developed for entry-level nursing students. Content is based on the Wisconsin Technical College System (WTCS) statewide nursing curriculum for the Nursing Fundamentals course (543-101), the 2019 NCLEX-RN Test Plan, the 2020 NCLEX-PN Test Plan, and the Wisconsin Nurse Practice Act.</p>
                        <p>This book introduces the entry-level nursing student to the scope of nursing practice, various communication techniques, and caring for diverse patients. The nursing process is used as a framework for providing patient care based on the following nursing concepts: safety, oxygenation, comfort, spiritual wellbeing, grief and loss, sleep and rest, mobility, nutrition, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, and elimination. Care for patients with integumentary disorders and cognitive or sensory impairments is also discussed. Learning activities have been incorporated into each chapter to encourage students to use critical thinking while applying content to patient care situations.</p>
                        <p>The Open Resources for Nursing (Open RN) project is supported by a $2.5 million grant from the Department of Education. This book is available for free online and can also be downloaded in multiple formats for offline use. The online version is required for interaction with adaptive learning activities included in each chapter. Affordable print versions may also be purchased from XanEdu in college bookstores and on Amazon.</p>

                        <h3>Conceptual Approach</h3>
                        <p>The Open RN Nursing Fundamentals textbook incorporates the following concepts across all chapters:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Holism.</strong> Florence Nightingale taught nurses to focus on the principles of holism, including wellness and the interrelationship of human beings and their environment. This textbook encourages the application of holism by assessing the impact of developmental, emotional, cultural, religious, and spiritual influences on a patient's health status.</li>
                            <li><strong>Evidence-Based Practice (EBP).</strong> Textbook content is based on current, evidence-based practices that are referenced by footnotes. To promote digital literacy, hyperlinks are provided to credible, free online resources that supplement content. The Open RN textbooks will be updated as new EBP is established and with the release of updated NCLEX Test Plans every three years.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cultural Competency.</strong> Nurses have an ethical and moral obligation to provide culturally competent care to the patients they serve based on the ANA Code of Ethics. Cultural considerations are included throughout this textbook.</li>
                            <li><strong>Care Across the Life Span.</strong> Developmental stages are addressed regarding patient assessments and procedures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Health Promotion.</strong> Focused interview questions and patient education topics are included to promote patient well-being and encourage selfcare behaviors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scope of Practice.</strong> Assessment techniques are included that have been identified as frequently performed by entry-level nurse generalists.</li>
                            <li><strong>Patient Safety.</strong> Expected and unexpected findings on assessment are highlighted in tables to promote patient safety by encouraging notification of health care providers when changes in condition occur.</li>
                            <li><strong>Clear and Inclusive Language.</strong> Content is written using clear language preferred by entry-level pre-licensure nursing students to enhance understanding of complex concepts. "They" is used as a singular pronoun to refer to a person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context of the usage, as endorsed by APA style. It is inclusive of all people and helps writers avoid making assumptions about gender.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Source Images and Fair Use.</strong> Images are included to promote visual learning. Students and faculty can reuse open source images by following the terms of their associated Creative Commons licensing. Some images are included based on Fair Use as described in the "Code of Best Practices for Fair Use and Fair Dealing in Open Education" presented at the OpenEd20 conference. Refer to the footnotes of images for source and licensing information throughout the text.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Pedagogy.</strong> Students are encouraged to contribute to the Open RN textbooks in meaningful ways. In this textbook, students assisted in reviewing content for clarity for an entry-level learner and also assisted in creating open source images.</li>
                        </ul>
