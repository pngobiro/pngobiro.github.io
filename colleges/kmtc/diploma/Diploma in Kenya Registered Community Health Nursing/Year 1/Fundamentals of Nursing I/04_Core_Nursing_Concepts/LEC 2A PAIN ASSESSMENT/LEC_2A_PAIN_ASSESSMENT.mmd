PAIN ASSESSMENT

\section*{PAIN ASSESSMENT}
- Pain assessment is crucial if pain management is to be effective. Nurses are in a unique position to assess pain as they have the most contact with the patients and family.
- Three ways of measuring pain:
- Self-report - what they say (the gold standard)
- Behavioural - how they behave
- Physiological - clinical observations
- Pain is very subjective, therefore self-report is considered the Gold Standard and most accurate measure of pain.

\section*{PAIN ASSESSMENT}
- There are several tools used in pain assessment includes
- RTCCS
- ODPARA
- PQRST
- Wong-Baker faces pain scale
- Visual Analogue scale

\section*{Pain assessment tools}
- R - Radiation

T - Timing
C - Character
S - Site of pain
S - Severity of pain
S - Shifting of pain
- O - Onset of symptom sudden/Gradual
D - Duration of symptoms
P - Progression (is the symptom progressively worsening or it's static)
A - Aggravating factors
R - Relieving factors
A - Association (to know the other symptoms accompanying the main symptom which help us to rule in or rule out a differential diagnosis)

\section*{Pain assessment}
- The PQRST method of assessing pain is a valuable tool to describe, assess and document a patient's pain accurately
- P stands for provokes.
- What provoked the pain?
- What makes it worse?
- What makes it better?
- Did the pain occur at rest or during exertion?
- Did the pain wake the patient up?

Pain assessment using PQRST.

\section*{Provoking Factors.}

What factors precipitated the discomfort?
What were they doing at the time of onset?

Quality.
Ask the pt to describe the pain/
discomfort and its characteristics.
Region / Radiation.

Where is the pain?
Does it radiate?
Is there pain anywhere else?
Severity.

Ask the pt to rate their pain/discomfort on a pain scale.

T
Time.
How long has the pt had the pain.
Does anything make it worse or better?

\section*{Pain assessment}
- Q for quality.
- Sharp, dull, squeezing, a slight pressure, a burning or aching pain, a pounding pain, colic-like or cramping, or a stabbing pain.
- $\mathbf{R}$ for radiates.
- Does the pain move anywhere?
- Ask the patient to point to anywhere they feel pain.
- S for severity.
- Ask the patient to rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10.
- Where 0 is no pain, and 10 is the worst pain imaginable

\section*{Pain assessment}
- T for time.
- Ask the patient: when did it start?
- Was the onset slow or sudden?
- How long has it lasted?
- Is it a constant or intermittent pain? Does it come and go?
- Have you had the pain previously?
- Is it the same as previously or is it different from last time?
