                            <li>The middle and thickest layer is the myocardium, made largely of cardiac muscle cells. It is built upon a framework of collagenous fibers, plus the blood vessels that supply the myocardium and the nerve fibers that help regulate the heart.</li>
                            <li>It is the contraction of the myocardium that pumps blood through the heart and into the major arteries.</li>
                            <li>Although the ventricles on the right and left sides pump the same amount of blood per contraction, the muscle of the left ventricle is much thicker and better developed than that of the right ventricle.</li>
                            <li>The innermost layer of the heart wall, the endocardium, is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue.

                            <li>A septum (plural = septa) refers to a wall or partition that divides the heart into chambers.</li>
                            <li>The septa are physical extensions of the myocardium lined with endocardium.</li>
                            <li>Located between the two atria is the interatrial septum.</li>
                            <li>Normally in an adult heart, the interatrial septum bears an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale.</li>
                            <li>Between the two ventricles is a second septum known as the interventricular septum. Unlike the interatrial septum, the interventricular septum is normally intact after its formation during fetal development. It is substantially thicker than the interatrial septum, since the ventricles generate greater pressure when they contract.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The septum between the atria and ventricles is known as the atrioventricular septum. It is marked by the presence of four openings that allow blood to move from the atria into the ventricles and from the ventricles into the pulmonary trunk and aorta.</li>

                            <li>Located in each of these openings between the atria and ventricles is a valve, a specialized structure that ensures one-way flow of blood.</li>
                            <li>The heart has 4 valves:</li>
                            <li>The mitral valve and tricuspid valve, which control blood flow from the atria to the ventricles. (atrioventricular valves.)</li>
                            <li>The aortic valve and pulmonary valve, which control blood flow out of the ventricles. (semilunar valves.)</li>

                        <p>The right atrium serves as the receiving chamber for blood returning to the heart from the systemic circulation.</p>
                        <p>The two major systemic veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae, and the large coronary vein called the coronary sinus that drains the heart myocardium empty into the right atrium.</p>
                        <p>The superior vena cava drains blood from regions superior to the diaphragm: the head, neck, upper limbs, and the thoracic region. It empties into the superior and posterior portions of the right atrium.</p>
                        <p>The inferior vena cava drains blood from areas inferior to the diaphragm: the lower limbs and abdominopelvic region of the body. It, too, empties into the posterior portion of the atria, but inferior to the opening of the superior vena cava.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">The Right Ventricle</h3>
                        <p>The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve. Each flap of the valve is attached to strong strands of connective tissue, the chordae tendineae, literally "tendinous cords,"</p>
                        <p>They are composed of approximately 80 percent collagenous fibers with the remainder consisting of elastic fibers and endothelium. They connect each of the flaps to a papillary muscle that extends from the inferior ventricular surface</p>
                        <p>The walls of the ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium.</p>
                        <p>When the myocardium of the ventricle contracts, pressure within the ventricular chamber rises. Blood, like any fluid, flows from higher pressure to lower pressure areas, in this case, toward the pulmonary trunk and the atrium. To prevent any potential backflow, the papillary muscles also contract, generating tension on the chordae tendineae. This prevents the flaps of the valves from being forced into the atria and regurgitation of the blood back into the atria during ventricular contraction.</p>
                        <p>The Figure below shows papillary muscles and chordae tendineae attached to the tricuspid valve.</p>

                            <li>After exchange of gases in the pulmonary capillaries, blood returns to the left atrium high in oxygen via one of the four pulmonary veins.</li>
                            <li>While the left atrium does not contain pectinate muscles, it does have an auricle that includes these pectinate ridges. Blood flows from the pulmonary veins back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber.</li>
                            <li>Toward the end of the ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle.</li>
                            <li>The opening between the left atrium and ventricle is guarded by the mitral valve.</li>

                        <p>The mitral valve is connected to papillary muscles via chordae tendineae. There are two papillary muscles on the left-the anterior and posterior-as opposed to three on the right. (hence bicuspid valve and tricuspid valve)</p>
                        <p>The left ventricle is the major pumping chamber for the systemic circuit; it ejects blood into the aorta through the aortic semilunar valve.</p>

                        <p>The valves ensure unidirectional blood flow through the heart.</p>

                        <p>Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the right atrioventricular valve, or tricuspid valve.</p>
                        <p>It typically consists of three flaps, made of endocardium reinforced with additional connective tissue.</p>
                        <p>The flaps are connected by chordae tendineae to the papillary muscles, which control the opening and closing of the valves.</p>

                        <p>Emerging from the right ventricle at the base of the pulmonary trunk is the pulmonary semilunar valve, or the pulmonary valve; it is also known as the pulmonic valve or the right semilunar valve.</p>
                        <p>When the ventricle relaxes, the pressure differential causes blood to flow back into the ventricle from the pulmonary trunk. This flow of blood fills the pocket-like flaps of the pulmonary valve, causing the valve to close and producing an audible sound.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the atrioventricular valves, there are no papillary muscles or chordae tendineae associated with the pulmonary valve.</p>

                        <p>Located at the opening between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve, also called the bicuspid valve or the left atrioventricular valve.</p>
                        <p>Structurally, this valve consists of two cusps , compared to the three cusps of the tricuspid valve.</p>
                        <p>The two cusps of the mitral valve are attached by chordae tendineae to two papillary muscles that project from the wall of the ventricle.</p>

                        <p>At the base of the aorta is the aortic semilunar valve, or the aortic valve, which prevents backflow from the aorta.</p>
                        <p>When the ventricle relaxes and blood attempts to flow back into the ventricle from the aorta, blood will fill the cusps of the valve, causing it to close and producing an audible sound.</p>

                        <p>The sinuatrial node gives origin spontaneously to rhythmical impulses that spread in all direction through the cardiac muscle of the atria.</p>
                        <p>As a result, the atrial muscle contracts.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">b) Atrioventricular node:</h4>
                        <p>It is strategically placed in the lower part of the right atrium just above the attachment of the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve.</p>
                        <p>Through this node, the cardiac impulse is conducted from atria to the ventricles.</p>
                        <p>The speed of conduction of impulse through the atrioventricular node is very slow, which allows sufficient time for the atria to empty their blood into the ventricles completely.</p>

                        <p>It is also known as "the bundle of His".</p>

                        <p>The bundle descends and on reaching the muscular part of the septum, it divides into two branches, one for each ventricle.</p>
                        <p>The right bundle branch passes to the right ventricle and the left bundle branch passes to the left.</p>
                        <p>After this point, they become continuous with the fibers of Purkinje tissue.</p>

                            <li>The conducting system of heart is responsible not only for generating rhythmical cardiac impulses but also for conducting these impulses rapidly throughout the myocardium of the heart. Thus it aids in coordinated and efficient contraction of different chambers of the heart.</li>
                            <li>The activities of the conducting system of heart can be influenced by the autonomic nerve supply of heart. The parasympathetic nerves slow the rhythm and diminish the speed of conduction, while the sympathetic nerves have the opposite effect.</li>

                        <p>At the beginning of the cardiac cycle, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed (diastole). Blood is flowing into the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood flows into the left atrium from the four pulmonary veins. The two atrioventricular valves, the tricuspid and mitral valves, are both open, so blood flows unimpeded from the atria and into the ventricles. The two semilunar valves, the pulmonary and aortic valves, are closed, preventing backflow of blood into the right and left ventricles from the pulmonary trunk on the right and the aorta on the left.</p>

                        <p>Contraction of the atria follows depolarization, represented by the P wave of the ECG. As the atrial muscles contract from the superior portion of the atria toward the atrioventricular septum, pressure rises within the atria and blood is pumped into the ventricles through the open atrioventricular (tricuspid, and mitral or bicuspid) valves. Atrial systole ends prior to ventricular systole, as the atrial muscle returns to diastole.</p>

                            <li>Ventricular systole follows the depolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the QRS complex in the ECG.</li>
                            <li>Blood is pumped from the heart, pushing open the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves. Pressure generated by the left ventricle will be appreciably greater than the pressure generated by the right ventricle. Nevertheless, both ventricles pump the same amount of blood.</li>

                            <li>Ventricular relaxation, or diastole, follows repolarization of the ventricles and is represented by the T wave of the ECG. As the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the remaining blood within the ventricle begins to fall. The semilunar valves close to prevent backflow into the heart</li>
                            <li>As the ventricular muscle relaxes, pressure on the blood within the ventricles drops even further. Eventually, it drops below the pressure in the atria. When this occurs, blood flows from the atria into the ventricles, pushing open the tricuspid and mitral valves. As pressure drops within the ventricles, blood flows from the major veins into the relaxed atria and from there into the ventricles.</li>
                            <li>Both chambers are in diastole, the atrioventricular valves are open, and the semilunar valves remain closed. The cardiac cycle is complete.</li>

                        <p>Heart sounds are the noises generated by the beating heart and the resultant flow of blood through it. Specifically, the sounds reflect the turbulence created when the heart valves snap shut.</p>
                        <p>In cardiac auscultation, an examiner may use a stethoscope to listen for these unique and distinct sounds that provide important auditory data regarding the condition of the heart.</p>
                        <p>In healthy adults, there are two normal heart sounds, often described as a lub and a dub (or dup), that occur in sequence with each heartbeat.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These are the first heart sound (S<sub>1</sub>) and second heart sound (S<sub>2</sub>), produced by the closing of the atrioventricular valves and semilunar valves, respectively.</li>
                            <li>In addition to these normal sounds, a variety of other sounds may be present including heart murmurs, adventitious sounds, and gallop rhythms S<sub>3</sub> and S<sub>4</sub>. (gallop - abnormal rhythm of the heart on auscultation)</li>
                            <li>Heart murmurs are generated by turbulent flow of blood. Turbulence may occur inside or outside the heart; if it occurs outside the heart then the turbulence is called Bruit.</li>
