INVESTIGATIONS IN CARDIOLOGY

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- Investigations serve to confirm a diagnosis and they do not replace clinical skills
- They must be interpreted within the clinical context
- They include:
- CXR
- ECG (resting and stress)
- Echocardiogram
- Cardiac catheterization
- Coronary angiogram
- Myocardial perfusion scans
- MRI
- CT scan
- LAB tests
- Always treat the patient and not the result

\section*{CXR}
- Cardiac silhouette gives important information on the size and state of the heart
- Should occupy less than half of the hemi-thorax
- Know the chambers forming the borders
- LEFT BORDER - LV
- RIGHT BORDER - RA
- LEFT UPPER BODDER - LA/Pulmonary bay, aortic knuckle
- Lung fields - help differentiate cardiac and respiratory causes of dyspnea e.g. pulmonary edema, pleural effusion
- Ribs - e.g. notching in Coarctation of the Aorta due to new anastomoses being formed.
- Enlargement of the Left Atrium is called spraying of the carina.

\section*{FIND CXRs SHOWING:}
- Dextro-cardia; situs inversus and a gastric bubble
- Cardiomegaly
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Consolidation
- Pericardial effusion

\section*{ECG}
- Very important
- CONDUCTION SYSTEM:
- SAN, atrial tissue, AVN, Hi Purkinje system, Lt/Rt bundles, ventricular tissue
- Aids in diagnosis of:
- IHD especially Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)
- The ECG is diagnostic.
- ACS:
- STEMI (Require thrombolysis within 6 hours max.)
- Non-ST segment Elevation MI (Do not get thrombolysis)
- Unstable Angina
- Chamber enlargement
- Arrhythmias
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Pericardial disease - effusion
- PTE

\section*{ANALYZING ECG: KEY QUESTIONS}
-What's the rhythm?
- Are P waves present?
- P waves represent atrial depolarization
- How is the P wave related to the QRS complex?
- $P$ waves should always precede the QRS complex
- Is every P wave followed by a QRS complex with a normal $\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{R}$ interval?
-What's the R-R interval? - HR/ventricular response
- 300 divide by the large squares = HR
- 1500 divide be the small squares = HR
-What's the axis?
- General direction of impulse flow
- Are ST segments normal?
- U waves are present in hypokalemia which can lead to cardiac arrest.

\section*{RULES DETERMINING A NORMAL ECG}
- They all have a positive QRS EXCEPT aVR and V1
- V1 is place at the right fourth interspace
- aVR is place on the right arm
- Therefore, for aVR and V1, the impulse is moving away
- V1 has a positive QRS if the RV becomes bigger than the LV since, in that case, the former's activation (from left to right) camouflages the latter's (from right to left)
- R-R interval should always be regular
- A P-wave should always precede a QRS complex
- There should be a pattern
- An irregular ECG is seen in AF.

\section*{FIND ECGs SHOWING:}
- Sinus bradycardia
- Seen in athletes and in deep sleep
- Sinus tachycardia
- Ventricular bigeminy
- Ventricular ectopic beats

\section*{AXIS CALCULATION}
- Lead II tends to move along the axis and is therefore used as the rhythm strip
- When finding the axis, use lead I and aVF.
- Demonstrate Right and Left Axis Deviation
- RAD is seen in Right Ventricular Hypertrophy
- LV strain - inverted T waves in V4, V6, aVL and LI

\section*{STRESS ECG}
- Done when a diagnosis of CAD is suspected
- Follow up post-ACS to assess exercise tolerance and advice on life-style changes
- During myocardial perfusion scanning
- Standard Bruce Protocol
- Pharmacological stress testing
- ? Adenosine
- Limitations; Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) - do perfusion scanning, Limb amputation, Clinical state of the patient etc.

\section*{ECHOCARDIOGRAM}
- Visualizes the structure of the heart
- Definitive in diagnosis of structural abnormalities of the heart:
- Valvular heart lesions
- Atrial Septal Defect
- Mitral stenosis
- A normal M - mode echo is used to estimate the contractility of the heart using the ejection fraction (EF) - normal is 55\%
- Color Doppler can be done for mitral regurgitation

\section*{CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION}
- Diagnosis of complex xongenital heart disease when echo is inconclusive e.g. COA Assess pulmonary pressures before correction of VSD and ASD
- Determine significance of shunting in ASD i.e. pulmonary/systemic flow ratio
- Diagnossis of restrictive cardiomyopathy vs. constrictive pericarditis
- Is therapeutic

\section*{CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY}
- Confirms and assesses the severity of CAD

\section*{LAB INVESTIGATIONS}
- Cardiac enzymes - key in diagnosis of ACS
- Troponin I/T
- Creatinine phosphokinase - CK-MB
- Others
- U/E/C
- RBS
- Lipid profile
