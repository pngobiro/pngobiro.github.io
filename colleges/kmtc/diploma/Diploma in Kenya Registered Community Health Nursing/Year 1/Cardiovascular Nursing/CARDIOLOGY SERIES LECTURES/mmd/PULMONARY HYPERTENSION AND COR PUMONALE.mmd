PULMONARY HYPERTENSION AND COR PUMONALE.
Definitions
Primary pulmonary HTN (PPH) is a rare disease characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure with no apparent cause.
PPH is also termed precapillary pulmonary hypertension or idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).
- The diagnosis is usually made after excluding other known causes of pulmonary hypertension.
Normal Systolic pulmonary pressure-range $\mathbf{2 0 - 3 0 ~ m m H g}$ and dependent on RV stroke volume; elastance of main pulmonary artery and branches; reflectance wave from arterioles, which is influenced by tone and diastolic pressure factors.
Diastolic pressure $\mathbf{8 - 1 2 ~ m m ~ H g}$, Mean pressure $12-17 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg, Pulmonary wedge pressure $\mathbf{5 - 1 2 ~ m m ~ H g}$.
Secondary pulmonary artery HTN (SPAH) is defined as a pulmonary artery systolic pressure higher than 30 mm Hg or a pulmonary artery mean pressure higher than 20 mm Hg secondary to either a pulmonary or a cardiac disorder
Cor pulmonale is defined as an alteration in the structure and function of the right ventricle caused by a primary disorder of the respiratory system commonly leading to pulmonary HTN.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Primary Pulm. HTN
Pathophysiology not clear but an insult (eg, hormonal, mechanical, other) to the endothelium resulting in a cascade of events characterized by vascular scarring, endothelial dysfunction, and intimal and medial (smooth muscle) proliferation.
At least $15-20 \%$ of patients with IPAH have a familial form related to sporadic genetic defects(BMPR-II gene)
Early in the disease, thrombotic pulmonary arteriopathy occurs characterized by in situ thrombosis of small muscular arteries of the pulmonary vasculature.
In later stages, as the pulmonary pressure continues to rise, remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature occurs with intimal fibrosis and replacement of normal endothelial structure.
Associated conditions
1. Portal hypertension (thus porto-pulmonary HTN ) Shunting of splanchnic blood lead to exposure of the pulmonary circulation to substances in the splanchnic circulation that normally are detoxified via the liver. This may lead to endothelial injury and thus Pulmonary HTN.
2.Connective tissue diseases
- CREST (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal motility disorder, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) variant of scleroderma
- SLE

However, connective tissue diseases are sometimes thought of as causing secondary pulmonary HTN.

Secondary Pulmonary HTN.
Three predominant pathophysiologic mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of SPAH
(1) hypoxic vasoconstriction
(2) decreased area of the pulmonary vascular bed
(3) volume/pressure overload.

\section*{Hypoxic vasoconstriction}

Chronic hypoxemia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction by a variety of actions on pulmonary artery endothelium and smooth muscle cells ie
Down-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthetase and reduced production of the voltage-gated potassium channels
Chronic hypoxemia leading to pulmonary HTN may occur
1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
2) Hypoventilation disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea, adenoid hypertrophy).
3) Neuromuscular disorder causing hypoventilation eg poliomyelitis, myasthenia gravis
4) High-altitude disorders
5) Disorders of the chest wall kyphoscoliosis
6) Interstitial lung diseases

Obliteration of pulmonary vasculature
1) Collagen vascular diseases.
- Scleroderma-CREST syndrome-Calcinosis, Raynauds phenomena, Esophageal motility disorder, Sclerodactyly, Talengiectasia
- SLE,Chaug-straus syndrome,Good pastures disease,wenengers syndrome
2) Acute pulmonary embolism
3) Chronic proximal pulmonary emboli
4) HIV infection
5) Portal hypertension
6) Drugs
- Fenfluramine
- crack cocaine
- amphetamines
- aminorex
- chemotherapeutic drugs-Bleomycin(lung fibrosis)
- Tryptophan
7)Infections-Schistosomiasis ,TB, Fungal pneumonitis
8) Increased blood viscosity due to blood disorders, eg, polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, macroglobulinemia
9)Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis

\section*{Volume and pressure overload}
-Pulmonary blood volume overload is caused by left-toright shunts ie atrial or ventricular septal defects.
-Left atrial hypertension causes a passive rise in pulmonary arterial systolic pressure in order to maintain a driving force across the vasculature. Over time, persistent pulmonary hypertension accompanied by vasculopathy occurs. This may occur secondary to left ventricular dysfunction eg
- Mitral valvular disease
- Constrictive pericarditis
- Aortic stenosis
- Cardiomyopathy.
-Pulmonary venous obstruction is a rare cause of pulmonary hypertension. This may occur secondary to mediastinal fibrosis, anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, or pulmonary venoocclusive disease.

\section*{Cor pulmonale}

In chronic cor pulmonale, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) generally predominates. In acute cor pulmonale, right ventricular dilatation mainly occurs.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

The clinical manifestations are frequently masked by the underlying etiology.

\section*{History}
- Dyspnea upon exertion or at rest
- Fatigue and Lethargy
- Syncope with exertion
- Chest pain
- Cough
- Hemoptysis
- Hoarseness (due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve by the distended pulmonary artery)
- In advanced stages, passive hepatic congestion lead to anorexia, right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort, and jaundice
- Swelling of the legs

Obtaining a careful history may help exclude some of the numerous causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension. Important clues to a specific secondary cause include
- Known history of heart disease.
- TB treatment or chronic cough
- Occupational or residential exposure to industrial emissions.
- History deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
- Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis or arthralgias, rash
- Heavy alcohol consumption and cigarette use.
- Yelowness of eyes -hepatitis
- Tx or predisposed to schistosoma infection
- Heavy snoring
- Daytime hypersomnolence
- Morning headaches, morbid obesity, and a family history of hypertension.

\section*{Physical examination}
-Signs of the underlying lung disease
- with an increase in chest diameter
- labored respiratory efforts with retractions of the chest wall
- hyperresonance to percussion
- diminished breath sounds, wheezing
- distant heart sounds
- Sometimes cyanosis.

Signs of pulmonary hypertension
- Splitting of the second heart sound with accentuation of the pulmonic component
- A systolic ejection murmur with sharp ejection click over the region of the pulmonary artery may be heard in advanced disease, along with a diastolic pulmonary regurgitation murmur.

Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Left parasternal or subxiphoid heave
- A prominent A wave in the jugular venous pulse
- Right-sided fourth heart sound also can be present and reflects the increase in the filling pressure of the right ventricle.
Right ventricular failure
- Distended neck veins with a prominent V wave
- Right ventricular third heart sound
- Holosystolic tricuspid insufficiency murmur accentuated during inspiration
- Tender hepatomegaly, may be pulsatile
- Peripheral edema.
- Pleural effusions and ascites are uncommon, even in severe cor pulmonale.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

\section*{1.CXR}

Pulmonary HTN-enlargement of central pulmonary arteries, attenuation of peripheral vessels, and oligemic lung fields.
-Right ventricular hypertrophy and right atrial dilatation 2.Echocardiography
-Signs of chronic right ventricular pressure overload are present, which include increased thickness of the right
ventricle with paradoxical bulging of the septum into the left ventricle during systole.
-In later stages, right ventricular dilatation occurs, leading to right ventricular hypokinesis.
-Right atrial dilatation and tricuspid regurgitation are also present.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l}
Doppler echocardiography \\
-most reliable noninvasive method to estimate pulmonary arterial pressure. \\
-Tricuspid regurgitation -Tricuspid regurgitation is generally detected in more than $90 \%$ of patients with severe SPAH. \\
Other Tests. \\
3. ECG. \\
i) RVH- R-V1 +S-V6> 35mm, Right axis deviation Strain-T-wave and ST-segment inversion \\
ii)Right atrial enlargement-P-pulmonale-Peaked Pwave(increased P-wave amplitude) \\
iii) In acute cor pulmonale secondary to acute pulmonary embolism, the $\mathrm{S}_{1} \mathrm{Q}_{3} \mathrm{~T}_{3}$ pattern may be observed, along with incomplete or complete right bundle branch block. \\
iv)Patients with severe underlying obstructive lung disease may have low-voltage QRS on their ECG, reflecting the interposition of hyperexpanded lung between the heart and chest \\
4.Ventilation perfusion lung scan \\
-Ventilation perfusion scan should be performed to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. \\
-Diffuse mottled perfusion can be observed in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, as opposed to segmental or subsegmental mismatched defects observed in patients with SPAH. \\
5.Pulmonary function tests \\
These tests may show an obstructive pattern suggestive of COPD or a restrictive pattern suggestive of an interstitial lung disease. \\
In selected cases pulmonary angiography, and chest CT scanning may be indicated to determine underlying etiology \\
Procedures. \\
Cardiac catheterization: \\
Right-heart catheterization is considered the most precise method for diagnosis and quantification of pulmonary hypertension. \\
It is indicated when echocardiography cannot assess the severity a tricuspid regurgitant jet, thus excluding an assessment of pulmonary hypertension
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
Medical Care: \\
Acute cor pulmonale \\
Cardiopulmonary support for patients experiencing acute cor pulmonale with resultant acute right ventricular failure includes fluid \\
Massive pulmonary embolism administration of thrombolytic agents or surgical embolectomy, \\
Chronic cor pulmonale \\
Oxygen therapy, diuretics, vasodilators, digitalis, theophylline, and anticoagulation therapy are all different modalities used in the long-term management of chronic cor pulmonale. \\
1.Oxygen therapy \\
Esp. underlying COPD. With cor pulmonale, the partial pressure of oxygen ( $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ) is likely to be below 55 mm Hg and decreases further with exercise and during sleep. \\
Oxygen therapy relieves hypoxemic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which then improves cardiac output, lessens sympathetic vasoconstriction, alleviates tissue hypoxemia, and improves renal perfusion. \\
2.Diuretics \\
Management of chronic cor pulmonale, particularly when the right ventricular filling volume is markedly elevated. Diuretics may result in improvement of the function of both the right and left ventricles \\
Excessive volume depletion can lead to decline in cardiac output. Another potential complication of diuresis is the production of a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which diminishes the effectiveness of carbon dioxide stimulation on the respiratory centers and lessens ventilatory drive. \\
3.Vasodilator drugs \\
Management of chronic cor pulmonale with modest results. \\
Calcium channel blockers, particularly oral sustainedrelease nifedipine and diltiazem, can lower pulmonary pressures, although they appear more effective in primary rather than secondary pulmonary hypertension. \\
4.Digoxin \\
Shown to be beneficial in patients with associated atrial fibrillation due to atrial enlargement. \\
5.Theophylline \\
Reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressures acutely in patients with chronic cor pulmonale secondary to COPD. \\
Theophylline has a weak inotropic effect and thus may improve right and left ventricular ejection. As a result, considering the use of theophylline as adjunctive therapy in the management of chronic or decompensated cor pulmonale is reasonable in patients with underlying COPD. \\
6.Anticoagulation eg Warfarin \\
Anticoagulation therapy may be used in patients with cor pulmonale secondary to thromboembolic phenomena and with underlying primary pulmonary arterial hypertension
