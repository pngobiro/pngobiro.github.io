CONGENITAL HEART DISEASES II (DICTATED NOTES)

\section*{HISTORY TAKING}
- Take the maternal and intra-partum history
- Exposure of mother to teratogens
- Anything that interferes with placental blood flow will cause congenital malformations
- Polyhydramnios or Oligohydramnios
- Predispose to congenital heart malformations
- Severe High Fever in the first three months of pregnancy
- Predisposition to lesions that obstruct the flow of blood e.g. pulmonary stenosis
- Infections in the first trimester e.g. TORCHEs
- Characteristic heart malformations
- In Rubella infection there is a high likelihood for development of Pulmonary Stenosis and PDA.

\section*{CONT.}
- Gestational Diabetes or uncontrolled blood sugar
- Predisposition to Transposition of the Great Arteries and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- The neonates have very high birth weights e.g. 4kg
- SLE
- Predisposition to congenital bradycardia or complete heart block
- Severe PET
- Affects blood flow through the placenta
- Epilepsy and Anti-epileptic drugs
- Predisposition to pulmonary stenosis

\section*{CONT.}
- Post-partum
- Infants with congenital heart malformations tend to have low APGAR scores.
- Affected infants also have intra-uterine growth retardation and are therefore usually small for age; probe for weight at birth.
- Query for normal activities like crying, feeding, passing stool etc.
- Affected infants have feeding difficulties (they get tired, sweaty, cyanotic or even have DIB as they feed thus they stop feeding)
- They have poor growth
- They have delayed developmental milestones
- DIB worsened by scanty feeding is common in affected children.

\section*{CONT.}
- In childhood:
- Chest pains, DIB and syncope on exertion
- Easy fatigability
- Squatting back in tetralogy of Fallot (Fallot's sign in Fallot spells)
- Body swelling

CONT.
- Family history
- Cardiac disease in the siblings and the extended family
- Consanguinity

\section*{EXAMINATION}
- General examination
- General impression
- Lethargic and withdrawn
- Pallor or plethoric
- Plethora is seen in Superior Vena Cava obstruction
- Jaundice
- Predisposition to infective endocarditis
- Edema
- Cyanosis
- Finger clubbing
- Nutritional state
- Wasted; small for age (Septal Defects, severe obstruction of flow)

\section*{CONT.}
- CVS examination
- Pulses
- Rate - tachycardia
- In Coarctation of the aorta there is radio-femoral delay
- Volume - low volume pulse in obstructive malformations; high volume pulse in PDA
- Blood Pressure

\section*{CONT.}
- Precordium (the left side of the chest EXCEPT in Dextro-cardia).
- Inspection
- Shape and obvious bulges; pigeon chest (increased anterior diameter); barrel chest (increased lateral diameter); hyperactive precordium; sternotomy scars (open heart surgery); thoracotomy scars; traditional therapeutic marks/scars; chest motion with respiration.
- Palpate
- Apex beat (the point of maximum, outer-most, lower-most cardiac activity)
- Heaving apex
- Parasternal heave
- Thrill (palpable murmur)
- Percussion

\section*{CONT.}
- Auscultation
- Heart sounds
- Especially S2 which is normal in VSD; it is increased in Eisenmenger syndrome (pulmonary HTN), Tetralogy of Fallot and Transposition of the Great Arteries; it is inaudible in pulmonary stenosis; It is split in ASD.
- *Distinguish Eisenmenger syndrome from Eisenmenger complex

\section*{CONT.}
- Murmurs
- Systolic murmur (from S1 to S2)
- With the same intensity - pansystolic/holosystolic murmur - seen in VSD
- Increases with intensity then disappears at the ends (diamond-shaped; crescendo-decrescendo) - Ejection Systolic Murmur - seen in Pulmonary stenosis, Aortic stenosis (left sternal border); low volume pulses.
- Diastolic murmur (from S2 to S1)
- Continuous murmur (from S1 through S2 and back to S1)
- Seen in PDA; in the left upper sternal border; associated with high volume pulses

CONT.
- Abdominal Examination
- Hepatomegaly
- Respiratory Examination

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
- ECG
- Echocardiography
- Cardiac catheterization
