\section*{HYPERTENSION $7^{\text {TH }}$ JOINT NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON HYPERTNSION}

Need for JNC 7
(1) publication of many new hypertension observational studies and clinical trials
(2) need for a new, clear, and concise guideline that would be useful for clinicians
(3) need to simplify the classification of blood pressure
(4) clear recognition that the JNC reports were not being used to their maximum benefit

\section*{Classification of Hypertension}
-Classification of BP for adults ages 18 and older.
-The classification is based on the average of two or more properly measured seated BP readings on each of two or more office visits.

\section*{Cardiovascular disease risk}
-As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension increases unless broad and effective preventive measures are implemented.
-Individuals who are normotensive at age 55 have a 90 percent lifetime risk for developing hypertension.
-The relationship between BP and risk of CVD events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors.
The higher the BP, the greater is the chance
$\checkmark$ Heart attack
$\checkmark$ Heart failure
$\checkmark$ Stroke
$\checkmark$ Kidney disease.
-For individuals 40-70 years of age, across the entire BP range from $115 / 75$ to $185 / 115 \mathrm{mmHg}$ each increment of 20 mmHg SBP or 10 mmHg in DBP doubles the risk of CVD.
-The classification "prehypertension,", recognizes this relationship and signals the need for increased education of health care professionals and the public to reduce BP levels and prevent the development of hypertension in the general population.
Hypertension prevention strategies are available to achieve this eg Lifestyle Modifications

\section*{Benefits of lowering the Blood pressure}
-Antihypertensive therapy has been associated with reductions
- stroke incidence by 35-40\%
- myocardial infarction $20-25 \%$

\section*{Blood pressure control rates}
-Goal blood pressure treatment in hypertension is BP below $140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or below $130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$ for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
-In the majority of patients, controlling systolic hypertension has been considerably more difficult than controlling diastolic hypertension.
-Systolic hypertension is a more important CVD risk factor than DBP except in patients younger than age 50 years. It also occurs much more commonly in older persons.
-Effective BP control can be achieved in most patients who are hypertensive, but the majority will require two or more antihypertensive drugs.
-Challenges in BP control
- Patient compliance to drug intake
- clinicians fail to prescribe lifestyle modifications
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug doses
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug combinations
Accurate blood pressure measurement in the office
-The auscultatory method of BP measurement with a properly calibrated and validated instrument should be used.
-Persons should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair (rather than on an exam table), with feet on the floor, and arm supported at heart level.
-Measurement of BP in the standing position is indicated periodically, especially in those at risk for postural hypotension.
-An appropriate-sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80 percent of the arm) should be used to ensure accuracy. -At least two measurements should be made. SBP is the point at which the first of two or more sounds is heard phase 1), and DBP is the point before the disappearance of sounds (phase 5).
-Clinicians should provide to patients, verbally and in writing, their specific BP numbers and BP goals.

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION \\
Goals of Therapy \\
The ultimate public health goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. \\
Since most persons with hypertension, especially those age >50 years, will reach the DBP goal once SBP is at goal, the primary focus should be on achieving the SBP goal. \\
Treating SBP and DBP to targets that are $<140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ is associated with a decrease in CVD complications. \\
In patients with hypertension and diabetes or renal disease the BP goal is $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$

\section*{SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS}

\section*{Ischemic Heart Disease}
-Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common form of target organ damage associated with hypertension.
-In patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris, the first drug of choice is usually a BB; alternatively, long-acting CCBs can be used.
-In patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), hypertension should be treated initially with BBs and ACEIs, with addition of other drugs as needed for BP control.
-In patients with postmyocardial infarction, ACEIs, BBs, and aldosterone antagonists have proven to be most beneficial.
-Intensive lipid management and aspirin therapy are also indicated.

\section*{Heart Failure}
-Heart failure (HF), in the form of systolic or diastolic ventricular dysfunction, results primarily from systolic hypertension and IHD.
-Fastidious BP and cholesterol control are the primary preventive measures for those at high risk for HF. In asymptomatic individuals with demonstrable ventricular dysfunction, ACEIs and BBs are recommended.
-For those with symptomatic ventricular dysfunction or end-stage heart disease, ACEIs, BBs, ARBs and aldosterone blockers are recommended along with loop diuretics.

\section*{Diabetic Hypertension}
-Combinations of two or more drugs are usually needed to achieve the target goal of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
-Thiazide diuretics, BBs, ACEIs, ARBs, and CCBs are beneficial in reducing CVD and stroke incidence in patients with diabetes.
ACEI- or ARB-based treatments favorably affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy and reduce albuminuria and ARBs have been shown to reduce progression to macroalbuminuria.

\section*{Chronic Kidney Disease}

In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by either
(1) reduced excretory function with an estimated GFR below $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per 1.73 m 2 (corresponding approximately to a creatinine of $>1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $>1.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women)
(2) the presence of albuminuria ( $>300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day or 200 mg albumin/g creatinine), therapeutic goals are to slow deterioration of renal function and prevent CVD.
Hypertension appears in the majority of these patients, and they should receive aggressive BP management, often with three or more drugs to reach target BP values of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
ACEIs and ARBs have demonstrated favorable effects on the progression of diabetic and non diabetic renal disease. A limited rise in serum creatinine of as much as 35 percent above baseline with ACEIs or ARBs is acceptable and is not a reason to withhold treatment unless
-With advanced renal disease (estimated GFR $<30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ 1.73 m 2 , corresponding to a serum creatinine of $2.5-3$ mg/dL), increasing doses of loop diuretics are usually needed in combination with other drug classes.

\section*{Cerebrovascular Disease}

The risks and benefits of acute lowering of BP during an acute stroke are still unclear; control of BP at intermediate levels (approximately $160 / 100 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ) is appropriate until the condition has stabilized or improved.
-Recurrent stroke rates are lowered by the combination of an ACEI and thiazide-type diuretic

\section*{Obesity and the metabolic syndrome}

Obesity (BMI $>30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ ) is an increasingly prevalent risk factor for the development of hypertension and CVD. Metabolic syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following conditions:
1) Abdominal obesity (waist circumference $>40$ inches in men or $>35$ inches in women)
2) Glucose intolerance (fasting glucose >110 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
3) $\mathrm{BP}>130 / 85 \mathrm{mmHg}$
4) High triglycerides ( $>150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) or low HDL ( $<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $<50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women).
Intensive lifestyle modification should be pursued in all individuals with the metabolic syndrome, and appropriate drug therapy should be instituted for each of its components as indicated.

\section*{Left ventricular hypertrophy}

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor that increases the risk of subsequent CVD. Regression of LVH occurs with aggressive BP management, including weight loss, sodium restriction, and treatment with all classes of antihypertensive agents except the direct vasodilators hydralazine, and minoxidil.

\section*{Peripheral arterial disease}

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is equivalent in risk to IHD. Any class of antihypertensive drugs can be used in most PAD patients. Other risk factors should be managed aggressively, and aspirin should be used.

\section*{Postural hypotension}

A decrease in standing SBP $>10 \mathrm{mmHg}$, when associated with dizziness or fainting, is more frequent in older patients with systolic hypertension, diabetes, and those taking diuretics, venodilators (e.g., nitrates, alphablockers, and sildenafil like drugs), and some psychotropic drugs.
BP in these individuals should also be monitored in the upright position. Caution should be used to avoid volume depletion and excessively rapid dose titration of antihypertensive drugs.
hyperkalemia develops.

\section*{Hypertension in women}

Oral contraceptives may increase BP, and the risk of hypertension increases with duration of use.
Women taking oral contraceptives should have their BP checked regularly. Development of hypertension is a reason to consider other forms of contraception. In contrast, menopausal hormone therapy does not raise BP .
Women with hypertension who become pregnant should be followed carefully because of increased risks to mother and fetus.
-Methyldopa, BBs, and vasodilators are preferred medications for the safety of the fetus.
-ACEI and ARBs should not be used during pregnancy because of the potential for fetal defects and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant. -Preeclampsia, which occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy, is characterized by new-onset or worsening hypertension, albuminuria, and hyperuricemia ,sometimes with coagulation abnormalities.
-In some patients, preeclampsia may develop into a hypertensive urgency or emergency and may require hospitalization, intensive monitoring, early fetal delivery, and parenteral antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapy

\section*{Potential favorable effects of anti-hypertensives}
-Thiazide-type diuretics are useful in slowing demineralization in osteoporosis.
-BBs can be useful in the treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias/ fibrillation, migraine, thyrotoxicosis (short term), essential tremor, or perioperative hypertension.
-CCBs may be useful in Raynaud's syndrome and certain arrhythmias,
- Alpha-blockers may be useful in prostatism.

\section*{Potential unfavorable effects}
-Thiazide diuretics should be used cautiously in patients who have gout or who have a history of significant hyponatremia.
-BBs should generally be avoided in individuals who have asthma, reactive airways disease, or second or third degree heart block.
- ACEIs and ARBs should not be given to women likely to become pregnant and are contraindicated in those who are.
-ACEIs should not be used in individuals with a history of angioedema.
-Aldosterone antagonists and potassium-sparing diuretics can cause hyperkalemia and should generally be avoided in patients who have serum potassium values more than $5.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ while not taking medications.

\section*{Resistant Hypertension}

Resistant hypertension is the failure to reach goal BP in patients who are adhering to full doses of an appropriate three-drug regimen that includes a diuretic.

\section*{Causes}
1.Improper BP Measurement
2. Identifiable Causes of Hypertension.
3.Volume Overload and Pseudo tolerance
- Excess sodium intake
- Volume retention from kidney disease
- Inadequate diuretic therapy
4.Drug-Induced or Other Causes
- Non adherence
- Inadequate doses
- Inappropriate combinations
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cyclooxygenase

2 inhibitors
- Cocaine, amphetamines, other illicit drugs
- Sympathomimetics (decongestants, anorectics)
- Oral contraceptives
- Adrenal steroids
- Cyclosporine and tacrolimus
- Erythropoietin
- Licorice (including some chewing tobacco)
- Selected over-the-counter dietary supplements and medicines
(e.g., ephedra, ma haung, bitter orange)
5.Associated Conditions
- Obesity
- Excess alcohol intake
