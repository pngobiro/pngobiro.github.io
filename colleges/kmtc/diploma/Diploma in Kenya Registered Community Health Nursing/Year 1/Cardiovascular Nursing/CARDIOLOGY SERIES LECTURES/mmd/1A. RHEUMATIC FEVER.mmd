- Investigations
- Diagnosis
- Management

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- A multisystemic inflammatory disorder that typically develops after an episode of streptococcal pharyngitis.Does not follow infection by strep at other sites
- Presents with variety of symptoms affecting Heart,CNS,Skin and Joints
- Symptoms occur $2-3 \mathrm{wks}$ after initial attack of strep pharyngitis.
- Usually affects children, young adults peak 5-16yrs

\section*{Introd - cont}
- Recurrence is high unless prevention is instituted
- Main associated risk factor is crowding, hence a dz of low social economic popn groups.Rare in the west, common in dev countries
- 3\% of untreated strep pharyngitis will dev RF.
- Determined by serotypes of the group A strep present in the popn

\section*{PATOGENESIS}
- Exact mechanism unclear.
- Previously thought to be due to the direct action of the bacteria, or toxic effects of extra cellular products
- Now widely known to be an abnormal, or dysfunctional immune response to an extra cellular antigen prod by bacteria

\section*{Path - Cont}
- Toxicity due to antigenic mimicry
- Similarity betwn carbohydrate of bact cell wall \& glycoprotein of the tissues affected, or other molecular similarity betwn the bact and the tissue cell membrane
- The streptococcal bacterial cell wall has 'M' proteins, that are highly antigenic

\section*{Path - cont}
- A/bodies produced cross-react with cardiac myofibre protein myosin, smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release that causes tissue destruction.
- Inflammn occurs thro' direct attachment of complement and fc receptor mediated recruitment of MQ and Neutophills

\section*{Path -Cont}
- Profound morbidity results from affliction of the heart due to repeated inflammation alternating with fibrinous resolution
- Cardinal anatomical changes of the Heart valves include thickenning,fussion.shotenning of the tendinous cords - RHD

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Presents with variety of symptoms that may include :
- Fever,
- anorexia,
- lethargy and
- joint pains,
- skin rashes, subcutaneous nodules
- CVS symptoms
- neurological manifestations

\section*{(1) CVS}
- Pancarditis - endocarditis,myocarditis,pericarditis
- Key and frequent manifestation of RF
- May present as Chest pain,palpitations,Breathlessness,tarchycardia,,Mitral/ aortic regurgitation,cardiomegally,CCF
- Other hazards include embolization,Infective endocarditis

\section*{(2) CNS manifestations}
- Occurs in $10 \%$ of the patients
- Usually a late manifestation. Latent period varies. May occur 3mths after episode of RF,or even several decades later.
- Chorea, speech abnormalities
- Pts should be given prophylaxis to prevent further attacks

\section*{(3) Migratory Polyarthritis}
- Early feature
- Associated with high titres of strep antibodies
- Present in $75 \%$ of pts
- Characterized by acute,painful,assymetric and migratory inflammation of large joints (knees,elbow,wrist,ankle)
- Does not affect small joints of the hands,feet
- Joints are affected in quick succession

\section*{(4) Subcutaneous nodules}
- Rare,occurs in 10\% of cases
- Nodules found on extensor surfaces of joints, over bone tendons
- Firm,painless
- Seen in pts with longstanding RHD

\section*{(5) Erythema marginatum}
- An uncommon manifestation
- Characterized by macular eruptions with rounded borders, usually concentrated on the trunk

\section*{INVESTIGATIONS}
- Lab : - Full Haemogram ,ESR,CRP
- Throat swab culture for gp A B-hemolytic Strep
- ASO titres,levels >200u(adults) ,>300 Children
- CXR: cardiomegally,pulmonary congestion
- ECG: prolonged QRS interval, heart block
- Echocardiography: Cardiac dilatation,valve abnormalities

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Involves clinical assessment and Lab Investigations
- Clinical dx - utilizes the modified Jones criteria (after Duckett Jones, pub 1944)
- Makes use of major and minor criteria, plus evidence of a recent strep infection ( i.e. recovery of the organism on culture and antistreptolysin o antibodies)

\section*{Cont - Major criteria}
- Carditis
- Migratory Polyarthritis
- Chorea
- Subcutaneous nodules
- Erythema maginatum

\section*{Dx Cont - Minor criteria}
- Fever
- Arthralgia
- Lab

Acute phase reactants, raised ESR,leucocytosis,
- Prolonged PR interval

\section*{Dx - cont}

\section*{Diagnosis made based on}
- 2 or one major criteria, plus
- 2 minor criteria
- plus evidence of previous strep infection

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Approach
Tx geared towards
(i) Reduction of inflammation,
(ii) Tx of +ve throat infection,
(iii) Prophylaxis with cont use of low dose antibiotics
(iv) Mx of the resulting complications

\section*{Mx - Cont}
- Infection during acute attack

Use of Benzyl Penicillin 1.2 mu i.m q6h fr 10days,Erythromycin
For individuals with +ve throat culture.
- A/biotics will not alter the course of established disease
- Prevention is by eradication of acute infection, and prophylaxis cont for 10yrs.Screening School Children

\section*{Mx-Cont}
- Prophylaxis Benzyl Penicillin1.2mu i.m monthly,
- Bedrest,surpportive therapy, duration guided by symp \& markers of inflammation

\section*{Mx - Cont}
- Inflammation

Use of NSAIDS.ASA relieves symp rapidly. $60-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day in divided doses
- Severe symptoms of carditis and arthritis may require Corticosteroids, give Predisolone $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} /$ day in divided doses..

\section*{Mx - Cont}
- Heart Failure

Digoxin,Diuretics,Corticosteroids (response is usually satisfactory)
- Valve replacement if does not respond to med tx
