\section*{INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS Definition}

Infective endocarditis is defined as a microbial colonization of the inner lining of the heart.
-Can involve valves, the mural endocardium, or a septal defect.
-The prototypic lesion is vegetation-is a mass of platelets, fibrin, microcolonies of microorganisms, and scant inflammatory cells.
-Endocarditis can be classified as:
a) Native valve (acute and subacute) endocarditis
b) Prosthetic valve (early and late) endocarditis
c) Endocarditis related to intravenous drug use

Native valve endocarditis (acute and subacute)
-Native valve acute endocarditis usually has an aggressive course.
-Virulent organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and group B streptococci
-Underlying structural valve disease may not be present.
-Sub acute endocarditis usually has a more indolent course than the acute form.
-Alpha-hemolytic streptococci or enterococci, usually in the setting of underlying structural valve disease, typically are the causative agents of this type of endocarditis.
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (early and late)
-Early prosthetic valve endocarditis occurs within 60 days of valve implantation. Staphylococci aureus and epidermidis, gram-negative bacilli, and Candida species are the common infecting organisms.
-Late prosthetic valve endocarditis occurs 60 days or more after valve implantation. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, and staphylococci are the common causative organisms.
Endocarditis related to intravenous drug use
-Endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers commonly involves the tricuspid valve.
-S. aureus is the most common causative organism.
-Fungal colonization's also common eg Candida albicans.
Acute endocarditis is a hectically febrile illness, rapidly damages cardiac structures, hematogenously seeds extracardiac sites, and, if untreated, progresses to death within weeks.
Subacute endocarditis follows an indolent course; causes structural cardiac damage only slowly, if at all; rarely causes metastatic infection; and is gradually progressive unless complicated by a major embolic event or ruptured mycotic aneurysm.
Pathophysiology: Occur by-
1.Formation of thrombi on endocardium
2. Bacteremia (nosocomial or spontaneous) that delivers the organisms to the valve's surface
3.Adherence of the organisms
4.Eventual invasion of the valvular leaflets
-Infective endocarditis generally occurs as a consequence of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, which results from turbulence or trauma to the endothelial surface of the heart.
-Transient bacteremia then leads to seeding of lesions with adherent bacteria, and infective endocarditis develops.
4-Petechiae-Common but nonspecifie finding
-Pathologic effects due to infection can include local tissue destruction and embolic phenomena.
-In addition, secondary autoimmune effects, such as immune complex glomerulonephritis and vasculitis, can occur
-In acute IE, the thrombus may be produced by the invading organism (i.e., $S$ aureus) or by valvular trauma from intravenous catheters or pacing wires (i.e., NIE). $S$ aureus can invade the endothelial cells (endotheliosis) and increase the expression of adhesion molecules and of procoagulant activity on the cellular surface.
-Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis may result from stress, renal failure, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, or neoplasia.
-IE develops most commonly on the mitral valve, closely followed in descending order of frequency by the aortic valve, the combined mitral and aortic valve, the tricuspid valve, and, rarely, the pulmonic valve.
-Mechanical prosthetic and bioprosthetic valves exhibit equal rates of infection.
-The microorganisms that most commonly produce endocarditis (ie, S aureus; S viridans; group A, C, and G streptococci; enterococci) resist the bactericidal action of complement and possess fibronectin receptors for the surface of the fibrin-platelet thrombus.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

History- Highly variable
-Constitutional - Fever and chills are the most common symptoms
-Others- Anorexia, weight loss, malaise, headache, myalgias, night sweats, shortness of breath, cough, or joint pains are common complaints
-Symptoms may be due to primary cardiac effects or secondary embolic phenomena.
-Primary cardiac disease may present with signs of CCF
-Secondary phenomena -Focal neurologic complaints due to an embolic stroke or back pain associated with vertebral osteomyelitis.
-As many as 20\% of cases present with focal neurologic complaints and stroke syndromes.
-Dyspnea, cough, and chest pain are common complaints of intravenous drug users.
-This is likely related to the predominance of tricuspid valve endocarditis in this group and secondary embolic showering of the pulmonary vasculature.

\section*{Physical:}

1-Mild-moderate Pallor
2-Fever, possibly low-grade and intermittent, is present in $90 \%$ of patients.
3 Heart
-Heart murmurs -esp. Change in the characteristics of a previously noted murmur occurs
-Gallop rhythm.
-Signs of CCF, frequently are due to acute left-sided valvular insufficiency
- Distended neck veins
- Rales
- Cardiac arrhythmia-Pulse irregularity
- Pericardial rub
- Pleural friction rub
