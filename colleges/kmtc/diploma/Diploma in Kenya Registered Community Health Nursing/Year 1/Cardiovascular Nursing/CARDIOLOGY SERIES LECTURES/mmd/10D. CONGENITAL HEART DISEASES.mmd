Congenital heart disease

\section*{$4^{\text {th }}$ year}

\section*{Congenital heart disease continuation}
- Present from birth
- CHD- Most common form at $0.8 \%$ of all live births
- An end point of a disorder in the process by which the heart and the great vessels develop
- Requires an understanding of normal and abnormal cardiovascular development
- An interaction of genes, environment and chance
- When a newborn with significant cyanosis is first seen, they are often placed in supplemental oxygen. In cases of lung disease this often will improve the oxygen levels, but in cardiac problems such as transposition there will be little effect on the child's oxygen levels.

\section*{Patent ductus arterious}
- A normal fetal structure shunting blood from the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta, closing hours after birth with the onset of breathing. After birth its persistence equals congenital heart disease
- Common in prematures, the female sex and rubella
- Shunts left to right. If small, growth normal. Large ducts cause failure to thrive recurrent chest infections, heart failure and pulmonary over circulation.
- Treatment- premature- indomethacin or brufen. Older children- thoracotomy and surgical ligation.
- Percutaneous device embolization

\section*{Echocardiogram PDA}

\section*{PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS}
- Obstruction to blood flow at the level of the pulmonary valve after leaving the right ventricle(Right ventricular outflow tract-RVOT)
- $10 \%$ of CHD. Common in Noonan syndrome
- Varies from mild to severe obstruction
- Growth and development normal in mild to moderate PS
- Low volume pulses, right parasternal heave, soft second heart sound, ejection systolic murmur left upper sternal border
- Treatment - Catheter - percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty

\section*{Aortic stenosis}
- In children is usually congenital
- $5 \%$ of CHD. Common in male ( $3: 1$ )
- Varies from mild to severe stenosis
- Low volume pulses. Forceful apex, ejection systolic murmur left upper sternal border radiating to neck.
- ECG -LVH, echo- severity and type of AS
- Treatment -moderate to severepercutaneous valvuloplasty or OHS ,surgical replacement

\section*{Coarctation of aorta}
- Constriction of aorta usually at origin of the ductus
- Seen in Turners syndrome
- Disparity in upper and lower pulse volumes. Hypertension in upper part of body, lower pulses lower body.
- In neonates can present with CCF
- Treatment by surgical resection and anastomosis

\section*{Tetralogy of Fallot}
- Commonest cyanotic congenital heart disease
- Four components- VSD, Pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy
- Right to left shunting
- Pulmonary stenosis also infundibular (Muscular) and can constrict further reducing flow to lungs causing intense cyanosis( hypoxic spell)
- Cyanosis not present at birth , increases with age.
- Present with dyspnoe, squatting and blue (hypoxic) spells
- Low volume pulses, finger clubbing, parasternal heave, single loud second heart sound and ejection systolic murmur right sternal border
- CXR- Boot shaped heart, reduced pulmonary vascular markings
- ECG - RAD, RVH.
- Echo- large VSD, infundibular PS, overriding aorta and RVH
- Treatment- medical management of hypoxic spell
- Surgical - OHS : relief of RVOT obstruction and closure of VSD

\section*{Cardiac catheterization in TOF}

\section*{Hypoxic spells}
- Intermittent episodes of extreme cyanosis
- Can be fatal
- Caused by increased infundibular stenosis aggravated by fever, crying, dehydration, cold and stress. Associated with iron deficiency
- Increases left to right shunting
- Also seen in tricuspid atresia

\section*{Management of hypoxic spells}
- Prevention and prompt treatment of dehydration. Avoid hemoconcentation- IV fluids -
- Manage fever and attendent tachycardia
- Calm the infant \& place in knee chest position
- Administer oxygen and correct any acidosis
- Morphine $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Intravenous Propranalol $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Intubation and paralysis
- Urgent BT shunt

\section*{TGA}
- Transposition of the great arteries- the aorta arises from the right ventricle and pulmonary artery arises from left ventricle
- Transposition creates a situation where the systemic (to the body) and pulmonary (to the lungs) circulations are in parallel rather than in series.
- Must have a shunt ASD or PDA (duct dependant lesion)
- Keep duct open( prostalgandins) . Early surgical correction- arterial switch operation
- Balloon atrial septostomy- foramen ovale

\section*{TAPVR}
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous return and truncus arteriosus present early with heart failure
- TAPVR has characteristic chest X ray - the snow mans sign

\section*{EBSTEIN ANOMALY.}
- Ebstein's anomaly is a rare disease involving the right side of the heart.
- This disorder occurs when the tricuspid valve, that divides the two chambers of the right side of the heart, does not form correctly.
- Normally, the tricuspid valve separates the right atria and right ventricle. In Ebstein's anomaly, the valve forms too far down in the ventricle. This makes the right ventricle smaller and weaker than normal.
- Often there is also a connection between the left and right atria.
- The tricuspid valve usually has three parts that move freely. In Ebstein's anomaly, one or two parts of the valve get stuck to the walls of the heart and donii $\mathrm{i}^{1 / 2 t}$ move correctly, so blood can leak back in the wrong direction.

\section*{Hypolastic Heart Syndrome.}
- This results in only one side of the heart capable of pumping blood to the body and lungs effectively.
- Hypoplasia of the heart is rare but is the most serious form of CHD. It includes:
1. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
2. Hypoplastic right heart syndrome
- In both conditions, the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (and, when hypoplasia affects the right side of the heart, a patent foramen ovale) is vital to the infant's ability to survive until emergency heart surgery can be performed.
- Hypoplasia of the heart is generally a cyanotic heart defect.

\section*{Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_9c7274c44ab4306d6bbbg-26.jpg?height=1098&width=1971&top_left_y=519&top_left_x=290)
- Below is a list of cardiac lesions that require the Ductus to be kept open:
A) Ductus dependent systemic blood flow
- These are commonly called left sided obstructive lesions. These include a spectrum of hypoplasia of the left sided structures of the heart. These may range from coarctation of the aorta to hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
- These include:
1. Aortic stenosis - Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Coarctation of aorta
3. Interrupted aortic arch
4. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

\section*{B) Ductus Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow}
- This group includes lesions associated with restriction to pulmonary blood flow from significant obstruction to no flow leading to varying degrees of cyanosis and hemodynamic compromise. These include:
1) Critical Pulmonary stenosis
- There is Dysplastic pulmonary valve with obstruction with associated hypoxemia due to $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{L}$ shunt through patient foramen ovale.
2) Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (hypoplastic right heart syndrome)
3) Tricuspid atresia with severe PS.
4) $T O F$
5) Ebstein's anomaly

\section*{C) Parallel circulation}
- TGA with IVS

\section*{Management}
- The mainstay of management of neonates with Ductus dependent congenital heart disease is the early institution of Prostaglandin E1 to maintain ductal patency.
