\section*{Cardiomyopathies}

13 ${ }^{\text {th }}$ February 2013

\section*{Objectives}
- Definition
- List the types of cardiomyopathies
- Describe and understand the pathogenesis

\section*{Definition}
-more than 35 years, the term cardiomyopathies has been used to describe disorders of the heart with particular morphological and physiological characteristics; hypertrophy, restrictive, etc
-Previously was thought to be of unknown origin
-Now described are genetic metabolic and structural abnormalities

\section*{Definition}

A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality

European cardiac society- european heart journal 2007

\section*{Subtypes}

Cardiomyopathies are grouped into specific morphological and functional phenotypes; each phenotype is then sub-classified into familial and non-familial forms
In this context, familial refers to the occurrence, in more than one family member, of either the same disorder or a phenotype that is (or could be) caused by the same genetic mutation and not to acquired

\section*{Types of cardiomyopathies}
- Dilated
- Hypertrophic
- Restrictive
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy

\section*{DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY}
- Accounts for 90\%
- Progressive heart muscle dilatation and hypertrophy- biventricular
- Leads to congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction

\section*{Pathogenesis of DCM}
- Several aetiopathogenic mechanisms have been demonstrated
- Alcohol
- Inflammatory (infections, immunologic, etc)
- Pregnancy - develops at peuperium
- Genetic predisposition- up to 35\%
- A majority are ideopathic

\section*{Pathogenesis of DCM}
- Infections- entero viruses, Cocksackie B- myocarditis demonstrated
- Alcoholism- i)metabolites, e.g acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, etccause direct toxicity
ii) thiamine deficiency leading to Beriberi

\section*{DCM pathogenesis}
- Drugs i) Cytotoxics-e.g Adriamycin ii)HAART-
- Pregnancy -postpartum or peuperiumCM

Thought to be due to nutritional def; volume overload;
hypertension;metabolic derrangments; immunological

\section*{DCM-PATHOGENESIS}
- Genetic- commonly seen in younger patient, below 20years of age; due to autosomal dorminant ; or X-linked autosomal recessive patternt
- Mutions are seen in mitochondrial genes affecting oxidative phosphorylation during glucose metabolism
- X- linked defects are linked to defects in dystrophina cell membrane cytoskeleton important in linking internal cytoskeleton with external basement membrane ; defect seen in Duchene

\section*{Arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/CM}
- Linked to Chr 14 defects
- Mainly right ventricular dilatation with failure; irregular right ventricular myocytes
- Clinically shows arrhythmias- e.g ventricular tarchycardia or braddycardia

\section*{MORPHOLOGY}
- Gross-enlarged heart 2-3x the expected weight, flabby; dilated such that the ventricular thickness may appear normal; mural thrombi common
- Micro- irregular; hypertrophy; irregular; enlarged nuclei; boxed nuclei; subendocardial or perimyocyte fibrosis
- These changes don't correlate with the degree of disease

\section*{DCM CLINICAL PRESENTATION}
- 20-50 years
- Progressive shortness of breath, dyspnoea, orthopnoe-signs of CCF

\title{
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
}
- Aortic outlet obstruction/subaortic
- Caused by hypertension; amyloidosis;

\section*{HCP PATHOGENESIS}
- Defects in in genes that code for proteins that are part of the sarcomere
- Autosomal dorminant with variable penetrance
- Beta-myosin heavy chain gene (BMHC); alphatropomysin etc
- Leads to abnormal, forceful contraction

\section*{morphology}
- Gross-massive heart; left ventricular thickenning; most marked in the interventricluar septum ; free wall:ventricle ratio more that 1:3; mural thrombi
- The ventricle becomes elliptical-ovoid
- Leads to poor diastolic feeling
- Micro- extensive myocyte hypertrophy; irregularity (>40um cf 15um)

\section*{CLINICAL PRESENTATION}
- Mainly exertional dyspnoe due to pulmonary pooling and poor diastolic filling; systolic ejectionb murrmur due to aortic obstruction; anginal pain due to poor perfusion; arrhthmias; sudden death

\section*{Restrictive cardiomyopathy}
- Rare
- Endomyocardial fibrosis- disease of African children; fibrosis with restriction hence poor diastolic feeling; unknown cause
- Loefflers myocarditis- endomyocardial fibrosis- eosinophilia; thought to lead to the inflammation and fibrosis
- Endocardial fibroelastosis-mainly left ventriclular focal submural elastosis; common in infants.

\section*{Myocarditis}
- Read hypersensitivity
- Giant cell type
- Chagas disease-T cruzi
