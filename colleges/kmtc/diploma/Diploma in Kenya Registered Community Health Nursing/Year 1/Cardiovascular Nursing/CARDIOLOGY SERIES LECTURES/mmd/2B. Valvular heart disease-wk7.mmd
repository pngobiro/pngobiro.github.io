\section*{Valvular heart disease (rheumatic and non rheumatic)-wk7 \\ 24/02/2011}

\section*{introduction}
- Rheumatic in nature i.e. VHD, common cause of cardiac disease in the young
- Epidemiology reflect on ARF, under privileged, overcrowding, young age group
- Management unavailable, expensive, complex
- Other causes;
- Congenital
- Degenerative
- Ischemia, inflammation

\section*{RHD}
- AFFECTS LEFT VALVES
- Fibrosis distortion of valvular apparatus
- Stenosis, regurgitation or both
- MV>AV
- Tricuspid also but uncommon
- Almost never pulmonic
- Involvement almost multiple
- Rheumatic fever prophylaxis- long term

\section*{Mitral stenosis}
- Leaflets, where they meet is commissures, chordea tendinae- fibrosis
- Mitral valve area -4-6cm sq 1-2cm significant stenosis, $<1 \mathrm{~cm}$ sq critical stenosis

\title{
pathophysiology
}
- Impaired opening of mitral valve
- Inadequate LA emptying-increased pressure in LA, pulmonary venous congestion-pulmonary HT, right ventricular HT,
- increase size of LA- LA thrombosis, atrial fibrillation
- Inadequate LV filling- low CO

\section*{Clinical symptoms}
- Shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, fatigue
- Palpitation may be at rest
- Cough, hemoptysis
- Orthopnea-dyspnea on lying flat, PND
- Abdominal discomfort ,swelling; large liver
- Signs- mitral facies( darkening of faces), low volume pulse, rapid, irregular, palpable P2( pulmonary of second heart sound-loud), apex not displaced, left Para sternal heave, auscultation( loud first sound, loud $2^{\text {nd }}$, mid diastolic murmur ), features of TR,

\title{
Complication
}
- Heart failure
- Atrial fibrillation
- Thromboembolic phenomena
- Infective endocarditis

\section*{Investigation}
- CXR-chest x ray show LA enlargement, double shadow, widened carina, pulmonary congestion, mitral valve calcification,
- ECG-LA enlargement, right ventricular hypertrophy RAD, atrial fibrillation
- ECHO-

\section*{management}
- Limited
- Diuretics
- no role for usual heart failure medicines
- Surgical definitive, valvotomy- closed, open, valvular replacement

\title{
Mitral regurgitation
}
- Abnormality in leaflets, annulus, chordea, papillary muscles
- predominantly rheumatic, degenerative, ischemic, ventricular dilation, inflammatory endocarditis

\title{
pathogenesis
}
- Fibrosis
- Distortion of leaflets, chordea
- rupture

\title{
pathophysiology
}
- Increased SV to accommodate regurgitation volume
- Volume overload thus eccentric hypertrophy( dilatation)
- Enlargement of LA

\section*{clinical features}
- Slow/ insidious
- Patient may be asymptomatic
- Onset depends on complication development
- Pulmonary HT, atrial fibrillation and precipitation factors
- Signs- normal or large volume pulse, apex displaced ,heaving, apical pan systolic murmur, $1^{\text {st }}$ sound is soft

\section*{complication}
- Heart failure
- Infective endocarditis
- Atrial fibrillation

\section*{investigation}
- CXR- Cardiomegaly, Pulmonary congestion
- ECG-LA enlargement, Left ventricular hypertrophy, Atrial fibrillation
- ECHO- morphology, quantify the extent of regurgitation, secondary changes

\section*{Aortic stenosis}
- CUSPS damage, infra/supra valvular stenosis may occur
- Etiology- young adults, predominantly RHD usually with MVD, children congenital

\title{
pathophysiology
}
- Obstruction to LV, emptying, pressure overload, marked concentric hypertrophy, increased oxygen demand of myocardium( LV mass), elevated LV diastolic pressure( diastolic failure)

\section*{symptoms}
- Longer latent period, super vene, rapid progression
- Shortness of breath due to elevated diastolic pressure
- Classical triad;
- dyspnea,
- angina,
- syncope
- Sudden death( ventricular arrhythmias)
- Signs-low volume pulse, apex not displaced, injection systolic murmur radiates to carotid artery

\title{
complication
}
- LV failure
- Arrhythmias -ventricular
- Infective endocarditis
investigation
- CXR- may be normal, calcification, post stenotic dilatation
- ECG- marked left ventricle hypertrophy
- ECHO-

\section*{management}
- Medical, limited, cautious diuretics
- Complication management
- Surgical definitive

\title{
management
}
- Pharmacological
- Complication
- Surgery definitive

\title{
Aortic regurgitation
}
- Valve cusps-main mechanism of rheumatic
- Cusps are unable to close
- Etiology-
- congenital
- Acquired-rheumatic, syphilis, dissecting aneurysm in ascending aorta, inflammatory disorders, Degenerative lesion- of the vessel

\section*{pathophysiology}
- Hyper dynamic circulation-
- Massive eccentric hypertrophy ( dilatation)
- Enlargement of LV
- Regurgitation volume overload
- Unlike MR entire ejection into high pressure area> more LV wall stress thus severe dilatation

\section*{Clinical features}
- Symptoms- long latency
- Features of hyper dynamic state- pounding in the chest, head, palpitations
- Signs of hyper dynamic state- large volume, collapsing pulse, Corrigan's sign- large pulsation of carotid, wide pulse pressure( systolic and diastolic pressure wide difference), pistol shots ( traube's)- femoral artery murmur, duroziez's sign, quincke's, de Musset's sign - nodding of head

\section*{Signs Cntd..}
- Soft $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ sound
- Diastolic murmur(early) heard in LSE 3rd $4^{\text {th }}$ ICS
- Ejection systolic murmur -aortic
- Apical mid diastolic murmur( Austin Flint)
investigation
- ECG-LV hypertrophy, ST segment , T wave changes
- CXR-massive cardiomegaly
- ECHO-morphology, quantification

\title{
management
}
- Limited
- Surgical is definitive

\section*{Tricuspid stenosis}
- Predominantly rheumatic
- Usually occur together with MS,
- pathophysiology- RV-RA gradient, elevated RA pressure -systemic venous congestion

\section*{symptoms}
- Low out put-fatigue
- Systemic congestion-abdominal swelling, and discomfort, leg edema, fluttering in the neck
- Absence of chest symptoms- even with MS, no ventricular output thus no chest congestion to present with the chest symptoms
- Signs- prominent a wave, no feature of PHT, RVH and clear lung fields in MS
- Lower sternal edge opening snap, MDM increased in inspiration
investigation
- CXR-cardiomegaly, RA enlargement with clear lung fields
- ECG- RAH, biatrial hypertrophy with no RVH
- ECHO-diagnostic,

\title{
management
}
- Medical- sodium restriction, diuretics
- surgical

Tricuspid regurgitation
- Due too RV annular dilatation secondary to PHT, right ventricular dilatation ,others, rheumatic, congenital ,inflammatory, carcinoid syndrome
- Pathophysiology- volume overload, primary pathology especially PHT

\section*{clinically}
- Well tolerated in absence of PHT, with is RV failure-
Low CO, systemic venous congestion
Cachexia, pulsatile liver, ascites, elevated JVP with prominent V wave, left parasternal heave, lower lever sternal E thrill, LLSE parasternal murmur, Loud P2

\section*{investigation}
- ECG- RV hypertrophy, primary pathology
- ECHO-morphology, quantification,
- CXR-cardiomegaly due to RVH

\title{
management
}
- Primary condition treatment
- Diuretics
- Surgical- annuloplasty, valve replacement

\title{
Pulmonary valve
}
- Stenosis always almost congenital
- Regurgitation- secondary to PHT
