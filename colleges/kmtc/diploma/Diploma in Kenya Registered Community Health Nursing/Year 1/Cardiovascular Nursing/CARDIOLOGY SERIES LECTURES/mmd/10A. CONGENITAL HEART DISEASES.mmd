- Requires an understanding of normal and abnormal cardiovascular development
- An interaction of genes, environment and chance

\section*{ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT}
- Defects associated with left to right shunting across the atrial septum
- Assymptomatic in infancy
- Examination requires special attention to the heart sounds -wide fixed splitting of second heart sound
- Cardiomegaly on chest Xray, ECG- RAD. RVH, Echo- gap in the atrial septum
- Treatment- OHS-Patch closure of ASD
- Interventional catheterization -Device embolization

\section*{Patent ductus arterious}
- A normal fetal structure shunting blood from the main pulmonary artery to the descending aorta, closing hours after birth with the onset of breathing. After birth its persistence equals congenital heart disease
- Common in prematures, the female sex and rubella
- Shunts left to right. If small, growth normal. Large ducts cause failure to thrive recurrent chest infections, heart failure and pulmonary over circulation.
- Treatment- premature- indomethacin or brufen. Older children- thoracotomy and surgical ligation.
- Percutaneous device embolization

\section*{PULMONARY VALVE STENOSIS}
- Obstruction to blood flow at the level of the pulmonary valve after leaving the right ventricle-(Right ventricular outflow tract-RVOT)
- $10 \%$ of CHD. Common in Noonan syndrome
- Varies from mild to severe obstruction
- Growth and development normal in mild to moderate PS
- Low volume pulses, right parasternal heave, soft second heart sound, ejection systolic murmur left upper sternal border
- Treatment - Catheter - percutaneous pulmonary valvuloplasty

\section*{Aortic stenosis}
- In children is usually congenital
- $5 \%$ of CHD. Common in male ( $3: 1$ )
- Varies from mild to severe stenosis
- Low volume pulses. Forceful apex, ejection systolic murmur left upper sternaj border radiating to neck.
- ECG -LVH, echo- severity and type of AS
- Treatment -moderate to severe-percutaneous valvuloplasty or OHS ,surgical replacement

\section*{Coarctation of aorta}
- Constriction of aorta usually at origin of the ductus
- Seen in Turners syndrome
- Disparity in upper and lower pulse volumes. Hypertension in upper part of body, lower pulses lower body.
- In neonates can present with CCF
- Treatment by surgical resection and anastomosis

\section*{Tetralogy of Fallot}
- Commonest cyanotic congenital heart disease
- Four components-VSD, Pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, right ventricular hypertrophy
- Right to left shunting
- Pulmonary stenosis also infundibular (Muscular) and can constrict further reducing flow to lungs causing intense cyanosis( hypoxic spell)
- Cyanosis not present at birth , increases with age.
- Present with dyspnoe, squatting and blue (hypoxic) spells
- Low volume pulses, finger clubbing, parasternal heave, single loud second heart sound and ejection systolic murmur right sternal border
- CXR- Boot shaped heart, reduced pulmonary vascular markings
- ECG-RAD, RVH.
- Echo- large VSD, infundibular PS, overriding aorta and RVH
- Treatment- medical management of hypoxic spell
- Surgical-OHS : relief of RVOT obstruction and closure of VSD

\section*{Cardiac catheterization in TOF}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_de6e6b9660ce14994f6bg-35.jpg?height=1589&width=2338&top_left_y=286&top_left_x=49)

\section*{Hypoxic spells}
- Intermittent episodes of extreme cyanosis
- Can be fatal
- Caused by increased infundibular stenosis aggravated by fever, crying, dehydration, cold and stress. Associated with iron deficiency
- Increases left to right shunting
- Also seen in tricuspid atresja

\section*{Management of hypoxic spells}
- Prevention and prompt treatment of dehydration
. Avoid hemo-concentation- IV fluids -
- Manage fever and attendant tachycardia
- Calm the infant \& place in knee chest position
- Administer oxygen and correct any acidosis
- Morphine $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Intravenous Propranalol $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Intubation and paralysis
- Urgent BT shunt

\section*{Other cyanotic CHD}
- Transposition of the great arteries- the aorta arises from the right ventricle and pulmonary artery arises from left ventricle
- Parallel circulation
- Must have a shunt ASD or PDA ( duct dependant lesion)
- Keep duct open( prostalgandins) . Early surgical correction
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous return and truncus arteriosus present early with heart failure
- TAPVR has characteristic chest X ray - the snow mans sign
