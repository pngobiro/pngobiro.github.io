\section*{Acute rheumatic feverwk7 24/02/2011-}

\section*{ARF}
- Delayed non suppurative sequelae of upper respiratory tract infection with group A beta hemolysis strep
- Post infection connnective tissue disease
- A diffuse

\section*{epidemilogy}
- Incidence/prevalence 12 m
- 3 m had CCF requiring reaptrd hospita;lization
- Im require surgery annually
- Mortality 50000 deaths /yr
etiology
- Group A STREP
- Role of constitutional and environmental factors unknown
- Familial susceptibility
- Malnutrtion, overcrowding and low socio economic status

\section*{Cntd..}
- Rates of decline relates to
- Use of antibiotics
- Improved socio economic standards
- Decreased crowding in schools and homes
- Increased availability of health care
- Change in the virulence of organism

\section*{pathogenesis}
- Group A strep mutagenic strains, M 1,3,5 type
- Susceptibility of host, HLA-DR4, 2,1, dw10
- Immune reaction , cross reactivity of beta strep, antigenantibody
- Tissue damage, inflammation in heart , joints, brain , vascular and connective tissue
- Components (some- capsule-joints, M proteinsmyocardium, cell wall carbohydrate same as valvular tissue)of bacteria are same as host tissues, immune recognizes acts on this antigen which resemble part of the host tissue components, during an immune response it attacks also these cellular components producing antibodies against it, results is the inflammation of joints , heart and brain

\section*{Clinical features}
- Following upper airway infection
- Silent period 2-6weeks, sudden fever, pallor, malaise, fatigue
- Then arthritis, carditis, Sydenham's chorea, sub cutaneous nodules, and erythema marginatum
- (Polyarthritis, carditis, erythema marginatum, chorea, subcutaneous nodules)

\section*{Poly arthritis}
- Migratory poly arthritis, occur in 75\% of cases, large joints involved, hip, ankles, elbows and wrists
- Painful, red after some time disappears 3-4 weeks and is not associated with residual abnormalities
- It subsides even untreated and does not involve any damage

\section*{carditis}
- Most serious manifestation with long term morbidity and mortality
- Affects 30-70\%
- Involves all layers of the heart( pericarditis, myocarditis and endocarditis)- pancarditis
- Pericarditis of ARF does not have much of pericardial effusion as other diseases
- Mitral and aortic valves are involved in the acute rheumatic fever, valvular lesion of ARF is regurgitation due to inflammation of the valves( become edematous
- Heals with much sequelae
- Tachycardia( resting), chest pain, prolonged PR interval

\section*{chorea}
- Occur after 2 months, Sydenham's chorea, involvement of basal ganglia( balance and coordination
- Involunatry purposeless movements, muscular incordination emotional liabilty
- Occur in 30\% patients with ARF
- Half of these have carditis and arthritis
- Usually benign and resolves 2-3 months after treatment

\section*{Erythema marginatum}
- Present in 7\% of patients
- Skin lesions with red margins
- Often on trunk, abdomen, inner arms or thighs
- Starts at same time as carditis but continues in the course of the disease

\section*{Sub cutaneous nodules}
- $0.5-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ long, firm, non tender, isolated and in cludters
- Most common along extensor surfaces of joints
- Other conditions- nonspecific abdominal pain due to peritonitis, arthralgia, fever, epistaxis, hematuria, pneumonitis, mild pleuritis $5-10 \%$

\section*{diagnosis}
- Jones criteria major
- Arthritis
- Carditis
- Sydenham's chorea
- Erythema marginatum
- Subcutaneous nodules
- CANCER

\section*{Cntd...}
- Probability of ARF high with
- Evidence of previous strep infection
- Airway infection with 2 major criteria or 1 major criteria with 2 minor criteria
- Fever, arthralgia, elevated C- reactive protein, elevated ESR

\section*{Evidence of previous infection}
- Anti streptolysin antibody
- Arthritis
- Arteritis
- Antibodies to strep antigens
- Anti DNAse

\section*{differential diagnosis}
- Juvenile rheumatoid fever
- SLE
- Bacterial endocarditis
- Leukemias
- Sickle cell anemia

\section*{Aims of treatment}
- Relieve acute symptoms with steroids and aspirin
- Eradicate group A beta hemolytic strep
- sodium valproate for chorea relief though symptomatic treatment
- Prophylaxis-primary aimed to prevent $1^{\text {st }}$ attack of acute RF, secondary to prevent recurrence of RF and severe RHD
- Health facilities
- Strep eradication- penicillin, IM benzathine penicillin, phenoxy benzathine penicillin
- Continuous medication in secondary treatment

\section*{Treatment of carditis}
- Steroid use is a must
- Prednisone $1-2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$, maximum 60 mg x10 for 15 days
- Aspirin $70-100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{d}$

\section*{Chorea treatment}
- Haloperidol $0.5-1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Sodium valproate
- No steroids

\title{
conclusion
}
- ARF leads to RHD
- Preventive is important
