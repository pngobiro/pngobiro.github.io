\section*{MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Definition}
-Myocardial infarction (MI) is the necrosis of heart muscle secondary to prolonged ischemia.
-This usually results from an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand.

\section*{Background}

MI is considered, part of a spectrum referred to as acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), which also includes unstable angina ,ST elevation MI (STEMI)and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI).
Patients with ischemic discomfort may or may not have ST-segment elevation. Most of those with ST-segment elevation will develop Q waves. Those without ST elevations will ultimately be diagnosed with unstable angina or NSTEMI based on the presence of cardiac enzymes.
MI may lead to impairment of systolic function or diastolic function and to increased predisposition to arrhythmias and other long-term complications.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
-Acute MI occur due to ischemia of the myocardial due to the perfusion /oxygen demand mismatch.
-In majority of case this is due to coronary artery disease>90\% of cases.
-AMI due coronary artery disease generally occurs when coronary blood flow decreases abruptly after a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery previously narrowed by atherosclerosis.
-Slowly developing, high-grade coronary artery stenoses usually do not precipitate AMI because of development of a rich collateral network over time.
-AMI occurs when a coronary artery thrombus develops over atherosclerotic plaque when it fissures, ruptures, or ulcerates leading platelet activation and aggregation, coagulation pathway activation, and endothelial vasoconstriction occur and lead to coronary thrombosis and occlusion.
-This injury is produced or facilitated by factors such as
$\checkmark$ cigarette smoking
$\checkmark$ Hypertension
$\checkmark$ Lipid accumulation.
-Atherosclerotic plaques prone to rupture are those with a rich lipid core and a thin fibrous cap
-After an initial platelet monolayer forms at the site of the ruptured plaque, various agonists (collagen, ADP, epinephrine, serotonin) promote platelet activation. -Platelets also release of thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ cause further vasoconstrictor, further platelet activation vicois cycle propagate occlusion.
-. Total occlusion of the vessel for more than 4-6 hours results in irreversible myocardial necrosis, but reperfusion within this period can salvage the myocardium and reduce morbidity and mortality
- Non-atherosclerotic causes of MI include
$\checkmark$ Coronary vasospasm as seen in variant (Prinzmetal) angina
$\checkmark$ Patients using cocaine and amphetamines
$\checkmark$ Coronary emboli from sources such as an infected heart valve
$\checkmark$ Occlusion of the coronaries due to vasculitis
$\checkmark$ Other causes leading to mismatch of oxygen supply and demand, such as acute anemia from GI bleeding
$\checkmark$ MI induced by chest trauma
-The amount of myocardial damage caused by coronary occlusion depends on
(1) Territory supplied by the affected vessel
(2) Degree of occlusion of vessel
(3) Duration of coronary occlusion
(4) Presence of collateral blood supply.
(5) Demand for oxygen of the myocardium whose blood supply has been suddenly limited
(6) native factors that can produce early spontaneous lysis of the occlusive thrombus
(7Adequacy of myocardial perfusion in the infarct zone when flow is restored in the occluded epicardial coronary artery.

\section*{Frequency}

MI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States
There has been a progressive increase in the proportion of patients who are diagnosed with NSTEMI compared with STEMI.
MI continues to be a significant problem in industrialized countries and is becoming an increasingly significant problem in developing countries

\section*{Mortality}
-1/3 of patients who experience STEMI will die within 24 hours of the onset of ischemia and many of the survivors will suffer significant morbidity.
- For many patients, the first manifestation of coronary artery disease is sudden death likely from malignant ventricular dysrhythmia.
-More than one half of deaths occur in the prehospital setting.(1 ${ }^{\text {st }} 30$ minutes)
-In-hospital fatalities account for 10\% of all deaths. An additional 10\% of deaths occur in the first year postinfarction.
Sex:
Male predilection before onset of menopause.
After menopause the risk is almost equal but woman worse prognosis because of atypical presentation.
Age:
MI occurs most frequently in persons older than 45 years.
Certain subpopulations younger than 45 years are at risk
$\checkmark$ Cocaine and amphetamine abusers.
$\checkmark$ DM
$\checkmark$ Hypercholesterolemia-Familial
$\checkmark$ Positive family history for early coronary disease

Etiology \\
-The most frequent cause of MI is rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque within a coronary artery with subsequent arterial spasm and thrombus formation. Other causes include the following: \\
1-Coronary artery vasospasm \\
2-Ventricular hypertrophy (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy \\
3-[LVH], idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis [IHSS], underlying valve disease) \\
4-Hypoxia due to carbon monoxide poisoning or acute pulmonary disorders (Infarcts due to pulmonary disease usually occur when demand on the myocardium dramatically increases relative to the available blood supply.) \\
5-Coronary artery emboli, secondary to cholesterol, air, vegetations from damaged valves \\
6-Drugs-Cocaine, amphetamines, and ephedrine \\
7-Arteritis \\
8-Coronary anomalies, including aneurysms of the coronary arteries \\
9-Increased afterload or inotropic effects, which increase the demand on the myocardium \\
10-Aortic dissection, with retrograde involvement of the coronary arteries \\
11-Although rare, pediatric coronary artery disease may be seen with Marfan syndrome, Kawasaki disease, Takayasu arteritis, progeria, and cystic medial necrosis

Investigations \\
Lab Studies: \\
1)Cardiac enzymes \\
a) Troponin I and T \\
$\checkmark$ begin to rise 4-8 hours after an MI \\
$\checkmark$ peak 12-24 hours \\
$\checkmark$ remain elevated for up to 14days \\
-The preferred biomarker for diagnosis.Troponins have the greatest sensitivity and specificity in detecting MI. \\
-The test result is both diagnostic as well as prognostic of outcome. \\
- Troponin is a complex of three proteins on the thin filaments of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers. During muscle contraction the troponin complex regulates the interaction between the thick and thin filaments. \\
-This complex consists of troponin $\mathrm{T}(\mathrm{TnT})$, troponin I (TnI) and troponin C (TnC). Troponin C is identical in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but the amino acid sequences of troponin T and troponin I found in cardiac muscle is different from that of the troponins in skeletal muscle. \\
-These isoforms of cardiac troponins, cTnT and cTnI, are very specific to cardiac muscle and their presence in blood indicates cardiac tissue necrosis. Because of this specificity, cardiac troponin T or I is now the preferred cardiac marker \\
-For early detection of myocardial necrosis, sensitivity of this laboratory test is superior to that of the CK-MB. \\
b)CK and Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) \\
$\checkmark$ begin to rise within 6-10 hours after injury \\
$\checkmark$ peak at 18-24 hours \\
$\checkmark$ subside over 72 hours \\
-A level within the reference range does not exclude myocardial necrosis. \\
NB.CK-has Two subunits, B (brain) and M(muscle) combine to form 3 isoenzymes of CK: CK-MM(CK-1), CK- MB(CK-2), CK-BB(CK-3). Elevations in total CK activity occur in conditions affecting brain, skeletal muscle, and heart muscle. CK-MB(CK-2) is found almost entirely in myocardial tissue and elevations of this isoenzyme more specific for MI. \\
-Occasionally, very small infarcts can be missed by CKMB; therefore, a troponin level should be measured for patients suspected of having had MI who have negative serial CK-MBs. \\
c) Myoglobin \\
Blood levels of myoglobin become \\
$\checkmark$ Elevated within 2 hours of an MI \\
$\checkmark$ Peak within 4-10 hours \\
$\checkmark$ Return to normal within 24 hours \\
-Levels rise early in the course of MI. Has emerged as an ideal early marker. \\
-Myoglobin, a low-molecular-weight heme protein found in cardiac and skeletal muscle, is released more rapidly from infarcted myocardium than troponin and CK-MB and may be detected as early as 2 hours after MI. \\
-The marker has high sensitivity but poor specificity. Thus, its presence is not diagnostic of MI, but it still has utility in the early triage of chest pain patients. \\
-When performed in conjunction with other studies, it may be useful for the early detection of MI. and detection of any recurrences of MI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
d) Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level rises above the reference range within 24 hours of MI, reaches a peak within 3-6 days, and returns to the baseline within 8-12 days.

\section*{Other Lab Test}

\section*{1.Complete blood count}
-Anemia is suspected as a precipitant.
-Transfusion with packed red blood cells may be indicated.
-Leukocytosis may be observed within several hours after an AMI. It peaks in 2-4 days and returns to levels within the reference range within 1 week.

\section*{2.Urea/Electrolytes /Creatinine.}
-Potassium and magnesium levels should be monitored and corrected.
-Potassium imbalances especially hypokalemia predispose to arrhythmia
-Creatinine levels must be considered before using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

\section*{3.C-reactive protein (CRP) and ESR}

C-reactive protein marker of acute inflammation. Patients without biochemical evidence of myocardial necrosis but with elevated CRP are at increased risk of a subsequent ischemic event.
ESR rises above reference range values within 3 days and may remain elevated for weeks.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

\section*{a)CXR}
-Chest radiography may provide clues to an alternative or complicating diagnosis eg, aortic dissection,
pneumothorax -Complications of MI such as pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure.

\section*{b)Echocardiography}
-Wall motion abnormalities and overall ventricular function.
-Echocardiography also can identify complications of MI (eg, valvular insufficiency, ventricular dysfunction, pericardial effusion).

\section*{c)Technetium-99m sestamibi scan}

Technetium- 99 m is a radioisotope that is taken up by the myocardium in proportion to the blood flow and is only minimally redistributed after initial uptake. This allows for time delay between injection of the isotope and imaging. It has potential use in identifying infarct in patients with atypical presentations or in patients with ECGs that are not interpretable.

\section*{d)ECG}
-Results indicating high probability of MI:
$\checkmark$ ST-segment elevation greater than 1 mm in 2 anatomically contiguous leads
$\checkmark$ Presence of new Q waves.
-Results indicating intermediate probability of MI
$\checkmark$ ST-segment depression
$\checkmark$ T-wave inversion
$\checkmark$ Other nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. -Results indicating low probability of MI are normal findings on ECG; however, normal or nonspecific findings on ECG do not exclude the possibility of MI.

Localization of MI based on distribution of ECG
abnormalities is as follows:
- Inferior wall - II, III, aVF
- Lateral wall - I, aVL, $\mathrm{V}_{4}-\mathrm{V}_{6}$
- Anteroseptal - $\mathrm{V}_{1}-\mathrm{V}_{3}$
- Anterolateral - $\mathrm{V}_{1}-\mathrm{V}_{6}$
- Right ventricular - $\mathrm{RV}_{4}, \mathrm{RV}_{5}$
- Posterior wall - $\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{S}$ ratio $>1$ in $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{2}$; T wave changes (i.e., upright) in $\mathrm{V}_{1}, \mathrm{~V}_{8}$, and $\mathrm{V}_{9}$

\section*{Procedures:}
-Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are a group of catheter-based technologies used to establish coronary reperfusion.
-Angiography provides essential knowledge of the extent of coronary disease, and is performed prior to PCI.
- PCI may then be performed as a primary intervention or due to failure of thrombolysis.
-Evidence suggests that primary PCI is more effective than thrombolysis. They have fewer bleeding complications and less recurrent ischemia when compared with thrombolysis. PCI restores coronary artery patency in more than 90\% of patients
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) (balloon angioplasty) is the primary therapeutic modality used at centers where it can provide reperfusion as quickly as fibrinolytic therapy.
-Coronary artery bypass graft may be indicated based on angiographic findings.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
-Initial therapy for acute MI is directed toward restoration of perfusion in order to salvage as much of the jeopardized myocardium as possible.
-This may be accomplished through medical or mechanical means, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.
Further treatment is aimed at:
(1) Restoration of the balance between the oxygen supply and demand to prevent further ischemia
(2) Pain relief
(3) Prevention and treatment of complications
(4)Address underlying risk factors

\section*{1. Oxygen}

Supplemental oxygen should be administered to all patients especially with arterial oxygen desaturation ( $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ less than $90 \%$ ).

\section*{2. Analgesia-Morphine}

Morphine sulfate (2 to 4 mg IV with increments of 2 to 8 mg IV repeated at 5 - to 15 -minute intervals) is the analgesic of choice for management of pain associated with STEMI. It also relieves anxiety

\section*{3. Aspirin and anti-platelets}

Aspirin should be chewed by patients who have not taken aspirin before presentation with STEMI. The initial dose should be 162 mg to 325 mg .
In a dose of 162 mg or more, aspirin produces a rapid clinical antithrombotic effect caused by immediate and near-total inhibition of thromboxane A2 production.
Aspirin now forms part of the early management of all patients with suspected STEMI and should be given promptly, and certainly within the first 24 hours, at a dose between 162 and 325 mg and continued indefinitely at a daily dose of 75 to 162 mg
Use clopidogrel (Plavix) in case of aspirin allergy.

\section*{Other anti-platelets}

Administer a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonist
$\checkmark$ Epti-fiba-tide
$\checkmark$ Tirofiban
$\checkmark$ Abciximab
The addition of IV platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIareceptor antagonists to aspirin and heparin improves both early and late outcomes, including mortality, Q-wave MI, need for revascularization procedures, and length of hospital stay

\section*{4. Nitrates-Nitroglycerin}

Patients with ongoing ischemic discomfort should receive sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0.4 mg ) every 5 minutes for a total of 3 doses, after which an assessment should be made about the need for intravenous nitroglycerin.
-Intravenous nitroglycerin is indicated for relief of ongoing ischemic discomfort, control of hypertension, or management of pulmonary congestion.
NB. Contra. SBP less than 90 mm Hg , severe bradycardia (less than 50 bpm ), tachycardia (more than 100 bpm ), or suspected RV infarction.
-Contra.patients who have received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor for erectile dysfunction within the last 24 hours (48 hours for tadalafil).

\section*{5. Beta-Blockers}
-It is reasonable to administer IV beta-blockers promptly to STEMI patients without contraindications, especially if a tachyarrhythmia or hypertension is present.
-Beta-blockers reduce the rates of reinfarction and recurrent ischemia and possibly reduce the mortality rate if administered within 12 hours after MI. Administer routinely to all patients with MI unless a contraindication is present
-Immediate beta-blocker therapy appears to reduce the magnitude of infarction and incidence of associated complications in subjects not receiving concomitant fibrinolytic therapy, the rate of reinfarction in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy, and the frequency of lifethreatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias
Eg-Metoprolol
-Esmolol
-Atenolol

\section*{6) ACE inhibitors-Enalapril,Captopril}
-Reduce mortality rates after MI.
-They reduce post infarction heart remodeling.
-Administer ACE inhibitors as soon as possible as long as the patient has no contraindications and remains in stable condition.
-ACE inhibitors have the greatest benefit in patients with ventricular dysfunction.
-Continue ACE inhibitors indefinitely after MI.
-Angiotensin-receptor blockers may be used as an alternative in patients who develop adverse effects, such as a persistent cough

\section*{7.)Thrombolytic therapy}
-Has been shown to improve survival rates in patients with acute MI if administered in a timely fashion in the appropriate group of patients.
-If PCI capability is not available or will cause a delay greater than 90 minutes, then the optimal approach is to administer thrombolytics within 12 hours of onset of symptoms in patients with ST-segment elevation greater than 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous ECG leads, new left bundle-branch block (LBBB), or anterior ST depression consistent with posterior infarction.
-Tissue plasminogen activator ( $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$ ) is superior to streptokinase in achieving a higher rate of coronary artery patency; however, the key to efficacy lies in the speed of the delivery of therapy.
-High patency rate is achieved if platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist is combined with a half dose of thrombolytic agent as the initial reperfusion strategy.

\section*{Streptokinase}

Acts with plasminogen to convert plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots, as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. Non-specific acts on both the free and fibrin bound plasminogen.
Increase in fibrinolytic activity that degrades fibrinogen levels for $24-36 \mathrm{~h}$ occurs with IV infusion of streptokinase

\section*{Anistreplase}
(Anisoylated Plasminogen- Streptokinase activator Complex)
Non-fibrin-specific agent that activates conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and has half-life of 90 min . However, does not have any benefit over streptokinase, although has higher rate of allergic and bleeding complications. Easier to administer than t-PA, has lower cost and does not require heparinization.
Dose- 30 IU over 2-5 min
Other non-specific thrombolytic is Urokinase-human enzyme from the kidney.

\section*{Alteplase, t-PA}

Fibrin-specific agent with brief half-life of 5 min .
Adjunctive therapy with IV heparin necessary to maintain patency of arteries recanalized by t-PA, especially during first $24-48 \mathrm{~h}$.
Dose-15 mg IV initial bolus, followed by 50 mg IV over next 30 min , and then 35 mg IV over next h ; total dose not to exceed 100 mg

\section*{Reteplase}

Recombinant plasminogen activator that forms plasmin after facilitating cleavage of endogenous plasminogen.
Heparin and aspirin usually administered concomitantly and after reteplase
Dose-10 IU IV over 2 min, followed by second 10-IU IV dose after 30 min .

\section*{8)Anticoagulation}

Only required with admin of specific fibrinolyticAlteplace, Reteplace, Tenectaplace.
Unfractionated Heparin - 10,000 IU TID
Fractionated -LMW- Enoxaparin (Lovenox) -- Enhances inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin by increasing antithrombin III activity. In addition, preferentially increases inhibition of factor Xa.
Dose- $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ SC bid

\section*{Discharge medications and lifestyle modification}

\section*{1. The long-term use of aspirin}
-in patients who have had an MI results in significant reduction in subsequent mortality rate.

\section*{2. Beta-blocker therapy}

Confirmed therapeutic benefit in survivors of acute MI.
This therapy is most beneficial in patients with the highest risk.

\section*{3. ACE inhibitor}
-Use in patients with known CAD has been shown to reduce mortality rate.

\section*{4.Long-term anticoagulant (ie, warfarin)}
-Therapy is not routinely used in post-MI patients but as an alternative in patients who cannot take antiplatelet agents.
-Patients with known LV thrombus, atrial fibrillation, or severe wall motion abnormalities have shown benefit from long-term anticoagulation, maintaining the international normalized ratio (INR) between 2

Adjunctive therapy with heparin not needed.
-Dose-1.5 million IU over I hour IV infusion.
-Local delivery by catheter admin 10,000-25000 IU
loading dose then $4000 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{min}$ up to 75 minutes during angiography.NB.For peripheral arterial occlusion admin loading dose IV infusion of 250,000 IU then 100,000 IU per hour for 1-3 days
NB.

\section*{Modification of risks}

\section*{1. Lipid-lowering therapy}

Secondary and primary prevention of CAD -Atovastation.

\section*{2.HTN and DM control}

\section*{3.Smoking cessation}
-Risk of recurrent coronary events decreases 50\% at 1 year after smoking cessation
-Bupropion has been shown to increase the chances of patients' success in achieving smoking cessation.

\section*{4.Alcohol consumption-}

\section*{Reduce excess use}
5. Antioxidant therapy, including vitamin E, has not shown clear benefit in the prevention of coronary events.

\section*{Complications:}

\section*{1.Arrythmia}

Close monitoring and immediate treatment of arrhythmias may be the most important part of the treatment of a postMI patient within the first 48 hours.
Exacerbating factors, such as electrolyte disturbances (especially potassium and magnesium), hypoxemia, drugs, or acidosis, and correct them accordingly.
Ventricular fibrillation and/or ventricular tachycardia occurring within the first 48 hours may be due to ischemia; -Immediate cardio version is the treatment of choice
2. CCF can be due to systolic dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction in the setting of MI.
3. Valve dysfunction due to damage of chordae tendinae. 4.Ventricular rapture
5. Ventricluar septal defects with communication.
6. Thrombus formation over the infarction or due to arrthmia.Mural thromi.
