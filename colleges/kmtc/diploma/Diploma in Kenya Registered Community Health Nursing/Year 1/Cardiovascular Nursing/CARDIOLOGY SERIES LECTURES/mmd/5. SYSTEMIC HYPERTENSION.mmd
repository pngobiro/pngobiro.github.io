\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- CVD is currently a world wide epidemic
- Hypertension is a key CVD risk factor
- The communicable diseases epidemic is not yet under control in our country
- We do not have the resources to handle two epidemics
- We need to act quickly to prevent CVD and treat those already affected

\section*{Hypertension: definition}
- BP >/= 140/90 is considered as defining term, but hypertension is a continuum
- Cardiovascular risk doubles with every 20/10mmhg rise BP from 115/75mmhg between age 40 to 70 yrs
- Isolated systolic/diastolic hypertension should be treated like any other hypertension, higher figure determines grade
- White coat hypertension is also associated with increased cardiovascular risk

\section*{Hypertension: definition}
- It is an asymptomatic lifelong disease requiring life long treatment
- Progressive cardiovascular syndrome associated with target organ damage
- It's assoc with increased risk for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal failure, retinopathy and peripheral vascular disease.
- Treatment results in reduction in these complications
- Major challenges exist in diagnosis and treatment

\section*{BP CLASSIFICATION}

\section*{Global Burden of Hypertension: Analysis of Worldwide Data}

In 2000, 26.4\% (95\% CI 26.0-26.8\%) of the adult population had hypertension, 26.6\% of men \& 26.1\% of women.
- By 2025,29.2\% (28.8-9.7\%) were projected to be hypertensive, $29.0 \%$ of men \& 29.5\% of women.
- In 2000, 972 million adults had hypertension; 333 million (329-336 million) in economically developed countries \& 639 million (625-654 million) in economically developing countries.
- By 2025, the number of adults with hypertension was predicted to increase by about $60 \%$ to a total of 1.56 billion.

\section*{Global Burden of Hypertension: Africa}
- In Tanzania, > above $37 \%$ in an urban area and more than $26 \%$ in a rural population
- Kenya -rural - 33\%
- Of all patients with hypertension in Africa, only $1 / 3$ are aware.
- Of those diagnosed only $1 / 3$ are on treatment
- Of those on treatment only $1 / 3$ are controlled

\section*{Diagnosis of Arterial Hypertension}

Symptoms
- Most patients are asymptomatic
- Diagnosis at routine medical examination
- Diagnosis when stroke or MI
- Hypertension called "Silent Killer"
- Diagnostic procedures
- Aim:
* Establishing blood pressure levels
* Identifying secondary causes of hypertension
* Evaluating the overall cardiovascular risk
- Procedures:
* Repeated blood pressure measurements
* Medical history
* Physical examination
* Laboratory and instrumental investigations

\section*{BP measurement}

Patient sits for 5 mins -back supported, arm supported at the level of the heart
- No caffeine/adrenergic stimulants
- No smoking in the preceding 15 mins
- Cuff should encircle and cover two thirds of the length of the arm
- Use a mercury sphygmomanometer or validated electronic BP machine
- Two recordings at each visit at least three sets of readings one week apart
- Deflate at $2 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{hg} /$ second
- Record Korotkoff sound I -SBP V - DBP

\section*{Diagnosis of Arterial Hypertension}
- Medical history with particular attention to:
- Hypertension
- Life style factors - smoking, alcohol, diet, physical exercise, family history etc
- Diabetes
- Dyslipidemia
- Premature coronary heart disease
- Stroke
- Renal disease
- Physical examination
- Signs suggesting secondary hypertension obesity height, weight, BMI, WC, HC, HWR
- Signs of organ damage:
*Brain*Retina

\section*{Diagnosis of Arterial Hypertension}

Laboratory and instrumental investigations
- Routine tests
- Plasma glucose
- Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, fasting serum triglycerides
- Serum creatinine, uric acid
- Serum potassium
- Hemoglobin and hematocrit
- Urinalysis (dipstick, urinary sediment)
- Electrocardiogram

\section*{Diagnosis of Arterial Hypertension}

Laboratory and instrumental investigations
-Recommended tests
- Echocardiogram, Carotid ultrasound
- Postprandial plasma glucose (if FBS > $\mathbf{6 . 1 ~ m m o l}$ /l or $110 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{l}$ )
- C-reactive protein (high sensitivity)
- Microalbuminuria (essential in diabetics)
- 24 hr proteinuria (if dipstick positive)
- Funduscopy (in severe hypertension)

\section*{Diagnosis of Arterial Hypertension}

\section*{Factors influencing prognosis}

Risk factors for cardiovascular disease used for stratification
- Levels of systolic and diastolic BP
- Men > 55 years; Women > 65 years
- Smoking
- Dyslipidemia
- Family history of PCAD
* Abdominal obesity (circ) $\mathrm{M}>102$ cm, W > 88 cm )
* C-reactive protein $>1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$
* Diabetes mellitus
* Fasting plasma glucose > 7.0 mmol/l
* Postprandial plasma glucose > $11.0 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$

\section*{Goals of Treatment}
- Maximum decrease in long-term total CV risk
- Lower level of systolic and diastolic BP per se
- Treat all reversible risk factors and associated conditions
- Target BP:
- At least $<140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ in all HT patients
- $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$ in diabetics and other high risk patients eg renal dysfunction, CVA, proteinuria, post AMI
- Difficult to achieve in the elderly
- Start anti hypertensive before cardiovascular complications develop

\section*{Lifestyle Changes}

\section*{Purpose: lower BP, control other risk factors, reduce Humber of drugs required to reach target}
* This is for all and should be normal way of life in all to prevent hypertension
- Smoking cessation
- Weight reduction
- Reduction of excessive alcohol intake
- Physical exercise
- Reduction of salt intake
- Increase in fruit and vegetable intake
- Decrease in saturated and total fat intake

\section*{Recommendations by ADA, ISHIB, and NKF consistent with JNC 7}

Drug therapy is recommended for all patients with hypertension (SBP/DBP $>140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ )
- BP goals
- $<140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$
- $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$ for patients with diabetes mellitus
- $<125 / 75 \mathrm{mmHg}$ CRF + proteinuria $>1 \mathrm{~g} /$ day
- Multiple drug therapy with 2 or more agents at adequate doses (thiazide diuretic, ACE inhibitor, ARB, beta-blocker, CCB) is usually required to achieve BP targets
- ISHIB guidelines: consider initiating treatment with 2 drugs if BP is $\geq 15 / 10 \mathrm{mmHg}$ above goal

\section*{Compelling drug indications}
-In case of Sub clinical organ damage
- LVH - ARB, ACE, CCB
- Microalbuminuria/ renal dysfunction - ARB, ACE
- Heart failure - ACE, BB, ARB, diuretics, aldosterone inhibitors
- Metabolic syndrome - ARB, ACE, CCB
. ISH (elderly) - diuretics, CCB
- Pregnancy - BB, CCB, alpha methyldopa

\section*{Recommended combinations}

\section*{Control is often poor}

\section*{Poor compliance}
- Denial
- Inadequate patient education
- Inadequate life style change
- Cost
- Side effects
- Competing alternative therapies
- Fatigue
- Poly pharmacy
- Poor drug combinations
- Sub optimal dosing

\section*{Lifestyle Changes are not easy to implement and sustain}
