HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES \\
Introduction \\
Joint National Committee (JNC-7) has introduced a new classification system for HTN. \\
Pre-hypertension \\
$\checkmark$ Systolic blood pressure(SBP) 120-139 \\
$\checkmark$ Diastolic blood pressure(DBP) 80-89 \\
Stage I HTN \\
$\checkmark$ SBP 140-159 \\
$\checkmark$ DBP 90-99 \\
Stage II HTN \\
$\checkmark$ SBP >160 \\
$\checkmark \quad$ DBP >100 \\
Hypertensive crises encompass a spectrum of clinical presentations where uncontrolled BPs lead to progressive or impending target organ dysfunction (TOD). \\
The clinical distinction between hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies depends on the presence of acute TOD and not on the absolute level of the BP. \\
Hypertensive emergency \\
Hypertensive emergencies represent severe HTN with acute impairment of an organ system (eg central nervous system [CNS], cardiovascular, renal). In these conditions, the BP should be lowered aggressively over minutes to hours. \\
Hypertensive urgency \\
Hypertensive urgency is defined as a severe elevation of BP, without evidence of progressive TOD. These patients require BP control over hours to days. \\
Pathophysiology: \\
The pathophysiology of hypertensive emergencies is not well understood. However, an abrupt rise in vascular resistance seems to be a necessary initial step. The 3 major organ systems affected by high BP are the CNS, cardiovascular system, and renal system. \\
Central nervous system \\
Cerebral autoregulation is the inherent ability of the cerebral vasculature to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in blood pressure. \\
As mean arterial pressure (MAP) increases, the cerebral endothelium is disrupted and the blood-brain barrier can become interrupted. \\
This leads to cerebral edema and microhemorrhages. Patients with chronic HTN can tolerate higher MAPs before they have disruption of their autoregulation system. However, such patients also have increased cerebrovascular resistance and are more prone to cerebral ischemia when flow decreases. \\
Hypertensive encephalopathy is one of the clinical manifestations of cerebral edema and microhemorrhages seen with dysfunction of cerebral autoregulation.
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
Cardiovascular system \\
HTN affects the structure and function of the coronary vasculature and left ventricle. \\
HTN also activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing systemic vasculature constriction. This results in increasing myocardial oxygen demand by increasing the left ventricular wall tension and leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary compression. During hypertensive emergencies, the left ventricle cannot overcome systemic vascular resistance. This leads to left ventricular failure and pulmonary edema or myocardial ischemia. \\
Renal system \\
Chronic HTN causes pathologic changes to the small arteries of the kidney. The arteries develop endothelial dysfunction and impaired vasodilation, which alter renal autoregulation. \\
When the renal autoregulatory system is disrupted, the intraglomerular pressure starts to vary directly with the systemic arterial pressure, thus offering no protection to the kidney during BP fluctuations. During a hypertensive crisis, this can lead to acute renal ischemia. \\
Mortality/Morbidity: \\
Death from both ischemic heart disease and stroke increase progressively as the BP increases. For every 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm diastolic increase in BP, the mortality rate from both ischemic heart disease and stroke doubles. \\
The morbidity and mortality of hypertensive emergencies depend on the extent of TOD on presentation and the degree to which BP is controlled subsequently. \\
With BP control and medication compliance, the 10-year survival rate of patients with hypertensive crises approaches 70\%. \\
Sex: \\
Overall, the prevalence and incidence of HTN is slightly higher in men than in women. \\
Hypertensive crises are two times more frequent in males than in females. \\
Age: \\
Hypertensive crises are more common among elderly persons. \\
Etiology \\
The most common hypertensive emergency is a rapid unexplained rise in BP in a patient with chronic essential HTN. \\

2. CBC and smear to exclude microangiopathic anemia
3. Urinalysis (UA)

Dipstick UA to detect hematuria or proteinuria (renal impairment)

4. Optional studies

Toxicology screen
Pregnancy test

\section*{Endocrine testing}

\section*{Imaging Studies:}
1.Chest radiography is indicated in patients with chest pain or shortness of breath.
$\checkmark$ Cardiac enlargement
$\checkmark$ Pulmonary edema
$\checkmark$ Widened mediastinum
2.Head CT scans are indicated in patients with abnormal neurologic examinations.
$\checkmark$ Intracranial bleeding
$\checkmark$ Cerebral edema
$\checkmark$ Cerebral infarction
3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for evidence of myocardial ischemia or left ventricular hypertrophy 4.Chest CT scan, Tran esophageal echocardiography, or aortic angiogram is indicated in cases where aortic dissection is suspected.
-Rapid reduction in BP below the cerebral, renal, and/or coronary autoregulatory range will result in marked reduction in organ blood flow, possibly leading to ischemia and infarction.
-In general, the MAP should be lowered by no more than $20-25 \%$ in the first hour of treatment. If the patient remains stable, the BP should then be lowered to 160/100-110 in the next 2-6 hours. Please note the exceptions to this general rule listed below.
-These BP goals are best achieved by a continuous infusion of a short-acting, titratable, parenteral antihypertensive agent along with constant, intensive patient monitoring.
-Rapid BP reduction is indicated in the following circumstances:
1.Acute myocardial ischemia
$\checkmark$ Nitroglycerin IV
$\checkmark$ Beta-blockers IV
2.CHF with pulmonary edema
$\checkmark$ Nitroglycerin IV
$\checkmark$ Lasix IV
$\checkmark$ Nitroprusside IV
3.Acute aortic dissection:

In cases of acute aortic dissection, the SBP should be decreased as rapidly as possible to a goal of $100-110 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg or lower.
Labetalol IV
Alternative - Nitroprusside IV with beta-blocker IV (eg, esmolol)

\section*{4. CVA:}
-Evidence exists that patients who have acute strokes have better outcomes with higher BPs. Antihypertensive therapy is not routinely recommended for patients with acute stroke and HTN.
-Recent ischemic stroke and a SBP $>220 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ or a DBP $>120-140 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ can undergo cautious reduction of BP by about 10-15\% (with IV nitroprusside or IV labetalol), if the patient is carefully monitored for neurologic deterioration related to the lower pressure. -Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH): A precipitous fall in SBP may compromise cerebral perfusion and increase mortality.
The controlled lowering of BP with IV nitroprusside or IV labetalol (in the absence of bradycardia) is currently recommended only when the SBP is $>200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ or the DBP is >110.
