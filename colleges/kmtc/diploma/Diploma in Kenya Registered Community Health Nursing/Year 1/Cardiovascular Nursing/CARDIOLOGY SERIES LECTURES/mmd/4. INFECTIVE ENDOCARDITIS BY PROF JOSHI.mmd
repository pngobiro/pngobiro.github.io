\section*{DEFINITION}
- Microbial infection of the endothelial surface of the heart. Commonly bacterial.
- A Vegetation is the characteristic lesion: amorphous mass of platelets, fibrin, micro-organisms \& scant inflammatory cells.

\section*{SITE OF INVOLVEMENT}
- Heart valves - most common
- Septal defects
- Chordae tendinae
- Mural endocardium
- NB: Infection of the arterio-venous shunts, arterio-arterial shunts (PDA), Coarctation of the aorta.

\section*{WHO IS AT RISK OF DEVELOPING IE?}
- Structural heart disease (SHD)
- VHD-RHD/DHD, CHD, Prosthesis
- Turbulent flow \& endothelial denudation
- Sterile vegetation nidus for microbe settlement
- Mostly, the mitral and aortic valves are involved
- Transient bacteremia - instrumentation e.g. dental procedures or urogenital instrumentation
- No prior SHD - IV drug users (IVDU IE)
- Mostly involves the tricuspid valves.

\section*{CLASSIFICATON - CLINICAL COURSE}
- Acute
- Marked toxicity
- Progress over days to several weeks with Valvular destruction
- Metastatic infection
- Staphylococcus aureus
- Sub-acute
- Modes toxicity
- Evolves over weeks to months
- Staphylococcus viridans and coagulase negative staphylococcus

\section*{OTHER}
- Native valve IE
- Prosthetic valve IE
- IVDU IE
- Nosocomial IE

\section*{PATHOGENESIS}
- Underlying Heart Disease
- Endothelial trauma
- Turbulence
- Immune complexes
- Foreign particles
- Non-Bacterial Thrombotic Vegetation (NBTV)
- Transient Bacteremia
- Local invasion (Murmur, valve/chordal rupture, Valve ring abscess, aortic root abscess)
- Septic emboli (cerebral, coronary, renal, mesenteric)
- Constant bacteremia due to poor blood supply to the endocardium and physical coverage of the infected vegetations:
- Systemic infection - Fever, splenomegaly, malaise
- Immune complexes - Arthritis Glomerulonephritis, Vasculitis DIC

\section*{CONT.}
- Adherence to damaged valves
- Mechanical lesions
- Excoriation of the endothelium
- Formation of a blood coagulum
- Bacterial colonization
- Monocyte activation
- In-situ bacterial persistence
- Maturation of vegetation - within which the micro-organisms become enveloped
- Monocytes
- Platelet aggregation
- Intracellular invasion

\section*{MICROBIOLOGY}
- Streptococcus - Common in children and middle aged population (260 years)
- Staph aureus
- Enterococcus - common in in old (> 60 years)
- Gram negative - common in neonates
- HACEK (Haemophilus, Actinnobacillus, Cardiobacerium, Ekinella \& Kingella) - common in neonates and in the old.
- Polymicrobial - common in neonates

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
- $80 \%$ within 14 days
- Fever
- Absent in elderly, CHF, Severe disability, CRF (Chronic renal failure)
- Heart murmur
- $80-85 \%$ (absent with Tricuspid Valve)
- Splenomegaly - 25-50\%
- Peripheral manifestations
- Less frequent/absent TV IE

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES: PERIPHERAL MANIFESTATIONS}
- Petechiae
- Splinter hemorrhages
- Janeway lesions - Non-tender lesions on the soles and the palms
- Osler's nodes - at the pulp of the fingers; are tender
- Roth spots in the fundus
- Finger clubbing
- Musculo-skeletal
- Arthralgia, myalgias, true arthritis (due to immune complexes), back pain
- Systemic embolization - common (40\%)
- Spleen, kidneys, CNS, coronaries, mesenteries
- Neurologic
- Staphylococcus aureus is more common.

\section*{DIAGNOSIS: MODIFIED DUKES CRITERIA}
- Major criteria
- Microbiological
- Typical organisms 2 cultures/+ cultures consistent bugs/single C. burnetti
- Endocardial involvement evidence
- Changing murmurs
- Positive echo: vegetation, abscess/Prosthetic Valve dehiscence
- Minor criteria
- Predisposition to IE
- Fever of $>38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Vascular phenomenon
- Immunological phenomenon: RF, Glomerulonephritis, Roth's \& Osler's nodes.
- Clinical criteria
- 2 major / 1 major and 3 minor / 5 minor

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
- Multidisciplinary approach
- Specialists in cardiology, infectious disease and cardiac surgeons
- Bactericidal antibiotics are the cornerstone of therapy
- Regimen choice should be based on susceptibility testing
- Give high dose, IV antibiotics for a prolonged period of time

\section*{PROPHYLAXIS}
- Establish a person at risk
- Procedure that might provoke bacteremia
- Most effective prophylactic regimen

\section*{PROSTHETIC VALVE IE}
- 1-5\% of individuals with IE
- Early PVIE
- Within 60 days
- Infectious agents
- S. epidermidis
- S. aureus
- Late PVIE
- After 60 days
- Microbes: gram negative organisms and Strep.

\section*{IVDU IE}
- Young people
- Valves commonly affects Tricuspid (50\%), Aortic (25\%), Mitral
- HIV co-infection increases the risk and mortality from IVDU IE; Organisms are unusual, Bartonella, Salmonella etc.

\section*{NOSOCOMIAL ENDOCARDITIS}
- Common organisms are staph aureus and enterococcus.
