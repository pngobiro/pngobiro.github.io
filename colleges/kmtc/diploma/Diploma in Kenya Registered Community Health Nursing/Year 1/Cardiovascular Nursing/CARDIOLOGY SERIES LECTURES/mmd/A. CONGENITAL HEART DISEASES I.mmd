\section*{CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE FOR UNDERGRADUATES}

\author{

}

\section*{CONT.}
- Present from birth
- Most common form of CHD 0.8\$ of all live births
- An end point of a disorder in the process which the heart and the great vessels develop
- Requires understanding of normal and abnormal CVS development
- An interaction of genes, environment and chance.

\section*{CARDIAC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY}
- The heart is found at the left side of the chest (precordium)
- The upper part of the body takes $1 / 3$ of the CO and the lower part takes $2 / 3$ of the CO.
- The heart is made of 2 collecting chambers (atria) and 2 pumping chambers (ventricles)
- The atria are thin chambers and are at very low pressures ( 5 mmHg ) compared to the right ventricles ( $15-30 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ) and left ventricles ( 120 mmHg ) < this is the pumping pressure; the filling pressure is $0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}>$.
- The Left atrium has a filling pressures of 7.0 mmHg .
- The DBP is always 0 .

\section*{BASIC EMBRYOLOGY}
- The cardiogenetic plate
- The primitive heart plate
- The cardiac looping
- Septation of the heart
- AV valves
- Arterial valves
- Aortic arch system
- The pulmonary and systemic veins
- One can tell of a cardiac malformation at 16 week.

\section*{LEFT-RIGHT SHUNTS}

\section*{NON-CYANOTIC CONDITIONS}
- Atrial Septal Defects
- The pressure difference is low hence a murmur will not be appreciated
- Ventricular Septal Defects
- Gives a pansystolic murmur
- Patent Ductus Arteriosus
- From Pulmonary a. -> Aorta
- Pressure is higher in the aorta both in systole and in diastole hence a continuous murmur.
- Conditions which block the flow of blood at the level of the AV valves.
- Stenosis of the valves.
- Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)

\section*{RIGHT TO LEFT SHUNTS (5Ts)}

\section*{CYANOTIC CONDITIONS:}
- Tricuspid Atresia
- Without a tricuspid valve, one must have have an PDA, ASD or VSD to survive
- Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
- Pulmonary veins connect to the right atrium
- Truncus arteriosus
- Single arterial trunk and a VSD
- Tetralogy of Fallot
- VSD
- Pulmonary stenosis
- Over-riding aorta
- RVH - to pump blood through the stenosed pulmonary artery
- Transposition of the great vessels
- Pulmonary artery is connected to the left ventricle and the aorta is connected to the right ventricle.
- They run parallel and forget to crossed
- For survival, there has to be either an ASD, VSD or PDA
