ECG Waves and Intervals:
P wave: the sequential activation (depolarization) of the right and left atria
QRS complex: right and left ventricular depolarization (normally the ventricles are activated simultaneously)
ST-T wave: ventricular repolarization
U wave: origin for this wave is not clear - but probably represents "afterdepolarizations" in the ventricles
PR interval: time interval from onset of atrial depolarization (P wave) to onset of ventricular depolarization (QRS complex)
QRS duration: duration of ventricular muscle depolarization
QT interval: duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization
RR interval: duration of ventricular cardiac cycle (an indicator of ventricular rate)
PP interval: duration of atrial cycle (an indicator of atrial rate)
Orientation of the 12 Lead ECG
Each of the 12 leads represents a particular orientation in space, as indicated below (RA = right arm; LA = left arm, LF = left foot):

Bipolar limb leads (frontal plane):
Lead I: RA (-) to LA (+) (Right Left, or lateral)
Lead II: RA (-) to LF (+) (Superior Inferior)
Lead III: LA (-) to LF (+) (Superior Inferior)
Augmented unipolar limb leads (frontal plane):
Lead aVR: RA (+) to [LA \& LF] (-) (Rightward)
Lead aVL: LA (+) to [RA \& LF] (-) (Leftward)
Lead aVF: LF (+) to [RA \& LA] (-) (Inferior)
Unipolar (+) chest leads (horizontal plane):
Leads V1, V2, V3: (Posterior Anterior)
Leads V4, V5, V6:(Right Left, or lateral)

Measurement
1.Heart Rate

In normal sinus rhythm, a resting heart rate of below 60 bpm is called bradycardia and a rate of above 90 bpm is called tachycardia.
2. PR Interval
(measured from beginning of P to beginning of QRS in the frontal plane)
Normal: 0.12-0.20s

Left ventricular hypertrophy
1)Tall $R$ wave (greater than 25 mm in $V 5$ or $V 6$ ), or R at V5 plus S wave at V1greater than 35 mm -Leons hypothesis
2)a deep S in V1 or V2
3)if there is significant left ventricular 'strain' then there are also inverted T waves in V5 and V6 and possible ST depression
4)left axis deviation may also be present
5)QRS may be slightly prolonged

\section*{Right ventricular hypertrophy include:}
1)right axis deviation
2) predominant R wave in lead V 1 - in a normal ECG the S wave is dominant in V1 there will be a deep S in V6 in a normal ECG the QRS complex is predominantly upwards in V6
3)inverted T waves in right praecordial leads - V2, V3 will be present in severe cases; it is normal to have inverted T waves in V1
4)Peaked $P$ waves may also occur due to right atrial hypertrophy
5)QRS < 0.12s

\section*{HYPERKALEMIA}

\section*{ECG CHANGES}

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+} 5.5-6.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Tall, peaked T waves with narrow base, best seen in precordial leads

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+} 6.5-8.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Peaked T waves
- Prolonged PR interval
- Widening of QRS, amplified $R$ wave
- Decreased or disappearing $P$ wave

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+}$greater than $8.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Absence of P wave
- Intraventricular/fascicular/bundle branch blocks
- Progressive widening of QRS (eventually merging with the T wave just before cardiac arrest, forming the Sine-wave pattern
- Ventricular dysrhythmia
- Prolongation of QT interval
- ST-segment depression
- T-wave flattening
- Appearance of U waves
-During therapy, monitor for changes associated with overcorrection and hyperkalemia, including a prolonged QRS, peaked T waves, bradyarrhythmia, sinus node dysfunction, and asystole

\section*{Hypercalcemia}
-QT interval shortening is common, and, in some cases, the PR interval is prolonged.
-At very high levels, the QRS interval may lengthen, T waves may flatten or invert, and a variable degree of heart block may develop. Digoxin effects are amplified.
