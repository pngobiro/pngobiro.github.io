\section*{PERICARDIAL EFFUSION Definition}

Pericardial effusion defines the presence of an abnormal amount and/or character of fluid in the pericardial space. Cardiac tamponade is a clinical syndrome caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, resulting in reduced ventricular filling and subsequent hemodynamic

\section*{compromise..}

\section*{Introduction}

It can be caused by a variety of local and systemic disorders, or it may be idiopathic. Pericardial effusions can be acute or chronic, and the time course of development has a great impact on the patient's symptoms.
Treatment varies, and is directed at both removal of the pericardial fluid and alleviation of the underlying cause, which usually is determined by a combination of fluid analysis and correlation with co morbid illnesses.
Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency. The overall risk of death depends on the speed of diagnosis, the treatment provided, and the underlying cause of the tamponade

\section*{Pathophysiology:}

The pericardial space normally contains 15-50 cc of fluid, which serves as lubrication for the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium.
This fluid is thought to originate from the visceral pericardium and is essentially an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Total protein levels are generally low; however, the concentration of albumin is increased in pericardial fluids owing to its low molecular weight.
The cause of abnormal fluid production depends on the underlying etiology, but usually it is secondary to injury or insult to the pericardium (ie, pericarditis).
Transudative fluids result from obstruction of fluid drainage, which occurs through lymphatic channels. Exudative fluids occur secondary to inflammatory, infectious, malignant, or autoimmune processes within the pericardium.
Clinical manifestations of pericardial effusion are highly dependent upon the rate of accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. Rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid may cause elevated intrapericardial pressures with as little as 80 cc of fluid, while slowly progressing effusions can grow to 2 liters without symptoms.
The underlying pathophysiologic process for the development of tamponade is markedly diminished diastolic filling because transmural distending pressures are insufficient to overcome the increased intrapericardial pressures.
Systemic venous return is also altered during tamponade. Because the heart is compressed throughout the cardiac cycle due to the increased intrapericardial pressure, systemic venous return is impaired and right atrial collapse occurs. During inspiration, intrapericardial and right atrial pressures decrease because of negative intrathoracic pressure. This results in augmented systemic venous return to right-sided chambers and a marked increase in the right ventricular volume. Because the pulmonary vascular bed is a vast and compliant circuit, blood preferentially accumulates in the venous circulation, at the expense of LV filling.

This results in a reduced cardiac output.
The amount of pericardial fluid needed to impair the diastolic filling of the heart depends on the rate of fluid accumulation and the compliance of the pericardium. Rapid accumulation of as little as 150 mL of fluid can result in a marked increase in pericardial pressure and can severely impede cardiac output, whereas 1000 mL of fluid may accumulate over a longer period without any significant effect on diastolic filling of the heart. This is due to adaptive stretching of the pericardium over time. A more compliant pericardium can allow considerable fluid accumulation over a longer period without hemodynamic insult.

Pericarditis
The most common symptom of acute pericarditis is precordial or retrosternal chest pain, usually described as sharp or stabbing.
Pain may be of sudden or gradual onset and may radiate to the back (left trapezial ridge), neck, left shoulder, or arm.
Movement or inspiration may aggravate the pain.
Pain may be most severe when the patient is supine and can be relieved when the patient leans forward while sitting.
Common associated signs and symptoms include lowgrade intermittent fever, dyspnea, cough, and dysphagia.
In tuberculous pericarditis, fever, night sweats, and weight loss were commonly noted (80\%).
Patients can present with acute abdominal pain.

hematocrits usually significantly less than simultaneous peripheral blood hemato
Balloon pericardotomy
A catheter is placed in the pericardial space under fluoroscopy, which, after inflation of the balloon, creates a channel for passage of fluid into the pleural space, where reabsorption occurs more readily.
This may be useful for recurrent effusions.
Pericardial sclerosis
Several pericardial sclerosing agents have been used with varying success rates (eg, tetracycline, doxycycline, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil).
Pericardioscopy
This procedure is not universally available.
It may increase diagnostic sensitivity in cases of unexplained pericardial effusions. It allows for visualization of pericardium and for pericardial biopsies.

\section*{Medical Care:}

Initially, medical care is focused on determination of the underlying etiology.
Intravenous fluid resuscitation may be helpful in cases of hemodynamic compromise.
Antineoplastic therapy (eg, systemic chemotherapy, radiation) in conjunction with pericardiocentesis has been shown to be effective in reducing recurrences of malignant effusions.
Corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are helpful in patients with autoimmune conditions.

\section*{Surgical Care:}

Subxiphoid pericardial window with pericardiostomy
This procedure is associated with low morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates.
It can be performed under local anesthesia.
It may be less effective when effusion is loculated.
It may replace pericardiocentesis as initial treatment for stable pericardial effusions.
May be safer and more effective at reducing recurrence rates than pericardiocentesis.
Thoracotomy
This should be reserved for patients in whom conservative approaches have failed.
Thoracotomy allows for creation of a pleuropericardial window, which provides greater visualization of pericardium.

\section*{Video-assisted thoracic surgery}

Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) enables resection of a wider area of pericardium than the subxiphoid approach without the morbidity of thoracotomy.
One disadvantage of VATS is that it requires general anesthesia with single lung ventilation, which may be difficult in otherwise seriously ill patients.
Median sternotomy
This procedure is reserved for patients with constrictive pericarditis.
Operative mortality rate is high (5-15\%).
$\checkmark$ Pericardial effusion appears as an "echo-free" space between the visceral and parietal pericardium
$\checkmark$ False-positive echocardiograms can occur in pleural effusions, pericardial thickening, increased pericardial fat (especially the anterior epicardial fat pad), atelectasis, and mediastinal lesions.
$\checkmark$ Transesophageal echocardiography: -useful in characterizing loculated effusions
CT scan
$\checkmark$ May detect as little as 50 cc of fluid
$\checkmark$ Fewer false-positives than with echocardiography
MRI
$\checkmark$ Can detect as little as 30 cc of pericardial flui
$\checkmark$ May be able to distinguish hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic effusions

\section*{Other Tests:}

ECG:Classic findings include
$\checkmark$ low voltage, sinus tachycardia
$\checkmark$ electrical alternans
$\checkmark$ PR-segment depression
$\checkmark$ Diffuse ST elevation if pericarditis is presen

\section*{Procedures:}

\section*{Pericardiocentesis}

This procedure is used for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. Support for the use of echocardiographic guidance is increasing, unless emergent treatment is required.
Indications include impending hemodynamic compromise (ie, pericardial tamponade), suspected infectious etiology, and uncertain etiology.
Attaching an ECG electrode to the pericardiocentesis needle is also useful for avoiding myocardial puncture. Electrical activity will be seen on the monitor when the needle comes into contact with atrial or ventricular myocardium.
Complications of pericardiocentesis include ventricular rupture, dysrhythmias, pneumothorax, myocardial and/or coronary artery laceration, and infection.
Recurrence rates within 90 days may be as high as $90 \%$ in patients with cancer
