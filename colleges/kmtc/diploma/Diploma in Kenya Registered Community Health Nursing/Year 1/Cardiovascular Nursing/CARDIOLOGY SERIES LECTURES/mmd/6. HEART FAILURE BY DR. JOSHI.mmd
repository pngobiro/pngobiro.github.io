HEAT FAILURE
BY PROF JOSHI

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Abnormality in cardiac structure or function resulting in the inability of the heart to fill with or eject blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues
- It is a syndrome characterized by dyspnea. Fatigue and fluid retention
- It is a progressive disorder of LV remodeling, usually resulting from an index event that culminates in a clinical syndrome characterized by impaired cardiac function and circulatory condestion

\section*{FORMS OF HEART FAILURE}
- Systolic: inability of the ventricles to contract normally and expel sufficient blood
- Diastolic: HF in patients with preserved systolic function; EF > 50\%
- Due to increased resistance to ventricular inflow -> reduced ventricular diastolic capacity or reduced ventricular relaxation
- Mostly abnormal or both contraction and relaxation

\section*{HF PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- Risk factors
- Myocardial injury (MI, HTN, VHD, Cardiomyopathy)
- Initial fall in LV performance - increase wall stress
- Activation of RAAS and SNS
- Fibrosis, apoptosis, hypertrophy, cellular and molecular alterations
- Hemodynamic alterations, salt and water retention -> HF symptoms: dyspnea, edema, fatigue
- Re-modelling and progressive worsening of LVF -> Morbidity and mortality

\section*{COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS}
- Increase preload - Frank-Starling ventricular dilatation and volume expansion
- Increase afterload - PV vasoconstriction
- Hypertrophy - preserve wall stress - Laplace law
- Salt and water retention - preload
- Increased HR and myocardial contractility
- Via neuro-hormonal activation - RAAS. AVP

\section*{ETIOLOGY}
- Categories Six Major: failure related to:
- Myocardial abnormalities - myocyte loss etc.
- External work overload
- Valvular abnormalities
- Abnormal cardiac rhythm
- Pericardial abnormalities
- Congenital abnormalities

\section*{ADHF EPIDEMIOLOGY KENYA}
- Period prevalence hospitalized medical
- KNH 1998 3.3\%; 2008 4-6\%
- Muranga rural 2011 DH 5\%
- Age: median age KNH 44 year; MDH60 years
- Prognosis mortality
- In-hospital 11\%
- Post-discharge 25-37\% at 6 months
- Re-admission 38\%; average 1.3 per patient
- M\&M 49\% (40.6-57.8)

\section*{SYMPTOMATOLOGY}
- Cardiac
- Exertional dyspnea
- PND; orthopnea
- Dyspnea at rest
- Palpitations
- Leg swelling
- Abdominal swelling
- RUQ pain
- Non-cardiac
- Fatigue
- Anorexia
- Weight-loss cachexia

\section*{SIGNS}
- Systemic venous congestion
- Pedal edema
- Tender hepatomegaly
- Elevated JVP
- Pulmonary venous congestion
- Basal rales
- Hypotension and tachycardia
- Precordial findings depend on cause

\section*{PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT}
-Diagnosis:
- Presence of HF
- Underlying cardiac condition
- Precipitating conditions
- Comorbidity

\section*{CRITERIA 1 \& 2 should be fulfilled in all cases}
1. Symptoms of HF at rest or on exertion
2. Objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction (at rest)

\section*{IN CASES WHERE THE DIAGNOSIS IS IN DOUBT}
3. Response to treatment directed towards HF

\section*{MODIFIED FRAMINGHAM CLINICAL CRITERIA FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF HEART FAILURE}
- Major
- PND
- Orthopnea
- Elevated JVP
- Pulmonary rales
- S3
- Cardiomegaly on CXR
- Pulmonary edema on CXR
- Weight loss
- Minor
- Bilateral leg edema
- Nocturnal cough
- Dyspnea on exertion
- Hepatomegaly
- Pleural effusion
- Tachycardia

\section*{ALGORITHM FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF HF}
- Suspected HF because of symptoms and signs
- Assess presence of cardiac diseases by ECG, X-ray or Natriuretic peptides
- If test is abnormal -> echocardiography
- If abnormal - assess etiology, HF, precipitating factors and type degree of cardiac dysfunction
- Additional diagnostic tests where appropriate e.g. coronary angiography
- Choose therapy

\section*{INVESTIGATION}
- ECG - normal or high negative predictive value
- CXR to r/o dyspnea
- 2D echocardiography
- LV dysfunction (systolic/diastolic)
- Etiology
- Biochemistry and hematology
- Natriuretic peptides (NT-BNP)
- Others:
- Stress testing, Holter, catheterization, RNA, MRI

\section*{MANAGEMENT AIMS}
-Prevention
- Prevention and/or controlling of diseases leading to cardiac dysfunction and HF
- Prevention of progression to HF once cardiac dysfunction is established
- Morbidity
- Maintenance or improvement in quality of life
- Mortality
- Increased longevity

\section*{MANAGEMEN TSTRATEGIES}
- Non-pharmacological intervention and lifestyle modification
- Physical activity
- Dietary modification
- Vaccination - influenza, pneumococcal
- Education and counselling

\section*{CONT.}
- Symptomatic therapy
- Diuretic
- Less signs and symptoms; no mortality benefit; use loop diuretic along with a thiazide (plus a RAAS blocker); monitor renal function
- Digoxin
- Useful in rate control in AF, indicated in: Symptomatic patients after maximal doses in medical treatment and frequent hospitalizations; rate control in AF; large RCTs - no mortality benefit; DIG trial

\section*{CONT.}
- Disease modifying therapy
- Neuro-hormonal interventions:
- ACE-inhibitors: first line agents, C/I in renal disease, angioedema, persistent cough
- Beta-blockers: nebivolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol; provide significant mortality and long-term symptomatic benefit in all grades of HF and post MI-LVSD; start beta blocker in patient free of decompensation.
- Aldosterone antagonists: spironolactone, eplerenone; reduced morbidity and mortality in patients with moderat - severe HF; combined with standard ACE-I + BB therapy; watch out for hyperkalemia and tender gynecomastia (spironolactone)
- Hydralazine/Nitrate
- AT-II receptor antagonists

\section*{CONT.}
- Other pharmacological agents
- Device therapy
- Surgical options

\section*{DRUGS TO AVOID IN HF}
- NSAIDs - cause fluid retention
- Rate limiting CCBs - Diltiazem and Verapamil
- Class I anti-arrhythmics
- Steroids
- TCAs
