# INVESTIGATIONS IN CARDIOLOGY

## Introduction
- Investigations serve to confirm diagnosis
- Do not replace clinical skills
- Must be interpreted within the clinical context
- Include CXR, ECG (resting and stress), ECHO, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiogram, myocardial perfusion scans MRI, CT scan, LAB tests
- Always treat the patient not the result

## CXR
- Cardiac silhouette gives important information on size and state of heart
- Should occupy less than $1/2$ of hemi thorax
- Know the chambers forming the borders:
  - LEFT BORDER - LV
  - RIGHT BORDER - RA
  - LEFT UPPER BORDER - LA/pulmonary bay, aortic knuckle
- Lung fields - help differentiate cardiac and respiratory causes of dyspnoea e.g., pulmonary oedema / pl. effusion
- Ribs - e.g., notching in COA due to new anastomoses being formed
- Enlargement of the Left Atrium is called spraying of the carina

### Example CXR Cases

#### Dextrocardia Case

- There is Dextrocardia
- The patient has Situs inversus; see gastric bubble

#### Cardiomegaly Case

This CXR shows:
- Cardiomegaly
- Right sided consolidation and effusion

#### Massive Cardiomegaly
Differential diagnoses include:
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Pericardial effusion

## ECG

### Basic Principles
- Very important diagnostic tool
- Components: SAN, atrial tissue, AVN, His purkinje system, Lt/Rt bundles, ventricular tissue
- Aids in diagnosis of:
  - Ischemic heart disease especially ACS
  - Chamber enlargement
  - Arrhythmias
  - Electrolyte imbalance
  - Pericardial disease - effusion
  - Pulmonary thromboembolism

### Analyzing ECG: Key Questions
- What's the rhythm?
- Are P waves present? (represent atrial depolarization)
- How is the P wave related to the QRS complex?
- Is every P wave followed by a QRS complex with a normal P-R interval?
- What is the R-R interval? (heart rate)
  - 300 divide by the large squares = HR
  - 1500 divide by the small squares = HR
- What is the axis?
- Are ST Segments normal?

### Normal ECG Rules
- All leads have positive QRS EXCEPT aVR and V1
- V1 is placed at the right fourth interspace
- aVR is placed on the right arm
- For aVR and V1, the impulse is moving away
- V1 has positive QRS if RV becomes bigger than LV
- R-R interval should be regular
- P-wave should precede QRS complex
- There should be a pattern
- Irregular ECG seen in AF

## Stress ECG
- Diagnosis of CAD if suspected
- Follow up post ACS to assess exercise tolerance and advice on life style changes
- During myocardial perfusion scanning
- Standard Bruce protocol
- Pharmacological stress testing with adenosine
- Limitations: LBBB, limb amputation, clinical state of patient

## Echocardiogram
- Visualizes the structure of the heart
- Definitive in diagnosis of structural abnormalities:
  - Valvular heart lesions - stenosis/regurgitation
  - Cardiomyopathies - dilatation/hypertrophy
  - Pericardial diseases - effusion, constriction
  - Congenital abnormalities
  - Diseases of the aorta
- Key in planning and follow up of OHS
- Normal M-mode echo used to estimate EF (normal 55%)

[Include all echo images and examples from source files...]

## Cardiac Catheterization
- Diagnosis of complex congenital heart disease when echo inconclusive
- Assess pulmonary pressures before correction of VSD, ASD
- Determine significance of shunting in ASD
- Diagnosis of restrictive cardiomyopathy vs constrictive pericarditis
- Therapeutic applications: ASD closure, PBMV
- Assess LV systolic function, presence of LV thrombus during coronary angiography

## Coronary Angiography
- Confirm, assess severity of CAD
- Plan treatment of CAD
- PTCA - percutaneous coronary angioplasty

## Lab Investigations
- Cardiac enzymes - Key in diagnosis of ACS
  - Troponin I/T
  - Creatinine phosphokinase - CK-MB
- Others
  - U/E/C
  - RBS
  - Lipid profile
