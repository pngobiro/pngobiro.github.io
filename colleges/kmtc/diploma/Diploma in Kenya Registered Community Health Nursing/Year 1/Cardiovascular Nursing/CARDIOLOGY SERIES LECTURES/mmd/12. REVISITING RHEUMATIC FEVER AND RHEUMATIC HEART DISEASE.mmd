\section*{ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER}
- CARDIOLOGY LECTURES 3 ${ }^{\text {RD }}$ YEAR
- FEBRUARY 2009
- INTRODUCTION - Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a delayed, nonsuppurative sequela of a pharyngeal infection with the group A streptococcus (GAS). Following the initial pharyngitis, a latent period of two to three weeks occurs before the first signs or symptoms of ARF appear [1].

\section*{DEFINITIONS}
- Delayed nonsuppurative sequelae of upper respiratory tract infection with group A beta hemolytic streptococcus.
- Post infectious or connective tissue disease.
- A diffuse inflammatory disease of the connective tissue involving chiefly the heart, joints, blood vessels, and subcutaneous tissues.

\section*{IS IT STILL IMPORTANT?}
- Its incidence/prevalence- WHO 12 million people suffered RF\&RHD worldwide
- 3 million had CCF requiring repeated hospitalizations
- 1 million requiring surgery annually
- Mortality- 500,000 dead by one year
- Disability adjusted life year lost to RHD worldwide 173.4per 100,000 population

\section*{WHY IS THERE STILL A PROBLEM?}
- The same old problem
- The devastating new ones
- Chronic lack of resources
- Morbidity and Mortality in Paediatric population still high
- It is a preventable disease.

\section*{AETIOLOGY \& EPIDEMIOLOGY}
- Group A streptococcus the aetiologic precursor
- Role of constitutional and environmental factors unknown
- Familial susceptibility is significant
- Malnutrition, overcrowding and lower socioeconomic status seem to predispose to streptococcal infections and subsequent rheumatic attacks
- Risk factors for rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease
- Poverty and overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, lack of education and limited access to medical care for adequate diagnosis and treatment are recognised as contributing factors to rheumatic fever.
- top

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY Cont}
- In developed countries, control of RF followed by apparent resurges- a warning to the ever existing potential to the presence of disease
- Rates of decline related to
-use of antibiotics for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis,
-Improved economic standards
-Decreased crowding in schools and homes
-Increased availability of Health care
-Change in the virulence of the organism

Fig. 86-1. Schematic diagram showing the structure of the streptococcal cell wall. The firmbriae covered with lipoteichoic acid help the organism 1 the throat epithelium (adherence factor). These fimbriae, being projections from the protein layer of the cell wall, contain M-protein, it factor. Each of the different layers of the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane have been shown to cross-react with different an different structures of the mammalian heart, including the human heart.

\section*{Difficulty relating to nature of the disease}
- Varied clinical profile
- Sub-clinical course
- Lack of specific diagnostic test
- Accuracy of reporting cases of RF \& RHD
- Major criteria
- Carditis: This occurs in as many as $40 \%$ of patients and may include cardiomegaly, new murmur, congestive heart failure, and pericarditis, with or without a rub and valvular disease.
- Migratory polyarthritis: This condition occurs in 75\% of cases and is polyarticular, fleeting, and involves the large joints.
- Subcutaneous nodules (ie, Aschoff bodies): These nodules occur in 10\% of patients and are edematous, fragmented collagen fibers. They are firm, painless nodules on the extensor surfaces of the wrists, elbows, and knees.
- Erythema marginatum: This condition occurs in about 5\% of cases. The rash is serpiginous and long lasting.
- Chorea (also known as Sydenham chorea and "St Vitus dance"): This characteristic movement disorder occurs in 5-10\% of cases. Sydenham chorea consists of rapid, purposeless movements of the face and upper extremities. Onset may be delayed for several months and may cease when the patient is asleep.
- Minor criteria
- Clinical findings include arthralgia, fever and previous history of ARF
- Laboratory findings include elevated acute phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein), a prolonged PR interval, and supporting evidence of antecedent group A streptococcal infections (ie, positive throat culture or rapid streptococcal screen and an elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titer).

\section*{Duration of secondary prophylaxis}
- Influenced by
- Age of patient,
- Presence of RHD,
- Time elapsed from the first attack,
- The number of previous attacks,
- The degree of crowding in the family,
- A family history of RHD,
- Socioeconomic and educational status of the individual,
- The risk of streptococal infection in the area
- Whether the patient is willing to the injections The occupation and place of employment of the patient school teacher, physcians, employees in crowded areas)

\section*{suggested duration of Secondary prophylaxis (WHO)}

\section*{Category of Patient - Duration of Prophyla}

Pt without proven carditis - 10 yrs after last attack
(Or mild or healed carditis)

More severe valve disease - Lifelong

After valve surgery - Life long

\section*{prevention\& control of RF \& RHD}
- Goals
- - Reduce morbidity, disability \& mortality from RHD
- Assessment of prevalence of RF/RHD
- Implement programmes through ministry of Health and Ministry of Education

\section*{Health Care In Underdeveloped Countries}
- Partial coverage of health care
- Low quality of that care which exists
- Imperfect conditions for scientific research
- Deficient registration of the complications occurring in the various subsystem
- Inaccurate decisions that the disease is disappearing
