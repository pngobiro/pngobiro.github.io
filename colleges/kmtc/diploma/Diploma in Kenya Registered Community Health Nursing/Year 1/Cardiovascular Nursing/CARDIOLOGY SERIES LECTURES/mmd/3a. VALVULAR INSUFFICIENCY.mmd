\section*{AORIIC REGURGIIATION}

\section*{Background:}
- Primary disease of the aortic valve leaflets, the wall of the aortic root, or both may cause aortic regurgitation (AR).

\section*{Pathophysiology:}
- Chronic AR produces LV volume overload that leads to a series of compensatory changes, including LV enlargement and eccentric hypertrophy.
- The enlarged ventricle is more compliant and is well suited to deliver a larger stroke volume to compensate for the regurgitant aortic flow. It can also accommodate an increased EDV.
- Wall thicKness must increase to compensate for the increased ventricular dimensions. These compensatory changes are necessary to minimize or normalize wall stress according to the LAPLACE LAW
- Wall tension/stress is related to the product of intra-ventricular pressure and radius divided by wall thickness).
- Hypertrophy observed in a volume-overload state usually is eccentric, as opposed to concentric hypertrophy observed in a pressure-overload state (i.e., aortic stenosis).
- The increased myocardial mass in a hypertrophic heart enables individual sarcomeres to shorten to a normal degree.
- As long as $\mathcal{L V}$ wall stress is maintained in the normal range, the $\mathcal{L V}$ preload reserve, contractility, and ejection fraction ( $\mathcal{E F}$ ) remain within the normal range. This is the chronic compensated stage. During this phase of the disease, most patients remain asymptomatic for decades because chronic AR generally is a slow and insidious disease with very low morbidity during a long asymptomatic phase.
- With time, transition from a compensated to a decompensated state marks the progression of the disease. Progressive $\mathcal{L V}$ enlargement beyond that required by the valvular regurgitation occurs and is associated with a change of the LV from an elliptical shape to a spherical shape.
- The cause of this pathologic dilatation is not well understood, but loss of the collagen support system that acts as a skeleton for the heart may play a substantial role. These maladaptive changes in the interstitial of the heart are an intricate part of the $\mathcal{L} \mathcal{V}$ hypertrophy process.
- In addition, diminished coronary flow reserve in this hypertrophied ventricle is thought to result in chronic sub-endocardial ischemia, even in the absence of epi-cardial coronary artery disease (CAD). Eventually, sub-endocardial necrosis and fibrosis occur, along with disruption of the collagen support system, with loss of $\mathcal{L V}$ systolic function.
- The neuro- hormonal response complicates the disease state further by its excessive growth stimuli, which are thought to be partially responsible for apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the remaining functional myocytes.
- The vicious cycle continues until the decompensated stage develops over many years. Progressive LV enlargement, spherical LV shape, increased wall stress, decline in the contractility and $\mathcal{E F}$, increased afterload, and decreased diastolic compliance with a rise in end-diastolic pressure characterize this stage. Frequently, development of congestive symptoms heralds this stage, but an insidious deterioration of ventricular function may occur without overt clinical signs.
- In ACUIE AR, the normal- sized left ventricle poorly tolerates the sudden large volume imposed on it. The left ventricle poorly accommodates the abrupt increase in end-diastolic volume, and diastolic
filling pressure increases rapidly and dramatically. This leads to an acute decrease in forward stroke volume, and, although tachycardia develops as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output, this often is insufficient. The rise in LV filling pressure is transmitted to the left atrium, pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillaries, leading to pulmonary edema and congestion. Acute AR usually is severe and rapidly leads to LV decompensation and/or failure and cardiogenic shock

\section*{PHOSICAL SIGNS}
- Hemo- dynamically severe AR causes a widened pulse pressure, often greater than $100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathcal{H g}$, associated with a low diastolic pressure, often less than $60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathcal{H g}$.
- The de Musset sign is when patients' heads frequently bob with each heartbeat.
- The Corrigan pulse is when patients' pulses are of the water-hammer or collapsing type, with abrupt distention and quick collapse.
- The Quincke sign is when light transmitted through the patient's fingertip shows capillary pulsations.
- The Hill sign is when popliteal cuff systolic pressure exceeds brachial cuff pressure by more than 60 mm $\mathcal{H g}$.
- The Duroziez sign is when a systolic murmur is heard over the femoral artery when compressed proximally and when a diastolic murmur is heard when the femoral artery is compressed distally.
- The MÃ¼ller sign is systolic pulsations of the uvula.
- The Traube sign (also called pistol-shot sounds) refers to booming systolic and diastolic sounds heard over the femoral artery.
- The apical impulse in chronic AR is diffuse, hyper- dynamic, and displaced inferiorly and leftward.
- $S_{3}$ gallop correlates with development of $\mathcal{L V}$ dysfunction.
- The typical diastolic murmur of AR has a decrescendo shape. A figh-frequency early diastolic murmur often occurs in mild $\mathcal{A R}$, whereas a rough holo-diastolic or decrescendo diastolic murmur occurs more commonly in severe AR. The volume and velocity of blood across the incompetent aortic valve tapers off in mid-to-last diastole as the aortic and $L \mathcal{V}$ pressures equilibrate. The diastolic murmur of $\mathcal{A} \mathcal{R}$ is usually best heard adjacent to the sternum in the second to fourth left intercostal space. $\mathcal{A}$ concomitant systolic ejection murmur is common in moderate-to-severe $\mathcal{A R}$
- The murmur associated with acute AR may not be impressive. If cardiac decompensation is present, the diastolic murmur of acute $\mathcal{A R}$ may be very soft and surprisingly short.
- Antegrade flow across the mitral valve is thought to cause an Austin Flint murmur, which is a midand late-diastolic apical low-frequency murmur or rumble. The rumble occurs during rapid closure of the mitral valve as flow velocity is increasing across the valve and $\mathcal{L V}$ diastolic pressure is rising rapidly because of severe aortic reflux. Its presence indicates severe $\mathcal{A} \mathcal{R}$.

\section*{MITRAL REGURGILAITON}

\section*{MITRAL REGURGITAITON}

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is characterized by an abnormal reversal of blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium.

\section*{Patflopfysiology:}
-The mitral or bicuspid atrioventricular is composed of the mitral annulus, papillary muscles, chordae tendineae the leaflets.
-Abnormalities in any of these structures can cause $\mathcal{M R}$. The leaflets are continuous with each other at their lines of attachment, called commissures, and are tethered to the left ventricle by the chordae tendineae.
-Chordae tendineae attach to papillary muscles and prevent prolapse of the mitral valve leaflet to prevent reflux of blood into the left atrium.
-MR can be caused by organic disease or a functional lesion (i.e., a normal valve may regurgitate [leak] because of global annular dilatation, focal myocardial dysfunction, or both).
- Congenital MR is rare but is commonly associated with myxomatous mitral valve disease and can be associated with cleft of the mitral valve in persons with Down syndrome.
-In acute mitral valve regurgitation, the incompetent mitral valve allows the ventricular ejection fraction to reflux into the left atrium.
-This volume overload is intensified by the inability of the atrium and ventricle to immediately dilatate, resulting in elevated left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures and acute pulmonary edema.
- The net reduction in forward stroke volume reduces systemic perfusion, can result in hemodynamic deterioration, and can lead to cardiogenic shock. -In chronic mitral valve regurgitation, the distensibility of the left atrium and ventricle are increased over time.
- This dilatation of the left atrium decreases left atrial pressures, thus increasing preload. The left ventricle dilatates and, via the process of eccentric hypertrophy, generates a larger stroke volume without a significant rise
The $\mathcal{L V}$ dilatation may further profibit the coaptation of the mitral valve leaflets during systolic ejection, leading to progression of $\mathcal{L} \mathcal{V}$ dilatation and overload.
-Patients with compensated $\mathcal{M R}$ may remain asymptomatic for years despite the presence of severe volume overload.
-Ultimately, most people with MR decompensate over the long term.
Morbidity: $\mathcal{N}$ atural Fistory studies of patients with rheumatic $\mathcal{M R}$ have shown 5- and 10-year survival rates of 80\% and 60\%, respectively. Sex: MR is independently associated with female sex.
Age: MR is independently associated advanced age

\section*{Imaging Studies:}
1.Chest radiography
-Evidence of $\mathcal{L V}$ enlargement due to volume overload may be observed, although pulmonary congestion, represented by increased pulmonary markings, may not be observed until heart failure has developed.
-Left atrial enlargement also may be observed as a prominence along the right sternal border.
2.Echocardiograph
3.Electrocardiography
-Acute MR is often accompanied by MI
- LV dilatation and hypertrophy
- Left atrial enlargement in chronic mitral valve regurgitation produces a negative $\mathcal{P}$ wave in lead $\mathcal{V}_{1}$, but atrial fibrillation may be observed in the late stages.
4.Cardiac catheterization
- Left ventriculography confirms mitral valve regurgitation by demonstrating a flow of contrast into the left atrium.
- LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions can be measured and used to calculate the ejection fraction
--Catheterization can also help detect lesions within the aortic valve, coexistent coronary artery disease through selective coronary artery injection, and other cardiac anomalies such as septal defects

\section*{MAN(AGEMENT}

Medical therapy
1. Afterload-reducing agents, such as nitrates and antihypertensive drugs, are helpful for maintaining the forward-flow state in persons with mitral valve regurgitation.
2.If atrial fibrillation is encountered, digitalis therapy is considered.
3.Similar to other valvular diseases, prophylactic antibiotics are administered prior to any interventional treatment. However, the current American Heart Association guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis in patients with mitral prolapse indicate that patients with no murmur and normal leaflets are at low risk; therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary.
4.In late-stage mitral valve regurgitation, heart failure develops; diuretics and inotropic agents are administered, and consultation with a specialist in cardiothoracic surgery is arranged.
5. The use of balloon counterpulsation should be considered as a preoperative measure

\section*{Surgical Care:}

Indications for surgical interventi
1.Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) with congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock
2.Class III/IV symptoms (ie, patient symptomatic while at rest or with minimal activity)
3.Class I/II (few or no) symptoms with evidence of deteriorating LV function as evidenced by
- an ejection fraction less than 0.55,
- fractional shortening less than 30\%
- either the end-diastolic diameter approaching 75 mm or the end-systolic diameter approaching 50 mm
4.Systemic emboli
5.End-systolic volume index greater than $60 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ - Most commonly used parameter

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{History:}
-Mitral regurgitation can be tolerated for many years.
-The initial symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue can rapidly progress to orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
-Patients with anginal-type pain may have underlying ischemia.
-In those with Mitral Valve Prolapse, palpitations and atypical chest pain are the most frequent complaints. Two thirds are female, often with an underlying panic disorder.
-With underlying coronary artery disease (CAD), regurgitation usually is associated with symptoms of angina pectoris.
-Regurgitation also can develop acutely with myocardial infarction, secondary to papillary muscle rupture..
-When mitral regurgitation is due to left ventricular dilatation and altered valve function, patients often have chronic left-sided heart failure.
-In acute mitral regurgitation from sudden disruption of the mitral valve, the symptoms are due to acute pulmonary edema.

\section*{Physical:}
-With chronic $\mathcal{M R}$, the characteristic holosystolic apical murmur, which radiates to the left axilla and sternal border, may be accompanied by a ventricular gallop (signifying $\mathcal{L V}$ dysfunction) followed by an early diastolic rumble caused by the large inflow of blood from a dilatated left atrium. -If the $\mathcal{M R}$ is caused by $\mathcal{L V}$ dilatation and depressed ventricular contractile function, this murmur may be mid, late, or holosystolic and may be accompanied by the aforementioned $\mathcal{L V}\left(\mathcal{S}_{3}\right)$ gallop. In this setting, the murmur is usually grade II/VI or less.
-With acute mitral valve regurgitation, a harsh murmur, usually grade III or IV/VI, is heard and is accompanied by a palpable thrill at the apex of the heart.

\section*{Causes:}

\section*{Acute MR}
1.Ruptured chordae or papillary muscle due to acute myocardial infarction or trauma
2.Perforation of the mitral valve leaflet
3. Acute failure of a prosthetic valve

\section*{Chronic MR}
1.Rheumatic heart disease
2.Mitral valve prolapse
3.Coronary artery disease
4.Annular calcification
5. Connective-tissue disorder-Eflers-Danlos syndrome

Marfan syndrome, Osteogenesis imperfecta ,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
6.LV dilatation
7.Prosthetic valves

\section*{Surgical options}
-Mitral valve reconstruction with mitral annuloplasty, quadratic segmental resection, shortening of the elongated chordae, or posterior leaflet resection
-Mitral valve replacement with either a mechanical valve (requiring lifelong anticoagulation) or a bioprosthetic porcine valve

\section*{MITRAL STENOSIS}

\section*{Introduction}
-Mitral stenosis (MS) is a narrowing of the inlet valve into the left ventricle that prevents proper opening during diastolic filling.
-Mitral valve leaflets that are typically thickened, commissures that are fused, and/or chordae tendineae that are thickened and shortened.
-The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever (RF).
-After the initial episode of RF, a latency period of 20-40 years occurs until the onset of symptoms. The natural history of mitral stenosis is typically progressive, with a slow and stable course early on, followed by progressive acceleration in the later years.

\section*{Pathophysiology:}
-The serum of patients with RF contains antibodies to the type 5 streptococcal M protein, which cross-reacts with myocardial tissue.
-Pathologic examination of the mitral valve at this time reveals proliferation of fibroblasts and macrophages.
-Subsequent disease may occur as a consequence :
1) Healing of the rheumatic process
2) Sub clinical repetitive rheumatic insults
3) Chronic rheumatic activity
4) Progressive hemodynamic stresses on the traumatized valve
-Some patients experience a chronic stable disease, while others have an accelerated course necessitating early surgical intervention.
-The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is $4-6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, Narrowing of the valve area to less than $2.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ impedes the free flow of blood and causes a build up of left atrial pressure (LAP) to promote normal transmitral flow volume.
-Critical mitral stenosis occurs when the opening is reduced to $\mathbf{1} \mathbf{~ c m}^{2}$. At this stage, a LAP of 25 mm Hg is required to maintain a normal cardiac output.
-With progressive stenosis, critical flow restriction reduces left ventricular output.
-The increase in LAP also enlarges the left atrium and raises pulmonary venous and capillary pressures.
- As the disease evolves, chronic elevation of LAP eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid and pulmonary valve incompetence, and secondary right heart failure.

\section*{Prevalence}

Both RF and mitral stenosis remain common in developing nations, and progression of mitral stenosis tends to be more rapid .

\section*{Mortality/Morbidity:}

Overall, the 10 -year survival of untreated patients with mitral stenosis is $50-60 \%$, depending on symptoms at presentation. -In untreated patients, the causes of death are as follows:
$\checkmark$ Progressive heart failure in 60-70\%
$\checkmark$ Systemic embolism in 20-30\%
$\checkmark$ Pulmonary embolism in 10\%
$\checkmark$ Infection in 1-5\%

-Jugular venous distention, ascites, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema may be noted.
-Auscultation may reveal a systolic murmur of TR, a Graham Steele murmur of Pulmonary Regurgitation (a high-pitched, decrescendo, early diastolic murmur of pulmonary insufficiency), and an $S_{4}$.
Physical examination
-Signs of left heart failure-Respiratory distress, evidence of pulmonary edema (eg rales),Digital clubbing
-Low volume pulse
-Pulse may be irregular due to artrial fibrillation.
-Cardiac examination of stenotic mitral valve (best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position)
- Observe for active precordium
- Feel the tapping apex-prominent $1^{\text {st }}$ heart sound
- Palpable diastolic thrill
- Prominent $1^{\text {st }}$ heart sound-(An accentuated $\mathrm{S}_{1}$ ) followed by $\mathrm{S}_{2}$
- Opening snap (OS)
- Characteristic mid-diastolic low-pitched, rumbling murmur best heard at the apex with the patient in left lateral position with the breath held in expiration and with the bell of the stethoscope.
-Large a waves in the jugular pulse indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid stenosis; with atrial fibrillation, the A wave is absent.
NB. Differentiating an Austin Flint murmur from a mitral stenosis rumble, since the quality of the murmurs is similar.
-The Austin Flint murmur is due to the convergence of the mitral orifice flow and the jet of aortic regurgitation, which results in audible turbulence.

\section*{ECG}

1-Left atrial enlargement: $\mathbf{P}$ mitrale, a wide ( $<\mathbf{0 . 1 2} \mathbf{~ s}$ ) and notched or bifid P wave in limb lead II.and/or a biphasic P wave in lead $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ with a wide negative deflection greater than 0.04 seconds.
NB.
-P-Pulmonale is a tall, peaked P wave (height at least 2.5 mm ) in limb lead II, associated with right atrial enlargement from either severe pulmonary hypertension or concomitant tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation.
2-Atrial fibrillation usually develops in the presence of preexisting left atrial enlargement.
3-With severe pulmonary hypertension, right-axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy can be seen.
The ECG of right ventricular hypertrophy typically shows tall R waves in the right chest leads, and the R wave may be taller than the S wave in lead $\mathrm{V}_{1}$.
4-In addition, right-axis deviation and right precordial T-wave inversions are often present.
Cardiac catheterization
-Measures absolute left- and right-sided pressure when pulmonary artery pressure elevation is out of proportion to mean gradient and valve area.
-Coronary angiography may be performed in selected patients.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Control symptoms
- Treat elevated pulmonary venous pressure
- LV systolic dysfunction
- Heart failure.

General
1-Bed rest-avoid strenuous physical activity.
2-Sodium intake should be restricted
3- Maintenance doses of oral diuretics? should be continued.
4-Beta-blockade may be useful for patients ONCE oedema cleared
ACE inhibitors for those in CCF
6-Manage atrial fibrillation Patients with atrial fibrillation are especially likely to show symptomatic improvement when heart rates are controlled with medication. Digoxin has been popular for rate control in atrial fibrillation
7-Rate control should be maintained with digitalis, a beta-blocker, or a calcium channel blocker. Digitalis works well but has a slow onset of action. A calcium channel blocker may become the preferred agent for its lower tendency to convert the rhythm and risk embolization.
7-Anticoagulation is necessary in patients who are unable to maintain normal sinus rhythm.
-Anticoagulation is also beneficial for cases with normal sinus rhythm with a prior embolic event or a left atrial dimension greater than 55 mm noted by echocardiography
- Patients with atrial fibrillation are especially likely to show symptomatic improvement when heart rates are controlled with medication. Digoxin has been popular for rate control in atrial fibrillation

Sex:
Although the attack rate for RF is roughly equal among genders, mitral stenosis is 2-3 times more common in women than in men.
Age:
Occasionally, patients can become symptomatic before age 20 years. Progression more rapid in the developing countries.
