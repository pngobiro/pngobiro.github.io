\section*{INVESTIGATIONS IN CARDIOLOGY}

\section*{DR. E. M. KARARI CARDIOLOGIST/LECTURER DEPT OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF NAIROBI}

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- Ix serve to confirm diagnosis
- Do not replace clinical skills
- Must be interpreted within the clinical context
- Include CXR, ECG (resting and stress), ECHO, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiogram, myocardial perfusion scans MRI, CT scan, LAB tests
- Always treat the patient not the result

\section*{CXR}
- Cardiac silhouette gives important information on size and state of heart
- Should occupy less than $1 / 2$ of hemi thorax
- Know the chambers forming the borders
- LT - LV
- RT-RA
- LT UPPER BORDER - LA/ pulmonary bay, aortic knuckle
- Lung fields - help differentiate cardiac and respiratory causes of dyspnoea e.g, pulmonary oedema / pl. effusion
- Ribs - e.g, notching in COA

\section*{- Cardiomegally}
- Right sided consolidation and effusion

\section*{MASSIVE CARDIOMEGALLY}

Differential diagnoses include:

Dilated cardiomyopathy

Pericardial effusion
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_2053d8e89922ed7846bcg-07.jpg?height=1000&width=1328&top_left_y=514&top_left_x=908)

\section*{ELECTROCARDIOGRAM}
- Very important
- SAN, atrial tissue, AVN, His purkinje system, Lt/Rt bundles, ventricular tissue
- Aids in diagnosis of
- Ischemic heart disease especially ACS
- Chamber enlargement
- Arrhythmias
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Pericardial disease - effusion
- Pulmonary thromboembolism

\section*{Arrhythmias \\ Diagnosis entirely based on ECG}
- Can arise from any part of the conduction system
- Classified depending on origin
- Supraventricular
- Ventricular
- Causes include
- Increased automaticity; ischaemia, chamber enlargement, heightened SNS activity
- Conduction abnormalities; degenerative disease/ischaemia at the AVN- Heart block
- Reentry e.g. WPW syndrome
- Sinus nodal dysfunction

\section*{Analyzing ECG}
- Key questions
- Are QRS complexes present?
- Are P waves present?
- How is the P wave related to the QRS complex?
- Is every P wave followed by a QRS complex with a normal P-R interval?
- What is the $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{R}$ interval?- heart rate
- What is the axis?

\section*{NSR}

Atrial bigeminy Atrial tigeminy in which each simus beat is followed by a premature atrial complex. The premature P waves (arrows) appear to be inverted in lead II, suggesting that they originate from a low atrial ectopic focus. Courtesy of Ary Goldberger, MD.

\section*{Atrial fibrillation}

Atrial fibrillation Lead $V 1$ showing coarse atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response. The two characteristic findings in AF are present: the very rapid atrial fibrillatory waves ( $f$ waves) which are variable in appearance; and the irregularly irregular ventricular response as the R-R interval between beats is unpredictable. Coarse atrial fibrillation may appear similar to atrial flutter. However, the variable height and duration of the $f$ waves differentiate them from atrial flutter (F) waves which are identical in appearance and occur at a constant rate of about 250 to 350 beats $/$ min. Courtesy of Ary Goldberger, MD.

\section*{Atrial fibrillation}

Coarse atrial fibrillation Coarse atrial fibrillatory waves are seen with an irregular ventricular response at a moderate rate. This arrhythmia may be mistaken for atrial flutter. However, the atrial waves are all identical in atrial flutter; in comparison, the rapid atrial waves vary in rate and shape from one section of the rhythm strip to the next in atrial fibrillation. Courtesy of Ary Goldberger, MD.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- Ix serve to confirm diagnosis
- Do not replace clinical skills
- Must be interpreted within the clinical context
- Include CXR, ECG (resting and stress), ECHO, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiogram, myocardial perfusion scans MRI, CT scan, LAB tests
- Always treat the patient not the result

\section*{CXR}
- Cardiac silhouette gives important information on size and state of heart
- Should occupy less than $1 / 2$ of hemi thorax
- Know the chambers forming the borders
- LT - LV
- RT- RA
- LT UPPER BORDER - LA/ pulmonary bay, aortic knuckle
- Lung fields - help differentiate cardiac and respiratory causes of dyspnoea e.g, pulmonary oedema / pl. effusion
- Ribs - e.g, notching in COA

Atrial fibrillation Lead V1 showing coarse atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response. The two characteristic findings in AF are present: the very rapid atrial fibrillatory waves ( $f$ waves) which are variable in appearance; and the irregularly irregular ventricular response as the R-R interval between beats is unpredictable. Coarse atrial fibrillation may appear similar to atrial flutter. However, the variable height and duration of the $f$ waves differentiate them from atrial flutter (F) waves which are identical in appearance and occur at a constant rate of about 250 to 350 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$.

LVH With strain pattern Precordial leads in a hpertensive patient with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The ECG far exceeds commonly used voltage criteria for LVH in the precordial leads: the S in V1 plus the R in VS equals So mm cupper limit of normal 35 mom. Voltage criteria alone may not be diagnostic of LVH.
However, the associated repolarization abnormality ("strain" pattern) in leads vs and Vo, characterized by downward sloping ST segment depression and T wave inversion. make LVH highly likely. Left atrial abnormality consistent with enlargement is also present as shown by the biphasic $P$ wave with a broad negative deflection in lead $V 1$. These changes can be induced by a chronic pressure laad chypertension or antic stemosis) or a chronic volume load (agrtic or mitral regurgitation or dilated cardiomynathy) Courtesy of Ary Galdberger.

INVESTIGATIONS IN CARDIOLOGY

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- Investigations serve to confirm a diagnosis and they do not replace clinical skills
- They must be interpreted within the clinical context
- They include:
- CXR
- ECG (resting and stress)
- Echocardiogram
- Cardiac catheterization
- Coronary angiogram
- Myocardial perfusion scans
- MRI
- CT scan
- LAB tests
- Always treat the patient and not the result

\section*{CXR}
- Cardiac silhouette gives important information on the size and state of the heart
- Should occupy less than half of the hemi-thorax
- Know the chambers forming the borders
- LEFT BORDER - LV
- RIGHT BORDER - RA
- LEFT UPPER BODDER - LA/Pulmonary bay, aortic knuckle
- Lung fields - help differentiate cardiac and respiratory causes of dyspnea e.g. pulmonary edema, pleural effusion
- Ribs - e.g. notching in Coarctation of the Aorta due to new anastomoses being formed.
- Enlargement of the Left Atrium is called spraying of the carina.

\section*{FIND CXRs SHOWING:}
- Dextro-cardia; situs inversus and a gastric bubble
- Cardiomegaly
- Dilated cardiomyopathy
- Consolidation
- Pericardial effusion

\section*{ECG}
- Very important
- CONDUCTION SYSTEM:
- SAN, atrial tissue, AVN, Hi Purkinje system, Lt/Rt bundles, ventricular tissue
- Aids in diagnosis of:
- IHD especially Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)
- The ECG is diagnostic.
- ACS:
- STEMI (Require thrombolysis within 6 hours max.)
- Non-ST segment Elevation MI (Do not get thrombolysis)
- Unstable Angina
- Chamber enlargement
- Arrhythmias
- Electrolyte imbalance
- Pericardial disease - effusion
- PTE

\section*{ANALYZING ECG: KEY QUESTIONS}
-What's the rhythm?
- Are P waves present?
- P waves represent atrial depolarization
- How is the P wave related to the QRS complex?
- $P$ waves should always precede the QRS complex
- Is every P wave followed by a QRS complex with a normal $\mathrm{P}-\mathrm{R}$ interval?
-What's the R-R interval? - HR/ventricular response
- 300 divide by the large squares = HR
- 1500 divide be the small squares = HR
-What's the axis?
- General direction of impulse flow
- Are ST segments normal?
- U waves are present in hypokalemia which can lead to cardiac arrest.

\section*{RULES DETERMINING A NORMAL ECG}
- They all have a positive QRS EXCEPT aVR and V1
- V1 is place at the right fourth interspace
- aVR is place on the right arm
- Therefore, for aVR and V1, the impulse is moving away
- V1 has a positive QRS if the RV becomes bigger than the LV since, in that case, the former's activation (from left to right) camouflages the latter's (from right to left)
- R-R interval should always be regular
- A P-wave should always precede a QRS complex
- There should be a pattern
- An irregular ECG is seen in AF.

\section*{FIND ECGs SHOWING:}
- Sinus bradycardia
- Seen in athletes and in deep sleep
- Sinus tachycardia
- Ventricular bigeminy
- Ventricular ectopic beats

\section*{AXIS CALCULATION}
- Lead II tends to move along the axis and is therefore used as the rhythm strip
- When finding the axis, use lead I and aVF.
- Demonstrate Right and Left Axis Deviation
- RAD is seen in Right Ventricular Hypertrophy
- LV strain - inverted T waves in V4, V6, aVL and LI

\section*{STRESS ECG}
- Done when a diagnosis of CAD is suspected
- Follow up post-ACS to assess exercise tolerance and advice on life-style changes
- During myocardial perfusion scanning
- Standard Bruce Protocol
- Pharmacological stress testing
- ? Adenosine
- Limitations; Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) - do perfusion scanning, Limb amputation, Clinical state of the patient etc.

\section*{ECHOCARDIOGRAM}
- Visualizes the structure of the heart
- Definitive in diagnosis of structural abnormalities of the heart:
- Valvular heart lesions
- Atrial Septal Defect
- Mitral stenosis
- A normal M - mode echo is used to estimate the contractility of the heart using the ejection fraction (EF) - normal is 55\%
- Color Doppler can be done for mitral regurgitation

\section*{CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION}
- Diagnosis of complex xongenital heart disease when echo is inconclusive e.g. COA Assess pulmonary pressures before correction of VSD and ASD
- Determine significance of shunting in ASD i.e. pulmonary/systemic flow ratio
- Diagnossis of restrictive cardiomyopathy vs. constrictive pericarditis
- Is therapeutic

\section*{CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY}
- Confirms and assesses the severity of CAD

\section*{LAB INVESTIGATIONS}
- Cardiac enzymes - key in diagnosis of ACS
- Troponin I/T
- Creatinine phosphokinase - CK-MB
- Others
- U/E/C
- RBS
- Lipid profile

- Presents with variety of symptoms affecting Heart,CNS,Skin and Joints
- Symptoms occur $2-3 \mathrm{wks}$ after initial attack of strep pharyngitis.
- Usually affects children, young adults peak 5-16yrs

\section*{Introd - cont}
- Recurrence is high unless prevention is instituted
- Main associated risk factor is crowding, hence a dz of low social economic popn groups.Rare in the west, common in dev countries
- 3\% of untreated strep pharyngitis will dev RF.
- Determined by serotypes of the group A strep present in the popn

\section*{PATOGENESIS}
- Exact mechanism unclear.
- Previously thought to be due to the direct action of the bacteria, or toxic effects of extra cellular products
- Now widely known to be an abnormal, or dysfunctional immune response to an extra cellular antigen prod by bacteria

\section*{Path - Cont}
- Toxicity due to antigenic mimicry
- Similarity betwn carbohydrate of bact cell wall \& glycoprotein of the tissues affected, or other molecular similarity betwn the bact and the tissue cell membrane
- The streptococcal bacterial cell wall has 'M' proteins, that are highly antigenic

\section*{Path - cont}
- A/bodies produced cross-react with cardiac myofibre protein myosin, smooth muscle cells of arteries, inducing cytokine release that causes tissue destruction.
- Inflammn occurs thro' direct attachment of complement and fc receptor mediated recruitment of MQ and Neutophills

\section*{Path -Cont}
- Profound morbidity results from affliction of the heart due to repeated inflammation alternating with fibrinous resolution
- Cardinal anatomical changes of the Heart valves include thickenning,fussion.shotenning of the tendinous cords - RHD

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Presents with variety of symptoms that may include :
- Fever,
- anorexia,
- lethargy and
- joint pains,
- skin rashes, subcutaneous nodules
- CVS symptoms
- neurological manifestations

\section*{(1) CVS}
- Pancarditis - endocarditis,myocarditis,pericarditis

- Other hazards include embolization,Infective endocarditis

\section*{(2) CNS manifestations}
- Occurs in $10 \%$ of the patients
- Usually a late manifestation. Latent period varies. May occur 3mths after episode of RF,or even several decades later.
- Chorea, speech abnormalities
- Pts should be given prophylaxis to prevent further attacks

\section*{(3) Migratory Polyarthritis}
- Early feature
- Associated with high titres of strep antibodies
- Present in $75 \%$ of pts
- Characterized by acute,painful,assymetric and migratory inflammation of large joints (knees,elbow,wrist,ankle)
- Does not affect small joints of the hands,feet
- Joints are affected in quick succession

\section*{(4) Subcutaneous nodules}
- Rare,occurs in 10\% of cases

- ASO titres,levels >200u(adults) ,>300 Children
- CXR: cardiomegally,pulmonary congestion
- ECG: prolonged QRS interval, heart block
- Echocardiography: Cardiac dilatation,valve abnormalities

\section*{DIAGNOSIS}
- Involves clinical assessment and Lab Investigations
- Clinical dx - utilizes the modified Jones criteria (after Duckett Jones, pub 1944)

\section*{MBchB IV}

\section*{DR. LOICE MUTAI PAEDIATRICIAN CARDIOLOGIST}

\section*{RHEUMATIC FEVER}

Definition ; RHF is an inflammatory ds which occurs as a delayed sequel to pharyngeal throat infection by $\mathcal{B}$-hemolytic strep of Lancefield gp A after latency period of about 34 weeks.
-The pharyngitis is often purulent.
>M Serotypes3,5,18,19,24 have been frequently associated with RHF.
- Not all strains in these serotypes are

\section*{RHEUMATIC FEVER}
- Rheumatic process is an inflammatory reaction involving multiple organs- Joints, skin, brain and the heart.
- The usual manifestations in the acute form are ; Migratory polyarthritis, fever and carditis.
> Other manifestations are ; Sydenham's Chorea, subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum.

\section*{RHEUMATIC FEVER}
${ }^{\text {- Joints, skin and brain involvement is }}$ normally self limited.
- Cardiac involvement can lead to severe and life threatening acute inflammation or to a chronic disease that results in permanent cardiac scarring and dysfunction.

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}
- Untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis precipitates an attack of RF in 2-3 \% of individuals who've not had previous attack of RF. These individuals have genetic predisposition.
- Some studies have emphasized relationship between occurrence of Rheumatic fever and severity of clinical manifestations of antecedent streptococcal pharyngitis.

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}
- However $1 / 3$ of all cases of acute RF follow mild or almost asymptomatic phargngitis. Some patients with Rheumatic heart disease have no history of pharyngitis.
- Initial attacks of Rheumatic Fever are encountered between ages 6 and 15 years in developed world. In developing countries it seen at younger ages - up to 4 yrs .

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}
- Increased incidences of RF has been seen in young adults who're at risk of strep pharyngitis e.g. military recruits and parents of school age children.
- No sexual preference

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}
- Racial and ethnic differences in incidence of RF have been described ;
- e.g. in New Zealand there's higher incidence among the Maori population.
- In the U.S. it is more common among African and Hispanic American than in caucasians.

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}
- Incidence of RF higher in developing countries. In developed world incidence was $0.5-3.1 / 100,000$ at the turn of the century.
- In developing countries mortality from RHD is 10x higher than in the developed world.
- Some of the factors which influence this are: Crowding in homes and schools Availability of health care Health seeking behavior.

\section*{Host susceptibility}
- Only 2-3\% of individuals who've suffered strep pharyngitis develope RF. However in patients who've had RF previously, incidence is 50\%
- Genetic susceptibility is mediated by single recessive gene. Examination of human lymphocytes has revealed presence of a specific B cell alloantigen in 99 \% of patients with RF and only $14 \%$ in controls.

\section*{Host susceptibility}
-There is high incidence of class II human leucocyte (HLA) in patients with RF.

\section*{PATHOGENESIS}

\section*{Mechanism of Tissue injury}
- Thought to result from immune reaction
- Kaplan et al showed that common antigenic determinants were shared between group A streptococci and myocardial tissue

\section*{Antigenic mimicry}
- Antibodies produced against strep cross react with host tissue leading to tissue damage.
- Strep M protein and myocardial sarcolemma have immunologic cross-reactivity.

\section*{Antigenic mimicry}
- Similar cross reactivity has been seen between a protoplast membrane antigen and sarcolemmal membrane of myocardium.
- Other immunologic cross reactions:

Streptococcal glycoprotein $\rightarrow$ valvular
glycoprotein
Strep protoplast $\rightarrow$ Neuronal tissue membrane of subthalamic and caudate nuclei.
Hyaluronate of capsule $\rightarrow \quad$ articular cartilage

\section*{PATHOLOGY}
- Inflamatory reaction in RhF involves connective or collagen tissue. Most tissues of body maybe involved but clinically important manifestations primarily involve joints, heart and brain.

\section*{SKIN}
- Skin rash reflects presence of vasculitis mainly involving small vessels. Vessels show proliferation of endothelial cells.
- Subcutaneous nodules rarely seen in acute Rh fever.

\section*{PATHOLOGY}

Subcutaneous Nodules
-Seen more in chronic valvular heart DS e.g. mitral stenosis.
-Subcutaneous nodules consists of central fibrinoid recrosis surrounded by epithelial \& mononuclear cells.
-Lession similar to that described for Aschoff body (pathologic hallmark of Rheumatic Carditis)

\section*{PATHOLOGY}

\section*{CARDIAC INVOLVEMENT}

In acute Rh fever, process often involves endocardium and myocardium. Pericardium may get involved in severe myocarditis.

\section*{PATHOLOGY}

\section*{PANCARDITIS}
- Histological findings not specific. Degree of histological change doesn't correlate with severity of clinical findings.
- In early stages when cardiac dilation is a prominent feature, histological changes maybe minimal though cardiac function maybe so severely impaired as to be fatal.
- As inflamatory rxn progresses, exudative and proliferative reaction becomes more apparent.

\section*{PANCARDITIS}
- Oedematous changes occur in the tissues followed by a cellular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Lymphocytes are predorminatly CD4 type.
- Fibrinoid (eosinophilic granular substance) is seen scattered in the tissue, includes collagen fibres plus granular material derived from degenerating collagen in a mixture of fibrin, globulin and other substances.

\section*{PANCARDITIS}
- Other tissues affected by disease process e.g. joint tissue may show fibrinoid necrosis.
- Aschoff cell (Aschoff body) formation follows the above stage.
- Lession consists of a perivascular infiltrate of large cells with polymorphous nuclei and basophilic cytoplasm arranged in a rossette around the centre of fibrinoid.
- It is pathognomonic of Rheumatic carditis. Commonly found at IVS, LV wall and LA appendage.

\section*{PATHOLOGY}
- Aschoff body not found in acute Rheumatic carditis but rather in patients with chronic disease.

\section*{ENDOCARDITIS}

Affects valvular tissue and mitral endocardium. Mitral valve involvement is commonest. Aortic involvement is $2^{\text {nd }}$ and much less frequent and pulmonary valve is rarely involved.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
- Acute Rheumatic Carditis is manifested by appearance of heart murmurs.
- In severe cases signs and symptoms of pericarditis and CCF will be eveident.
- Death from heart failure may occur in the acute phase of ds.
- Permanent valvular damage may occur.
- Carditis may range from a fulminating fatal course to a low grade subclinical inflammation.

\section*{CARDITIS}
- Hence in pts whose RhF is manifested only as mild carditis, ds is often missed until later in life when they are found to have RHD ds.In such pts no definite hx of RhF can be established.
- Pts with acute carditis may manifest with tachycardia, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, changing heart murmurs

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{ARTHRITIS}
-The classic attack of RhF appears as acute migratory polyarthritis anf fever.
-Large joints of upper and lower limbs are most frequently affected in a migratory manner.
-Sometimes several joints are involved at the same time.
${ }^{\mathrm{t}}$ This is usually associated with high ESR.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

\section*{Subcutaneous Nodules}
-Small pea-sizes painless swellings over bony prominences.
- Often not noticed.
- Usually appear on extensor tendons of hands and feet, elbows,margins of patellae, scalp, scapulae, vertebrae etc.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
- Erythema Marginatum
- Erythematous rash with clear centres and round or serpiginous margins.
- They occur on trunk and proximal part of extremeties and never on the face.
- Rash is transient and migratory.
- It is non-pruritic and not indurated.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Chorea
- Sydenham's chorea, St Vitus' dance.
"Disorder of the CNS ; Sudden aimless irregular movements often associated with muscle weakness and emotional instability.
-Often a late manifestation which appears long after other features of acute RhF have subsided.
'Onset gradual. Symptoms subside during sleep.

\section*{RHEUMATIC FEVER}

Definition ; RHF is an inflammatory ds which occurs as a delayed sequel to pharyngeal throat infection by $\mathscr{B}$-hemolytic strep of Lancefield gp A after latency period of about 3-4 weeks.
- The pharyngitis is often purulent.
- M Serotypes3,5,18,19,24 have been frequently associated with RHF.
- Not all strains in these serotypes are rheumatogenic

\section*{RHEUMATIC FEVER}
- Rheumatic process is an inflammatory reaction involving multiple organs- Joints, skin, brain and the heart.
- The usual manifestations in the acute form are ; Migratory polyarthritis, fever and carditis.
- Other manifestations are ; Sydenham's Chorea, subcutaneous nodules and erythema marginatum.

\section*{RHEUMATIC FEVER}

Joints, skin and brain involvement is normally self limited.

Cardiac involvement can lead to severe and life threatening acute inflammation or to a chronic disease that results in permanent cardiac scarring and dysfunction.

However $1 / 3$ of all cases of acute RF follow mild or almost asymptomatic phargngitis. Some patients with Rheumatic heart disease have no history of pharyngitis.

Initial attacks of Rheumatic Fever are encountered between ages 6 and 15 vears in developed world. In developing countries it seen at younger ages - up to 4 yrs .

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}

Increased incidences of RF has been seen in voung adults who're at risk of strep pharyngitis e.g. military recruits and parents of school age children.
- No sexual preference

- Racial and ethnic differences in incidence of RF have been described;
- e.g. in New Zealand there's higher incidence among the Maori population.
- In the U.S. it is more common among African and Hispanic American than in caucasians.

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY}

Incidence of RF higher in developing countries. In developed world incidence was $0.5-3.1 / 100,000$ at the turn of the century. In developing countries mortality from RHD is $10 x$ higher than in the developed world.

Some of the factors which influence this are:
Crowding in homes and schools Availability of health care
Health seeking behavior.

\section*{Host susceptibility}
- Only 2-3\% of individuals who've suffered strep pharyngitis develope RF. However in patients who've had RF previously, incidence is 50\%
- Genetic susceptibility is mediated by single recessive gene. Examination of human lymphocytes has revealed presence of a specific B cell alloantigen in 99 \% of patients with RF and only 14 \% in controls.

- It is pathognomonic of Rheumatic carditis. Commonly found at IVS. LV wall and LA appendage.

\section*{PATHOLOGY}

Aschoff bodv not found in acute Rheumatic carditis but rather in patients with chronic disease.

\section*{ENDOCARDITIS}

Affects valvular tissue and mitral endocardium. Mitral valve involvement is commonest. Aortic involvement is $2^{\text {nd }}$ and much less frequent and pulmonary valve is rarely involved.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
- Acute Rheumatic Carditis is manifested by appearance of heart murmurs.
- In severe cases signs and symptoms of pericarditis and CCF will be eveident.
- Death from heart failure may occur in the acute phase of ds.
- Permanent valvular damage may occur.
- Carditis may range from a fulminating fatal course to a low grade subclinical inflammation.

\section*{CARDITIS}
- Hence in pts whose RhF is manifested only as mild carditis, ds is often missed until later in life when they are found to have RHD ds.In such pts no definite hx of RhF can be established.
- Pts with acute carditis may manifest with tachycardia, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly, changing heart murmurs

\section*{Clinical features}

\section*{ARTHRITIS}
- The classic attack of RhF appears as acute migratory polyarthritis anf fever.
- Large joints of upper and lower limbs are most frequently affected in a migratory manner.
- Sometimes several joints are involved at the same time.
- This is usually associated with high ESR.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

\section*{Subcutaneous Nodules}
- Small pea-sizes painless swellings over bony prominences.
- Often not noticed.
- Usually appear on extensor tendons of hands and feet, elbows,margins of patellae, scalp, scapulae, vertebrae etc.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}
- Erythema Marginatum
- Erythematous rash with clear centres and round or serpiginous margins.
- They occur on trunk and proximal part of extremeties and never on the face.
- Rash is transient and migratory.
- It is non-pruritic and not indurated.

\section*{CLINICAL FEATURES}

Chorea
- Sydenham's chorea, St Vitus' dance.
- Disorder of the CNS ; Sudden aimless irregular movements often associated with muscle weakness and emotional instabilitv.
- Often a late manifestation which appears long after other features of acute RhF have subsided.
- Onset gradual. Symptoms subside during sleep.

failure. Digitalize ( $0-02-0.03 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) (TDD)
- Then maintenance $1 / 4$ TDD given in 2 doses daily

\section*{Severe carditis}
- Additional cardiac drugs maybe considered if response is not adequate.
- May use Lasix, aldactone.
- Bed rest: Recommended for acute carditis with slow resumption of normal activity.

\section*{ARTHRITIS}

\section*{AORIIC REGURGIIATION}

\section*{Background:}
- Primary disease of the aortic valve leaflets, the wall of the aortic root, or both may cause aortic regurgitation (AR).

\section*{Pathophysiology:}
- Chronic AR produces LV volume overload that leads to a series of compensatory changes, including LV enlargement and eccentric hypertrophy.
- The enlarged ventricle is more compliant and is well suited to deliver a larger stroke volume to compensate for the regurgitant aortic flow. It can also accommodate an increased EDV.
- Wall thicKness must increase to compensate for the increased ventricular dimensions. These compensatory changes are necessary to minimize or normalize wall stress according to the LAPLACE LAW
- Wall tension/stress is related to the product of intra-ventricular pressure and radius divided by wall thickness).
- Hypertrophy observed in a volume-overload state usually is eccentric, as opposed to concentric hypertrophy observed in a pressure-overload state (i.e., aortic stenosis).
- The increased myocardial mass in a hypertrophic heart enables individual sarcomeres to shorten to a normal degree.
- As long as $\mathcal{L V}$ wall stress is maintained in the normal range, the $\mathcal{L V}$ preload reserve, contractility, and ejection fraction ( $\mathcal{E F}$ ) remain within the normal range. This is the chronic compensated stage. During this phase of the disease, most patients remain asymptomatic for decades because chronic AR generally is a slow and insidious disease with very low morbidity during a long asymptomatic phase.
- With time, transition from a compensated to a decompensated state marks the progression of the disease. Progressive $\mathcal{L V}$ enlargement beyond that required by the valvular regurgitation occurs and is associated with a change of the LV from an elliptical shape to a spherical shape.
- The cause of this pathologic dilatation is not well understood, but loss of the collagen support system that acts as a skeleton for the heart may play a substantial role. These maladaptive changes in the interstitial of the heart are an intricate part of the $\mathcal{L} \mathcal{V}$ hypertrophy process.
- In addition, diminished coronary flow reserve in this hypertrophied ventricle is thought to result in chronic sub-endocardial ischemia, even in the absence of epi-cardial coronary artery disease (CAD). Eventually, sub-endocardial necrosis and fibrosis occur, along with disruption of the collagen support system, with loss of $\mathcal{L V}$ systolic function.
- The neuro- hormonal response complicates the disease state further by its excessive growth stimuli, which are thought to be partially responsible for apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the remaining functional myocytes.
- The vicious cycle continues until the decompensated stage develops over many years. Progressive LV enlargement, spherical LV shape, increased wall stress, decline in the contractility and $\mathcal{E F}$, increased afterload, and decreased diastolic compliance with a rise in end-diastolic pressure characterize this stage. Frequently, development of congestive symptoms heralds this stage, but an insidious deterioration of ventricular function may occur without overt clinical signs.
- In ACUIE AR, the normal- sized left ventricle poorly tolerates the sudden large volume imposed on it. The left ventricle poorly accommodates the abrupt increase in end-diastolic volume, and diastolic
filling pressure increases rapidly and dramatically. This leads to an acute decrease in forward stroke volume, and, although tachycardia develops as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output, this often is insufficient. The rise in LV filling pressure is transmitted to the left atrium, pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillaries, leading to pulmonary edema and congestion. Acute AR usually is severe and rapidly leads to LV decompensation and/or failure and cardiogenic shock

\section*{PHOSICAL SIGNS}
- Hemo- dynamically severe AR causes a widened pulse pressure, often greater than $100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathcal{H g}$, associated with a low diastolic pressure, often less than $60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathcal{H g}$.
- The de Musset sign is when patients' heads frequently bob with each heartbeat.
- The Corrigan pulse is when patients' pulses are of the water-hammer or collapsing type, with abrupt distention and quick collapse.
- The Quincke sign is when light transmitted through the patient's fingertip shows capillary pulsations.
- The Hill sign is when popliteal cuff systolic pressure exceeds brachial cuff pressure by more than 60 mm $\mathcal{H g}$.
- The Duroziez sign is when a systolic murmur is heard over the femoral artery when compressed proximally and when a diastolic murmur is heard when the femoral artery is compressed distally.
- The Müller sign is systolic pulsations of the uvula.
- The Traube sign (also called pistol-shot sounds) refers to booming systolic and diastolic sounds heard over the femoral artery.
- The apical impulse in chronic AR is diffuse, hyper- dynamic, and displaced inferiorly and leftward.
- $S_{3}$ gallop correlates with development of $\mathcal{L V}$ dysfunction.
- The typical diastolic murmur of AR has a decrescendo shape. A figh-frequency early diastolic murmur often occurs in mild $\mathcal{A R}$, whereas a rough holo-diastolic or decrescendo diastolic murmur occurs more commonly in severe AR. The volume and velocity of blood across the incompetent aortic valve tapers off in mid-to-last diastole as the aortic and $L \mathcal{V}$ pressures equilibrate. The diastolic murmur of $\mathcal{A} \mathcal{R}$ is usually best heard adjacent to the sternum in the second to fourth left intercostal space. $\mathcal{A}$ concomitant systolic ejection murmur is common in moderate-to-severe $\mathcal{A R}$
- The murmur associated with acute AR may not be impressive. If cardiac decompensation is present, the diastolic murmur of acute $\mathcal{A R}$ may be very soft and surprisingly short.
- Antegrade flow across the mitral valve is thought to cause an Austin Flint murmur, which is a midand late-diastolic apical low-frequency murmur or rumble. The rumble occurs during rapid closure of the mitral valve as flow velocity is increasing across the valve and $\mathcal{L V}$ diastolic pressure is rising rapidly because of severe aortic reflux. Its presence indicates severe $\mathcal{A} \mathcal{R}$.

\section*{MITRAL REGURGILAITON}

\section*{MITRAL REGURGITAITON}

Mitral regurgitation (MR) is characterized by an abnormal reversal of blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium.

-The mitral or bicuspid atrioventricular is composed of the mitral annulus, papillary muscles, chordae tendineae the leaflets.
-Abnormalities in any of these structures can cause $\mathcal{M R}$. The leaflets are continuous with each other at their lines of attachment, called commissures, and are tethered to the left ventricle by the chordae tendineae.
-Chordae tendineae attach to papillary muscles and prevent prolapse of the mitral valve leaflet to prevent reflux of blood into the left atrium.
-MR can be caused by organic disease or a functional lesion (i.e., a normal valve may regurgitate [leak] because of global annular dilatation, focal myocardial dysfunction, or both).
- Congenital MR is rare but is commonly associated with myxomatous mitral valve disease and can be associated with cleft of the mitral valve in persons with Down syndrome.
-In acute mitral valve regurgitation, the incompetent mitral valve allows the ventricular ejection fraction to reflux into the left atrium.
-This volume overload is intensified by the inability of the atrium and ventricle to immediately dilatate, resulting in elevated left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures and acute pulmonary edema.
- The net reduction in forward stroke volume reduces systemic perfusion, can result in hemodynamic deterioration, and can lead to cardiogenic shock. -In chronic mitral valve regurgitation, the distensibility of the left atrium and ventricle are increased over time.
- This dilatation of the left atrium decreases left atrial pressures, thus increasing preload. The left ventricle dilatates and, via the process of eccentric hypertrophy, generates a larger stroke volume without a significant rise
The $\mathcal{L V}$ dilatation may further profibit the coaptation of the mitral valve leaflets during systolic ejection, leading to progression of $\mathcal{L} \mathcal{V}$ dilatation and overload.
-Patients with compensated $\mathcal{M R}$ may remain asymptomatic for years despite the presence of severe volume overload.
-Ultimately, most people with MR decompensate over the long term.
Morbidity: $\mathcal{N}$ atural Fistory studies of patients with rheumatic $\mathcal{M R}$ have shown 5- and 10-year survival rates of 80\% and 60\%, respectively. Sex: MR is independently associated with female sex.
Age: MR is independently associated advanced age

\section*{Imaging Studies:}
1.Chest radiography
-Evidence of $\mathcal{L V}$ enlargement due to volume overload may be observed, although pulmonary congestion, represented by increased pulmonary markings, may not be observed until heart failure has developed.
-Left atrial enlargement also may be observed as a prominence along the right sternal border.
2.Echocardiograph
3.Electrocardiography
-Acute MR is often accompanied by MI
- LV dilatation and hypertrophy
- Left atrial enlargement in chronic mitral valve regurgitation produces a negative $\mathcal{P}$ wave in lead $\mathcal{V}_{1}$, but atrial fibrillation may be observed in the late stages.
4.Cardiac catheterization
- Left ventriculography confirms mitral valve regurgitation by demonstrating a flow of contrast into the left atrium.
- LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions can be measured and used to calculate the ejection fraction
--Catheterization can also help detect lesions within the aortic valve, coexistent coronary artery disease through selective coronary artery injection, and other cardiac anomalies such as septal defects

\section*{MAN(AGEMENT}

Medical therapy
1. Afterload-reducing agents, such as nitrates and antihypertensive drugs, are helpful for maintaining the forward-flow state in persons with mitral valve regurgitation.
2.If atrial fibrillation is encountered, digitalis therapy is considered.
3.Similar to other valvular diseases, prophylactic antibiotics are administered prior to any interventional treatment. However, the current American Heart Association guidelines for endocarditis prophylaxis in patients with mitral prolapse indicate that patients with no murmur and normal leaflets are at low risk; therefore, antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary.
4.In late-stage mitral valve regurgitation, heart failure develops; diuretics and inotropic agents are administered, and consultation with a specialist in cardiothoracic surgery is arranged.
5. The use of balloon counterpulsation should be considered as a preoperative measure

\section*{Surgical Care:}

Indications for surgical interventi
1.Acute mitral regurgitation (MR) with congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock
2.Class III/IV symptoms (ie, patient symptomatic while at rest or with minimal activity)
3.Class I/II (few or no) symptoms with evidence of deteriorating LV function as evidenced by
- an ejection fraction less than 0.55,
- fractional shortening less than 30\%
- either the end-diastolic diameter approaching 75 mm or the end-systolic diameter approaching 50 mm
4.Systemic emboli
5.End-systolic volume index greater than $60 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ - Most commonly used parameter

\section*{Clinical presentation}

\section*{History:}
-Mitral regurgitation can be tolerated for many years.
-The initial symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue can rapidly progress to orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
-Patients with anginal-type pain may have underlying ischemia.
-In those with Mitral Valve Prolapse, palpitations and atypical chest pain are the most frequent complaints. Two thirds are female, often with an underlying panic disorder.
-With underlying coronary artery disease (CAD), regurgitation usually is associated with symptoms of angina pectoris.
-Regurgitation also can develop acutely with myocardial infarction, secondary to papillary muscle rupture..
-When mitral regurgitation is due to left ventricular dilatation and altered valve function, patients often have chronic left-sided heart failure.
-In acute mitral regurgitation from sudden disruption of the mitral valve, the symptoms are due to acute pulmonary edema.

\section*{Physical:}
-With chronic $\mathcal{M R}$, the characteristic holosystolic apical murmur, which radiates to the left axilla and sternal border, may be accompanied by a ventricular gallop (signifying $\mathcal{L V}$ dysfunction) followed by an early diastolic rumble caused by the large inflow of blood from a dilatated left atrium. -If the $\mathcal{M R}$ is caused by $\mathcal{L V}$ dilatation and depressed ventricular contractile function, this murmur may be mid, late, or holosystolic and may be accompanied by the aforementioned $\mathcal{L V}\left(\mathcal{S}_{3}\right)$ gallop. In this setting, the murmur is usually grade II/VI or less.
-With acute mitral valve regurgitation, a harsh murmur, usually grade III or IV/VI, is heard and is accompanied by a palpable thrill at the apex of the heart.

\section*{Causes:}

\section*{Acute MR}
1.Ruptured chordae or papillary muscle due to acute myocardial infarction or trauma
2.Perforation of the mitral valve leaflet
3. Acute failure of a prosthetic valve

\section*{Chronic MR}
1.Rheumatic heart disease
2.Mitral valve prolapse
3.Coronary artery disease
4.Annular calcification
5. Connective-tissue disorder-Eflers-Danlos syndrome

Marfan syndrome, Osteogenesis imperfecta ,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
6.LV dilatation
7.Prosthetic valves

\section*{Surgical options}
-Mitral valve reconstruction with mitral annuloplasty, quadratic segmental resection, shortening of the elongated chordae, or posterior leaflet resection
-Mitral valve replacement with either a mechanical valve (requiring lifelong anticoagulation) or a bioprosthetic porcine valve

\section*{MITRAL STENOSIS}

\section*{Introduction}
-Mitral stenosis (MS) is a narrowing of the inlet valve into the left ventricle that prevents proper opening during diastolic filling.
-Mitral valve leaflets that are typically thickened, commissures that are fused, and/or chordae tendineae that are thickened and shortened.
-The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever (RF).
-After the initial episode of RF, a latency period of 20-40 years occurs until the onset of symptoms. The natural history of mitral stenosis is typically progressive, with a slow and stable course early on, followed by progressive acceleration in the later years.

\section*{Pathophysiology:}
-The serum of patients with RF contains antibodies to the type 5 streptococcal M protein, which cross-reacts with myocardial tissue.
-Pathologic examination of the mitral valve at this time reveals proliferation of fibroblasts and macrophages.
-Subsequent disease may occur as a consequence :
1) Healing of the rheumatic process
2) Sub clinical repetitive rheumatic insults
3) Chronic rheumatic activity
4) Progressive hemodynamic stresses on the traumatized valve
-Some patients experience a chronic stable disease, while others have an accelerated course necessitating early surgical intervention.
-The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is $4-6 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, Narrowing of the valve area to less than $2.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ impedes the free flow of blood and causes a build up of left atrial pressure (LAP) to promote normal transmitral flow volume.
-Critical mitral stenosis occurs when the opening is reduced to $\mathbf{1} \mathbf{~ c m}^{2}$. At this stage, a LAP of 25 mm Hg is required to maintain a normal cardiac output.
-With progressive stenosis, critical flow restriction reduces left ventricular output.
-The increase in LAP also enlarges the left atrium and raises pulmonary venous and capillary pressures.
- As the disease evolves, chronic elevation of LAP eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid and pulmonary valve incompetence, and secondary right heart failure.

\section*{Prevalence}

Both RF and mitral stenosis remain common in developing nations, and progression of mitral stenosis tends to be more rapid .

\section*{Mortality/Morbidity:}

Overall, the 10 -year survival of untreated patients with mitral stenosis is $50-60 \%$, depending on symptoms at presentation. -In untreated patients, the causes of death are as follows:
$\checkmark$ Progressive heart failure in 60-70\%
$\checkmark$ Systemic embolism in 20-30\%
$\checkmark$ Pulmonary embolism in 10\%
$\checkmark$ Infection in 1-5\%

-Jugular venous distention, ascites, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema may be noted.
-Auscultation may reveal a systolic murmur of TR, a Graham Steele murmur of Pulmonary Regurgitation (a high-pitched, decrescendo, early diastolic murmur of pulmonary insufficiency), and an $S_{4}$.
Physical examination
-Signs of left heart failure-Respiratory distress, evidence of pulmonary edema (eg rales),Digital clubbing
-Low volume pulse
-Pulse may be irregular due to artrial fibrillation.
-Cardiac examination of stenotic mitral valve (best at the apex with the patient in the left lateral recumbent position)
- Observe for active precordium
- Feel the tapping apex-prominent $1^{\text {st }}$ heart sound
- Palpable diastolic thrill
- Prominent $1^{\text {st }}$ heart sound-(An accentuated $\mathrm{S}_{1}$ ) followed by $\mathrm{S}_{2}$
- Opening snap (OS)
- Characteristic mid-diastolic low-pitched, rumbling murmur best heard at the apex with the patient in left lateral position with the breath held in expiration and with the bell of the stethoscope.
-Large a waves in the jugular pulse indicate the presence of pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid stenosis; with atrial fibrillation, the A wave is absent.
NB. Differentiating an Austin Flint murmur from a mitral stenosis rumble, since the quality of the murmurs is similar.
-The Austin Flint murmur is due to the convergence of the mitral orifice flow and the jet of aortic regurgitation, which results in audible turbulence.

\section*{ECG}

1-Left atrial enlargement: $\mathbf{P}$ mitrale, a wide ( $<\mathbf{0 . 1 2} \mathbf{~ s}$ ) and notched or bifid P wave in limb lead II.and/or a biphasic P wave in lead $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ with a wide negative deflection greater than 0.04 seconds.
NB.
-P-Pulmonale is a tall, peaked P wave (height at least 2.5 mm ) in limb lead II, associated with right atrial enlargement from either severe pulmonary hypertension or concomitant tricuspid stenosis or regurgitation.
2-Atrial fibrillation usually develops in the presence of preexisting left atrial enlargement.
3-With severe pulmonary hypertension, right-axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy can be seen.
The ECG of right ventricular hypertrophy typically shows tall R waves in the right chest leads, and the R wave may be taller than the S wave in lead $\mathrm{V}_{1}$.
4-In addition, right-axis deviation and right precordial T-wave inversions are often present.
Cardiac catheterization
-Measures absolute left- and right-sided pressure when pulmonary artery pressure elevation is out of proportion to mean gradient and valve area.
-Coronary angiography may be performed in selected patients.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}

Control symptoms
- Treat elevated pulmonary venous pressure
- LV systolic dysfunction
- Heart failure.

General
1-Bed rest-avoid strenuous physical activity.
2-Sodium intake should be restricted
3- Maintenance doses of oral diuretics? should be continued.
4-Beta-blockade may be useful for patients ONCE oedema cleared
ACE inhibitors for those in CCF
6-Manage atrial fibrillation Patients with atrial fibrillation are especially likely to show symptomatic improvement when heart rates are controlled with medication. Digoxin has been popular for rate control in atrial fibrillation
7-Rate control should be maintained with digitalis, a beta-blocker, or a calcium channel blocker. Digitalis works well but has a slow onset of action. A calcium channel blocker may become the preferred agent for its lower tendency to convert the rhythm and risk embolization.
7-Anticoagulation is necessary in patients who are unable to maintain normal sinus rhythm.
-Anticoagulation is also beneficial for cases with normal sinus rhythm with a prior embolic event or a left atrial dimension greater than 55 mm noted by echocardiography
- Patients with atrial fibrillation are especially likely to show symptomatic improvement when heart rates are controlled with medication. Digoxin has been popular for rate control in atrial fibrillation

Sex:
Although the attack rate for RF is roughly equal among genders, mitral stenosis is 2-3 times more common in women than in men.
Age:
Occasionally, patients can become symptomatic before age 20 years. Progression more rapid in the developing countries.

-The administration of amyl nitrite causes a marked transient fall in systemic vascular resistance, with an. increase in heart rate and stroke volume.
-A diastolic rumble caused by mitral stenosis will increase in intensity, whereas the Austin Flint murmur will decrease as the degree of aortic regurgitation is reduced by a fall in systemic blood pressure.
-It should not be given to patients with significant aortic stenosis, unstable angina pectoris, or other conditions in which even brief hypotension could exacerbate the condition.

\section*{INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS Definition}

Infective endocarditis is defined as a microbial colonization of the inner lining of the heart.
-Can involve valves, the mural endocardium, or a septal defect.
-The prototypic lesion is vegetation-is a mass of platelets, fibrin, microcolonies of microorganisms, and scant inflammatory cells.
-Endocarditis can be classified as:
a) Native valve (acute and subacute) endocarditis
b) Prosthetic valve (early and late) endocarditis
c) Endocarditis related to intravenous drug use

Native valve endocarditis (acute and subacute)
-Native valve acute endocarditis usually has an aggressive course.
-Virulent organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and group B streptococci
-Underlying structural valve disease may not be present.
-Sub acute endocarditis usually has a more indolent course than the acute form.
-Alpha-hemolytic streptococci or enterococci, usually in the setting of underlying structural valve disease, typically are the causative agents of this type of endocarditis.
Prosthetic valve endocarditis (early and late)
-Early prosthetic valve endocarditis occurs within 60 days of valve implantation. Staphylococci aureus and epidermidis, gram-negative bacilli, and Candida species are the common infecting organisms.
-Late prosthetic valve endocarditis occurs 60 days or more after valve implantation. Alpha-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, and staphylococci are the common causative organisms.
Endocarditis related to intravenous drug use
-Endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers commonly involves the tricuspid valve.
-S. aureus is the most common causative organism.
-Fungal colonization's also common eg Candida albicans.
Acute endocarditis is a hectically febrile illness, rapidly damages cardiac structures, hematogenously seeds extracardiac sites, and, if untreated, progresses to death within weeks.
Subacute endocarditis follows an indolent course; causes structural cardiac damage only slowly, if at all; rarely causes metastatic infection; and is gradually progressive unless complicated by a major embolic event or ruptured mycotic aneurysm.
Pathophysiology: Occur by-
1.Formation of thrombi on endocardium
2. Bacteremia (nosocomial or spontaneous) that delivers the organisms to the valve's surface
3.Adherence of the organisms
4.Eventual invasion of the valvular leaflets
-Infective endocarditis generally occurs as a consequence of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, which results from turbulence or trauma to the endothelial surface of the heart.
-Transient bacteremia then leads to seeding of lesions with adherent bacteria, and infective endocarditis develops.
4-Petechiae-Common but nonspecifie finding
-Pathologic effects due to infection can include local tissue destruction and embolic phenomena.
-In addition, secondary autoimmune effects, such as immune complex glomerulonephritis and vasculitis, can occur
-In acute IE, the thrombus may be produced by the invading organism (i.e., $S$ aureus) or by valvular trauma from intravenous catheters or pacing wires (i.e., NIE). $S$ aureus can invade the endothelial cells (endotheliosis) and increase the expression of adhesion molecules and of procoagulant activity on the cellular surface.
-Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis may result from stress, renal failure, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, or neoplasia.
-IE develops most commonly on the mitral valve, closely followed in descending order of frequency by the aortic valve, the combined mitral and aortic valve, the tricuspid valve, and, rarely, the pulmonic valve.
-Mechanical prosthetic and bioprosthetic valves exhibit equal rates of infection.
-The microorganisms that most commonly produce endocarditis (ie, S aureus; S viridans; group A, C, and G streptococci; enterococci) resist the bactericidal action of complement and possess fibronectin receptors for the surface of the fibrin-platelet thrombus.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

History- Highly variable
-Constitutional - Fever and chills are the most common symptoms
-Others- Anorexia, weight loss, malaise, headache, myalgias, night sweats, shortness of breath, cough, or joint pains are common complaints
-Symptoms may be due to primary cardiac effects or secondary embolic phenomena.
-Primary cardiac disease may present with signs of CCF
-Secondary phenomena -Focal neurologic complaints due to an embolic stroke or back pain associated with vertebral osteomyelitis.
-As many as 20\% of cases present with focal neurologic complaints and stroke syndromes.
-Dyspnea, cough, and chest pain are common complaints of intravenous drug users.
-This is likely related to the predominance of tricuspid valve endocarditis in this group and secondary embolic showering of the pulmonary vasculature.

\section*{Physical:}

1-Mild-moderate Pallor
2-Fever, possibly low-grade and intermittent, is present in $90 \%$ of patients.
3 Heart
-Heart murmurs -esp. Change in the characteristics of a previously noted murmur occurs
-Gallop rhythm.
-Signs of CCF, frequently are due to acute left-sided valvular insufficiency
- Distended neck veins
- Rales
- Cardiac arrhythmia-Pulse irregularity

\title{
HEAT FAILURE
}

BY PROF JOSHI

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Abnormality in cardiac structure or function resulting in the inability of the heart to fill with or eject blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues
- It is a syndrome characterized by dyspnea. Fatigue and fluid retention
- It is a progressive disorder of LV remodeling, usually resulting from an index event that culminates in a clinical syndrome characterized by impaired cardiac function and circulatory congestion

\section*{FORMS OF HEART FAILURE}
- Systolic: inability of the ventricles to contract normally and expel sufficient blood
- Diastolic: HF in patients with preserved systolic function; EF > 50\%
- Due to increased resistance to ventricular inflow -> reduced ventricular diastolic capacity or reduced ventricular relaxation
- Mostly abnormal or both contraction and relaxation

\section*{HF PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- Risk factors
- Myocardial injury (MI, HTN, VHD, Cardiomyopathy)
- Initial fall in LV performance - increase wall stress
- Activation of RAAS and SNS
- Fibrosis, apoptosis, hypertrophy, cellular and molecular alterations
- Hemodynamic alterations, salt and water retention -> HF symptoms: dyspnea, edema, fatigue
- Re-modelling and progressive worsening of LVF -> Morbidity and mortality

\section*{COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS}
- Increase preload - Frank-Starling ventricular dilatation and volume expansion
- Increase afterload - PV vasoconstriction
- Hypertrophy - preserve wall stress - Laplace law
- Salt and water retention - preload

\section*{INFECIIVE ENDOCARDITIS}

\section*{Definition}

Infective endocarditis is defined as a microbial colonization of the inner lining of the heart.
-Can involve valves, the mural endocardium, or a septal defect.
-The prototypic lesion is vegetation-is a mass of platelets, fibrin, microcolonies of microorganisms, and scant inflammatory cells.
-Endocarditis can be classified as:
a) Native valve (acute and subacute) endocarditis
b) Prosthetic valve (early and late) endocarditis
c) Endocarditis related to intravenous drug use

\section*{N(ative valve endocarditis (acute and subacute)}
-Native valve acute endocarditis usually fas an aggressive course.
-Virulent organisms, such as Stapfylococcus aureus and group $\mathcal{B}$ streptococci
-Underlying structural valve disease may not be present.
-Sub acute endocarditis usually fas a more indolent course than the acute form.
-Alpha-femolytic streptococci or enterococci, usually in the setting of underlying structural valve disease, typically are the causative agents of this type of endocarditis.

\section*{Prosthetic valve endocarditis (early and late)}
-Early prosthetic valve endocarditis occurs within 60 days of valve implantation. Staphylococci aureus and epidermidis, gram-negative bacilli, and Candida species are the common infecting organisms.
- Late prosthetic valve endocarditis occurs 60 days or more after valve implantation. Alpha-femolytic streptococci, enterococci, and staphylococci are the common causative organisms.

\section*{Endocarditis related to intravenous drug use}
-Endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers commonly involves the tricuspid valve.
-S. aureus is the most common causative organism.
-Fungal colonization's also common eg Candida albicans.

Acute endocarditis is a hectically febrile illness, rapidly damages cardiac structures, hematogenously seeds extracardiac sites, and, if untreated, progresses to death within weeks.

Subacute endocarditis follows an indolent course; causes structural cardiac damage only slowly, if at all; rarely causes metastatic infection; and is gradually progressive unless complicated by a major embolic event or ruptured mycotic aneurysm.

Pathopfysiology: : Occur by-
1. Formation of thrombi on endocardium
2. Bacteremia (nosocomial or spontaneous) that delivers the organisms to the valve's surface
3. Adference of the organisms
4. Eventual invasion of the valvular leaflets
-Infective endocarditis generally occurs as a consequence of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, which results from turbulence or trauma to the endothelial surface of the heart.
-Transient bacteremia then leads to seeding of lesions with adherent bacteria, and infective endocarditis develops.

4- Petechiae - Common but nonspecific finding
5-Splinter hemorrhages - Dark red linear lesions in the nailbeds
6-Finger clubbing

7-Immunologic phenomena
- Osler nodes - Tender subcutaneous nodules usually found on the distal pads of the digits cal phenomena
- Roth spots( Retinal hemorrhages)

8-Vascular phenomena-
- Conjunctival hemorrhage
- Janeway lesions - Nontender maculae on the palms and soles

9-Tender Splenomegaly
10-Neurologic disease due to embolic stroke with focal neurologic deficits- Other etiologies include intracerebral hemorrhage and multiple microabscesses
- Paralysis ,Hemiparesis
- aphasia
- Stiff neck
- Delirium

11-Signs of systemic septic emboli are due to left heart disease and are more commonly associated with mitral valve vegetations.
- Multiple embolic pulmonary infections or infarctions are due to right heart disease.

\section*{Investigations}

\section*{Lab Studies:}
1. FBC- Anemia of chronic disease is common in subacute endocarditis

Leukocytosis is observed in acute endocarditis

\section*{ESR and C-reactive protein}
$2 . \mathcal{U} / E / C r$

\section*{3.Urinalysis}

Proteinuria and microscopic hematuria are present in approximately 50\% of cases
4. Blood cultures-I wo sets of blood cultures have greater than $90 \%$ sensitivity when bacteremia is present.
5.. Serology for Chlamydia, Q,fever (Coxiella), and Bartonella_may be useful in culture-negative endocarditis
5.. Rheumatoid factor is noted in subacute endocarditis
5. Decreased C3, C4, and CH50 are evident in subacute endocarditis.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

\section*{1.Echocardiograpfyy}
-Transthoracic echocardiography -more sensitive
-This test is particularly indicated with culture-negative cases, such as in fungal endocarditis.
-Visible vegetation suggests a worse prognosis.local complications, such as abscesses.

\section*{2.Chest radiography}
-Features of CCF-cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema
-Pulmonary embolic phenomena strongly suggest tricuspid disease.

\section*{3. Ventilation/perfusion ( $\mathcal{V} / Q$ ) scanning:}

This may be useful in right-sided endocarditis.

\section*{4. CI scanning:}

This imaging modality is helpful for localizing abscesses

\section*{Causes:}
a) Dative valve endocarditis
$\checkmark$ Rheumatic valvular disease (30\%)
$\checkmark$ Congenital Feart disease (15\% of $\mathcal{N} \mathcal{V}$ E)
$\checkmark$ Mitral valve prolapse with an associated murmur (20\% of $\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{V} E)$
$\checkmark$ Degenerative heart disease - Including calcific aortic stenosis due to a bicuspid valve, Marfan syndrome, or syphilitic disease
Up to 70\% of cases are caused by Streptococcus species including Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus bovis, and enterococci. Staphylococcus species cause 25\% of cases and generally demonstrate a more aggressive acute course.

\section*{b)Endocarditis in intravenous drug use}
-This condition most commonly involves the tricuspid valve, followed by the aortic valve.
-Pulmonary manifestations may be prominent in patients with tricuspid infection: pleuritic chest pain, e chest radiograpfic abnormalities.
-S aureus is the most common (<50\% of cases) etiologic organism. Other $\backslash$ organisms include streptococci, fungi, and gram-negative rods (eg, pseudomonads, Serratia species).

\section*{c)Prosthetic valve endocarditis}

Early disease, which presents shortly after surgery, has a different bacteriology and prognosis than late disease, which presents in a subacute fashion similar to native valve endocarditis.

Infection associated with aortic valve prostheses may lead to: local abscess, fistula formation and valvular defiscence.

This may lead to shock, heart failure, heart block, shunting of blood to the right atrium, pericardial tamponade, and peripheral emboli to the central nervous system and elsewhere.

Endocarditis can occur in association with intravascular devices.
Infection that occurs early after surgery may be caused by a variety of pathogens, including $\mathcal{S}$ aureus and $\mathcal{S}$ epidermidis.

Late disease is most commonly caused by streptococci.
Fungal endocarditis- found in intravenous drug users and intensive care unit patients who receive broadspectrum antibiotics. Blood cultures are often negative, and diagnosis frequently is made after microscopic examination of large emboli.

\section*{Prevention of IE}

Reduce the predisposing factors
1. Adequate treatment of $\mathcal{U R I I}$ to prevent most common cause of valvular damage- $\mathcal{R H D}$.
2. .IV drug use-Drug abuse prevention
3. Aseptic technique in IV line insertion and therapeutic IV drug admin.
4. Early surgical correction for the congenital heart disease as VSD,ASD
5. Those with damaged valve deg $\mathcal{R H D}$ should get antibiotic prophylaxis before surgical manipulation of dentals, GIT or GU system
Dental-Admin $3 g$ amoxicillin $1 / 2$ hour before procedure then $1.6 g 6$ hours after the procedure.
$\mathcal{N} \mathcal{B}$. Monthly Benyl Penicillin in RHD patients is not to prevent IE but to prevent recurrence or Acute rheumatic fever.
-Pathologic effects due to infection can include local tissue destruction and embolic phenomena.
-In addition, secondary autoimmune effects, such as immune complex glomerulonepfiritis and vasculitis, can occur
-In acute IE, the thrombus may be produced by the invading organism (i.e., $\mathcal{S}$ aureus) or by valvular trauma from intravenous catheters or pacing wires (i.e., NIE). S aureus can invade the endothelial cells (endotheliosis) and increase the expression of adhesion molecules and of procoagulant activity on the cellular surface.
- Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis may result from stress, renal failure, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, or neoplasia.
-IE develops most commonly on the mitral valve, closely followed in descending order of frequency by the aortic valve, the combined mitral and aortic valve, the tricuspid valve, and, rarely, the pulmonic valve.
-Mechanical prosthetic and bioprosthetic valves exfibit equal rates of infection.
-The microorganisms that most commonly produce endocarditis (ie, $\mathcal{S}$ aureus; $\mathcal{S}$ viridans; group $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{C}$, and $\mathcal{G}$ streptococci; enterococci) resist the bactericidal action of complement and possess fibronectin receptors for the surface of the fibrin-platelet thrombus.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

History- Highly variable
-Constitutional - Fever and chills are the most common symptoms
-Others- Anorexia, weight loss, malaise, headache, myalgias, night sweats, shortness of breath, cough, or joint pains are common complaints
-Symptoms may be due to primary cardiac effects or secondary embolic phenomena.
-Primary cardiac disease may present with signs of CCF
-Secondary phenomena-Focal neurologic complaints due to an embolic stroke or backpain associated with vertebral osteomyelitis.
-As many as 20\% of cases present with focal neurologic complaints and stroke syndromes.
-Dyspnea, cough, and chest pain are common complaints of intravenous drug users.
-This is likely related to the predominance of tricuspid valve endocarditis in this group and secondary embolic showering of the pulmonary vasculature.

\section*{Physical:}

\section*{1-Mild-moderate Pallor}

2-Fever, possibly low-grade and intermittent, is present in $90 \%$ of patients.
3 Heart
-Heart murmurs -esp. Change in the characteristics of a previously noted murmur occurs
-Gallop rhythm.
-Signs of CCF, frequently are due to acute left-sided valvular insufficiency
- Distended neck veins
- Rales
- Cardiac arrhythmia-Pulse irregularity
- Pericardial rub
- Pleural friction rub

\section*{5.Electrocardiograpfy}
- Nonspecific changes are common
-First-degree AV block and new interventricular conduction delays may signal septal involvement in aortic valve disease; both are poor prognostic signs.

\section*{Procedures:}

Cardiac catheterization may be indicated to determine the degree of valvular damage

\section*{Modified Dukes Criteria}

\section*{Major Criteria}

\section*{1.Positive blood culture for Infective Endocarditis}

Typical microorganism consistent with IE from 2 separate blood cultures, as noted below:
- viridians streptococci, Streptococcus bovis, or HACEKgroup
- community-acquired Staphylococcus aureus or enterococci, in the absence of a primary focus
or
Microorganisms consistent with IE from persistently positive blood cultures defined as:
- 2 positive cultures of blood samples drawn $>12$ hours apart, or
- all of 3 or a majority of 4 separate cultures of blood (with first and last sample drawn 1 hour apart)

\section*{2. Evidence of endocardial involvement}

Tositive echocardiogram for IE defined as :
- Vegetations on the valve
- abscess, or
- new partial defiscence of prosthetic valve

Or
$\mathcal{N}$ ew valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of preexisting murmur not sufficient)

\section*{Minor Criteria}

\section*{1.Predisposition:}

Predisposing feart condition or intravenous drug use
2.Fever: $>38.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(100.4^{\circ} \mathcal{F}\right)$
3.Vascular phenomena:
- Conjunctival Kemorrhages
- Janeway lesions
- Major arterial emboli eg septic pulmonary infarcts
- Mycotic aneurysm
- Intracranial hemorrhage

\section*{4.Immunologic phenomena:}
- Osler's nodes
- $\mathcal{G} \mathcal{N}$
- Roth spots
- rheumatoid factor
5.Microbiological evidence: positive blood culture but does not meet a major criterion as noted above
6. Echocardiographic findings: consistent with IE but do not meet a major criterion as noted above.

Excludes single positive cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci, diphtheroids, and organisms that do not commonly cause endocarditis.

Clinical criteria for infective endocarditis requires:
- Two major criteria, or
- One major and three minor criteria, or
- Five minor criteria

Histologic and/or microbiologic evidence of infection at surgery or autopsy

\section*{MADAGEMENT}

Goals to maximize treatment success are
(1) Early diagnosis
(2) Accurate microorganism identification
(3) Reliable susceptibility testing
(4) Prolonged intravenous administration of bactericidal antimicrobial agents
(5) Proper monitoring of potentially toxic antimicrobial regimens
(6) Aggressive surgical management of correctable mechanical complications.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
- CVD is currently a world wide epidemic
- Hypertension is a key CVD risk factor
- The communicable diseases epidemic is not yet under control in our country
- We do not have the resources to handle two epidemics
- We need to act quickly to prevent CVD and treat those already affected

\section*{Hypertension: definition}
- BP >/= 140/90 is considered as defining term, but hypertension is a continuum
- Cardiovascular risk doubles with every 20/10mmhg rise BP from 115/75mmhg between age 40 to 70 yrs
- Isolated systolic/diastolic hypertension should be treated like any other hypertension, higher figure determines grade
- White coat hypertension is also associated with increased cardiovascular risk

\section*{Hypertension: definition}
- It is an asymptomatic lifelong disease requiring life long treatment
- Progressive cardiovascular syndrome associated with target organ damage
- It's assoc with increased risk for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, renal failure, retinopathy and peripheral vascular disease.
- Treatment results in reduction in these complications
- Major challenges exist in diagnosis and treatment

HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCIES \\
Introduction \\
Joint National Committee (JNC-7) has introduced a new classification system for HTN. \\
Pre-hypertension \\
$\checkmark$ Systolic blood pressure(SBP) 120-139 \\
$\checkmark$ Diastolic blood pressure(DBP) 80-89 \\
Stage I HTN \\
$\checkmark$ SBP 140-159 \\
$\checkmark$ DBP 90-99 \\
Stage II HTN \\
$\checkmark$ SBP >160 \\
$\checkmark \quad$ DBP >100 \\
Hypertensive crises encompass a spectrum of clinical presentations where uncontrolled BPs lead to progressive or impending target organ dysfunction (TOD). \\
The clinical distinction between hypertensive emergencies and hypertensive urgencies depends on the presence of acute TOD and not on the absolute level of the BP. \\
Hypertensive emergency \\
Hypertensive emergencies represent severe HTN with acute impairment of an organ system (eg central nervous system [CNS], cardiovascular, renal). In these conditions, the BP should be lowered aggressively over minutes to hours. \\
Hypertensive urgency \\
Hypertensive urgency is defined as a severe elevation of BP, without evidence of progressive TOD. These patients require BP control over hours to days. \\
Pathophysiology: \\
The pathophysiology of hypertensive emergencies is not well understood. However, an abrupt rise in vascular resistance seems to be a necessary initial step. The 3 major organ systems affected by high BP are the CNS, cardiovascular system, and renal system. \\
Central nervous system \\
Cerebral autoregulation is the inherent ability of the cerebral vasculature to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in blood pressure. \\
As mean arterial pressure (MAP) increases, the cerebral endothelium is disrupted and the blood-brain barrier can become interrupted. \\
This leads to cerebral edema and microhemorrhages. Patients with chronic HTN can tolerate higher MAPs before they have disruption of their autoregulation system. However, such patients also have increased cerebrovascular resistance and are more prone to cerebral ischemia when flow decreases. \\
Hypertensive encephalopathy is one of the clinical manifestations of cerebral edema and microhemorrhages seen with dysfunction of cerebral autoregulation.
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}
Cardiovascular system \\
HTN affects the structure and function of the coronary vasculature and left ventricle. \\
HTN also activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing systemic vasculature constriction. This results in increasing myocardial oxygen demand by increasing the left ventricular wall tension and leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary compression. During hypertensive emergencies, the left ventricle cannot overcome systemic vascular resistance. This leads to left ventricular failure and pulmonary edema or myocardial ischemia. \\
Renal system \\
Chronic HTN causes pathologic changes to the small arteries of the kidney. The arteries develop endothelial dysfunction and impaired vasodilation, which alter renal autoregulation. \\
When the renal autoregulatory system is disrupted, the intraglomerular pressure starts to vary directly with the systemic arterial pressure, thus offering no protection to the kidney during BP fluctuations. During a hypertensive crisis, this can lead to acute renal ischemia. \\
Mortality/Morbidity: \\
Death from both ischemic heart disease and stroke increase progressively as the BP increases. For every 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm diastolic increase in BP, the mortality rate from both ischemic heart disease and stroke doubles. \\
The morbidity and mortality of hypertensive emergencies depend on the extent of TOD on presentation and the degree to which BP is controlled subsequently. \\
With BP control and medication compliance, the 10-year survival rate of patients with hypertensive crises approaches 70\%. \\
Sex: \\
Overall, the prevalence and incidence of HTN is slightly higher in men than in women. \\
Hypertensive crises are two times more frequent in males than in females. \\
Age: \\
Hypertensive crises are more common among elderly persons. \\
Etiology \\
The most common hypertensive emergency is a rapid unexplained rise in BP in a patient with chronic essential HTN. \\

\section*{Investigations}
1.Electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine levels to evaluate for renal impairment
2. CBC and smear to exclude microangiopathic anemia
3. Urinalysis (UA)

Dipstick UA to detect hematuria or proteinuria (renal impairment)
Microscopic UA to detect RBCs or RBC casts (renal impairment
4. Optional studies

Toxicology screen
Pregnancy test

\section*{Endocrine testing}

\section*{Imaging Studies:}
1.Chest radiography is indicated in patients with chest pain or shortness of breath.
$\checkmark$ Cardiac enlargement
$\checkmark$ Pulmonary edema
$\checkmark$ Widened mediastinum
2.Head CT scans are indicated in patients with abnormal neurologic examinations.
$\checkmark$ Intracranial bleeding
$\checkmark$ Cerebral edema
$\checkmark$ Cerebral infarction
3. Electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for evidence of myocardial ischemia or left ventricular hypertrophy 4.Chest CT scan, Tran esophageal echocardiography, or aortic angiogram is indicated in cases where aortic dissection is suspected.
-Rapid reduction in BP below the cerebral, renal, and/or coronary autoregulatory range will result in marked reduction in organ blood flow, possibly leading to ischemia and infarction.
-In general, the MAP should be lowered by no more than $20-25 \%$ in the first hour of treatment. If the patient remains stable, the BP should then be lowered to 160/100-110 in the next 2-6 hours. Please note the exceptions to this general rule listed below.
-These BP goals are best achieved by a continuous infusion of a short-acting, titratable, parenteral antihypertensive agent along with constant, intensive patient monitoring.
-Rapid BP reduction is indicated in the following circumstances:
1.Acute myocardial ischemia
$\checkmark$ Nitroglycerin IV
$\checkmark$ Beta-blockers IV
2.CHF with pulmonary edema
$\checkmark$ Nitroglycerin IV
$\checkmark$ Lasix IV
$\checkmark$ Nitroprusside IV
3.Acute aortic dissection:

In cases of acute aortic dissection, the SBP should be decreased as rapidly as possible to a goal of $100-110 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg or lower.
Labetalol IV
Alternative - Nitroprusside IV with beta-blocker IV (eg, esmolol)

\section*{4. CVA:}
-Evidence exists that patients who have acute strokes have better outcomes with higher BPs. Antihypertensive therapy is not routinely recommended for patients with acute stroke and HTN.
-Recent ischemic stroke and a SBP $>220 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ or a DBP $>120-140 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ can undergo cautious reduction of BP by about 10-15\% (with IV nitroprusside or IV labetalol), if the patient is carefully monitored for neurologic deterioration related to the lower pressure. -Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH): A precipitous fall in SBP may compromise cerebral perfusion and increase mortality.
The controlled lowering of BP with IV nitroprusside or IV labetalol (in the absence of bradycardia) is currently recommended only when the SBP is $>200 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ or the DBP is >110.

\section*{ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE}

Dr Martin M Murage
- Ischemia refers to lack of oxygen due to inadequate perfusion of the myocardium causing an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand
- Most common cause is obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the epicardial coronary arteries
- Coronary circulation is unique as it is responsible for generating the arterial pressure that is required for systemic perfusion,
- myocardial perfusion is impeded during systolic contraction: there is an increase in tissue pressure, circulation is redistributed from the subendocardial layers of the heart to the subepicardial, impedes coronary artery inflow, reduces the diameter of the intramyocardial microcirculatory vessels, increases coronary venous outflow,
- in diastole coronary arterial inflow increases with a gradient that favours perfusion to the subendocardial layers.
- Myocardial oxygen extraction is 75\% at rest
- Increases in myocardial oxygen consumptions are met by increases in coronary blood flow and oxygen delivery
- Oxygen delivery is directly determined by arterial oxygen content PaO 2
- Determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption are heart rate, systolic pressure(myocardial wall stress), and LV contractility
- A 2 fold increase in any of these determinants requires a approx. $50 \%$ increase in coronary blood flow.
- The classic manifestation of ischemia is angina described as heavy chest pressure or squeezing, burning feeling or difficulty in breathing, pain may radiate to the left shoulder or arm , neck
- Builds in intensity over few minutes, may develop with exercise or psychological stress , may occur without any precipitating factors
- Ischemic heart disease can be present as acute coronary syndrome or as stable angina secondary to chronic coronary artery disease .
- with acute chest pain and persistent ( $>20 \mathrm{~min}$ ) ST-segment elevation.
- This condition is termed ST-elevation ACS and generally reflects an acute total coronary occlusion. Most patients will ultimately develop an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
- acute chest pain but no persistent ST-segment elevation.
- ECG changes may include transient ST-segment elevation, persistent or transient ST-segment depression, T -wave inversion, flat T waves or pseudonormalization of T waves or the ECG may be normal.
- spectrum of non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) may range from patients free of symptoms at presentation to individuals with ongoing ischaemia, electrical or haemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest.
- The pathological correlate at the myocardial level is cardiomyocyte necrosis [NSTE-myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)] or, less frequently, myocardial ischaemia without cell loss (unstable angina)
- Acute myocardial infarction (MI) defines cardiomyocyte necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia.
- A combination of criteria is required to meet the diagnosis of acute MI, namely the detection of an increase and/or decrease of a cardiac biomarker, preferably high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and at least one of the following:
- Symptoms of ischaemia.
- New or presumed new significant ST-T wave changes or left bundle branch block on 12-lead ECG.
- Development of pathological Q waves on ECG.
- Imaging evidence of new or presumed new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality.
- Intracoronary thrombus detected on angiography or autopsy

\section*{- Type 1 MI}
- characterized by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissure, erosion or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more coronary arteries leading to decreased myocardial blood flow and/or distal embolization and subsequent myocardial necrosis.
- The patient may have underlying severe coronary artery disease (CAD) but, on occasion (i.e. $5-20 \%$ of cases), there may be non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis or no angiographic evidence of CAD, particularly in women.
- Type 2 MI
- myocardial necrosis in which a condition other than coronary plaque instability contributes to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
- Mechanisms include coronary artery spasm, coronary endothelial dysfunction, tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, anaemia, respiratory failure, hypotension and severe hypertension.
- In addition, in critically ill patients and in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, myocardial necrosis may be related to injurious effects of pharmacological agents and toxins. ${ }^{\underline{6}}$
- type 3 MI (MI resulting in death when biomarkers are not available)
- type 4 and 5 MI (related to percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], respectively).
- Unstable angina is defined as myocardial ischaemia at rest or minimal exertion in the absence of cardiomyocyte necrosis.
- Compared with NSTEMI patients, individuals with unstable angina do not experience myocardial necrosis, have a substantially lower risk of death and appear to derive less benefit from intensified antiplatelet therapy as well as early invasive strategy.
- Anginal pain in NSTE-ACS patients may have the following presentations:
- Prolonged (>20 min) anginal pain at rest;
- New onset (de novo) angina (class II or III of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification)
- Recent destabilization of previously stable angina with at least Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class III angina characteristics (crescendo angina); or
- Post-MI angina.
- Prolonged and de novo/crescendo angina are observed in $\sim 80 \%$ and $\sim 20 \%$ of patients, respectively. Typical chest pain is characterized by a retrosternal sensation of pressure or heaviness ('angina') radiating to the left arm (less frequently to both arms or to the right arm), neck or jaw, which may be intermittent (usually lasting several minutes) or persistent.
- Additional symptoms such as sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea and syncope may be present
- Atypical presentations include epigastric pain, indigestion-like symptoms and isolated dyspnoea.
- Atypical complaints are more often observed in the elderly, in women and in patients with diabetes, chronic renal disease or dementia.
- The exacerbation of symptoms by physical exertion and their relief at rest increase the probability of myocardial ischaemia. The relief of symptoms after nitrates administration is not specific for anginal pain as it is reported also in other causes of acute chest pain.
- In patients presenting with suspected MI , Older age, male gender, family history of CAD, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, renal insufficiency, previous manifestation of CAD as well as peripheral or carotid artery disease increase the likelihood of ACS.
- Conditions that may exacerbate or precipitate-ACS include anaemia, infection, inflammation, fever, and metabolic or endocrine (in particular thyroid) disorders.

\section*{Physical examination}
- May be unremarkable in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.
- Signs of heart failure or haemodynamic or electrical instability
- systolic murmur due to ischaemic mitral regurgitation, which is associated with poor prognosis, or aortic stenosis (mimicking ACS)
- systolic murmur may indicate a mechanical complication (i.e. papillary muscle rupture or ventricular septal defect) of a subacute and possibly undetected MI.
- signs of non-coronary causes of chest pain (e.g. pulmonary embolism, acute aortic syndromes, myopericarditis, aortic stenosis)
- extracardiac pathologies (e.g. pneumothorax, pneumonia or musculoskeletal diseases). In this setting, the presence of a chest pain that can be reproduced by exerting pressure on the chest wall has a relatively high negative predictive value for NSTE-ACS
- According to the presentation, abdominal disorders (e.g. oesophageal spasm, oesophagitis, gastric ulcer, cholecystitis, pancreatitis) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
- Differences in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs or between the arms, irregular pulse, jugular vein distension, heart murmurs, friction rub and pain reproduced by chest or abdominal palpation are findings suggestive of alternative diagnoses.
- Pallor, sweating or tremor may point towards precipitating conditions such as anaemia and thyrotoxicosis
- The resting 12-lead ECG is the first-line diagnostic tool in the assessment of patients with suspected ACS. It is recommended to obtain it within 10 min of the patient's arrival in the emergency room or, ideally, at first contact with emergency medical services in the pre-hospital setting and to have it immediately interpreted by a qualified physician.
- While the ECG in the setting of NSTE-ACS may be normal in more than onethird of patients, characteristic abnormalities include ST depression, transient ST elevation and T -wave changes
- Measurement of a biomarker of cardiomyocyte injury, preferably high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, is mandatory in all patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.
- Cardiac troponins are more sensitive and specific markers of cardiomyocyte injury than creatine kinase (CK), its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and myoglobin.
- In patients with MI, levels of cardiac troponin rise rapidly (i.e. usually within 1 $h$ if using high-sensitivity assays) after symptom onset and remain elevated for a variable period of time (usually several days)
- echocardiography should be routinely available in emergency rooms and chest pain units and performed/interpreted by trained physicians in all patients during hospitalization for NSTE-ACS.
- useful to identify abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischaemia or necrosis (i.e. segmental hypokinesia or akinesia).
- In the absence of significant wall motion abnormalities, impaired myocardial perfusion detected by contrast echocardiography or reduced regional function using strain and strain rate imaging might improve the diagnostic and prognostic value of conventional echocardiography
- In patients without ischaemic changes on 12-lead ECGs and negative cardiac troponins (preferably high-sensitivity) who are free of chest pain for several hours, stress imaging can be performed during admission or shortly after discharge. Stress imaging is preferred over exercise ECG due to its greater diagnostic accuracy.
- Various studies have shown that normal exercise, dobutamine or dipyridamole stress echocardiograms have high negative predictive value for ischaemia and are associated with excellent patient outcomes.
- stress echocardiography demonstrated superior prognostic value over exercise ECG.
- The addition of contrast may improve endocardial border detection, which may facilitate detection of ischaemia.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can assess both perfusion and wall motion abnormalities, and patients presenting with acute chest pain with a normal stress CMR have an excellent short- and midterm prognosis.
- CMR also permits detection of scar tissue (using late gadolinium enhancement) and can differentiate this from recent infarction (using T2-weighted imaging to delineate myocardial oedema).
- Moreover, CMR can facilitate the differential diagnosis between infarction and myocarditis or Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy
- Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) allows for visualization of the coronary arteries and a normal scan excludes CAD

\section*{pharmacological treatment}
- anti-ischaemic therapy to decrease myocardial oxygen demand (secondary to a decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, preload or myocardial contractility) or to increase myocardial oxygen supply (by administration of oxygen or through coronary vasodilation).
- Oxygen: should be administered when blood oxygen saturation is $<90 \%$ or if the patient is in respiratory distress.
- Nitrates :Intravenous nitrates are more effective than sublingual nitrates with regard to symptom relief and regression of ST depression
- Beta-blockers:Beta-blockers competitively inhibit the myocardial effects of circulating catecholamines and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial contractility
- Platelet inhibition;
- Aspirin irreversibly inactivates the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity of platelet prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase 1 (COX-1), thereby suppressing thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ production throughout the platelet lifespan
- Clopidogrel, P2Y ${ }_{12}$ inhibitors Clopidogrel ( $300-600 \mathrm{mg}$ loading and $75 \mathrm{mg} /$ day maintenance dose) is an inactive prodrug that requires oxidation by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system to generate an active metabolite
- Prasugrel ( 60 mg loading and $10 \mathrm{mg} /$ day maintenance dose) is a prodrug that irreversibly blocks platelet $\mathrm{P} 2 \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ receptors with a faster onset and a more profound inhibitory effect than clopidogrel
- Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly binding $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ inhibitor with a plasma half-life of $6-12 \mathrm{~h}$.
- Cangrelor is an i.v. adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogue that binds reversibly and with high affinity to the platelet $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ receptor and has a short plasma halflife (<10 min)
- Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors Intravenous GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors block platelet aggregation by inhibiting fibrinogen binding to a conformationally activated form of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor on two adjacent platelets

- Anticoagulation Anticoagulants are used to inhibit thrombin generation and/or activity, thereby reducing thrombus-related events.
- There is evidence that anticoagulation is effective in reducing ischaemic events in NSTE-ACS and that the combination with platelet inhibitors is more effective than either treatment alone
- Reperfusion
- thrombolysis
- Invasive coronary angiography, followed if indicated by coronary revascularization
- For patients with the clinical presentation of STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset and with persistent ST-segment elevation or new or presumed new LBBB, early mechanical (PCI) or pharmacological reperfusion should be performed as early as possible

\section*{HYPERTENSION $7^{\text {TH }}$ JOINT NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON HYPERTNSION}

Need for JNC 7
(1) publication of many new hypertension observational studies and clinical trials
(2) need for a new, clear, and concise guideline that would be useful for clinicians
(3) need to simplify the classification of blood pressure
(4) clear recognition that the JNC reports were not being used to their maximum benefit

\section*{Classification of Hypertension}
-Classification of BP for adults ages 18 and older.
-The classification is based on the average of two or more properly measured seated BP readings on each of two or more office visits.

\section*{Cardiovascular disease risk}
-As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension increases unless broad and effective preventive measures are implemented.
-Individuals who are normotensive at age 55 have a 90 percent lifetime risk for developing hypertension.
-The relationship between BP and risk of CVD events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors.
The higher the BP, the greater is the chance
$\checkmark$ Heart attack
$\checkmark$ Heart failure
$\checkmark$ Stroke
$\checkmark$ Kidney disease.
-For individuals 40-70 years of age, across the entire BP range from $115 / 75$ to $185 / 115 \mathrm{mmHg}$ each increment of 20 mmHg SBP or 10 mmHg in DBP doubles the risk of CVD.
-The classification "prehypertension,", recognizes this relationship and signals the need for increased education of health care professionals and the public to reduce BP levels and prevent the development of hypertension in the general population.
Hypertension prevention strategies are available to achieve this eg Lifestyle Modifications

\section*{Benefits of lowering the Blood pressure}
-Antihypertensive therapy has been associated with reductions
- stroke incidence by 35-40\%
- myocardial infarction $20-25 \%$

\section*{Blood pressure control rates}
-Goal blood pressure treatment in hypertension is BP below $140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or below $130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$ for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
-In the majority of patients, controlling systolic hypertension has been considerably more difficult than controlling diastolic hypertension.
-Systolic hypertension is a more important CVD risk factor than DBP except in patients younger than age 50 years. It also occurs much more commonly in older persons.
-Effective BP control can be achieved in most patients who are hypertensive, but the majority will require two or more antihypertensive drugs.
-Challenges in BP control
- Patient compliance to drug intake
- clinicians fail to prescribe lifestyle modifications
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug doses
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug combinations
Accurate blood pressure measurement in the office
-The auscultatory method of BP measurement with a properly calibrated and validated instrument should be used.
-Persons should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair (rather than on an exam table), with feet on the floor, and arm supported at heart level.
-Measurement of BP in the standing position is indicated periodically, especially in those at risk for postural hypotension.
-An appropriate-sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80 percent of the arm) should be used to ensure accuracy. -At least two measurements should be made. SBP is the point at which the first of two or more sounds is heard phase 1), and DBP is the point before the disappearance of sounds (phase 5).
-Clinicians should provide to patients, verbally and in writing, their specific BP numbers and BP goals.

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION \\
Goals of Therapy \\
The ultimate public health goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. \\
Since most persons with hypertension, especially those age >50 years, will reach the DBP goal once SBP is at goal, the primary focus should be on achieving the SBP goal. \\
Treating SBP and DBP to targets that are $<140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ is associated with a decrease in CVD complications. \\
In patients with hypertension and diabetes or renal disease the BP goal is $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$

\section*{SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS}

\section*{Ischemic Heart Disease}
-Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common form of target organ damage associated with hypertension.
-In patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris, the first drug of choice is usually a BB; alternatively, long-acting CCBs can be used.
-In patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), hypertension should be treated initially with BBs and ACEIs, with addition of other drugs as needed for BP control.
-In patients with postmyocardial infarction, ACEIs, BBs, and aldosterone antagonists have proven to be most beneficial.
-Intensive lipid management and aspirin therapy are also indicated.

\section*{Heart Failure}
-Heart failure (HF), in the form of systolic or diastolic ventricular dysfunction, results primarily from systolic hypertension and IHD.
-Fastidious BP and cholesterol control are the primary preventive measures for those at high risk for HF. In asymptomatic individuals with demonstrable ventricular dysfunction, ACEIs and BBs are recommended.
-For those with symptomatic ventricular dysfunction or end-stage heart disease, ACEIs, BBs, ARBs and aldosterone blockers are recommended along with loop diuretics.

\section*{Diabetic Hypertension}
-Combinations of two or more drugs are usually needed to achieve the target goal of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
-Thiazide diuretics, BBs, ACEIs, ARBs, and CCBs are beneficial in reducing CVD and stroke incidence in patients with diabetes.
ACEI- or ARB-based treatments favorably affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy and reduce albuminuria and ARBs have been shown to reduce progression to macroalbuminuria.

\section*{Chronic Kidney Disease}

In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by either
(1) reduced excretory function with an estimated GFR below $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per 1.73 m 2 (corresponding approximately to a creatinine of $>1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $>1.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women)
(2) the presence of albuminuria ( $>300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day or 200 mg albumin/g creatinine), therapeutic goals are to slow deterioration of renal function and prevent CVD.
Hypertension appears in the majority of these patients, and they should receive aggressive BP management, often with three or more drugs to reach target BP values of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
ACEIs and ARBs have demonstrated favorable effects on the progression of diabetic and non diabetic renal disease. A limited rise in serum creatinine of as much as 35 percent above baseline with ACEIs or ARBs is acceptable and is not a reason to withhold treatment unless
-With advanced renal disease (estimated GFR $<30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ 1.73 m 2 , corresponding to a serum creatinine of $2.5-3$ mg/dL), increasing doses of loop diuretics are usually needed in combination with other drug classes.

\section*{Cerebrovascular Disease}

The risks and benefits of acute lowering of BP during an acute stroke are still unclear; control of BP at intermediate levels (approximately $160 / 100 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ) is appropriate until the condition has stabilized or improved.
-Recurrent stroke rates are lowered by the combination of an ACEI and thiazide-type diuretic

\section*{Obesity and the metabolic syndrome}

Obesity (BMI $>30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ ) is an increasingly prevalent risk factor for the development of hypertension and CVD. Metabolic syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following conditions:
1) Abdominal obesity (waist circumference $>40$ inches in men or $>35$ inches in women)
2) Glucose intolerance (fasting glucose >110 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
3) $\mathrm{BP}>130 / 85 \mathrm{mmHg}$
4) High triglycerides ( $>150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) or low HDL ( $<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $<50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women).
Intensive lifestyle modification should be pursued in all individuals with the metabolic syndrome, and appropriate drug therapy should be instituted for each of its components as indicated.

\section*{Left ventricular hypertrophy}

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor that increases the risk of subsequent CVD. Regression of LVH occurs with aggressive BP management, including weight loss, sodium restriction, and treatment with all classes of antihypertensive agents except the direct vasodilators hydralazine, and minoxidil.

\section*{Peripheral arterial disease}

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is equivalent in risk to IHD. Any class of antihypertensive drugs can be used in most PAD patients. Other risk factors should be managed aggressively, and aspirin should be used.

\section*{Postural hypotension}

A decrease in standing SBP $>10 \mathrm{mmHg}$, when associated with dizziness or fainting, is more frequent in older patients with systolic hypertension, diabetes, and those taking diuretics, venodilators (e.g., nitrates, alphablockers, and sildenafil like drugs), and some psychotropic drugs.
BP in these individuals should also be monitored in the upright position. Caution should be used to avoid volume depletion and excessively rapid dose titration of antihypertensive drugs.
hyperkalemia develops.

\section*{Hypertension in women}

Oral contraceptives may increase BP, and the risk of hypertension increases with duration of use.
Women taking oral contraceptives should have their BP checked regularly. Development of hypertension is a reason to consider other forms of contraception. In contrast, menopausal hormone therapy does not raise BP .
Women with hypertension who become pregnant should be followed carefully because of increased risks to mother and fetus.
-Methyldopa, BBs, and vasodilators are preferred medications for the safety of the fetus.
-ACEI and ARBs should not be used during pregnancy because of the potential for fetal defects and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant. -Preeclampsia, which occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy, is characterized by new-onset or worsening hypertension, albuminuria, and hyperuricemia ,sometimes with coagulation abnormalities.
-In some patients, preeclampsia may develop into a hypertensive urgency or emergency and may require hospitalization, intensive monitoring, early fetal delivery, and parenteral antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapy

\section*{Potential favorable effects of anti-hypertensives}
-Thiazide-type diuretics are useful in slowing demineralization in osteoporosis.
-BBs can be useful in the treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias/ fibrillation, migraine, thyrotoxicosis (short term), essential tremor, or perioperative hypertension.
-CCBs may be useful in Raynaud's syndrome and certain arrhythmias,
- Alpha-blockers may be useful in prostatism.

\section*{Potential unfavorable effects}
-Thiazide diuretics should be used cautiously in patients who have gout or who have a history of significant hyponatremia.
-BBs should generally be avoided in individuals who have asthma, reactive airways disease, or second or third degree heart block.
- ACEIs and ARBs should not be given to women likely to become pregnant and are contraindicated in those who are.
-ACEIs should not be used in individuals with a history of angioedema.
-Aldosterone antagonists and potassium-sparing diuretics can cause hyperkalemia and should generally be avoided in patients who have serum potassium values more than $5.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ while not taking medications.

\section*{Resistant Hypertension}

Resistant hypertension is the failure to reach goal BP in patients who are adhering to full doses of an appropriate three-drug regimen that includes a diuretic.

\section*{Causes}
1.Improper BP Measurement
2. Identifiable Causes of Hypertension.

\section*{Ischemic heart disease}

Dr Martin M Murage
- Ischemia refers to lack of oxygen due to inadequate perfusion of the myocardium causing an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand
- Most common cause is obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the epicardial coronary arteries
- Coronary circulation is unique its responsible for generating the arterial pressure that is required for systemic perfusion,
- myocardial perfusion is impeded during systolic contraction: there is an increase in tissue pressure, circulation is redistributed from the subendocardial layers of the heart to the subepicardial, impedes coronary artery inflow ,reduces the diameter of the intramyocardial microcirculatory vessels, increases coronary venous outflow,
- in diastole coronary arterial inflow increases with a gradient that favours perfusion to the subendocardial layers.
- Myocardial oxygen extraction is $75 \%$ at rest
- Increases in myocardial oxygen consumptions are met by increases in coronary blood flow and oxygen delivery
- Oxygen delivery is directly determined by arterial oxygen content PaO2
- Determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption are heart rate, systolic pressure(myocardial wall stress), and LV contractility
- A 2 fold increase in any of these determinants requires a approx. 50\% increase in coronary blood flow.
- The classic manifestation of ischemia is angina described as heavy chest pressure or squeezing ,burning feeling or difficulty in breathing, pain may radiate to the left shoulder or arm , neck
- Builds in intensity over few minutes, may develop with exercise or psychological stress , may occur without any precipitating factors
- Ischemic heart disease can be present as acute coronary syndrome or as stable angina secondary chronic coronary artery disease .
- with acute chest pain and persistent (>20 min) STsegment elevation.
- This condition is termed ST-elevation ACS and generally reflects an acute total coronary occlusion. Most patients will ultimately develop an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
- acute chest pain but no persistent ST-segment elevation.
- ECG changes may include transient ST-segment elevation, persistent or transient ST-segment depression, T-wave inversion, flat T waves or pseudo-normalization of T waves or the ECG may be normal.
- spectrum of non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) may range from patients free of symptoms at presentation to individuals with ongoing ischaemia, electrical or haemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest.
- The pathological correlate at the myocardial level is cardiomyocyte necrosis [NSTE-myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)] or, less frequently, myocardial ischaemia without cell loss (unstable angina)
- Acute myocardial infarction (MI) defines cardiomyocyte necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia.
- A combination of criteria is required to meet the diagnosis of acute MI, namely the detection of an increase and/or decrease of a cardiac biomarker, preferably high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and at least one of the following:
- Symptoms of ischaemia.
- New or presumed new significant ST-T wave changes or left bundle branch block on 12-lead ECG.
- Development of pathological Q waves on ECG.
- Imaging evidence of new or presumed new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality.
- Intracoronary thrombus detected on angiography or autopsy
- Type 1 MI
- characterized by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissure, erosion or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more coronary arteries leading to decreased myocardial blood flow and/or distal embolization and subsequent myocardial necrosis.
- The patient may have underlying severe coronary artery disease (CAD) but, on occasion (i.e. $5-20 \%$ of cases), there may be nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis or no angiographic evidence of CAD, particularly in women.
- Type 2 MI
- myocardial necrosis in which a condition other than coronary plaque instability contributes to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
- Mechanisms include coronary artery spasm, coronary endothelial dysfunction, tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, anaemia, respiratory failure, hypotension and severe hypertension.
- In addition, in critically ill patients and in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery, myocardial necrosis may be related to injurious effects of pharmacological agents and toxins.
- type 3 MI (MI resulting in death when biomarkers are not available)
- type 4 and 5 MI (related to percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], respectively).
- Unstable angina is defined as myocardial ischaemia at rest or minimal exertion in the absence of cardiomyocyte necrosis.
- Compared with NSTEMI patients, individuals with unstable angina do not experience myocardial necrosis, have a substantially lower risk of death and appear to derive less benefit from intensified antiplatelet therapy as well as early invasive strategy.
- Anginal pain in NSTE-ACS patients may have the following presentations:
- Prolonged (>20 min) anginal pain at rest;
- New onset (de novo) angina (class II or III of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification)
- Recent destabilization of previously stable angina with at least Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class III angina characteristics (crescendo angina); or
- Post-MI angina.
- Prolonged and de novo/crescendo angina are observed in $\sim 80 \%$ and $\sim 20 \%$ of patients, respectively. Typical chest pain is characterized by a retrosternal sensation of pressure or heaviness ('angina') radiating to the left arm (less frequently to both arms or to the right arm), neck or jaw, which may be intermittent (usually lasting several minutes) or persistent.
- Additional symptoms such as sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea and syncope may be present
- Atypical presentations include epigastric pain, indigestionlike symptoms and isolated dyspnoea.
- Atypical complaints are more often observed in the elderly, in women and in patients with diabetes, chronic renal disease or dementia.
- The exacerbation of symptoms by physical exertion and their relief at rest increase the probability of myocardial ischaemia. The relief of symptoms after nitrates administration is not specific for anginal pain as it is reported also in other causes of acute chest pain.
- In patients presenting with suspected MI , Older age, male gender, family history of CAD, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, renal insufficiency, previous manifestation of CAD as well as peripheral or carotid artery disease increase the likelihood of ACS.
- Conditions that may exacerbate or precipitate-ACS include anaemia, infection, inflammation, fever, and metabolic or endocrine (in particular thyroid) disorders.

\section*{Physical examination}
- May be unremarkable in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.
- Signs of heart failure or haemodynamic or electrical instability
- systolic murmur due to ischaemic mitral regurgitation, which is associated with poor prognosis, or aortic stenosis (mimicking ACS)
- systolic murmur may indicate a mechanical complication (i.e. papillary muscle rupture or ventricular septal defect) of a subacute and possibly undetected MI.
- signs of non-coronary causes of chest pain (e.g. pulmonary embolism, acute aortic syndromes, myopericarditis, aortic stenosis)
- extracardiac pathologies (e.g. pneumothorax, pneumonia or musculoskeletal diseases). In this setting, the presence of a chest pain that can be reproduced by exerting pressure on the chest wall has a relatively high negative predictive value for NSTE-ACS
- According to the presentation, abdominal disorders (e.g. oesophageal spasm, oesophagitis, gastric ulcer, cholecystitis, pancreatitis) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
- Differences in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs or between the arms, irregular pulse, jugular vein distension, heart murmurs, friction rub and pain reproduced by chest or abdominal palpation are findings suggestive of alternative diagnoses.
- Pallor, sweating or tremor may point towards precipitating conditions such as anaemia and thyrotoxicosis
- The resting 12-lead ECG is the first-line diagnostic tool in the assessment of patients with suspected ACS . It is recommended to obtain it within 10 min of the patient's arrival in the emergency room or, ideally, at first contact with emergency medical services in the pre-hospital setting and to have it immediately interpreted by a qualified physician.
- While the ECG in the setting of NSTE-ACS may be normal in more than one-third of patients, characteristic abnormalities include ST depression, transient ST elevation and T-wave changes
- Measurement of a biomarker of cardiomyocyte injury, preferably highsensitivity cardiac troponin, is mandatory in all patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.
- Cardiac troponins are more sensitive and specific markers of cardiomyocyte injury than creatine kinase (CK), its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and myoglobin.
- In patients with MI, levels of cardiac troponin rise rapidly (i.e. usually within 1 h if using high-sensitivity assays) after symptom onset and remain elevated for a variable period of time (usually several days)
- echocardiography should be routinely available in emergency rooms and chest pain units and performed/interpreted by trained physicians in all patients during hospitalization for NSTE-ACS.
- useful to identify abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischaemia or necrosis (i.e. segmental hypokinesia or akinesia).
- In the absence of significant wall motion abnormalities, impaired myocardial perfusion detected by contrast echocardiography or reduced regional function using strain and strain rate imaging might improve the diagnostic and prognostic value of conventional echocardiography
- In patients without ischaemic changes on 12-lead ECGs and negative cardiac troponins (preferably high-sensitivity) who are free of chest pain for several hours, stress imaging can be performed during admission or shortly after discharge. Stress imaging is preferred over exercise ECG due to its greater diagnostic accuracy.
- Various studies have shown that normal exercise, dobutamine or dipyridamole stress echocardiograms have high negative predictive value for ischaemia and are associated with excellent patient outcomes.
- stress echocardiography demonstrated superior prognostic value over exercise ECG.
- The addition of contrast may improve endocardial border detection, which may facilitate detection of ischaemia.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can assess both perfusion and wall motion abnormalities, and patients presenting with acute chest pain with a normal stress CMR have an excellent short- and midterm prognosis.
- CMR also permits detection of scar tissue (using late gadolinium enhancement) and can differentiate this from recent infarction (using T2-weighted imaging to delineate myocardial oedema).
- Moreover, CMR can facilitate the differential diagnosis between infarction and myocarditis or Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy
- Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) allows for visualization of the coronary arteries and a normal scan excludes CAD

\end{tabular}

\section*{pharmacological treatment}
- anti-ischaemic therapy to decrease myocardial oxygen demand (secondary to a decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, preload or myocardial contractility) or to increase myocardial oxygen supply (by administration of oxygen or through coronary vasodilation).
- Oxygen: should be administered when blood oxygen saturation is $<90 \%$ or if the patient is in respiratory distress.
- Nitrates :Intravenous nitrates are more effective than sublingual nitrates with regard to symptom relief and regression of ST depression
- Beta-blockers:Beta-blockers competitively inhibit the myocardial effects of circulating catecholamines and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial contractility

\section*{- Platelet inhibition ;}
- Aspirin irreversibly inactivates the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity of platelet prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase 1 (COX-1), thereby suppressing thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ production throughout the platelet lifespan
- Clopidogrel, $\mathbf{P 2 Y}_{\mathbf{1 2}}$ inhibitors Clopidogrel ( $300-600 \mathrm{mg}$ loading and $75 \mathrm{mg} /$ day maintenance dose) is an inactive prodrug that requires oxidation by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system to generate an active metabolite
- Prasugrel ( 60 mg loading and $10 \mathrm{mg} /$ day maintenance dose) is a prodrug that irreversibly blocks platelet $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ receptors with a faster onset and a more profound inhibitory effect than clopidogrel
- Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly binding $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ inhibitor with a plasma half-life of 6-12 h.
- Cangrelor is an i.v. adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogue that binds reversibly and with high affinity to the platelet $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ receptor and has a short plasma half-life ( $<10 \mathrm{~min}$ )
- Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors Intravenous GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors block platelet aggregation by inhibiting fibrinogen binding to a conformationally activated form of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor on two adjacent platelets

- Anticoagulation Anticoagulants are used to inhibit thrombin generation and/or activity, thereby reducing thrombus-related events.
- There is evidence that anticoagulation is effective in reducing ischaemic events in NSTE-ACS and that the combination with platelet inhibitors is more effective than either treatment alone
- Reperfusion
- thrombolysis
- Invasive coronary angiography, followed if indicated by coronary revascularization
- For patients with the clinical presentation of STEMI within 12 h of symptom onset and with persistent ST-segment elevation or new or presumed new LBBB, early mechanical (PCI) or pharmacological reperfusion should be performed as early as possible

\title{
HEAT FAILURE
}

BY PROF JOSHI

\section*{DEFINITION}
- Abnormality in cardiac structure or function resulting in the inability of the heart to fill with or eject blood at a rate commensurate with the requirements of the metabolizing tissues
- It is a syndrome characterized by dyspnea. Fatigue and fluid retention
- It is a progressive disorder of LV remodeling, usually resulting from an index event that culminates in a clinical syndrome characterized by impaired cardiac function and circulatory congestion

\section*{FORMS OF HEART FAILURE}
- Systolic: inability of the ventricles to contract normally and expel sufficient blood
- Diastolic: HF in patients with preserved systolic function; EF > 50\%
- Due to increased resistance to ventricular inflow -> reduced ventricular diastolic capacity or reduced ventricular relaxation
- Mostly abnormal or both contraction and relaxation

\section*{HF PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- Risk factors
- Myocardial injury (MI, HTN, VHD, Cardiomyopathy)
- Initial fall in LV performance - increase wall stress
- Activation of RAAS and SNS
- Fibrosis, apoptosis, hypertrophy, cellular and molecular alterations
- Hemodynamic alterations, salt and water retention -> HF symptoms: dyspnea, edema, fatigue
- Re-modelling and progressive worsening of LVF -> Morbidity and mortality

\section*{COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS}
- Increase preload - Frank-Starling ventricular dilatation and volume expansion

\section*{ALGORITHM FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF HF}
- Suspected HF because of symptoms and signs
- Assess presence of cardiac diseases by ECG, X-ray or Natriuretic peptides
- If test is abnormal -> echocardiography
- If abnormal - assess etiology, HF, precipitating factors and type degree of cardiac dysfunction
- Additional diagnostic tests where appropriate e.g. coronary angiography
- Choose therapy

\section*{INVESTIGATION}
- ECG - normal or high negative predictive value
- CXR to r/o dyspnea
- 2D echocardiography
- LV dysfunction (systolic/diastolic)

Atrial fibrillation Lead $\vee 1$ showing coarse atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response. The two characteristic findings in AF are present: the very rapid atrial fibrillatory waves ( $f$ waves) which are variable in appearance; and the irregularly irregular ventricular response as the R-R interval between beats is unpredictable. Coarse atrial fibrillation may appear similar to atrial flutter.
However, the variable height and duration of the $f$ waves differentiate them from atrial flutter (F) waves which are identical in appearance and occur at a constant rate of about 250 to 350 beats $/ \mathrm{min}$. Courtesy of Ary Goldberger, MD.

Coarse atrial fibrillation Coarse atrial fibrillatory waves are seen with an irregular ventricular response at a moderate rate. This arrhythmia may be mistaken for atrial flutter. However, the atrial waves are all identical in atrial flutter; in comparison, the rapid atrial waves vary in rate and shape from one section of the rhythm strip to the next in atrial fibrillation.

\section*{Arrhythmias}

\section*{Diagnosis entirely based on ECG}
- Can arise from any part of the conduction system
- Classified depending on origin
- Supraventricular
- Ventricular
- Causes include
- Increased automaticity; ischaemia, chamber enlargement, heightened SNS activity
- Conduction abnormalities; degenerative disease/ischaemia at the AVN- Heart block
- Reentry e.g. WPW syndrome
- Sinus nodal dysfunction

\section*{Analyzing ECG}
- Key questions
- Are QRS complexes present?
- Are P waves present?
- How is the P wave related to the QRS complex?
- Is every P wave followed by a QRS complex with a normal P-R interval?
- What is the $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{R}$ interval?- heart rate
- What is the axis?

Atrial fibrillation Lead V1 showing coarse atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response. The two characteristic findings in AF are present: the very rapid atrial fibrillatory waves (f waves) which are variable in appearance; and the irregularly irregular ventricular response as the R-R interval between beats is unpredictable. Coarse atrial fibrillation may appear similar to atrial flutter. However, the variable height and duration of the $f$ waves differentiate them from atrial flutter (F) waves which are identical in appearance and occur at a constant rate of about 250 to 350 beats/min.

LYH With strain pattern Precordial leads in a hpertensive patient with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The ECG far exceeds commonly used voltage criteria for LVH in the precordial leads: the S in V1 plus the R in VS equals 50 mm cupper limit of normal 35 mm) Voltage criteria alone may not be diagnostic of LVH.
However, the associated repolarization abmormality ("strain" pattern) in leads vs and Vo, characterized by downward sloping ST segment depression and T wave inversion. make LVH highly likely. Left atrial atmormality consistent with enlargement is also present as shown by the biphasic $P$ wave with a broad negative deflection in lead $V 1$.

\section*{HYPERTENSION $7^{\text {TH }}$ JOINT NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON HYPERTNSION}

Need for JNC 7
(1) publication of many new hypertension observational studies and clinical trials
(2) need for a new, clear, and concise guideline that would be useful for clinicians
(3) need to simplify the classification of blood pressure
(4) clear recognition that the JNC reports were not being used to their maximum benefit

\section*{Classification of Hypertension}
-Classification of BP for adults ages 18 and older.
-The classification is based on the average of two or more properly measured seated BP readings on each of two or more office visits.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \begin{tabular}{l} 
BP \\
Classification
\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}{l}

\section*{Cardiovascular disease risk}
-As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension increases unless broad and effective preventive measures are implemented.
-Individuals who are normotensive at age 55 have a 90 percent lifetime risk for developing hypertension.
-The relationship between BP and risk of CVD events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors.
The higher the BP, the greater is the chance
$\checkmark$ Heart attack
$\checkmark$ Heart failure
$\checkmark$ Stroke
$\checkmark$ Kidney disease.
-For individuals 40-70 years of age, across the entire BP range from $115 / 75$ to $185 / 115 \mathrm{mmHg}$ each increment of 20 mmHg SBP or 10 mmHg in DBP doubles the risk of CVD.
-The classification "prehypertension,", recognizes this relationship and signals the need for increased education of health care professionals and the public to reduce BP levels and prevent the development of hypertension in the general population.
Hypertension prevention strategies are available to achieve this eg Lifestyle Modifications

\section*{Benefits of lowering the Blood pressure}
-Antihypertensive therapy has been associated with reductions
- stroke incidence by 35-40\%
- myocardial infarction $20-25 \%$

\section*{Blood pressure control rates}
-Goal blood pressure treatment in hypertension is BP below $140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or below $130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$ for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
-In the majority of patients, controlling systolic hypertension has been considerably more difficult than controlling diastolic hypertension.
-Systolic hypertension is a more important CVD risk factor than DBP except in patients younger than age 50 years. It also occurs much more commonly in older persons.
-Effective BP control can be achieved in most patients who are hypertensive, but the majority will require two or more antihypertensive drugs.
-Challenges in BP control
- Patient compliance to drug intake
- clinicians fail to prescribe lifestyle modifications
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug doses
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug combinations
Accurate blood pressure measurement in the office
-The auscultatory method of BP measurement with a properly calibrated and validated instrument should be used.
-Persons should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair (rather than on an exam table), with feet on the floor, and arm supported at heart level.
-Measurement of BP in the standing position is indicated periodically, especially in those at risk for postural hypotension.
-An appropriate-sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80 percent of the arm) should be used to ensure accuracy. -At least two measurements should be made. SBP is the point at which the first of two or more sounds is heard phase 1), and DBP is the point before the disappearance of sounds (phase 5).
-Clinicians should provide to patients, verbally and in writing, their specific BP numbers and BP goals.

Goals of Therapy \\
The ultimate public health goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. \\
Since most persons with hypertension, especially those age >50 years, will reach the DBP goal once SBP is at goal, the primary focus should be on achieving the SBP goal. \\
Treating SBP and DBP to targets that are $<140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ is associated with a decrease in CVD complications. \\
In patients with hypertension and diabetes or renal disease the BP goal is $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$

\section*{SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS}

\section*{Ischemic Heart Disease}
-Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common form of target organ damage associated with hypertension.
-In patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris, the first drug of choice is usually a BB; alternatively, long-acting CCBs can be used.
-In patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), hypertension should be treated initially with BBs and ACEIs, with addition of other drugs as needed for BP control.
-In patients with postmyocardial infarction, ACEIs, BBs, and aldosterone antagonists have proven to be most beneficial.
-Intensive lipid management and aspirin therapy are also indicated.

\section*{Heart Failure}
-Heart failure (HF), in the form of systolic or diastolic ventricular dysfunction, results primarily from systolic hypertension and IHD.
-Fastidious BP and cholesterol control are the primary preventive measures for those at high risk for HF. In asymptomatic individuals with demonstrable ventricular dysfunction, ACEIs and BBs are recommended.
-For those with symptomatic ventricular dysfunction or end-stage heart disease, ACEIs, BBs, ARBs and aldosterone blockers are recommended along with loop diuretics.

\section*{Diabetic Hypertension}
-Combinations of two or more drugs are usually needed to achieve the target goal of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
-Thiazide diuretics, BBs, ACEIs, ARBs, and CCBs are beneficial in reducing CVD and stroke incidence in patients with diabetes.
ACEI- or ARB-based treatments favorably affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy and reduce albuminuria and ARBs have been shown to reduce progression to macroalbuminuria.

\section*{Chronic Kidney Disease}

In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by either
(1) reduced excretory function with an estimated GFR below $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per 1.73 m 2 (corresponding approximately to a creatinine of $>1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $>1.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women)
(2) the presence of albuminuria ( $>300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day or 200 mg albumin/g creatinine), therapeutic goals are to slow deterioration of renal function and prevent CVD.
Hypertension appears in the majority of these patients, and they should receive aggressive BP management, often with three or more drugs to reach target BP values of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
ACEIs and ARBs have demonstrated favorable effects on the progression of diabetic and non diabetic renal disease. A limited rise in serum creatinine of as much as 35 percent above baseline with ACEIs or ARBs is acceptable and is not a reason to withhold treatment unless
-With advanced renal disease (estimated GFR $<30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ 1.73 m 2 , corresponding to a serum creatinine of $2.5-3$ mg/dL), increasing doses of loop diuretics are usually needed in combination with other drug classes.

\section*{Cerebrovascular Disease}

The risks and benefits of acute lowering of BP during an acute stroke are still unclear; control of BP at intermediate levels (approximately $160 / 100 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ) is appropriate until the condition has stabilized or improved.
-Recurrent stroke rates are lowered by the combination of an ACEI and thiazide-type diuretic

\section*{Obesity and the metabolic syndrome}

Obesity (BMI $>30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ ) is an increasingly prevalent risk factor for the development of hypertension and CVD. Metabolic syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following conditions:
1) Abdominal obesity (waist circumference $>40$ inches in men or $>35$ inches in women)
2) Glucose intolerance (fasting glucose >110 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
3) $\mathrm{BP}>130 / 85 \mathrm{mmHg}$
4) High triglycerides ( $>150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) or low HDL ( $<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $<50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women).
Intensive lifestyle modification should be pursued in all individuals with the metabolic syndrome, and appropriate drug therapy should be instituted for each of its components as indicated.

\section*{Left ventricular hypertrophy}

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor that increases the risk of subsequent CVD. Regression of LVH occurs with aggressive BP management, including weight loss, sodium restriction, and treatment with all classes of antihypertensive agents except the direct vasodilators hydralazine, and minoxidil.

\section*{Peripheral arterial disease}

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is equivalent in risk to IHD. Any class of antihypertensive drugs can be used in most PAD patients. Other risk factors should be managed aggressively, and aspirin should be used.

\section*{Postural hypotension}

A decrease in standing SBP $>10 \mathrm{mmHg}$, when associated with dizziness or fainting, is more frequent in older patients with systolic hypertension, diabetes, and those taking diuretics, venodilators (e.g., nitrates, alphablockers, and sildenafil like drugs), and some psychotropic drugs.
BP in these individuals should also be monitored in the upright position. Caution should be used to avoid volume depletion and excessively rapid dose titration of antihypertensive drugs.
hyperkalemia develops.

\section*{Hypertension in women}

Oral contraceptives may increase BP, and the risk of hypertension increases with duration of use.
Women taking oral contraceptives should have their BP checked regularly. Development of hypertension is a reason to consider other forms of contraception. In contrast, menopausal hormone therapy does not raise BP .
Women with hypertension who become pregnant should be followed carefully because of increased risks to mother and fetus.
-Methyldopa, BBs, and vasodilators are preferred medications for the safety of the fetus.
-ACEI and ARBs should not be used during pregnancy because of the potential for fetal defects and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant. -Preeclampsia, which occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy, is characterized by new-onset or worsening hypertension, albuminuria, and hyperuricemia ,sometimes with coagulation abnormalities.
-In some patients, preeclampsia may develop into a hypertensive urgency or emergency and may require hospitalization, intensive monitoring, early fetal delivery, and parenteral antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapy

\section*{Potential favorable effects of anti-hypertensives}
-Thiazide-type diuretics are useful in slowing demineralization in osteoporosis.
-BBs can be useful in the treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias/ fibrillation, migraine, thyrotoxicosis (short term), essential tremor, or perioperative hypertension.
-CCBs may be useful in Raynaud's syndrome and certain arrhythmias,
- Alpha-blockers may be useful in prostatism.

\section*{Potential unfavorable effects}
-Thiazide diuretics should be used cautiously in patients who have gout or who have a history of significant hyponatremia.
-BBs should generally be avoided in individuals who have asthma, reactive airways disease, or second or third degree heart block.
- ACEIs and ARBs should not be given to women likely to become pregnant and are contraindicated in those who are.
-ACEIs should not be used in individuals with a history of angioedema.
-Aldosterone antagonists and potassium-sparing diuretics can cause hyperkalemia and should generally be avoided in patients who have serum potassium values more than $5.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ while not taking medications.

\section*{Resistant Hypertension}

Resistant hypertension is the failure to reach goal BP in patients who are adhering to full doses of an appropriate three-drug regimen that includes a diuretic.

\section*{Causes}
1.Improper BP Measurement

\section*{ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE}

Dr Martin M Murage
- Ischemia refers to lack of oxygen due to inadequate perfusion of the myocardium causing an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand
- Most common cause is obstructive atherosclerotic disease of the epicardial coronary arteries
- Coronary circulation is unique as it is responsible for generating the arterial pressure that is required for systemic perfusion,
- myocardial perfusion is impeded during systolic contraction: there is an increase in tissue pressure, circulation is redistributed from the subendocardial layers of the heart to the subepicardial, impedes coronary artery inflow, reduces the diameter of the intramyocardial microcirculatory vessels, increases coronary venous outflow,
- in diastole coronary arterial inflow increases with a gradient that favours perfusion to the subendocardial layers.
- Myocardial oxygen extraction is 75\% at rest
- Increases in myocardial oxygen consumptions are met by increases in coronary blood flow and oxygen delivery
- Oxygen delivery is directly determined by arterial oxygen content PaO 2
- Determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption are heart rate, systolic pressure(myocardial wall stress), and LV contractility
- A 2 fold increase in any of these determinants requires a approx. $50 \%$ increase in coronary blood flow.
- The classic manifestation of ischemia is angina described as heavy chest pressure or squeezing, burning feeling or difficulty in breathing, pain may radiate to the left shoulder or arm , neck
- Builds in intensity over few minutes, may develop with exercise or psychological stress , may occur without any precipitating factors
- Ischemic heart disease can be present as acute coronary syndrome or as stable angina secondary to chronic coronary artery disease .
- with acute chest pain and persistent ( $>20 \mathrm{~min}$ ) ST-segment elevation.
- This condition is termed ST-elevation ACS and generally reflects an acute total coronary occlusion. Most patients will ultimately develop an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
- acute chest pain but no persistent ST-segment elevation.
- ECG changes may include transient ST-segment elevation, persistent or transient ST-segment depression, T -wave inversion, flat T waves or pseudonormalization of T waves or the ECG may be normal.
- spectrum of non-ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) may range from patients free of symptoms at presentation to individuals with ongoing ischaemia, electrical or haemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest.
- The pathological correlate at the myocardial level is cardiomyocyte necrosis [NSTE-myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)] or, less frequently, myocardial ischaemia without cell loss (unstable angina)
- Acute myocardial infarction (MI) defines cardiomyocyte necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia.
- A combination of criteria is required to meet the diagnosis of acute MI, namely the detection of an increase and/or decrease of a cardiac biomarker, preferably high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and at least one of the following:
- Symptoms of ischaemia.
- New or presumed new significant ST-T wave changes or left bundle branch block on 12-lead ECG.
- Development of pathological Q waves on ECG.
- Imaging evidence of new or presumed new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality.
- Intracoronary thrombus detected on angiography or autopsy

\section*{- Type 1 MI}
- characterized by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissure, erosion or dissection with resulting intraluminal thrombus in one or more coronary arteries leading to decreased myocardial blood flow and/or distal embolization and subsequent myocardial necrosis.
- The patient may have underlying severe coronary artery disease (CAD) but, on occasion (i.e. $5-20 \%$ of cases), there may be non-obstructive coronary atherosclerosis or no angiographic evidence of CAD, particularly in women.
- Type 2 MI
- myocardial necrosis in which a condition other than coronary plaque instability contributes to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
- Mechanisms include coronary artery spasm, coronary endothelial dysfunction, tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, anaemia, respiratory failure, hypotension and severe hypertension.
- In addition, in critically ill patients and in patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery, myocardial necrosis may be related to injurious effects of pharmacological agents and toxins. ${ }^{\underline{6}}$
- type 3 MI (MI resulting in death when biomarkers are not available)
- type 4 and 5 MI (related to percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] and coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG], respectively).
- Unstable angina is defined as myocardial ischaemia at rest or minimal exertion in the absence of cardiomyocyte necrosis.
- Compared with NSTEMI patients, individuals with unstable angina do not experience myocardial necrosis, have a substantially lower risk of death and appear to derive less benefit from intensified antiplatelet therapy as well as early invasive strategy.
- Anginal pain in NSTE-ACS patients may have the following presentations:
- Prolonged (>20 min) anginal pain at rest;
- New onset (de novo) angina (class II or III of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society classification)
- Recent destabilization of previously stable angina with at least Canadian Cardiovascular Society Class III angina characteristics (crescendo angina); or
- Post-MI angina.
- Prolonged and de novo/crescendo angina are observed in $\sim 80 \%$ and $\sim 20 \%$ of patients, respectively. Typical chest pain is characterized by a retrosternal sensation of pressure or heaviness ('angina') radiating to the left arm (less frequently to both arms or to the right arm), neck or jaw, which may be intermittent (usually lasting several minutes) or persistent.
- Additional symptoms such as sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnoea and syncope may be present
- Atypical presentations include epigastric pain, indigestion-like symptoms and isolated dyspnoea.
- Atypical complaints are more often observed in the elderly, in women and in patients with diabetes, chronic renal disease or dementia.
- The exacerbation of symptoms by physical exertion and their relief at rest increase the probability of myocardial ischaemia. The relief of symptoms after nitrates administration is not specific for anginal pain as it is reported also in other causes of acute chest pain.
- In patients presenting with suspected MI , Older age, male gender, family history of CAD, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, renal insufficiency, previous manifestation of CAD as well as peripheral or carotid artery disease increase the likelihood of ACS.
- Conditions that may exacerbate or precipitate-ACS include anaemia, infection, inflammation, fever, and metabolic or endocrine (in particular thyroid) disorders.

\section*{Physical examination}
- May be unremarkable in patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.
- Signs of heart failure or haemodynamic or electrical instability
- systolic murmur due to ischaemic mitral regurgitation, which is associated with poor prognosis, or aortic stenosis (mimicking ACS)
- systolic murmur may indicate a mechanical complication (i.e. papillary muscle rupture or ventricular septal defect) of a subacute and possibly undetected MI.
- signs of non-coronary causes of chest pain (e.g. pulmonary embolism, acute aortic syndromes, myopericarditis, aortic stenosis)
- extracardiac pathologies (e.g. pneumothorax, pneumonia or musculoskeletal diseases). In this setting, the presence of a chest pain that can be reproduced by exerting pressure on the chest wall has a relatively high negative predictive value for NSTE-ACS
- According to the presentation, abdominal disorders (e.g. oesophageal spasm, oesophagitis, gastric ulcer, cholecystitis, pancreatitis) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
- Differences in blood pressure between the upper and lower limbs or between the arms, irregular pulse, jugular vein distension, heart murmurs, friction rub and pain reproduced by chest or abdominal palpation are findings suggestive of alternative diagnoses.
- Pallor, sweating or tremor may point towards precipitating conditions such as anaemia and thyrotoxicosis
- The resting 12-lead ECG is the first-line diagnostic tool in the assessment of patients with suspected ACS. It is recommended to obtain it within 10 min of the patient's arrival in the emergency room or, ideally, at first contact with emergency medical services in the pre-hospital setting and to have it immediately interpreted by a qualified physician.
- While the ECG in the setting of NSTE-ACS may be normal in more than onethird of patients, characteristic abnormalities include ST depression, transient ST elevation and T -wave changes
- Measurement of a biomarker of cardiomyocyte injury, preferably high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, is mandatory in all patients with suspected NSTE-ACS.
- Cardiac troponins are more sensitive and specific markers of cardiomyocyte injury than creatine kinase (CK), its MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) and myoglobin.
- In patients with MI, levels of cardiac troponin rise rapidly (i.e. usually within 1 $h$ if using high-sensitivity assays) after symptom onset and remain elevated for a variable period of time (usually several days)
- echocardiography should be routinely available in emergency rooms and chest pain units and performed/interpreted by trained physicians in all patients during hospitalization for NSTE-ACS.
- useful to identify abnormalities suggestive of myocardial ischaemia or necrosis (i.e. segmental hypokinesia or akinesia).
- In the absence of significant wall motion abnormalities, impaired myocardial perfusion detected by contrast echocardiography or reduced regional function using strain and strain rate imaging might improve the diagnostic and prognostic value of conventional echocardiography
- In patients without ischaemic changes on 12-lead ECGs and negative cardiac troponins (preferably high-sensitivity) who are free of chest pain for several hours, stress imaging can be performed during admission or shortly after discharge. Stress imaging is preferred over exercise ECG due to its greater diagnostic accuracy.
- Various studies have shown that normal exercise, dobutamine or dipyridamole stress echocardiograms have high negative predictive value for ischaemia and are associated with excellent patient outcomes.
- stress echocardiography demonstrated superior prognostic value over exercise ECG.
- The addition of contrast may improve endocardial border detection, which may facilitate detection of ischaemia.
- Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can assess both perfusion and wall motion abnormalities, and patients presenting with acute chest pain with a normal stress CMR have an excellent short- and midterm prognosis.
- CMR also permits detection of scar tissue (using late gadolinium enhancement) and can differentiate this from recent infarction (using T2-weighted imaging to delineate myocardial oedema).
- Moreover, CMR can facilitate the differential diagnosis between infarction and myocarditis or Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy
- Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) allows for visualization of the coronary arteries and a normal scan excludes CAD

${ }^{\text {a }}$ Dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathies may cause angina or chest discomfort.

\section*{pharmacological treatment}
- anti-ischaemic therapy to decrease myocardial oxygen demand (secondary to a decrease in heart rate, blood pressure, preload or myocardial contractility) or to increase myocardial oxygen supply (by administration of oxygen or through coronary vasodilation).
- Oxygen: should be administered when blood oxygen saturation is $<90 \%$ or if the patient is in respiratory distress.
- Nitrates :Intravenous nitrates are more effective than sublingual nitrates with regard to symptom relief and regression of ST depression
- Beta-blockers:Beta-blockers competitively inhibit the myocardial effects of circulating catecholamines and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption by lowering heart rate, blood pressure and myocardial contractility
- Platelet inhibition;
- Aspirin irreversibly inactivates the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity of platelet prostaglandin endoperoxide (PGH) synthase 1 (COX-1), thereby suppressing thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ production throughout the platelet lifespan
- Clopidogrel, P2Y ${ }_{12}$ inhibitors Clopidogrel ( $300-600 \mathrm{mg}$ loading and $75 \mathrm{mg} /$ day maintenance dose) is an inactive prodrug that requires oxidation by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system to generate an active metabolite
- Prasugrel ( 60 mg loading and $10 \mathrm{mg} /$ day maintenance dose) is a prodrug that irreversibly blocks platelet $\mathrm{P} 2 \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ receptors with a faster onset and a more profound inhibitory effect than clopidogrel
- Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly binding $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ inhibitor with a plasma half-life of $6-12 \mathrm{~h}$.
- Cangrelor is an i.v. adenosine triphosphate (ATP) analogue that binds reversibly and with high affinity to the platelet $\mathrm{P}_{2} \mathrm{Y}_{12}$ receptor and has a short plasma halflife (<10 min)
- Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors Intravenous GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors block platelet aggregation by inhibiting fibrinogen binding to a conformationally activated form of the GPIIb/IIIa receptor on two adjacent platelets

\section*{MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Definition}
-Myocardial infarction (MI) is the necrosis of heart muscle secondary to prolonged ischemia.
-This usually results from an imbalance of oxygen supply and demand.

\section*{Background}

MI is considered, part of a spectrum referred to as acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), which also includes unstable angina ,ST elevation MI (STEMI)and non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI).
Patients with ischemic discomfort may or may not have ST-segment elevation. Most of those with ST-segment elevation will develop Q waves. Those without ST elevations will ultimately be diagnosed with unstable angina or NSTEMI based on the presence of cardiac enzymes.
MI may lead to impairment of systolic function or diastolic function and to increased predisposition to arrhythmias and other long-term complications.

\section*{Pathophysiology}
-Acute MI occur due to ischemia of the myocardial due to the perfusion /oxygen demand mismatch.
-In majority of case this is due to coronary artery disease>90\% of cases.
-AMI due coronary artery disease generally occurs when coronary blood flow decreases abruptly after a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery previously narrowed by atherosclerosis.
-Slowly developing, high-grade coronary artery stenoses usually do not precipitate AMI because of development of a rich collateral network over time.
-AMI occurs when a coronary artery thrombus develops over atherosclerotic plaque when it fissures, ruptures, or ulcerates leading platelet activation and aggregation, coagulation pathway activation, and endothelial vasoconstriction occur and lead to coronary thrombosis and occlusion.
-This injury is produced or facilitated by factors such as
$\checkmark$ cigarette smoking
$\checkmark$ Hypertension
$\checkmark$ Lipid accumulation.
-Atherosclerotic plaques prone to rupture are those with a rich lipid core and a thin fibrous cap
-After an initial platelet monolayer forms at the site of the ruptured plaque, various agonists (collagen, ADP, epinephrine, serotonin) promote platelet activation. -Platelets also release of thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ cause further vasoconstrictor, further platelet activation vicois cycle propagate occlusion.
-. Total occlusion of the vessel for more than 4-6 hours results in irreversible myocardial necrosis, but reperfusion within this period can salvage the myocardium and reduce morbidity and mortality
- Non-atherosclerotic causes of MI include
$\checkmark$ Coronary vasospasm as seen in variant (Prinzmetal) angina
$\checkmark$ Patients using cocaine and amphetamines
$\checkmark$ Coronary emboli from sources such as an infected heart valve
$\checkmark$ Occlusion of the coronaries due to vasculitis
$\checkmark$ Other causes leading to mismatch of oxygen supply and demand, such as acute anemia from GI bleeding
$\checkmark$ MI induced by chest trauma
-The amount of myocardial damage caused by coronary occlusion depends on
(1) Territory supplied by the affected vessel
(2) Degree of occlusion of vessel
(3) Duration of coronary occlusion
(4) Presence of collateral blood supply.
(5) Demand for oxygen of the myocardium whose blood supply has been suddenly limited
(6) native factors that can produce early spontaneous lysis of the occlusive thrombus
(7Adequacy of myocardial perfusion in the infarct zone when flow is restored in the occluded epicardial coronary artery.

\section*{Frequency}

MI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States
There has been a progressive increase in the proportion of patients who are diagnosed with NSTEMI compared with STEMI.
MI continues to be a significant problem in industrialized countries and is becoming an increasingly significant problem in developing countries

\section*{Mortality}
-1/3 of patients who experience STEMI will die within 24 hours of the onset of ischemia and many of the survivors will suffer significant morbidity.
- For many patients, the first manifestation of coronary artery disease is sudden death likely from malignant ventricular dysrhythmia.
-More than one half of deaths occur in the prehospital setting.(1 ${ }^{\text {st }} 30$ minutes)
-In-hospital fatalities account for 10\% of all deaths. An additional 10\% of deaths occur in the first year postinfarction.
Sex:
Male predilection before onset of menopause.
After menopause the risk is almost equal but woman worse prognosis because of atypical presentation.
Age:
MI occurs most frequently in persons older than 45 years.
Certain subpopulations younger than 45 years are at risk
$\checkmark$ Cocaine and amphetamine abusers.
$\checkmark$ DM
$\checkmark$ Hypercholesterolemia-Familial
$\checkmark$ Positive family history for early coronary disease

-The most frequent cause of MI is rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque within a coronary artery with subsequent arterial spasm and thrombus formation. Other causes include the following: \\
1-Coronary artery vasospasm \\
2-Ventricular hypertrophy (eg, left ventricular hypertrophy \\
3-[LVH], idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis [IHSS], underlying valve disease) \\
4-Hypoxia due to carbon monoxide poisoning or acute pulmonary disorders (Infarcts due to pulmonary disease usually occur when demand on the myocardium dramatically increases relative to the available blood supply.) \\
5-Coronary artery emboli, secondary to cholesterol, air, vegetations from damaged valves \\
6-Drugs-Cocaine, amphetamines, and ephedrine \\
7-Arteritis \\
8-Coronary anomalies, including aneurysms of the coronary arteries \\
9-Increased afterload or inotropic effects, which increase the demand on the myocardium \\
10-Aortic dissection, with retrograde involvement of the coronary arteries \\
11-Although rare, pediatric coronary artery disease may be seen with Marfan syndrome, Kawasaki disease, Takayasu arteritis, progeria, and cystic medial necrosis

Investigations \\
Lab Studies: \\
1)Cardiac enzymes \\
a) Troponin I and T \\
$\checkmark$ begin to rise 4-8 hours after an MI \\
$\checkmark$ peak 12-24 hours \\
$\checkmark$ remain elevated for up to 14days \\
-The preferred biomarker for diagnosis.Troponins have the greatest sensitivity and specificity in detecting MI. \\
-The test result is both diagnostic as well as prognostic of outcome. \\
- Troponin is a complex of three proteins on the thin filaments of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers. During muscle contraction the troponin complex regulates the interaction between the thick and thin filaments. \\
-This complex consists of troponin $\mathrm{T}(\mathrm{TnT})$, troponin I (TnI) and troponin C (TnC). Troponin C is identical in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but the amino acid sequences of troponin T and troponin I found in cardiac muscle is different from that of the troponins in skeletal muscle. \\
-These isoforms of cardiac troponins, cTnT and cTnI, are very specific to cardiac muscle and their presence in blood indicates cardiac tissue necrosis. Because of this specificity, cardiac troponin T or I is now the preferred cardiac marker \\
-For early detection of myocardial necrosis, sensitivity of this laboratory test is superior to that of the CK-MB. \\
b)CK and Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) \\
$\checkmark$ begin to rise within 6-10 hours after injury \\
$\checkmark$ peak at 18-24 hours \\
$\checkmark$ subside over 72 hours \\
-A level within the reference range does not exclude myocardial necrosis. \\
NB.CK-has Two subunits, B (brain) and M(muscle) combine to form 3 isoenzymes of CK: CK-MM(CK-1), CK- MB(CK-2), CK-BB(CK-3). Elevations in total CK activity occur in conditions affecting brain, skeletal muscle, and heart muscle. CK-MB(CK-2) is found almost entirely in myocardial tissue and elevations of this isoenzyme more specific for MI. \\
-Occasionally, very small infarcts can be missed by CKMB; therefore, a troponin level should be measured for patients suspected of having had MI who have negative serial CK-MBs. \\
c) Myoglobin \\
Blood levels of myoglobin become \\
$\checkmark$ Elevated within 2 hours of an MI \\
$\checkmark$ Peak within 4-10 hours \\
$\checkmark$ Return to normal within 24 hours \\
-Levels rise early in the course of MI. Has emerged as an ideal early marker. \\
-Myoglobin, a low-molecular-weight heme protein found in cardiac and skeletal muscle, is released more rapidly from infarcted myocardium than troponin and CK-MB and may be detected as early as 2 hours after MI. \\
-The marker has high sensitivity but poor specificity. Thus, its presence is not diagnostic of MI, but it still has utility in the early triage of chest pain patients. \\
-When performed in conjunction with other studies, it may be useful for the early detection of MI. and detection of any recurrences of MI.
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
d) Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level rises above the reference range within 24 hours of MI, reaches a peak within 3-6 days, and returns to the baseline within 8-12 days.

\section*{Other Lab Test}

\section*{1.Complete blood count}
-Anemia is suspected as a precipitant.
-Transfusion with packed red blood cells may be indicated.
-Leukocytosis may be observed within several hours after an AMI. It peaks in 2-4 days and returns to levels within the reference range within 1 week.

\section*{2.Urea/Electrolytes /Creatinine.}
-Potassium and magnesium levels should be monitored and corrected.
-Potassium imbalances especially hypokalemia predispose to arrhythmia
-Creatinine levels must be considered before using an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.

\section*{3.C-reactive protein (CRP) and ESR}

C-reactive protein marker of acute inflammation. Patients without biochemical evidence of myocardial necrosis but with elevated CRP are at increased risk of a subsequent ischemic event.
ESR rises above reference range values within 3 days and may remain elevated for weeks.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

\section*{a)CXR}
-Chest radiography may provide clues to an alternative or complicating diagnosis eg, aortic dissection,
pneumothorax -Complications of MI such as pulmonary edema secondary to heart failure.

\section*{b)Echocardiography}
-Wall motion abnormalities and overall ventricular function.
-Echocardiography also can identify complications of MI (eg, valvular insufficiency, ventricular dysfunction, pericardial effusion).

\section*{c)Technetium-99m sestamibi scan}

Technetium- 99 m is a radioisotope that is taken up by the myocardium in proportion to the blood flow and is only minimally redistributed after initial uptake. This allows for time delay between injection of the isotope and imaging. It has potential use in identifying infarct in patients with atypical presentations or in patients with ECGs that are not interpretable.

\section*{d)ECG}
-Results indicating high probability of MI:
$\checkmark$ ST-segment elevation greater than 1 mm in 2 anatomically contiguous leads
$\checkmark$ Presence of new Q waves.
-Results indicating intermediate probability of MI
$\checkmark$ ST-segment depression
$\checkmark$ T-wave inversion
$\checkmark$ Other nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. -Results indicating low probability of MI are normal findings on ECG; however, normal or nonspecific findings on ECG do not exclude the possibility of MI.

Localization of MI based on distribution of ECG
abnormalities is as follows:
- Inferior wall - II, III, aVF
- Lateral wall - I, aVL, $\mathrm{V}_{4}-\mathrm{V}_{6}$
- Anteroseptal - $\mathrm{V}_{1}-\mathrm{V}_{3}$
- Anterolateral - $\mathrm{V}_{1}-\mathrm{V}_{6}$
- Right ventricular - $\mathrm{RV}_{4}, \mathrm{RV}_{5}$
- Posterior wall - $\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{S}$ ratio $>1$ in $\mathrm{V}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{2}$; T wave changes (i.e., upright) in $\mathrm{V}_{1}, \mathrm{~V}_{8}$, and $\mathrm{V}_{9}$

\section*{Procedures:}
-Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are a group of catheter-based technologies used to establish coronary reperfusion.
-Angiography provides essential knowledge of the extent of coronary disease, and is performed prior to PCI.
- PCI may then be performed as a primary intervention or due to failure of thrombolysis.
-Evidence suggests that primary PCI is more effective than thrombolysis. They have fewer bleeding complications and less recurrent ischemia when compared with thrombolysis. PCI restores coronary artery patency in more than 90\% of patients
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) (balloon angioplasty) is the primary therapeutic modality used at centers where it can provide reperfusion as quickly as fibrinolytic therapy.
-Coronary artery bypass graft may be indicated based on angiographic findings.

\section*{MANAGEMENT}
-Initial therapy for acute MI is directed toward restoration of perfusion in order to salvage as much of the jeopardized myocardium as possible.
-This may be accomplished through medical or mechanical means, such as angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting.
Further treatment is aimed at:
(1) Restoration of the balance between the oxygen supply and demand to prevent further ischemia
(2) Pain relief
(3) Prevention and treatment of complications
(4)Address underlying risk factors

\section*{1. Oxygen}

Supplemental oxygen should be administered to all patients especially with arterial oxygen desaturation ( $\mathrm{SaO}_{2}$ less than $90 \%$ ).

\section*{2. Analgesia-Morphine}

Morphine sulfate (2 to 4 mg IV with increments of 2 to 8 mg IV repeated at 5 - to 15 -minute intervals) is the analgesic of choice for management of pain associated with STEMI. It also relieves anxiety

\section*{3. Aspirin and anti-platelets}

Aspirin should be chewed by patients who have not taken aspirin before presentation with STEMI. The initial dose should be 162 mg to 325 mg .
In a dose of 162 mg or more, aspirin produces a rapid clinical antithrombotic effect caused by immediate and near-total inhibition of thromboxane A2 production.
Aspirin now forms part of the early management of all patients with suspected STEMI and should be given promptly, and certainly within the first 24 hours, at a dose between 162 and 325 mg and continued indefinitely at a daily dose of 75 to 162 mg
Use clopidogrel (Plavix) in case of aspirin allergy.

\section*{Other anti-platelets}

Administer a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonist
$\checkmark$ Epti-fiba-tide
$\checkmark$ Tirofiban
$\checkmark$ Abciximab
The addition of IV platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIareceptor antagonists to aspirin and heparin improves both early and late outcomes, including mortality, Q-wave MI, need for revascularization procedures, and length of hospital stay

\section*{4. Nitrates-Nitroglycerin}

Patients with ongoing ischemic discomfort should receive sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0.4 mg ) every 5 minutes for a total of 3 doses, after which an assessment should be made about the need for intravenous nitroglycerin.
-Intravenous nitroglycerin is indicated for relief of ongoing ischemic discomfort, control of hypertension, or management of pulmonary congestion.
NB. Contra. SBP less than 90 mm Hg , severe bradycardia (less than 50 bpm ), tachycardia (more than 100 bpm ), or suspected RV infarction.
-Contra.patients who have received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor for erectile dysfunction within the last 24 hours (48 hours for tadalafil).

\section*{5. Beta-Blockers}
-It is reasonable to administer IV beta-blockers promptly to STEMI patients without contraindications, especially if a tachyarrhythmia or hypertension is present.
-Beta-blockers reduce the rates of reinfarction and recurrent ischemia and possibly reduce the mortality rate if administered within 12 hours after MI. Administer routinely to all patients with MI unless a contraindication is present
-Immediate beta-blocker therapy appears to reduce the magnitude of infarction and incidence of associated complications in subjects not receiving concomitant fibrinolytic therapy, the rate of reinfarction in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy, and the frequency of lifethreatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias
Eg-Metoprolol
-Esmolol
-Atenolol

\section*{6) ACE inhibitors-Enalapril,Captopril}
-Reduce mortality rates after MI.
-They reduce post infarction heart remodeling.
-Administer ACE inhibitors as soon as possible as long as the patient has no contraindications and remains in stable condition.
-ACE inhibitors have the greatest benefit in patients with ventricular dysfunction.
-Continue ACE inhibitors indefinitely after MI.
-Angiotensin-receptor blockers may be used as an alternative in patients who develop adverse effects, such as a persistent cough

\section*{7.)Thrombolytic therapy}
-Has been shown to improve survival rates in patients with acute MI if administered in a timely fashion in the appropriate group of patients.
-If PCI capability is not available or will cause a delay greater than 90 minutes, then the optimal approach is to administer thrombolytics within 12 hours of onset of symptoms in patients with ST-segment elevation greater than 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous ECG leads, new left bundle-branch block (LBBB), or anterior ST depression consistent with posterior infarction.
-Tissue plasminogen activator ( $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{PA}$ ) is superior to streptokinase in achieving a higher rate of coronary artery patency; however, the key to efficacy lies in the speed of the delivery of therapy.
-High patency rate is achieved if platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist is combined with a half dose of thrombolytic agent as the initial reperfusion strategy.

\section*{Streptokinase}

Acts with plasminogen to convert plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots, as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. Non-specific acts on both the free and fibrin bound plasminogen.
Increase in fibrinolytic activity that degrades fibrinogen levels for $24-36 \mathrm{~h}$ occurs with IV infusion of streptokinase

\section*{Anistreplase}
(Anisoylated Plasminogen- Streptokinase activator Complex)
Non-fibrin-specific agent that activates conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and has half-life of 90 min . However, does not have any benefit over streptokinase, although has higher rate of allergic and bleeding complications. Easier to administer than t-PA, has lower cost and does not require heparinization.
Dose- 30 IU over 2-5 min
Other non-specific thrombolytic is Urokinase-human enzyme from the kidney.

\section*{Alteplase, t-PA}

Fibrin-specific agent with brief half-life of 5 min .
Adjunctive therapy with IV heparin necessary to maintain patency of arteries recanalized by t-PA, especially during first $24-48 \mathrm{~h}$.
Dose-15 mg IV initial bolus, followed by 50 mg IV over next 30 min , and then 35 mg IV over next h ; total dose not to exceed 100 mg

\section*{Reteplase}

Recombinant plasminogen activator that forms plasmin after facilitating cleavage of endogenous plasminogen.
Heparin and aspirin usually administered concomitantly and after reteplase
Dose-10 IU IV over 2 min, followed by second 10-IU IV dose after 30 min .

\section*{8)Anticoagulation}

Only required with admin of specific fibrinolyticAlteplace, Reteplace, Tenectaplace.
Unfractionated Heparin - 10,000 IU TID
Fractionated -LMW- Enoxaparin (Lovenox) -- Enhances inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin by increasing antithrombin III activity. In addition, preferentially increases inhibition of factor Xa.
Dose- $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ SC bid

\section*{Discharge medications and lifestyle modification}

\section*{1. The long-term use of aspirin}
-in patients who have had an MI results in significant reduction in subsequent mortality rate.

\section*{2. Beta-blocker therapy}

Confirmed therapeutic benefit in survivors of acute MI.
This therapy is most beneficial in patients with the highest risk.

\section*{3. ACE inhibitor}
-Use in patients with known CAD has been shown to reduce mortality rate.

\section*{4.Long-term anticoagulant (ie, warfarin)}
-Therapy is not routinely used in post-MI patients but as an alternative in patients who cannot take antiplatelet agents.
-Patients with known LV thrombus, atrial fibrillation, or severe wall motion abnormalities have shown benefit from long-term anticoagulation, maintaining the international normalized ratio (INR) between 2

Adjunctive therapy with heparin not needed.
-Dose-1.5 million IU over I hour IV infusion.
-Local delivery by catheter admin 10,000-25000 IU
loading dose then $4000 \mathrm{IU} / \mathrm{min}$ up to 75 minutes during angiography.NB.For peripheral arterial occlusion admin loading dose IV infusion of 250,000 IU then 100,000 IU per hour for 1-3 days
NB.

\section*{Modification of risks}

\section*{1. Lipid-lowering therapy}

Secondary and primary prevention of CAD -Atovastation.

\section*{2.HTN and DM control}

\section*{3.Smoking cessation}
-Risk of recurrent coronary events decreases 50\% at 1 year after smoking cessation
-Bupropion has been shown to increase the chances of patients' success in achieving smoking cessation.

\section*{4.Alcohol consumption-}

\section*{Reduce excess use}
5. Antioxidant therapy, including vitamin E, has not shown clear benefit in the prevention of coronary events.

\section*{Complications:}

\section*{1.Arrythmia}

Close monitoring and immediate treatment of arrhythmias may be the most important part of the treatment of a postMI patient within the first 48 hours.
Exacerbating factors, such as electrolyte disturbances (especially potassium and magnesium), hypoxemia, drugs, or acidosis, and correct them accordingly.
Ventricular fibrillation and/or ventricular tachycardia occurring within the first 48 hours may be due to ischemia; -Immediate cardio version is the treatment of choice
2. CCF can be due to systolic dysfunction or diastolic dysfunction in the setting of MI.
3. Valve dysfunction due to damage of chordae tendinae. 4.Ventricular rapture
5. Ventricluar septal defects with communication.

\section*{Diseases of the Pericardium}
- Acute Pericarditis
- Pericardial Effusion
- Constrictive Pericarditis

\section*{Acute Pericarditis}

\section*{Acute Pericarditis common causes}

Outpatient setting
- usually idiopathic
- probably due to viral infections
- Coxsackie A and B (highly cardiotropic) are the most common viral cause of pericarditis and myocarditis
- Others viruses: mumps, varicella-zoster, influenza, Epstein-Barr, HIV

\section*{Diseases of the Pericardium}

\section*{Acute Pericarditis}
- Primary:
- Usually due to viral infection Course brief and usually uncomplicated
- Secondary
- Result from other conditions: rheumatic or collagen diseases, radiotherapy or rend failure related, often exhibit clinical feature, similar to acute pericarditis

\section*{Acute Pericarditis common causes}

In-patient setting
T = Trauma, TUMOR
U = Uremia
M = Myocardial infarction (acute, post)
Medications (hydralazine, procainamide)
O = Other infections (bacterial, fungal, TB)
R = Rheumatoid, autoimmune disorder, Radiation

\section*{Special Ethiologic Forms of acute Pericarditis and Pericardial Effusion}
- Renal failure and dialysis: more extensive dialysis and NSAID is usually successful occasionally pericardocentesis necessary
- unexpected drop of B.P during dialysis may be the clue
- Radiation induced pericardial effusion:
- After radiation to the mediastinum
- May evolve into constrictive Pericarditis after many years
- Neoplastic pericardial effusion
- Accounts for $50 \%$ of patient with tamponade
- Lung, Breast cancers accounts for majority of causes, lymphomas and leukemia also important causes
- Purulent Pericarditis: usually requires surgical draming
- Drug induced Pericarditis: Procainamide, Minoxidil, Methylsergide
- Post Cardiotomy Syndrome

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Diagnostic Clues}
- History
sudden onset of anterior chest pain that is pleuritic and substernal
- Physical exam presence of two- or three-component rub
- ECG
most important laboratory clue

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Differential Diagnosis}
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pneumonia
- Aortic dissection

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Chest Pain History pericarditis vs infarction}
- Common characteristics
- retrosternl or precordial with raditaion to the neck, back, left shoulder or arm
- Special characteristics (pericarditis)
- more likely to be sharp and pleuritic
- $\uparrow$ with coughing, inspiration, swallowing
- worse by lying supine, relieved by sitting and leaning forward

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Heart Murmurs of Pericarditis}
- Pericardial friction rub is pathognomic for pericarditis
- scratching or grating sound
- Classically three components:
- presystolic rub during atrial filling
- ventricular systolic rub (loudest)
- ventricular diastolic rub (after A2P2

EKG contrast the pattern of ST segment elevation characteristic of acute pericarditis (a) with the normal variant (early repolarization) pattern of ST segment elevation (b). The normal variant pattern is associated with a normal or slow heart rate and has relatively tall R waves and T waves in V 4 , V 5 , and V6. The ST segment elevation is less than $25 \%$ of the T wave amplitude. In contrast, the acute pericarditis has PR depression and lower T wave.

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Management}
- Analgesic agents
- codeine $15-30 \mathrm{mg}$ q $4-6 \mathrm{hr}$
- Anti-inflmmatory agents
- Treat underlying cause
- ASA 648 mg q 3-4 hrs
- NSAID (indomethacin $25-50 \mathrm{mg}$ qid)
- Corticosteroids are symptomatically effective , but preferably avoided

\section*{Acute Pericarditis}

- Friction rub, fever, Tachycardia
- EKG changes are common (diffuse ST-T changes with absence of reciprocal ST depression when ST elevation is present, depressed PR segment)
- Mild elevation of cardiac enzymes
- Treatment
- Analgesics - codeine, hydrocodone
- NSAID - Indomethacin ( $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ )
- Corticosteroids - ( $40-60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{d}$ ) , slow tapering (2-4 weeks) due to possible recurrence after steroid withdrawal

\section*{Other forms of Acute Pericarditis}
- Relapsing Pericarditis
- Acute Pericarditis of any etiology may relapse
- Treatment: Colchicine, Prednisone or immnosuppressants
- Progression to constriction
- Rarely acute pericarditis progresses to subucute / chromic

\section*{Other Forms of Pericarditis Dressler's Syndrome}
- Described by Dressler in 1956
- fever, pericarditis, pleuritis (typically with a low grade fever and a pericardial friction rub)
- occurs in the first few days to several weeks following MI or heart surgery
- incidence of 6-25\%
- treat with high-dose aspirin

\section*{Other Forms of Pericarditis Bacterial Pericarditis}
- Rare condition in antibiotic era (steadily decreased over last 40 years)
- Typically arises from contiguous spread of intrathoracic infection (pneumonia, empyema, mediastinitis, endocarditis, trauma, surgery)
- Usually fatal without adequate treatment
- Diagnosis frequently missed
- Often lacks characteristic features of acute pericarditis

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Key Points}
- Acute pericarditis is accompanied by pericardial effusion in 60\% of cases and tamponade in as many as 15\% of cases.
- Outpatient management of acute idiopathic pericarditis is acceptable if there is no effusion at predischarge echocardiography and surveillance can be provided at home.
- In the care of patients in clinically stable condition who are being hospitalized, echocardiography should be performed in the first 24 hours because a large effusion is the best predictor of poor outcome

\section*{Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade}

\section*{Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade}
- Fluid can accumalte in the pericardium in any form of pericardial disease
- Transudate
- Exudate
- Serosanguineous: Idopathic, dialysis-related, neoplastic, radiation induced, TB, coagulapaties
- Bloody: Coagulopathies, trauma, rupture in MI and in aortic dissection
- Cardiac Tamponade is the most important complication of fluid accumulation

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade pathophysiology}

Fluid accumulation within the pericardial space resulting in
- increased intracardiac pressure
- progressive limitation of ventricular diastolic filling
- reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade}
- The physiological effect depends on the rate of fluid accumulation
- Gradually the pericardium may strech and accommodate > $2,000 \mathrm{ml}$
- Acutely as little as 200 ml of accumulated fluid may raise the intrapercardial pressure to cause tamponade
- JVD elevated (rarely not in low pressure tamponade)
- B.P variable, paradoxical pulse ( $>10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{HG} \Delta$ )
- Echocardiography
- Treatment: fluids, pericardiocentesis, cardiac surgery.

\section*{Rise In Intrapericardial Pressure As A Result Of Pericardial Effusion}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_7faac15bc447da7f6017g-29.jpg?height=1024&width=1468&top_left_y=470&top_left_x=411)

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade} Beck's Triad
- Described in 1935 by thoracic surgeon Claude S. Beck
- 3 features of acute tamponade
- Decline in systemic arterial pressure
- Elevation in systemic venous pressure (e.g. distended neck vein)
- A small, quiet heart

\section*{Etiologies of Cardiac Tamponade}
- malignancy
- idiopathic pericarditis
- uremia
- acute myocardial infarction
- diagnostic procedures with cardiac perforation
- bacterial
- tuberculosis
- radiation
- myxedema
- dissecting aortic aneurysm
- post pericardiotomy syndrome
- systemic lupus erythematosus
- cardiomyopathy

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade}
- Early stage
- mild to moderate elevation of central venous pressure
- Advanced stage
- $\uparrow$ intrapericardial pressure
$\downarrow$ ventricular filling, $\downarrow$ stroke volume
- hypotension
- impaired organ perfusion

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade Clinical Features}
- Symptoms
- dyspnea, fatigue, agitation and restlessness, syncope, shock, anuria
- Physical examination
- pulsus paradoxus
- tachycardia
- increased jugular venous pressure
- hypotension

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade Pulsus Paradoxus}
tamponade without pulsus
- atrial septal defect
- severe aortic stenosis
- aortic insufficiency
- left ventricular dysfunction LVH with $\uparrow$ LVEDP
- decreased intravascular volume (low-pressure tamponade)
pulsus without tamponade
- COPD
- RV infarct
- pulmonary embolism
- effusive constrictive pericarditis
- restrictive cardiomyopathy
- extreme obesity
- tense ascites

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade Central Venous Pressure}
- X - descent
- descent of the base in systole
- Y - descent
- occurs as the tricuspid valve opens and ventricular filling begins from the high-pressure right atrium
- in constrictive pericarditis, filling is truncated in early to mid diastole
- in tamponade, filling is restricted throughout diastole
- Kussmaul's Sign
- in constriction, venous return increases with inspiration and a high right atrial pressure resists filling resulting in an increased JVP

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade Pulsus Paradoxus}

\section*{an exaggerated drop in SBP with inspiration ( $>10 \mathrm{mmHg}$ )}

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade Dignostic Evaluation}
- Chest x-ray
- usually requires > 200 ml of fluid
- cannot distin guish between pericardial effusion and cardiomegly
- Echocardiography
- standard for diagnosing pericardial effusion
- convenient, highly reliable, cost effective
- false positives (M-mode)- left pleural effusion, epicardial fat, tumor tissue, pericardial cysts

\section*{ECG in Pericardial Effusion}
- Diffuse low voltage
- amount of fluid
- electrical conductivity of the fluid
- Electrical alternans
- alternating amplitude of the QRS
- produced by heart swinging motion
- also seen in PSVT, HTN, ischemia

\section*{Electrical Alternans In Pericardial Effusion}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_7faac15bc447da7f6017g-39.jpg?height=1412&width=878&top_left_y=241&top_left_x=827)

The electrocardiogram (V2 lead) from a patient with pericardial effusion caused by malignant melanoma reveals a low voltage and electrical alternans.

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade Echocardiographic Diagnosis}
- Pericardial effusion
- highly reliable
- Cardiac tamponade
- RA and RV diastolic collapse
- reduced chamber size
- distension of the inferior vena cava

A chest CT scan of a patient with pericardial effusion, pericardial fluid appears less dense than the heart and is separated from the myocardium by epicardial fat in some areas.

\section*{Echocardiogram: Pericardial Effusion}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_7faac15bc447da7f6017g-45.jpg?height=993&width=1302&top_left_y=342&top_left_x=570)

The echocardiogral Id backward (B) within the effusion on alternate beats, thus producing the alternation of the QRS axis characteristic of electrical alternans. The heart also moves with inspiration (Insp) and expiration (Exp), which accounts for a change in anterior wall motion with every two cardiac cycles.

\section*{CT Scan in Chronic Constrictive Pericarditis}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_7faac15bc447da7f6017g-46.jpg?height=1216&width=1617&top_left_y=221&top_left_x=448)

\section*{Acute Pericarditis common causes}

Outpatient setting
- usually idiopathic
- probably due to viral infections
- Coxsackie A and B (highly cardiotropic) are the most common viral cause of pericarditis and myocarditis
- Others viruses: mumps, varicella-zoster, influenza, Epstein-Barr, HIV

\section*{Diseases of the Pericardium}

\section*{Acute Pericarditis}
- Primary:
- Usually due to viral infection Course brief and usually uncomplicated
- Secondary
- Result from other conditions: rheumatic or collagen diseases, radiotherapy or rend failure related, often exhibit clinical feature, similar to acute pericarditis

\section*{Acute Pericarditis common causes}

In-patient setting
T = Trauma, TUMOR
U = Uremia
M = Myocardial infarction (acute, post)
Medications (hydralazine, procainamide)
O = Other infections (bacterial, fungal, TB)
R = Rheumatoid, autoimmune disorder, Radiation

\section*{Special Ethiologic Forms of acute Pericarditis and Pericardial Effusion}
- Renal failure and dialysis: more extensive dialysis and NSAID is usually successful occasionally pericardocentesis necessary
- unexpected drop of B.P during dialysis may be the clue
- Radiation induced pericardial effusion:
- After radiation to the mediastinum
- May evolve into constrictive Pericarditis after many years
- Neoplastic pericardial effusion
- Accounts for $50 \%$ of patient with tamponade
- Lung, Breast cancers accounts for majority of causes, lymphomas and leukemia also important causes
- Purulent Pericarditis: usually requires surgical draming
- Drug induced Pericarditis: Procainamide, Minoxidil, Methylsergide
- Post Cardiotomy Syndrome

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Diagnostic Clues}
- History
sudden onset of anterior chest pain that is pleuritic and substernal
- Physical exam
presence of two- or three-component rub
- ECG
most important laboratory clue

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Differential Diagnosis}
- Acute myocardial infarction
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pneumonia
- Aortic dissection

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Chest Pain History pericarditis vs infarction}
- Common characteristics
- retrosternl or precordial with raditaion to the neck, back, left shoulder or arm
- Special characteristics (pericarditis)
- more likely to be sharp and pleuritic
$\square \uparrow$ with coughing, inspiration, swallowing
- worse by lying supine, relieved by sitting and leaning forward

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Heart Murmurs of Pericarditis}
- Pericardial friction rub is pathognomic for pericarditis
- scratching or grating sound
- Classically three components:
- presystolic rub during atrial filling
- ventricular systolic rub (loudest)
- ventricular diastolic rub (after A2P2

EKG contrast the pattern of ST segment elevation characteristic of acute pericarditis (a) with the normal variant (early repolarization) pattern of ST segment elevation (b). The normal variant pattern is associated with a normal or slow heart rate and has relatively tall $R$ waves and $T$ waves in V4, V5, and V6. The ST segment elevation is less than $25 \%$ of the $T$ wave amplitude. In contrast, the acute pericarditis has PR depression and lower T wave.

\section*{Acute Pericarditis Key Points}
- Acute pericarditis is accompanied by pericardial effusion in 60\% of cases and tamponade in as many as 15\% of cases.
- Outpatient management of acute idiopathic pericarditis is acceptable if there is no effusion at predischarge echocardiography and surveillance can be provided at home.
- In the care of patients in clinically stable condition who are being hospitalized, echocardiography should be performed in the first 24 hours because a large effusion is the best predictor of poor outcome

\section*{Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade}

\section*{Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade}
- Fluid can accumalte in the pericardium in any form of pericardial disease
- Transudate
- Exudate
- Serosanguineous: Idopathic, dialysis-related, neoplastic, radiation induced, TB, coagulapaties
- Bloody: Coagulopathies, trauma, rupture in MI and in aortic dissection
- Cardiac Tamponade is the most important complication of fluid accumulation

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade pathophysiology}

Fluid accumulation within the pericardial space resulting in
- increased intracardiac pressure
- progressive limitation of ventricular diastolic filling
- reduction of stroke volume and cardiac output

\section*{Cardiac Tamponade}
- The physiological effect depends on the rate of fluid accumulation
- Gradually the pericardium may strech and accommodate > $2,000 \mathrm{ml}$
- Acutely as little as 200 ml of accumulated fluid may raise the intrapercardial pressure to cause tamponade
- JVD elevated (rarely not in low pressure tamponade)
- B.P variable, paradoxical pulse ( $>10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{HG} \Delta$ )
- Echocardiography
- Treatment: fluids, pericardiocentesis, cardiac surgery.

\section*{PERICARDIAL EFFUSION Definition}

Pericardial effusion defines the presence of an abnormal amount and/or character of fluid in the pericardial space. Cardiac tamponade is a clinical syndrome caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, resulting in reduced ventricular filling and subsequent hemodynamic

\section*{compromise..}

\section*{Introduction}

It can be caused by a variety of local and systemic disorders, or it may be idiopathic. Pericardial effusions can be acute or chronic, and the time course of development has a great impact on the patient's symptoms.
Treatment varies, and is directed at both removal of the pericardial fluid and alleviation of the underlying cause, which usually is determined by a combination of fluid analysis and correlation with co morbid illnesses.
Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency. The overall risk of death depends on the speed of diagnosis, the treatment provided, and the underlying cause of the tamponade

\section*{Pathophysiology:}

The pericardial space normally contains 15-50 cc of fluid, which serves as lubrication for the visceral and parietal layers of the pericardium.
This fluid is thought to originate from the visceral pericardium and is essentially an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Total protein levels are generally low; however, the concentration of albumin is increased in pericardial fluids owing to its low molecular weight.
The cause of abnormal fluid production depends on the underlying etiology, but usually it is secondary to injury or insult to the pericardium (ie, pericarditis).
Transudative fluids result from obstruction of fluid drainage, which occurs through lymphatic channels. Exudative fluids occur secondary to inflammatory, infectious, malignant, or autoimmune processes within the pericardium.
Clinical manifestations of pericardial effusion are highly dependent upon the rate of accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac. Rapid accumulation of pericardial fluid may cause elevated intrapericardial pressures with as little as 80 cc of fluid, while slowly progressing effusions can grow to 2 liters without symptoms.
The underlying pathophysiologic process for the development of tamponade is markedly diminished diastolic filling because transmural distending pressures are insufficient to overcome the increased intrapericardial pressures.
Systemic venous return is also altered during tamponade. Because the heart is compressed throughout the cardiac cycle due to the increased intrapericardial pressure, systemic venous return is impaired and right atrial collapse occurs. During inspiration, intrapericardial and right atrial pressures decrease because of negative intrathoracic pressure. This results in augmented systemic venous return to right-sided chambers and a marked increase in the right ventricular volume. Because the pulmonary vascular bed is a vast and compliant circuit, blood preferentially accumulates in the venous circulation, at the expense of LV filling.

This results in a reduced cardiac output.
The amount of pericardial fluid needed to impair the diastolic filling of the heart depends on the rate of fluid accumulation and the compliance of the pericardium. Rapid accumulation of as little as 150 mL of fluid can result in a marked increase in pericardial pressure and can severely impede cardiac output, whereas 1000 mL of fluid may accumulate over a longer period without any significant effect on diastolic filling of the heart. This is due to adaptive stretching of the pericardium over time. A more compliant pericardium can allow considerable fluid accumulation over a longer period without hemodynamic insult.

Pericarditis
The most common symptom of acute pericarditis is precordial or retrosternal chest pain, usually described as sharp or stabbing.
Pain may be of sudden or gradual onset and may radiate to the back (left trapezial ridge), neck, left shoulder, or arm.
Movement or inspiration may aggravate the pain.
Pain may be most severe when the patient is supine and can be relieved when the patient leans forward while sitting.
Common associated signs and symptoms include lowgrade intermittent fever, dyspnea, cough, and dysphagia.
In tuberculous pericarditis, fever, night sweats, and weight loss were commonly noted (80\%).
Patients can present with acute abdominal pain.

hematocrits usually significantly less than simultaneous peripheral blood hemato
Balloon pericardotomy
A catheter is placed in the pericardial space under fluoroscopy, which, after inflation of the balloon, creates a channel for passage of fluid into the pleural space, where reabsorption occurs more readily.
This may be useful for recurrent effusions.
Pericardial sclerosis
Several pericardial sclerosing agents have been used with varying success rates (eg, tetracycline, doxycycline, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil).
Pericardioscopy
This procedure is not universally available.
It may increase diagnostic sensitivity in cases of unexplained pericardial effusions. It allows for visualization of pericardium and for pericardial biopsies.

\section*{Medical Care:}

Initially, medical care is focused on determination of the underlying etiology.
Intravenous fluid resuscitation may be helpful in cases of hemodynamic compromise.
Antineoplastic therapy (eg, systemic chemotherapy, radiation) in conjunction with pericardiocentesis has been shown to be effective in reducing recurrences of malignant effusions.
Corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are helpful in patients with autoimmune conditions.

\section*{Surgical Care:}

Subxiphoid pericardial window with pericardiostomy
This procedure is associated with low morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rates.
It can be performed under local anesthesia.
It may be less effective when effusion is loculated.
It may replace pericardiocentesis as initial treatment for stable pericardial effusions.
May be safer and more effective at reducing recurrence rates than pericardiocentesis.
Thoracotomy
This should be reserved for patients in whom conservative approaches have failed.
Thoracotomy allows for creation of a pleuropericardial window, which provides greater visualization of pericardium.

\section*{Video-assisted thoracic surgery}

Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) enables resection of a wider area of pericardium than the subxiphoid approach without the morbidity of thoracotomy.
One disadvantage of VATS is that it requires general anesthesia with single lung ventilation, which may be difficult in otherwise seriously ill patients.
Median sternotomy
This procedure is reserved for patients with constrictive pericarditis.
Operative mortality rate is high (5-15\%).
$\checkmark$ Pericardial effusion appears as an "echo-free" space between the visceral and parietal pericardium
$\checkmark$ False-positive echocardiograms can occur in pleural effusions, pericardial thickening, increased pericardial fat (especially the anterior epicardial fat pad), atelectasis, and mediastinal lesions.
$\checkmark$ Transesophageal echocardiography: -useful in characterizing loculated effusions
CT scan
$\checkmark$ May detect as little as 50 cc of fluid
$\checkmark$ Fewer false-positives than with echocardiography
MRI
$\checkmark$ Can detect as little as 30 cc of pericardial flui
$\checkmark$ May be able to distinguish hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic effusions

\section*{Other Tests:}

ECG:Classic findings include
$\checkmark$ low voltage, sinus tachycardia
$\checkmark$ electrical alternans
$\checkmark$ PR-segment depression
$\checkmark$ Diffuse ST elevation if pericarditis is presen

\section*{Procedures:}

\section*{Pericardiocentesis}

This procedure is used for diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. Support for the use of echocardiographic guidance is increasing, unless emergent treatment is required.
Indications include impending hemodynamic compromise (ie, pericardial tamponade), suspected infectious etiology, and uncertain etiology.
Attaching an ECG electrode to the pericardiocentesis needle is also useful for avoiding myocardial puncture. Electrical activity will be seen on the monitor when the needle comes into contact with atrial or ventricular myocardium.
Complications of pericardiocentesis include ventricular rupture, dysrhythmias, pneumothorax, myocardial and/or coronary artery laceration, and infection.
Recurrence rates within 90 days may be as high as $90 \%$ in patients with cancer

\section*{Hypertrophic CM}
-Most common cause of death in young people.
- The magnitude of left ventricular hypertrophy is directly correlated to the risk of SCD.
- Young pts with extreme hypertrophy and few or no symptoms are at substantial long-term risk of SCD.

Sudden Death
2-4\%/year in adults
4-6\% in children/adolescents
AICD for:
survivors of SCD with Vfib
episodes of Sustained VT
pts with family hx of SCD in young family members
High risk mutation (TnT, Arg403Gln)
Predictors of adverse prognosis:
early age of diagnosis

history of syncope
ischemia
presence of ventricular arrhythmias on Holter (EPS)
EPS
Amiodorone (low dose)
Prophylactic AICD?

\section*{Restrictive Cardiomyopathy}

\section*{Characterized by:}

\section*{Cardiomyopathies}

13 ${ }^{\text {th }}$ February 2013

\section*{Objectives}
- Definition
- List the types of cardiomyopathies
- Describe and understand the pathogenesis

\section*{Definition}
-more than 35 years, the term cardiomyopathies has been used to describe disorders of the heart with particular morphological and physiological characteristics; hypertrophy, restrictive, etc
-Previously was thought to be of unknown origin
-Now described are genetic metabolic and structural abnormalities

\section*{Definition}

A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality

European cardiac society- european heart journal 2007

\section*{Subtypes}

Cardiomyopathies are grouped into specific morphological and functional phenotypes; each phenotype is then sub-classified into familial and non-familial forms
In this context, familial refers to the occurrence, in more than one family member, of either the same disorder or a phenotype that is (or could be) caused by the same genetic mutation and not to acquired

\section*{Types of cardiomyopathies}
- Dilated
- Hypertrophic
- Restrictive
- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy

\section*{DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY}
- Accounts for 90\%
- Progressive heart muscle dilatation and hypertrophy- biventricular
- Leads to congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction

\section*{Pathogenesis of DCM}
- Several aetiopathogenic mechanisms have been demonstrated
- Alcohol
- Inflammatory (infections, immunologic, etc)
- Pregnancy - develops at peuperium
- Genetic predisposition- up to 35\%
- A majority are ideopathic

\section*{Pathogenesis of DCM}
- Infections- entero viruses, Cocksackie B- myocarditis demonstrated
- Alcoholism- i)metabolites, e.g acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, etccause direct toxicity
ii) thiamine deficiency leading to Beriberi

\section*{DCM pathogenesis}
- Drugs i) Cytotoxics-e.g Adriamycin ii)HAART-
- Pregnancy -postpartum or peuperiumCM

Thought to be due to nutritional def; volume overload;
hypertension;metabolic derrangments; immunological

\section*{DCM-PATHOGENESIS}
- Genetic- commonly seen in younger patient, below 20years of age; due to autosomal dorminant ; or X-linked autosomal recessive patternt
- Mutions are seen in mitochondrial genes affecting oxidative phosphorylation during glucose metabolism
- X- linked defects are linked to defects in dystrophina cell membrane cytoskeleton important in linking internal cytoskeleton with external basement membrane ; defect seen in Duchene

\section*{Arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/CM}
- Linked to Chr 14 defects
- Mainly right ventricular dilatation with failure; irregular right ventricular myocytes
- Clinically shows arrhythmias- e.g ventricular tarchycardia or braddycardia

\section*{MORPHOLOGY}
- Gross-enlarged heart 2-3x the expected weight, flabby; dilated such that the ventricular thickness may appear normal; mural thrombi common
- Micro- irregular; hypertrophy; irregular; enlarged nuclei; boxed nuclei; subendocardial or perimyocyte fibrosis
- These changes don't correlate with the degree of disease

\section*{DCM CLINICAL PRESENTATION}
- 20-50 years
- Progressive shortness of breath, dyspnoea, orthopnoe-signs of CCF

\title{
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
}
- Aortic outlet obstruction/subaortic
- Caused by hypertension; amyloidosis;

\section*{HCP PATHOGENESIS}
- Defects in in genes that code for proteins that are part of the sarcomere
- Autosomal dorminant with variable penetrance
- Beta-myosin heavy chain gene (BMHC); alphatropomysin etc
- Leads to abnormal, forceful contraction

\section*{morphology}
- Gross-massive heart; left ventricular thickenning; most marked in the interventricluar septum ; free wall:ventricle ratio more that 1:3; mural thrombi
- The ventricle becomes elliptical-ovoid
- Leads to poor diastolic feeling
- Micro- extensive myocyte hypertrophy; irregularity (>40um cf 15um)

\section*{CLINICAL PRESENTATION}
- Mainly exertional dyspnoe due to pulmonary pooling and poor diastolic filling; systolic ejectionb murrmur due to aortic obstruction; anginal pain due to poor perfusion; arrhthmias; sudden death

\section*{Restrictive cardiomyopathy}
- Rare
- Endomyocardial fibrosis- disease of African children; fibrosis with restriction hence poor diastolic feeling; unknown cause
- Loefflers myocarditis- endomyocardial fibrosis- eosinophilia; thought to lead to the inflammation and fibrosis
- Endocardial fibroelastosis-mainly left ventriclular focal submural elastosis; common in infants.

\section*{Myocarditis}
- Read hypersensitivity
- Giant cell type
- Chagas disease-T cruzi

\section*{Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy}

Left ventricular hypertrophy not due to pressure overload Hypertrpohy is variable in both severity and location:
-asymmetric septal hypertrophy
-symmetric (non-obstructive)
-apical hypertrophy

Vigorous systolic function, but impaired diastolic function impaired relaxation of ventricles elevated diastolic pressures
prevalence as high as 1/500 in general population mortality in selected populations 4-6\% (institutional) probably more favorable ( $\leq 1 \%$ )

\section*{Etiology}

Familial in ~ 55\% of cases with autosomal dominant transmission Mutations in one of 4 genes encoding proteins of cardiac sarcomere account for majority of familial cases
$\beta$-MHC
cardiac troponin T myosin binding protein C $\alpha$-tropomyosin

Remainder are spontaneous mutations.

\section*{HCM with outflow obstruction}

Dynamic LVOT obstruction (may not be present at rest)
SAM(systolic anterior motion of mitral valve)
LVOT Obstruction $\Rightarrow$ LVOT gradient
$\Rightarrow$ 个wall stress $\Rightarrow$ 个MVO2 $\Rightarrow$ ischemia/angina
$\uparrow$ LVOT gradient: $\uparrow$ HR (DFP), $\downarrow$ preload (LVEDV), $\downarrow$ afterload(BP).

$\downarrow$ LVOT gradient: $\uparrow$ BP (Afterload), $\uparrow$ LVEDV(preload)

Symptoms of dyspnea and angina more related to diastolic dysfunction than to outflow tract obstruction
Syncope: LVOT obstruction (failure to increase CO during exercise or after vasodilatory stress) or arrhythmia.

\begin{abstract}
In biology, classification systems are used to promote understanding and systematic discussion through the use of logical groups and hierarchies. In clinical medicine, similar principles are used to standardise the nomenclature of disease. For more than three decades, heart muscle diseases have been classified into primary or idiopathic myocardial diseases (cardiomyopathies) and secondary disorders that have similar morphological appearances, but which are caused by an identifiable pathology such as coronary artery disease or myocardial infiltration (specific heart muscle diseases). In this document, The European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases presents an update of the existing classification scheme. The aim is to help clinicians look beyond generic diagnostic labels in order to reach more specific diagnoses.

Keywords Cardiomyopathy - Classification - Position statement
\end{abstract}

\section*{Introduction}

In biology, classification systems are used to promote understanding and systematic discussion by arranging organisms into logical groups and hierarchies. In clinical medicine, similar principles are used to standardize the nomenclature of disease, grouping disorders on the basis of shared morphological appearances or particular biochemical and genetic abnormalities. For more than 30 years, the term cardiomyopathies has been used to describe disorders of the heart with particular morphological and physiological characteristics. ${ }^{1-4}$ The purpose of this position statement is to update the classification system for cardiomyopathies in order to ensure its continued utility in everyday clinical practice.

\section*{The rationale for a new classification}

When the classification system for cardiomyopathies was originally conceived, the lack of knowledge about the underlying cause and pathophysiology of different types of cardiomyopathy was recognized, but there was an implicit assumption that they were distinct entities. Cardiomyopathies were defined as primary myocardial disorders of unknown cause; heart muscle disorders of known aetiology or associated with systemic disorders were classified as secondary or specific heart muscle diseases. With the passage of time, the distinction between primary and secondary heart muscle disease has become increasingly tenuous, as the aetiology of previously idiopathic disorders has been discovered. Recently,

}
an expert committee of the American Heart Association proposed a new scheme in which the term primary is used to describe diseases in which the heart is the sole or predominantly involved organ and secondary to describe diseases in which myocardial dysfunction is part of a systemic disorder. ${ }^{5}$ However, the challenge of distinguishing primary and secondary disorders in this way is illustrated by the fact that many of the diseases classified as primary cardiomyopathies can be associated with major extra-cardiac manifestations; conversely, pathology in many of the diseases classed as secondary cardiomyopathies can predominantly (or exclusively) involve the heart.

As many cardiomyopathies are caused by mutations in genes that encode various cardiac proteins, an alternative approach is to reclassify cardiomyopathies according to the causative genetic defect. ${ }^{6}$ However, in clinical practice the pathway from diagnosis to treatment rarely begins with the identification of an underlying genetic mutation; more usually, patients present with symptoms or are incidentally found to have clinical signs or abnormal screening tests. Even when the genetic defect is known in a family, the identification of clinically relevant disease in gene-carriers still requires the demonstration of a morphological phenotype. Thus, we believe that a clinically oriented classification system in which heart muscle disorders are grouped according to ventricular morphology and function remains the most useful method for diagnosing and managing patients and families with heart muscle disease.

\section*{Proposed new classification}

In this statement we define a cardiomyopathy as: A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal, in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to cause the observed myocardial abnormality.

Cardiomyopathies are grouped into specific morphological and functional phenotypes; each phenotype is then sub-classified into familial and non-familial forms (Figure 1). In this context, familial refers to the occurrence, in more than one family member, of either the same disorder or a phenotype that is (or could be) caused by the same genetic mutation and not to acquired cardiac or systemic diseases in which the clinical phenotype is

influenced by genetic polymorphism. Most familial cardiomyopathies are monogenic disorders (i.e. the gene defect is sufficient by itself to cause the trait). A monogenic cardiomyopathy can be sporadic when the causative mutation is de novo, i.e. has occurred in an individual for the first time within the family (or at the germinal level in one of the parents). In this classification system, patients with identified de novo mutations are assigned to the familial category as their disorder can be subsequently transmitted to their offspring.

Non-familial cardiomyopathies are clinically defined by the presence of a cardiomyopathy in the index patient and the absence of disease in other family members (based on pedigree analysis and clinical evaluation). They are subdivided into idiopathic (no identifiable cause) and acquired cardiomyopathies in which ventricular dysfunction is a complication of the disorder rather than an intrinsic feature of the disease. In a departure from the 1995 WHO/ISFC classification, we exclude left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery occlusion, hypertension, valve disease, and congenital heart disease because the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders generally involves clinical issues quite different from those encountered in most cardiomyopathies.

The expert panel of the American Heart Association has suggested that ion channelopathies and disorders of conduction should also be considered as cardiomyopathies. This suggestion was predicated on the fact that these genetic disorders 'are responsible for altering biophysical properties and protein structure, thereby creating structurally abnormal ion channel interfaces and architecture,' ${ }^{5}$ However, recent studies suggesting that genes encoding ion channels may be implicated in subgroups of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), conduction disorders, and arrhythmias ${ }^{7}$ do not provide an argument for the redesignation of channelopathies as cardiomyopathies at the present time.

\section*{Implications for clinical practice}

The most important principle underlying this proposed classification system is its relevance to everyday clinical practice. The division of cardiomyopathies into familial and non-familial forms is designed to raise awareness of genetic disease as a cause of heart muscle dysfunction and to provide a logical framework on which to base further investigations. Importantly, the classification system does not provide guidance on the diagnostic algorithm that should be followed whenever a cardiomyopathy is diagnosed, but it is our intention to provide such advice in subsequent statements.

\section*{Cardiomyopathy subtypes}

Historically, most cardiomyopathies have been defined by the absence of particular features or associated disorders, but it is increasingly apparent that many patients with unexplained heart muscle disease in fact have rare, but well described diseases that can involve the myocardium. In this new classification system, we propose a move away from the concept of diagnosis by exclusion and focus solely on the morphology and function of the heart. This simple but radical departure from the existing convention means that the differentiation between cardiomyopathies and specific heart muscle diseases is abandoned (with the exceptions of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, valve disease, and congenital heart anomalies). The aim is to promote a greater appreciation of the broad spectrum of diseases that can cause cardiomyopathies in everyday clinical practice.

\section*{Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy}

Historically, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been defined by the presence of myocardial hypertrophy in the absence of haemodynamic stresses sufficient to account for the degree of hypertrophy and systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and glycogen storage disease. ${ }^{1-4,8,9}$ The aim of this distinction was to separate conditions in which there is myocyte hypertrophy from those in which left ventricular mass and wall thickness are increased by interstitial infiltration or intracellular accumulation of metabolic substrates. In everyday clinical practice, however, it is frequently impossible to differentiate these two entities using non-invasive techniques such as echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging. One approach to this conundrum is to include the histological demonstration (on myocardial biopsy) of myocyte hypertrophy in the definition of HCM; unfortunately, the patchy and complex nature of most myocardial pathologies means that this distinction can only be reliably made at post-mortem. In order to provide a common starting point for clinical investigation, the presence of intramyocardial storage material is not an exclusion criterion for HCM in this classification scheme. Instead, hypertrophic cardiomyopathies are simply defined by the presence of increased ventricular wall thickness or mass in the absence of loading conditions (hypertension, valve disease) sufficient to cause the observed abnormality.

Inevitably, this approach will be controversial, but it reflects the terminology that is already in use in paediatric practice and avoids the circular arguments and contradictions that arise when trying to confine the term HCM to one narrow phenotype and aetiology (i.e. sarcomere protein disease). The potential inaccuracy (in a pathological sense) of the term 'hypertrophic' in some clinical settings is, in our view, outweighed by a shift in the clinical emphasis towards the development of appropriate diagnostic strategies based on clues from the history, physical examination, and noninvasive investigations.

The working group considered at some length the issue of cardiac amyloid, historically regarded as an exemplar of restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), in spite of the fact that, in strict morphological terms, it frequently fails to fulfil most of the features listed in previous definitions. The arguments for continuing with this convention are that interstitial (rather than intracellular) accumulation of amyloid protein precludes use of the term 'hypertrophy' and that, unlike other causes of myocardial thickening, amyloid has distinct features on electrocardiography and cardiac imaging that suggest the diagnosis. The counterargument is that the logic of a morphological classification dictates that increased ventricular wall thickness caused by amyloidosis should be listed as HCM. The final consensus was that amyloidosis should be listed in the differential diagnosis of both HCM and RCM, acknowledging that this still leaves a degree of nosological ambiguity.

Left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of hypertension and valve disease occurs in approximately 1:500 of the general population. ${ }^{8,9}$ Many individuals have familial disease with an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance caused by mutations in genes that encode different proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. The majority of patients with sarcomeric protein gene mutations have an asymmetrical pattern of hypertrophy, with a predilection for the interventricular septum and myocyte disarray. Left ventricular cavity size is usually diminished and fractional shortening typically higher than normal. Progression to left ventricular dilatation and systolic failure occurs in a minority of patients (up to $10 \%$ in some series). All patterns of hypertrophy are consistent with the diagnosis of sarcomeric protein disease, but concentric hypertrophy is more frequent in patients with metabolic disorders such as Anderson-Fabry disease, mitochondrial cytopathy, and glycogen storage disease. Additional diagnostic clues in these patients include the inheritance pattern (X-linked, autosomal recessive) and the presence of signs and symptoms of multi-system disease. Athletic training to national or international level is associated with physiological changes in left ventricular morphology that can be confused with a pathological phenotype, but myocardial thickness similar to those seen in patients with HCM are rare (less than $2 \%$ of male athletes). ${ }^{8}$ In the young, HCM is often associated with congenital syndromes, inherited metabolic disorders, and neuromuscular diseases. In familial cases, various patterns of inheritance are observed; autosomal disorders that present in the young include Noonan and LEOPARD syndrome (dominant) and Friedreich's ataxia (recessive). ${ }^{9}$

\section*{Dilated cardiomyopathy}

DCM is defined by the presence of left ventricular dilatation and left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence of abnormal loading conditions (hypertension, valve disease) or coronary artery disease sufficient to cause global systolic impairment. Right ventricular dilation and dysfunction may be present but are not necessary for the diagnosis.

The prevalence of DCM in the general population is unknown, but it clearly varies with age and geography. At least $25 \%$ of patients in Western populations have evidence for familial disease with predominantly autosomal dominant inheritance. ${ }^{10-12}$ Familial disease should also be suspected when there is a family history of premature cardiac death or conduction system disease or skeletal myopathy. Autosomal dominant forms of the disease are caused by mutations in cytoskeletal, sarcomeric protein/ Z-band, nuclear membrane and intercalated disc protein genes. X-linked diseases associated with DCM include muscular dystrophies (e.g. Becker and Duchenne) and X-linked DCM. DCM may also occur in patients with mitochondrial cytopathies and inherited metabolic disorders (e.g. haemochromatosis). Examples of acquired causes of DCM include nutritional deficiencies, endocrine dysfunction, and the administration of cardiotoxic drugs (Table 1).

DCM can occur at a late stage following cardiac infection and inflammation. In contrast to active or fulminant myocarditis, which is by definition, an acute inflammatory disorder of the heart, often with preserved left ventricular size, inflammatory DCM is defined by the presence of chronic inflammatory cells in association with left ventricular dilatation and reduced ejection fraction; histology and/or immunocytochemistry are, therefore, necessary for the diagnosis. A proportion of individuals with inflammatory DCM have persistence of viral proteins in the

myocardium; viral persistence can also be observed in the absence of inflammation.

The term mildly dilated congestive cardiomyopathy (MDCM) has been used to describe patients with advanced heart failure and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction occurring with neither restrictive haemodynamics nor significant left ventricular dilatation (less than $10-15 \%$ above normal range). A family history of DCM is present in over $50 \%$ of patients. Although some pathological findings differ, the clinical picture and prognosis of MDCM are very similar to those of typical DCM. ${ }^{13}$

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of DCM that presents with signs of cardiac failure during the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months of delivery. ${ }^{14}$ Suggested aetiological factors in PPCM include myocarditis, autoimmunity caused by chimerism of haematopoetic lineage cells from the foetus to the mother and the haemodynamic stress of pregnancy. PPCM can occur at any age but is more common in women older than 30 years. It affects women of all ethnic groups, is almost equally associated with first/second and multiple pregnancies and is strongly associated with gestational hypertension, twin pregnancy and tocolytic therapy.

\section*{Restrictive cardiomyopathy}

Restrictive left ventricular physiology is characterized by a pattern of ventricular filling in which increased stiffness of the myocardium causes ventricular pressure to rise precipitously with only small increases in volume. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) has always been difficult to define because restrictive ventricular physiology occurs in a wide range of different pathologies. ${ }^{15}$ In this classification system, restrictive cardiomyopathies are defined as restrictive ventricular physiology in the presence of normal or reduced diastolic volumes (of one or both ventricles), normal or reduced systolic volumes, and normal ventricular wall thickness. Historically, systolic function was said to be preserved in RCM, but is rare for contractility to be truly normal. Restrictive physiology can occur in patients with end-stage hypertrophic and DCM but we do not believe that these entities require their own sub-category.

The exact prevalence of RCM is unknown but it is probably the least common type of cardiomyopathy. RCM may be idiopathic, familial, or result from various systemic disorders, in particular, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, carcinoid heart disease, scleroderma and anthracycline toxicity. Familial RCM is often characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, which in some families is caused by mutations in the troponin I gene; in others, familial RCM is associated with conduction defects, caused by mutations in the desmin gene (usually associated with skeletal myopathy). Rarely, familial disease can be associated with autosomal recessive inheritance (such as haemochromatosis caused by mutations in the HFE gene, or glycogen storage disease), or with X-linked inheritance (such as Anderson-Fabry disease).

Restrictive ventricular physiology can also be caused by endocardial pathology (fibrosis, fibroelastosis, and thrombosis) that impairs diastolic function. These disorders can be sub-classified according to the presence of eosinophilia into endomyocardial diseases with hypereosinophilia [now grouped under hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES)] and endomyocardial disease without
hypereosinophilia [e.g. endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF)]. Parasitic infection, drugs such as methysergide, and inflammatory and nutritional factors have been implicated in acquired forms of EMF. Fibrous endocardial lesions of the right and/or left ventricular inflow tract cause incompetence of the atrioventricular valves. Isolated left ventricular involvement results in pulmonary congestion and predominant right ventricular involvement leads to right heart failure.

EMF should be distinguished from endocardial fibroelastosis, occurring in early childhood, characterized by thickening of mural endocardium mainly of the left ventricle, secondary to proliferation of fibrotic and elastic tissues. It is often associated with congenital malformations and some data suggest an aetiologic role for viral infection, in particular, mumps virus.

\section*{Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy}

Unlike HCM, DCM, and RCM, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is defined histologically by the presence of progressive replacement of right ventricular myocardium with adipose and fibrous tissue often confined to a 'triangle of dysplasia' comprising the right ventricular inflow, outflow, and apex. While these pathologic abnormalities can result in functional and morphological right ventricular abnormalities, they also occur in the left ventricle, producing a DCM phenotype, or can be present in the absence of clinically detectable structural changes in either ventricle. For the purposes of this classification, ARVC is defined by the presence of right ventricular dysfunction (global or regional), with or without left ventricular disease, in the presence of histological evidence for the disease and/or electrocardiographic abnormalities in accordance with published criteria. ${ }^{16}$

Although uncommon (estimated prevalence $1: 5000$ ), ARVC is a frequent cause of sudden death in young people in some areas of Europe. Autosomal recessive forms of ARVC (e.g. Naxos and Carvajal syndromes caused by mutations in genes encoding plakoglobin and desmoplakin, respectively) are recognized, but the majority of cases are caused by autosomal dominantly inherited mutations in genes encoding plakophilin 2 and other proteins of the desmosome of cardiomyocytes (Table 1). Mutations in TGF-ß and Ryanodine receptor genes may be associated with an ARVC phenotype.

\section*{Unclassified cardiomyopathies}

\section*{Left ventricular non-compaction}

Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is characterized by prominent left ventricular trabeculae and deep inter-trabecular recesses. ${ }^{17}$ The myocardial wall is often thickened with a thin, compacted epicardial layer and a thickened endocardial layer. In some patients, LVNC is associated with left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction, which can be transient in neonates.

It is not clear whether LVNC is a separate cardiomyopathy, or merely a congenital or acquired morphological trait shared by many phenotypically distinct cardiomyopathies. LVNC occurs in isolation and in association with congenital cardiac disorders such as Ebstein's anomaly or complex cyanotic heart disease and
some neuromuscular diseases. The population prevalence of isolated LVNC is not known, but it is reported in $0.014 \%$ of consecutive echocardiograms. In large paediatric series, LVNC is reported to be the commonest cause of unclassified cardiomyopathies. ${ }^{18}$ LVNC is frequently familial, with at least $25 \%$ of asymptomatic relatives having a range of echocardiographic abnormalities. Genes in which causative mutations have been identified include G 4.5 encoding taffazin (X-linked), alpha dystrobrevin, ZASP, actin, lamin A/C and a locus on chromosome 11 p 15.

\section*{Takotsubo cardiomyopathy}

Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient regional systolic dysfunction involving the left ventricular apex and/or mid-ventricle in the absence of obstructive coronary disease on coronary angiography. Patients present with an abrupt onset of angina-like chest pain, and have diffuse T -wave inversion, sometimes preceded by STsegment elevation, and mild cardiac enzyme elevation. ${ }^{19}$ Originally described in Japan, the condition is reported in Caucasian populations in Europe and North America. Most reported cases occur in post-menopausal women. Symptoms are often preceded by emotional or physical stress. Norepinephrine concentration is elevated in most patients and a transient, dynamic intraventricular pressure gradient is reported in $16 \%$ of cases. Left ventricular function usually normalizes over a period of days to weeks and recurrence is rare. The same kind of reversible myocardial dysfunction is occasionally encountered in patients with intracranial haemorrhage or other acute cerebral accidents (neurogenic myocardial stunning).

\section*{Limitations}

Inevitably there are circumstances in which this classification system fails to describe fully the complexity of some disease phenotypes. Some of the most commonly encountered clinical problems include the occurrence of different cardiomyopathies caused by the same genetic mutation (in unrelated and related individuals); the same cardiomyopathy resulting from many different mutations, and the evolution of one disease phenotype into another over time. A further limitation of the proposed scheme is the problem of the 'mixed phenotype' as, for example, in patients with dilated and hypertrophied ventricles. Rather than attempt to construct complex sub-categories that are difficult to apply in clinical practice, our solution is to modify the definitions of individual cardiomyopathies in such a way that raises awareness of the possible spectrum of abnormalities in patients (and families) with heart muscle diseases. We hope that subsequent revisions of the classification based on emerging data will resolve any remaining ambiguities.

\section*{Conclusions}

This position paper proposes a new classification of cardiomyopathies that is designed to provide a valid tool for routine clinical practice. The proposal differs in several ways from the 1995 WHO/ISFC classification and the system drawn
up by the expert panel of the American Heart Association. Specific features of the proposal include:
- A classification based on groupings of specific morphological and functional phenotypes (rather than putative pathophysiological mechanisms, which may be more suited to research purposes than to everyday practice).
- Further sub-classification into familial and non-familial forms so as to raise awareness of genetic determinants of cardiomyopathies and to orient diagnostic tests (including the search for specific mutations, when appropriate).
- Abandonment of the distinction between primary and secondary cardiomyopathies.
- A move away from the predominantly exclusion-based diagnostic work-up towards a positive, logical search for diagnostic indicators.

The aim of these proposals is to help clinicians look beyond generic diagnostic labels in order to reach more specific diagnoses that may be useful for tailored clinical management of patients and their families.

Conflict of interest: none declared.

\section*{CONT.}
- Present from birth
- Most common form of CHD 0.8\$ of all live births
- An end point of a disorder in the process which the heart and the great vessels develop
- Requires understanding of normal and abnormal CVS development
- An interaction of genes, environment and chance.

\section*{CARDIAC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY}
- The heart is found at the left side of the chest (precordium)
- The upper part of the body takes $1 / 3$ of the CO and the lower part takes $2 / 3$ of the CO.
- The heart is made of 2 collecting chambers (atria) and 2 pumping chambers (ventricles)
- The atria are thin chambers and are at very low pressures ( 5 mmHg ) compared to the right ventricles ( $15-30 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ) and left ventricles ( 120 mmHg ) < this is the pumping pressure; the filling pressure is $0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}>$.
- The Left atrium has a filling pressures of 7.0 mmHg .
- The DBP is always 0 .

\section*{BASIC EMBRYOLOGY}
- The cardiogenetic plate
- The primitive heart plate
- The cardiac looping
- Septation of the heart
- AV valves
- Arterial valves
- Aortic arch system
- The pulmonary and systemic veins
- One can tell of a cardiac malformation at 16 week.

\section*{LEFT-RIGHT SHUNTS}

\section*{NON-CYANOTIC CONDITIONS}
- Atrial Septal Defects
- The pressure difference is low hence a murmur will not be appreciated
- Ventricular Septal Defects
- Gives a pansystolic murmur
- Patent Ductus Arteriosus
- From Pulmonary a. -> Aorta
- Pressure is higher in the aorta both in systole and in diastole hence a continuous murmur.
- Conditions which block the flow of blood at the level of the AV valves.
- Stenosis of the valves.
- Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)

\section*{RIGHT TO LEFT SHUNTS (5Ts)}

\section*{CYANOTIC CONDITIONS:}
- Tricuspid Atresia
- Without a tricuspid valve, one must have have an PDA, ASD or VSD to survive
- Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
- Pulmonary veins connect to the right atrium
- Truncus arteriosus
- Single arterial trunk
- Tetralogy of Fallot
- VSD
- Pulmonary stenosis
- Over-riding aorta
- RVH - to pump blood through the stenosed pulmonary artery
- Transposition of the great vessels
- Pulmonary artery is connected to the left ventricle and the aorta is connected to the right ventricle.
- They run parallel and forget to crossed
- For survival, there has to be either an ASD, VSD or PDA

Congenital heart disease

\section*{$4^{\text {th }}$ year}

\section*{Congenital heart disease continuation}
- Present from birth
- CHD- Most common form at $0.8 \%$ of all live births
- An end point of a disorder in the process by which the heart and the great vessels develop
- Requires an understanding of normal and abnormal cardiovascular development
- An interaction of genes, environment and chance
- When a newborn with significant cyanosis is first seen, they are often placed in supplemental oxygen. In cases of lung disease this often will improve the oxygen levels, but in cardiac problems such as transposition there will be little effect on the child's oxygen levels.

- Morphine $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Intravenous Propranalol $0.1-0.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$
- Intubation and paralysis
- Urgent BT shunt

\section*{TGA}
- Transposition of the great arteries- the aorta arises from the right ventricle and pulmonary artery arises from left ventricle
- Transposition creates a situation where the systemic (to the body) and pulmonary (to the lungs) circulations are in parallel rather than in series.
- Must have a shunt ASD or PDA (duct dependant lesion)
- Keep duct open( prostalgandins) . Early surgical correction- arterial switch operation
- Balloon atrial septostomy- foramen ovale

\section*{TAPVR}
- Total anomalous pulmonary venous return and truncus arteriosus present early with heart failure
- TAPVR has characteristic chest X ray - the snow mans sign

\section*{EBSTEIN ANOMALY.}
- Ebstein's anomaly is a rare disease involving the right side of the heart.
- This disorder occurs when the tricuspid valve, that divides the two chambers of the right side of the heart, does not form correctly.
- Normally, the tricuspid valve separates the right atria and right ventricle. In Ebstein's anomaly, the valve forms too far down in the ventricle. This makes the right ventricle smaller and weaker than normal.
- Often there is also a connection between the left and right atria.
- The tricuspid valve usually has three parts that move freely. In Ebstein's anomaly, one or two parts of the valve get stuck to the walls of the heart and donii $\mathrm{i}^{1 / 2 t}$ move correctly, so blood can leak back in the wrong direction.

\section*{Hypolastic Heart Syndrome.}
- This results in only one side of the heart capable of pumping blood to the body and lungs effectively.
- Hypoplasia of the heart is rare but is the most serious form of CHD. It includes:
1. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome
2. Hypoplastic right heart syndrome
- In both conditions, the presence of a patent ductus arteriosus (and, when hypoplasia affects the right side of the heart, a patent foramen ovale) is vital to the infant's ability to survive until emergency heart surgery can be performed.
- Hypoplasia of the heart is generally a cyanotic heart defect.

\section*{Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_29_515a4b44375a4ea4c228g-26.jpg?height=1098&width=1971&top_left_y=519&top_left_x=290)
- Below is a list of cardiac lesions that require the Ductus to be kept open:
A) Ductus dependent systemic blood flow
- These are commonly called left sided obstructive lesions. These include a spectrum of hypoplasia of the left sided structures of the heart. These may range from coarctation of the aorta to hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
- These include:
1. Aortic stenosis - Critical aortic stenosis.
2. Coarctation of aorta
3. Interrupted aortic arch
4. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome

\section*{B) Ductus Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow}
- This group includes lesions associated with restriction to pulmonary blood flow from significant obstruction to no flow leading to varying degrees of cyanosis and hemodynamic compromise. These include:
1) Critical Pulmonary stenosis
- There is Dysplastic pulmonary valve with obstruction with associated hypoxemia due to $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{L}$ shunt through patient foramen ovale.
2) Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (hypoplastic right heart syndrome)
3) Tricuspid atresia with severe PS.
4) $T O F$
5) Ebstein's anomaly

\section*{C) Parallel circulation}
- TGA with IVS

\section*{Management}
- The mainstay of management of neonates with Ductus dependent congenital heart disease is the early institution of Prostaglandin E1 to maintain ductal patency.

Congenital heart disease

\section*{$4^{\text {th }}$ year}

\section*{Congenital heart disease continuation}
- Present from birth
- CHD- Most common form at $0.8 \%$ of all live births
- An end point of a disorder in the process by which the heart and the great vessels develop
- Requires an understanding of normal and abnormal cardiovascular development
- An interaction of genes, environment and chance
- When a newborn with significant cyanosis is first seen, they are often placed in supplemental oxygen. In cases of lung disease this often will improve the oxygen levels, but in cardiac problems such as transposition there will be little effect on the child's oxygen levels.

ECG Waves and Intervals:
P wave: the sequential activation (depolarization) of the right and left atria
QRS complex: right and left ventricular depolarization (normally the ventricles are activated simultaneously)
ST-T wave: ventricular repolarization
U wave: origin for this wave is not clear - but probably represents "afterdepolarizations" in the ventricles
PR interval: time interval from onset of atrial depolarization (P wave) to onset of ventricular depolarization (QRS complex)
QRS duration: duration of ventricular muscle depolarization
QT interval: duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization
RR interval: duration of ventricular cardiac cycle (an indicator of ventricular rate)
PP interval: duration of atrial cycle (an indicator of atrial rate)
Orientation of the 12 Lead ECG
Each of the 12 leads represents a particular orientation in space, as indicated below (RA = right arm; LA = left arm, LF = left foot):

Bipolar limb leads (frontal plane):
Lead I: RA (-) to LA (+) (Right Left, or lateral)
Lead II: RA (-) to LF (+) (Superior Inferior)
Lead III: LA (-) to LF (+) (Superior Inferior)
Augmented unipolar limb leads (frontal plane):
Lead aVR: RA (+) to [LA \& LF] (-) (Rightward)
Lead aVL: LA (+) to [RA \& LF] (-) (Leftward)
Lead aVF: LF (+) to [RA \& LA] (-) (Inferior)
Unipolar (+) chest leads (horizontal plane):

Left ventricular hypertrophy
1)Tall $R$ wave (greater than 25 mm in $V 5$ or $V 6$ ), or R at V5 plus S wave at V1greater than 35 mm -Leons hypothesis
2)a deep S in V1 or V2
3)if there is significant left ventricular 'strain' then there are also inverted T waves in V5 and V6 and possible ST depression
4)left axis deviation may also be present
5)QRS may be slightly prolonged

\section*{Right ventricular hypertrophy include:}
1)right axis deviation
2) predominant R wave in lead V 1 - in a normal ECG the S wave is dominant in V1 there will be a deep S in V6 in a normal ECG the QRS complex is predominantly upwards in V6
3)inverted T waves in right praecordial leads - V2, V3 will be present in severe cases; it is normal to have inverted T waves in V1
4)Peaked $P$ waves may also occur due to right atrial hypertrophy
5)QRS < 0.12s

\section*{HYPERKALEMIA}

\section*{ECG CHANGES}

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+} 5.5-6.5 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Tall, peaked T waves with narrow base, best seen in precordial leads

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+} 6.5-8.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Peaked T waves
- Prolonged PR interval
- Widening of QRS, amplified $R$ wave
- Decreased or disappearing $P$ wave

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+}$greater than $8.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Absence of P wave
- Intraventricular/fascicular/bundle branch blocks
- Progressive widening of QRS (eventually merging with the T wave just before cardiac arrest, forming the Sine-wave pattern
- Ventricular dysrhythmia
- Prolongation of QT interval
- ST-segment depression
- T-wave flattening
- Appearance of U waves
-During therapy, monitor for changes associated with overcorrection and hyperkalemia, including a prolonged QRS, peaked T waves, bradyarrhythmia, sinus node dysfunction, and asystole

\section*{Hypercalcemia}
-QT interval shortening is common, and, in some cases, the PR interval is prolonged.
-At very high levels, the QRS interval may lengthen, T waves may flatten or invert, and a variable degree of heart block may develop. Digoxin effects are amplified.

"You must be the change you wish to see in the world." Mahatma Gandhi

I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not ended.

\section*{ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER}
- CARDIOLOGY LECTURES 3 ${ }^{\text {RD }}$ YEAR
- FEBRUARY 2009
- INTRODUCTION - Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a delayed, nonsuppurative sequela of a pharyngeal infection with the group A streptococcus (GAS). Following the initial pharyngitis, a latent period of two to three weeks occurs before the first signs or symptoms of ARF appear [1].

\section*{DEFINITIONS}
- Delayed nonsuppurative sequelae of upper respiratory tract infection with group A beta hemolytic streptococcus.
- Post infectious or connective tissue disease.
- A diffuse inflammatory disease of the connective tissue involving chiefly the heart, joints, blood vessels, and subcutaneous tissues.

\section*{IS IT STILL IMPORTANT?}
- Its incidence/prevalence- WHO 12 million people suffered RF\&RHD worldwide
- 3 million had CCF requiring repeated hospitalizations
- 1 million requiring surgery annually
- Mortality- 500,000 dead by one year
- Disability adjusted life year lost to RHD worldwide 173.4per 100,000 population

\section*{WHY IS THERE STILL A PROBLEM?}
- The same old problem
- The devastating new ones
- Chronic lack of resources
- Morbidity and Mortality in Paediatric population still high
- It is a preventable disease.

\section*{AETIOLOGY \& EPIDEMIOLOGY}
- Group A streptococcus the aetiologic precursor
- Role of constitutional and environmental factors unknown
- Familial susceptibility is significant
- Malnutrition, overcrowding and lower socioeconomic status seem to predispose to streptococcal infections and subsequent rheumatic attacks
- Risk factors for rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease
- Poverty and overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, lack of education and limited access to medical care for adequate diagnosis and treatment are recognised as contributing factors to rheumatic fever.
- top

\section*{EPIDEMIOLOGY Cont}
- In developed countries, control of RF followed by apparent resurges- a warning to the ever existing potential to the presence of disease
- Rates of decline related to
-use of antibiotics for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis,
-Improved economic standards
-Decreased crowding in schools and homes
-Increased availability of Health care
-Change in the virulence of the organism

\section*{The strentococcus}

These fimbriae, being projections from the protein layer of the cell wall, contain M-protein, it factor. Each of the different layers of the cell wall and the cytoplasmic membrane have been shown to cross-react with different an different structures of the mammalian heart, including the human heart.

\section*{Difficulty relating to nature of the disease}
- Varied clinical profile
- Sub-clinical course
- Lack of specific diagnostic test
- Accuracy of reporting cases of RF \& RHD
- Major criteria
- Carditis: This occurs in as many as $40 \%$ of patients and may include cardiomegaly, new murmur, congestive heart failure, and pericarditis, with or without a rub and valvular disease.
- Migratory polyarthritis: This condition occurs in 75\% of cases and is polyarticular, fleeting, and involves the large joints.
- Subcutaneous nodules (ie, Aschoff bodies): These nodules occur in 10\% of patients and are edematous, fragmented collagen fibers. They are firm, painless nodules on the extensor surfaces of the wrists, elbows, and knees.
- Erythema marginatum: This condition occurs in about 5\% of cases. The rash is serpiginous and long lasting.
- Chorea (also known as Sydenham chorea and "St Vitus dance"): This characteristic movement disorder occurs in 5-10\% of cases. Sydenham chorea consists of rapid, purposeless movements of the face and upper extremities. Onset may be delayed for several months and may cease when the patient is asleep.
- Minor criteria
- Clinical findings include arthralgia, fever and previous history of ARF
- Laboratory findings include elevated acute phase reactants (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein), a prolonged PR interval, and supporting evidence of antecedent group A streptococcal infections (ie, positive throat culture or rapid streptococcal screen and an elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titer).

\section*{CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE FOR UNDERGRADUATES}

\author{
BY PROF. C. A. YUKO-JOWI
}

\section*{CONT.}
- Present from birth
- Most common form of CHD 0.8\$ of all live births
- An end point of a disorder in the process which the heart and the great vessels develop
- Requires understanding of normal and abnormal CVS development
- An interaction of genes, environment and chance.

\section*{CARDIAC ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY}
- The heart is found at the left side of the chest (precordium)
- The upper part of the body takes $1 / 3$ of the CO and the lower part takes $2 / 3$ of the CO.
- The heart is made of 2 collecting chambers (atria) and 2 pumping chambers (ventricles)
- The atria are thin chambers and are at very low pressures ( 5 mmHg ) compared to the right ventricles ( $15-30 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ) and left ventricles ( 120 mmHg ) < this is the pumping pressure; the filling pressure is $0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}>$.
- The Left atrium has a filling pressures of 7.0 mmHg .
- The DBP is always 0 .

\section*{BASIC EMBRYOLOGY}
- The cardiogenetic plate
- The primitive heart plate
- The cardiac looping
- Septation of the heart
- AV valves
- Arterial valves
- Aortic arch system
- The pulmonary and systemic veins
- One can tell of a cardiac malformation at 16 week.

\section*{LEFT-RIGHT SHUNTS}

\section*{NON-CYANOTIC CONDITIONS}
- Atrial Septal Defects
- The pressure difference is low hence a murmur will not be appreciated
- Ventricular Septal Defects
- Gives a pansystolic murmur
- Patent Ductus Arteriosus
- From Pulmonary a. -> Aorta
- Pressure is higher in the aorta both in systole and in diastole hence a continuous murmur.
- Conditions which block the flow of blood at the level of the AV valves.
- Stenosis of the valves.
- Coarctation of the aorta (CoA)

\section*{RIGHT TO LEFT SHUNTS (5Ts)}

\section*{CYANOTIC CONDITIONS:}
- Tricuspid Atresia
- Without a tricuspid valve, one must have have an PDA, ASD or VSD to survive
- Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection
- Pulmonary veins connect to the right atrium
- Truncus arteriosus
- Single arterial trunk and a VSD
- Tetralogy of Fallot
- VSD
- Pulmonary stenosis
- Over-riding aorta
- RVH - to pump blood through the stenosed pulmonary artery
- Transposition of the great vessels
- Pulmonary artery is connected to the left ventricle and the aorta is connected to the right ventricle.
- They run parallel and forget to crossed
- For survival, there has to be either an ASD, VSD or PDA

ECG Waves and Intervals:
P wave: the sequential activation (depolarization) of the right and left atria
QRS complex: right and left ventricular depolarization (normally the ventricles are activated simultaneously)
ST-T wave: ventricular repolarization
U wave: origin for this wave is not clear - but probably represents "afterdepolarizations" in the ventricles
PR interval: time interval from onset of atrial depolarization (P wave) to onset of ventricular depolarization (QRS complex)
QRS duration: duration of ventricular muscle depolarization
QT interval: duration of ventricular depolarization and repolarization
RR interval: duration of ventricular cardiac cycle (an indicator of ventricular rate)
PP interval: duration of atrial cycle (an indicator of atrial rate)
Orientation of the 12 Lead ECG
Each of the 12 leads represents a particular orientation in space, as indicated below (RA = right arm; LA = left arm, LF = left foot):

Bipolar limb leads (frontal plane):
Lead I: RA (-) to LA (+) (Right Left, or lateral)
Lead II: RA (-) to LF (+) (Superior Inferior)

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+} 6.5-8.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Peaked T waves
- Prolonged PR interval
- Widening of QRS, amplified $R$ wave
- Decreased or disappearing $P$ wave

Serum $\mathrm{K}^{+}$greater than $8.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$
- Absence of P wave
- Intraventricular/fascicular/bundle branch blocks
- Progressive widening of QRS (eventually merging with the T wave just before cardiac arrest, forming the Sine-wave pattern
- Ventricular dysrhythmia
- Prolongation of QT interval
- ST-segment depression
- T-wave flattening
- Appearance of U waves
-During therapy, monitor for changes associated with overcorrection and hyperkalemia, including a prolonged QRS, peaked T waves, bradyarrhythmia, sinus node dysfunction, and asystole

\section*{Hypercalcemia}
-QT interval shortening is common, and, in some cases, the PR interval is prolonged.
-At very high levels, the QRS interval may lengthen, T waves may flatten or invert, and a variable degree of heart block may develop. Digoxin effects are amplified.

PULMONARY HYPERTENSION AND COR PUMONALE.
Definitions
Primary pulmonary HTN (PPH) is a rare disease characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure with no apparent cause.
PPH is also termed precapillary pulmonary hypertension or idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH).
- The diagnosis is usually made after excluding other known causes of pulmonary hypertension.
Normal Systolic pulmonary pressure-range $\mathbf{2 0 - 3 0 ~ m m H g}$ and dependent on RV stroke volume; elastance of main pulmonary artery and branches; reflectance wave from arterioles, which is influenced by tone and diastolic pressure factors.
Diastolic pressure $\mathbf{8 - 1 2 ~ m m ~ H g}$, Mean pressure $12-17 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg, Pulmonary wedge pressure $\mathbf{5 - 1 2 ~ m m ~ H g}$.
Secondary pulmonary artery HTN (SPAH) is defined as a pulmonary artery systolic pressure higher than 30 mm Hg or a pulmonary artery mean pressure higher than 20 mm Hg secondary to either a pulmonary or a cardiac disorder
Cor pulmonale is defined as an alteration in the structure and function of the right ventricle caused by a primary disorder of the respiratory system commonly leading to pulmonary HTN.

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Primary Pulm. HTN
Pathophysiology not clear but an insult (eg, hormonal, mechanical, other) to the endothelium resulting in a cascade of events characterized by vascular scarring, endothelial dysfunction, and intimal and medial (smooth muscle) proliferation.
At least $15-20 \%$ of patients with IPAH have a familial form related to sporadic genetic defects(BMPR-II gene)
Early in the disease, thrombotic pulmonary arteriopathy occurs characterized by in situ thrombosis of small muscular arteries of the pulmonary vasculature.
In later stages, as the pulmonary pressure continues to rise, remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature occurs with intimal fibrosis and replacement of normal endothelial structure.
Associated conditions
1. Portal hypertension (thus porto-pulmonary HTN ) Shunting of splanchnic blood lead to exposure of the pulmonary circulation to substances in the splanchnic circulation that normally are detoxified via the liver. This may lead to endothelial injury and thus Pulmonary HTN.
2.Connective tissue diseases
- CREST (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal motility disorder, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) variant of scleroderma
- SLE

However, connective tissue diseases are sometimes thought of as causing secondary pulmonary HTN.

Secondary Pulmonary HTN.
Three predominant pathophysiologic mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of SPAH
(1) hypoxic vasoconstriction
(2) decreased area of the pulmonary vascular bed
(3) volume/pressure overload.

\section*{Hypoxic vasoconstriction}

Chronic hypoxemia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction by a variety of actions on pulmonary artery endothelium and smooth muscle cells ie
Down-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthetase and reduced production of the voltage-gated potassium channels
Chronic hypoxemia leading to pulmonary HTN may occur

9)Pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis

\section*{Volume and pressure overload}
-Pulmonary blood volume overload is caused by left-toright shunts ie atrial or ventricular septal defects.
-Left atrial hypertension causes a passive rise in pulmonary arterial systolic pressure in order to maintain a driving force across the vasculature. Over time, persistent pulmonary hypertension accompanied by vasculopathy occurs. This may occur secondary to left ventricular dysfunction eg
- Mitral valvular disease
- Constrictive pericarditis
- Aortic stenosis
- Cardiomyopathy.
-Pulmonary venous obstruction is a rare cause of pulmonary hypertension. This may occur secondary to mediastinal fibrosis, anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, or pulmonary venoocclusive disease.

\section*{Cor pulmonale}

In chronic cor pulmonale, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) generally predominates. In acute cor pulmonale, right ventricular dilatation mainly occurs.

\section*{Clinical presentation}

The clinical manifestations are frequently masked by the underlying etiology.

\section*{History}
- Dyspnea upon exertion or at rest
- Fatigue and Lethargy
- Syncope with exertion
- Chest pain
- Cough
- Hemoptysis
- Hoarseness (due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve by the distended pulmonary artery)
- In advanced stages, passive hepatic congestion lead to anorexia, right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort, and jaundice
- Swelling of the legs

Obtaining a careful history may help exclude some of the numerous causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension. Important clues to a specific secondary cause include
- Known history of heart disease.
- TB treatment or chronic cough
- Occupational or residential exposure to industrial emissions.
- History deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
- Raynaud phenomenon, arthritis or arthralgias, rash
- Heavy alcohol consumption and cigarette use.
- Yelowness of eyes -hepatitis
- Tx or predisposed to schistosoma infection
- Heavy snoring
- Daytime hypersomnolence
- Morning headaches, morbid obesity, and a family history of hypertension.

\section*{Physical examination}
-Signs of the underlying lung disease
- with an increase in chest diameter
- labored respiratory efforts with retractions of the chest wall
- hyperresonance to percussion
- diminished breath sounds, wheezing
- distant heart sounds
- Sometimes cyanosis.

Signs of pulmonary hypertension
- Splitting of the second heart sound with accentuation of the pulmonic component
- A systolic ejection murmur with sharp ejection click over the region of the pulmonary artery may be heard in advanced disease, along with a diastolic pulmonary regurgitation murmur.

Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Left parasternal or subxiphoid heave
- A prominent A wave in the jugular venous pulse
- Right-sided fourth heart sound also can be present and reflects the increase in the filling pressure of the right ventricle.
Right ventricular failure
- Distended neck veins with a prominent V wave
- Right ventricular third heart sound
- Holosystolic tricuspid insufficiency murmur accentuated during inspiration
- Tender hepatomegaly, may be pulsatile
- Peripheral edema.
- Pleural effusions and ascites are uncommon, even in severe cor pulmonale.

\section*{Imaging Studies:}

\section*{1.CXR}

Pulmonary HTN-enlargement of central pulmonary arteries, attenuation of peripheral vessels, and oligemic lung fields.
-Right ventricular hypertrophy and right atrial dilatation 2.Echocardiography
-Signs of chronic right ventricular pressure overload are present, which include increased thickness of the right
ventricle with paradoxical bulging of the septum into the left ventricle during systole.
-In later stages, right ventricular dilatation occurs, leading to right ventricular hypokinesis.
-Right atrial dilatation and tricuspid regurgitation are also present.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

Doppler echocardiography \\
-most reliable noninvasive method to estimate pulmonary arterial pressure. \\
-Tricuspid regurgitation -Tricuspid regurgitation is generally detected in more than $90 \%$ of patients with severe SPAH. \\

iv)Patients with severe underlying obstructive lung disease may have low-voltage QRS on their ECG, reflecting the interposition of hyperexpanded lung between the heart and chest \\
4.Ventilation perfusion lung scan \\
-Ventilation perfusion scan should be performed to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. \\
-Diffuse mottled perfusion can be observed in patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, as opposed to segmental or subsegmental mismatched defects observed in patients with SPAH. \\
5.Pulmonary function tests \\

Medical Care: \\
Acute cor pulmonale \\

Massive pulmonary embolism administration of thrombolytic agents or surgical embolectomy, \\
Chronic cor pulmonale \\
Oxygen therapy, diuretics, vasodilators, digitalis, theophylline, and anticoagulation therapy are all different modalities used in the long-term management of chronic cor pulmonale. \\
1.Oxygen therapy \\
Esp. underlying COPD. With cor pulmonale, the partial pressure of oxygen ( $\mathrm{PO}_{2}$ ) is likely to be below 55 mm Hg and decreases further with exercise and during sleep. \\
Oxygen therapy relieves hypoxemic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which then improves cardiac output, lessens sympathetic vasoconstriction, alleviates tissue hypoxemia, and improves renal perfusion. \\
2.Diuretics \\
Management of chronic cor pulmonale, particularly when the right ventricular filling volume is markedly elevated. Diuretics may result in improvement of the function of both the right and left ventricles \\
Excessive volume depletion can lead to decline in cardiac output. Another potential complication of diuresis is the production of a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which diminishes the effectiveness of carbon dioxide stimulation on the respiratory centers and lessens ventilatory drive. \\
3.Vasodilator drugs \\
Management of chronic cor pulmonale with modest results. \\
Calcium channel blockers, particularly oral sustainedrelease nifedipine and diltiazem, can lower pulmonary pressures, although they appear more effective in primary rather than secondary pulmonary hypertension. \\
4.Digoxin \\
Shown to be beneficial in patients with associated atrial fibrillation due to atrial enlargement. \\
5.Theophylline \\
Reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressures acutely in patients with chronic cor pulmonale secondary to COPD. \\
Theophylline has a weak inotropic effect and thus may improve right and left ventricular ejection. As a result, considering the use of theophylline as adjunctive therapy in the management of chronic or decompensated cor pulmonale is reasonable in patients with underlying COPD. \\
6.Anticoagulation eg Warfarin \\
Anticoagulation therapy may be used in patients with cor pulmonale secondary to thromboembolic phenomena and with underlying primary pulmonary arterial hypertension
