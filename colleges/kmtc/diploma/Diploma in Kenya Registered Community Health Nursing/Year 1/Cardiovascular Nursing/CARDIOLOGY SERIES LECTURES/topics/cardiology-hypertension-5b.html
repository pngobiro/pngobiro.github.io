                         <h4>Goals of Therapy</h4>
                         <p>The ultimate public health goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. Since most persons with hypertension, especially those age >50 years, will reach the DBP goal once SBP is at goal, the primary focus should be on achieving the SBP goal. Treating SBP and DBP to targets that are <140/90 mmHg is associated with a decrease in CVD complications. In patients with hypertension and diabetes or renal disease the BP goal is <130/80 mmHg.</p>

                        <p>Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common form of target organ damage associated with hypertension. In patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris, the first drug of choice is usually a BB; alternatively, long-acting CCBs can be used. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), hypertension should be treated initially with BBs and ACEIs, with addition of other drugs as needed for BP control. In patients with postmyocardial infarction, ACEIs, BBs, and aldosterone antagonists have proven to be most beneficial. Intensive lipid management and aspirin therapy are also indicated.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Heart Failure</h3>
                        <p>Heart failure (HF), in the form of systolic or diastolic ventricular dysfunction, results primarily from systolic hypertension and IHD. Fastidious BP and cholesterol control are the primary preventive measures for those at high risk for HF. In asymptomatic individuals with demonstrable ventricular dysfunction, ACEIs and BBs are recommended. For those with symptomatic ventricular dysfunction or end-stage heart disease, ACEIs, BBs, ARBs and aldosterone blockers are recommended along with loop diuretics.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diabetic Hypertension</h3>
                        <p>Combinations of two or more drugs are usually needed to achieve the target goal of <130/80 mmHg. Thiazide diuretics, BBs, ACEIs, ARBs, and CCBs are beneficial in reducing CVD and stroke incidence in patients with diabetes. ACEI- or ARB-based treatments favorably affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy and reduce albuminuria and ARBs have been shown to reduce progression to macroalbuminuria.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chronic Kidney Disease</h3>
                        <p>In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by either (1) reduced excretory function with an estimated GFR below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², (corresponding approximately to a creatinine of >1.5 mg/dL in men or >1.3 mg/dL in women) or (2) the presence of albuminuria (>300 mg/day or 200 mg albumin/g creatinine), therapeutic goals are to slow deterioration of renal function and prevent CVD. Hypertension appears in the majority of these patients, and they should receive aggressive BP management, often with three or more drugs to reach target BP values of <130/80 mmHg. ACEIs and ARBs have demonstrated favorable effects on the progression of diabetic and non diabetic renal disease. A limited rise in serum creatinine of as much as 35 percent above baseline with ACEIs or ARBs is acceptable and is not a reason to withhold treatment unless hyperkalemia develops. With advanced renal disease (estimated GFR <30 ml/min 1.73 m², corresponding to a serum creatinine of 2.5-3 mg/dL), increasing doses of loop diuretics are usually needed in combination with other drug classes.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cerebrovascular Disease</h3>
                        <p>The risks and benefits of acute lowering of BP during an acute stroke are still unclear; control of BP at intermediate levels (approximately 160/100 mmHg) is appropriate until the condition has stabilized or improved. Recurrent stroke rates are lowered by the combination of an ACEI and thiazide-type diuretic.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Obesity and the metabolic syndrome</h3>
                        <p>Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m²) is an increasingly prevalent risk factor for the development of hypertension and CVD. Metabolic syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following conditions:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Abdominal obesity (waist circumference >40 inches in men or >35 inches in women)</li>
                            <li>Glucose intolerance (fasting glucose >110 mg/dL)</li>
                            <li>BP >130/85 mmHg</li>
                            <li>High triglycerides (>150 mg/dL) or low HDL (<40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women).</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Intensive lifestyle modification should be pursued in all individuals with the metabolic syndrome, and appropriate drug therapy should be instituted for each of its components as indicated.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Left ventricular hypertrophy</h3>
                        <p>Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor that increases the risk of subsequent CVD. Regression of LVH occurs with aggressive BP management, including weight loss, sodium restriction, and treatment with all classes of antihypertensive agents except the direct vasodilators hydralazine, and minoxidil.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Peripheral arterial disease</h3>
                        <p>Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is equivalent in risk to IHD. Any class of antihypertensive drugs can be used in most PAD patients. Other risk factors should be managed aggressively, and aspirin should be used.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Postural hypotension</h3>
                        <p>A decrease in standing SBP >10 mmHg, when associated with dizziness or fainting, is more frequent in older patients with systolic hypertension, diabetes, and those taking diuretics, venodilators (e.g., nitrates, alphablockers, and sildenafil like drugs), and some psychotropic drugs. BP in these individuals should also be monitored in the upright position. Caution should be used to avoid volume depletion and excessively rapid dose titration of antihypertensive drugs.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Hypertension in women</h3>
                        <p>Oral contraceptives may increase BP, and the risk of hypertension increases with duration of use. Women taking oral contraceptives should have their BP checked regularly. Development of hypertension is a reason to consider other forms of contraception. In contrast, menopausal hormone therapy does not raise BP. Women with hypertension who become pregnant should be followed carefully because of increased risks to mother and fetus. Methyldopa, BBs, and vasodilators are preferred medications for the safety of the fetus. ACEI and ARBs should not be used during pregnancy because of the potential for fetal defects and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant. Preeclampsia, which occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy, is characterized by new-onset or worsening hypertension, albuminuria, and hyperuricemia, sometimes with coagulation abnormalities. In some patients, preeclampsia may develop into a hypertensive urgency or emergency and may require hospitalization, intensive monitoring, early fetal delivery, and parenteral antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapy.</p>
