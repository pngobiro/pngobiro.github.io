                        <p>Chronic AR produces LV volume overload that leads to a series of compensatory changes, including LV enlargement and eccentric hypertrophy. The enlarged ventricle is more compliant and is well suited to deliver a larger stroke volume to compensate for the regurgitant aortic flow. It can also accommodate an increased EDV. Wall thickness must increase to compensate for the increased ventricular dimensions. These compensatory changes are necessary to minimize or normalize wall stress according to the LAPLACE LAW (Wall tension/stress is related to the product of intra-ventricular pressure and radius divided by wall thickness). Hypertrophy observed in a volume-overload state usually is eccentric, as opposed to concentric hypertrophy observed in a pressure-overload state (i.e., aortic stenosis). The increased myocardial mass in a hypertrophic heart enables individual sarcomeres to shorten to a normal degree.</p>
                        <p>As long as LV wall stress is maintained in the normal range, the LV preload reserve, contractility, and ejection fraction (EF) remain within the normal range. This is the chronic compensated stage. During this phase of the disease, most patients remain asymptomatic for decades because chronic AR generally is a slow and insidious disease with very low morbidity during a long asymptomatic phase.</p>
                        <p>With time, transition from a compensated to a decompensated state marks the progression of the disease. Progressive LV enlargement beyond that required by the valvular regurgitation occurs and is associated with a change of the LV from an elliptical shape to a spherical shape. The cause of this pathologic dilatation is not well understood, but loss of the collagen support system that acts as a skeleton for the heart may play a substantial role. These maladaptive changes in the interstitial of the heart are an intricate part of the LV hypertrophy process.</p>
                        <p>In addition, diminished coronary flow reserve in this hypertrophied ventricle is thought to result in chronic sub-endocardial ischemia, even in the absence of epi-cardial coronary artery disease (CAD). Eventually, sub-endocardial necrosis and fibrosis occur, along with disruption of the collagen support system, with loss of LV systolic function. The neuro-hormonal response complicates the disease state further by its excessive growth stimuli, which are thought to be partially responsible for apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the remaining functional myocytes. The vicious cycle continues until the decompensated stage develops over many years. Progressive LV enlargement, spherical LV shape, increased wall stress, decline in the contractility and EF, increased afterload, and decreased diastolic compliance with a rise in end-diastolic pressure characterize this stage. Frequently, development of congestive symptoms heralds this stage, but an insidious deterioration of ventricular function may occur without overt clinical signs.</p>
                        <p>In ACUTE AR, the normal-sized left ventricle poorly tolerates the sudden large volume imposed on it. The left ventricle poorly accommodates the abrupt increase in end-diastolic volume, and diastolic filling pressure increases rapidly and dramatically. This leads to an acute decrease in forward stroke volume, and, although tachycardia develops as a compensatory mechanism to maintain cardiac output, this often is insufficient. The rise in LV filling pressure is transmitted to the left atrium, pulmonary veins, and pulmonary capillaries, leading to pulmonary edema and congestion. Acute AR usually is severe and rapidly leads to LV decompensation and/or failure and cardiogenic shock.</p>

                            <li>The Duroziez sign is when a systolic murmur is heard over the femoral artery when compressed proximally and when a diastolic murmur is heard when the femoral artery is compressed distally.</li>
                            <li>The Müller sign is systolic pulsations of the uvula.</li>
                            <li>The Traube sign (also called pistol-shot sounds) refers to booming systolic and diastolic sounds heard over the femoral artery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The apical impulse in chronic AR is diffuse, hyper-dynamic, and displaced inferiorly and leftward.</p>
                        <p>S3 gallop correlates with development of LV dysfunction.</p>
                        <p>The typical diastolic murmur of AR has a decrescendo shape. A high-frequency early diastolic murmur often occurs in mild AR, whereas a rough holo-diastolic or decrescendo diastolic murmur occurs more commonly in severe AR. The volume and velocity of blood across the incompetent aortic valve tapers off in mid-to-last diastole as the aortic and LV pressures equilibrate. The diastolic murmur of AR is usually best heard adjacent to the sternum in the second to fourth left intercostal space. A concomitant systolic ejection murmur is common in moderate-to-severe AR.</p>
                        <p>The murmur associated with acute AR may not be impressive. If cardiac decompensation is present, the diastolic murmur of acute AR may be very soft and surprisingly short.</p>
                        <p>Antegrade flow across the mitral valve is thought to cause an Austin Flint murmur, which is a mid-and late-diastolic apical low-frequency murmur or rumble. The rumble occurs during rapid closure of the mitral valve as flow velocity is increasing across the valve and LV diastolic pressure is rising rapidly because of severe aortic reflux. Its presence indicates severe AR.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Mitral regurgitation (MR) is characterized by an abnormal reversal of blood flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Pathophysiology:</h2>
                        <p>The mitral or bicuspid atrioventricular is composed of the mitral annulus, papillary muscles, chordae tendineae the leaflets. Abnormalities in any of these structures can cause MR. The leaflets are continuous with each other at their lines of attachment, called commissures, and are tethered to the left ventricle by the chordae tendineae. Chordae tendineae attach to papillary muscles and prevent prolapse of the mitral valve leaflet to prevent reflux of blood into the left atrium.</p>
                        <p>MR can be caused by organic disease or a functional lesion (i.e., a normal valve may regurgitate [leak] because of global annular dilatation, focal myocardial dysfunction, or both). Congenital MR is rare but is commonly associated with myxomatous mitral valve disease and can be associated with cleft of the mitral valve in persons with Down syndrome.</p>
                        <p>In acute mitral valve regurgitation, the incompetent mitral valve allows the ventricular ejection fraction to reflux into the left atrium. This volume overload is intensified by the inability of the atrium and ventricle to immediately dilatate, resulting in elevated left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures and acute pulmonary edema.</p>
                        <p>The net reduction in forward stroke volume reduces systemic perfusion, can result in hemodynamic deterioration, and can lead to cardiogenic shock.</p>
                        <p>In chronic mitral valve regurgitation, the distensibility of the left atrium and ventricle are increased over time. This dilatation of the left atrium decreases left atrial pressures, thus increasing preload. The left ventricle dilatates and, via the process of eccentric hypertrophy, generates a larger stroke volume without a significant rise. The LV dilatation may further prohibit the coaptation of the mitral valve leaflets during systolic ejection, leading to progression of LV dilatation and overload.</p>
                        <p>Patients with compensated MR may remain asymptomatic for years despite the presence of severe volume overload. Ultimately, most people with MR decompensate over the long term.</p>
                        <p><strong>Morbidity:</strong> Natural History studies of patients with rheumatic MR have shown 5- and 10-year survival rates of 80% and 60%, respectively.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sex:</strong> MR is independently associated with female sex.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age:</strong> MR is independently associated advanced age.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Mitral stenosis (MS) is a narrowing of the inlet valve into the left ventricle that prevents proper opening during diastolic filling. Mitral valve leaflets that are typically thickened, commissures that are fused, and/or chordae tendineae that are thickened and shortened. The most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic fever (RF). After the initial episode of RF, a latency period of 20-40 years occurs until the onset of symptoms. The natural history of mitral stenosis is typically progressive, with a slow and stable course early on, followed by progressive acceleration in the later years.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Pathophysiology:</h2>
                        <p>The serum of patients with RF contains antibodies to the type 5 streptococcal M protein, which cross-reacts with myocardial tissue. Pathologic examination of the mitral valve at this time reveals proliferation of fibroblasts and macrophages. Subsequent disease may occur as a consequence:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Healing of the rheumatic process</li>
                            <li>Sub clinical repetitive rheumatic insults</li>
                            <li>Chronic rheumatic activity</li>
                            <li>Progressive hemodynamic stresses on the traumatized valve</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Some patients experience a chronic stable disease, while others have an accelerated course necessitating early surgical intervention. The normal area of the mitral valve orifice is 4-6 cm². Narrowing of the valve area to less than 2.5 cm² impedes the free flow of blood and causes a build up of left atrial pressure (LAP) to promote normal transmitral flow volume. Critical mitral stenosis occurs when the opening is reduced to <strong>1 cm²</strong>. At this stage, a LAP of 25 mm Hg is required to maintain a normal cardiac output. With progressive stenosis, critical flow restriction reduces left ventricular output. The increase in LAP also enlarges the left atrium and raises pulmonary venous and capillary pressures. As the disease evolves, chronic elevation of LAP eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid and pulmonary valve incompetence, and secondary right heart failure.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Prevalence</h2>
                        <p>Both RF and mitral stenosis remain common in developing nations, and progression of mitral stenosis tends to be more rapid.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Mortality/Morbidity:</h2>
                        <p>Overall, the 10-year survival of untreated patients with mitral stenosis is 50-60%, depending on symptoms at presentation.</p>
                        <p>In untreated patients, the causes of death are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✓ Progressive heart failure in 60-70%</li>

                        <p>The duration of the diastolic murmur is a guide to the severity of mitral valve narrowing. However, murmur may be difficult to hear. The diastolic murmur are often reduced during inspiration and augmented during expiration.

                        <p>The administration of amyl nitrite causes a marked transient fall in systemic vascular resistance, with an increase in heart rate and stroke volume. A diastolic rumble caused by mitral stenosis will increase in intensity, whereas the Austin Flint murmur will decrease as the degree of aortic regurgitation is reduced by a fall in systemic blood pressure. It should not be given to patients with significant aortic stenosis, unstable angina pectoris, or other conditions in which even brief hypotension could exacerbate the condition.</p>
