Patients with ischemic discomfort may or may not have ST-segment elevation. Most of those with ST-segment elevation will develop Q waves. Those without ST elevations will ultimately be diagnosed with unstable angina or NSTEMI based on the presence of cardiac enzymes. MI may lead to impairment of systolic function or diastolic function and to increased predisposition to arrhythmias and other long-term complications.</p>

                        <p>Acute MI occur due to ischemia of the myocardial due to the perfusion /oxygen demand mismatch. In majority of case this is due to coronary artery disease >90% of cases. AMI due coronary artery disease generally occurs when coronary blood flow decreases abruptly after a thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery previously narrowed by atherosclerosis.</p>
                        <p>Slowly developing, high-grade coronary artery stenoses usually do not precipitate AMI because of development of a rich collateral network over time.</p>
                        <p>AMI occurs when a coronary artery thrombus develops over atherosclerotic plaque when it fissures, ruptures, or ulcerates leading platelet activation and aggregation, coagulation pathway activation, and endothelial vasoconstriction occur and lead to coronary thrombosis and occlusion.</p>
                        <p>This injury is produced or facilitated by factors such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✓ cigarette smoking</li>
                            <li>✓ Hypertension</li>
                            <li>✓ Lipid accumulation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Atherosclerotic plaques prone to rupture are those with a rich lipid core and a thin fibrous cap. After an initial platelet monolayer forms at the site of the ruptured plaque, various agonists (collagen, ADP, epinephrine, serotonin) promote platelet activation. Platelets also release of thromboxane A2 cause further vasoconstrictor, further platelet activation. Vicious cycle propagate occlusion.</p>
                        <p>Total occlusion of the vessel for more than 4-6 hours results in irreversible myocardial necrosis, but reperfusion within this period can salvage the myocardium and reduce morbidity and mortality.</p>
                        <p>Non-atherosclerotic causes of MI include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✓ Coronary vasospasm as seen in variant (Prinzmetal) angina</li>
                            <li>✓ Patients using cocaine and amphetamines</li>
                            <li>✓ Coronary emboli from sources such as an infected heart valve</li>
                            <li>✓ Occlusion of the coronaries due to vasculitis</li>
                            <li>✓ Other causes leading to mismatch of oxygen supply and demand, such as acute anemia from GI bleeding</li>
                            <li>✓ MI induced by chest trauma</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The amount of myocardial damage caused by coronary occlusion depends on:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Territory supplied by the affected vessel</li>

                        <p>MI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. There has been a progressive increase in the proportion of patients who are diagnosed with NSTEMI compared with STEMI. MI continues to be a significant problem in industrialized countries and is becoming an increasingly significant problem in developing countries.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mortality</h3>
                        <p>1/3 of patients who experience STEMI will die within 24 hours of the onset of ischemia and many of the survivors will suffer significant morbidity. For many patients, the first manifestation of coronary artery disease is sudden death likely from malignant ventricular dysrhythmia. More than one half of deaths occur in the prehospital setting (1st 30 minutes). In-hospital fatalities account for 10% of all deaths. An additional 10% of deaths occur in the first year postinfarction.</p>

                        <h4>1) Cardiac enzymes</h4>
                        <p><strong>a) Troponin I and T</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✓ begin to rise 4-8 hours after an MI</li>
                            <li>✓ peak 12-24 hours</li>
                            <li>✓ remain elevated for up to 14days</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The preferred biomarker for diagnosis. Troponins have the greatest sensitivity and specificity in detecting MI. The test result is both diagnostic as well as prognostic of outcome. Troponin is a complex of three proteins on the thin filaments of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers. During muscle contraction the troponin complex regulates the interaction between the thick and thin filaments. This complex consists of troponin T (TnT), troponin I (TnI) and troponin C (TnC). Troponin C is identical in skeletal and cardiac muscle, but the amino acid sequences of troponin T and troponin I found in cardiac muscle is different from that of the troponins in skeletal muscle. These isoforms of cardiac troponins, cTnT and cTnI, are very specific to cardiac muscle and their presence in blood indicates cardiac tissue necrosis. Because of this specificity, cardiac troponin T or I is now the preferred cardiac marker. For early detection of myocardial necrosis, sensitivity of this laboratory test is superior to that of the CK-MB.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>b) CK and Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB)</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✓ begin to rise within 6-10 hours after injury</li>
                            <li>✓ peak at 18-24 hours</li>
                            <li>✓ subside over 72 hours</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A level within the reference range does not exclude myocardial necrosis.</p>
                        <aside class="callout note">
                            <p><strong>NB.</strong> CK-has Two subunits, B (brain) and M(muscle) combine to form 3 isoenzymes of CK: CK-MM(CK-1), CK-MB(CK-2), CK-BB(CK-3). Elevations in total CK activity occur in conditions affecting brain, skeletal muscle, and heart muscle. CK-MB(CK-2) is found almost entirely in myocardial tissue and elevations of this isoenzyme more specific for MI. Occasionally, very small infarcts can be missed by CKMB; therefore, a troponin level should be measured for patients suspected of having had MI who have negative serial CK-MBs.</p>

                        <p>Levels rise early in the course of MI. Has emerged as an ideal early marker. Myoglobin, a low-molecular-weight heme protein found in cardiac and skeletal muscle, is released more rapidly from infarcted myocardium than troponin and CK-MB and may be detected as early as 2 hours after MI. The marker has high sensitivity but poor specificity. Thus, its presence is not diagnostic of MI, but it still has utility in the early triage of chest pain patients. When performed in conjunction with other studies, it may be useful for the early detection of MI. and detection of any recurrences of MI.</p>

In a dose of 162 mg or more, aspirin produces a rapid clinical antithrombotic effect caused by immediate and near-total inhibition of thromboxane A2 production. Aspirin now forms part of the early management of all patients with suspected STEMI and should be given promptly, and certainly within the first 24 hours, at a dose between 162 and 325 mg and continued indefinitely at a daily dose of 75 to 162 mg. Use clopidogrel (Plavix) in case of aspirin allergy.</p>
                                <h5>Other anti-platelets</h5>
                                <p>Administer a platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonist:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>✓ Epti-fiba-tide</li>
                                    <li>✓ Tirofiban</li>
                                    <li>✓ Abciximab</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The addition of IV platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonists to aspirin and heparin improves both early and late outcomes, including mortality, Q-wave MI, need for revascularization procedures, and length of hospital stay.</p>

                            <li>
                                <h4>Nitrates-Nitroglycerin</h4>
                                <p>Patients with ongoing ischemic discomfort should receive sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg) every 5 minutes for a total of 3 doses, after which an assessment should be made about the need for intravenous nitroglycerin. Intravenous nitroglycerin is indicated for relief of ongoing ischemic discomfort, control of hypertension, or management of pulmonary congestion.</p>
                                <p><strong>NB.</strong> Contra. SBP less than 90 mm Hg, severe bradycardia (less than 50 bpm), tachycardia (more than 100 bpm), or suspected RV infarction. Contra. patients who have received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor for erectile dysfunction within the last 24 hours (48 hours for tadalafil).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Beta-Blockers</h4>
                                <p>It is reasonable to administer IV beta-blockers promptly to STEMI patients without contraindications, especially if a tachyarrhythmia or hypertension is present. Beta-blockers reduce the rates of reinfarction and recurrent ischemia and possibly reduce the mortality rate if administered within 12 hours after MI. Administer routinely to all patients with MI unless a contraindication is present. Immediate beta-blocker therapy appears to reduce the magnitude of infarction and incidence of associated complications in subjects not receiving concomitant fibrinolytic therapy, the rate of reinfarction in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy, and the frequency of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias.</p>
                                <p>Eg-Metoprolol, Esmolol, Atenolol</p>

                            <li>
                                <h4>ACE inhibitors-Enalapril,Captopril</h4>
                                <p>Reduce mortality rates after MI. They reduce post infarction heart remodeling. Administer ACE inhibitors as soon as possible as long as the patient has no contraindications and remains in stable condition. ACE inhibitors have the greatest benefit in patients with ventricular dysfunction. Continue ACE inhibitors indefinitely after MI. Angiotensin-receptor blockers may be used as an alternative in patients who develop adverse effects, such as a persistent cough.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Thrombolytic therapy</h4>
                                <p>Has been shown to improve survival rates in patients with acute MI if administered in a timely fashion in the appropriate group of patients. If PCI capability is not available or will cause a delay greater than 90 minutes, then the optimal approach is to administer thrombolytics within 12 hours of onset of symptoms in patients with ST-segment elevation greater than 0.1 mV in 2 or more contiguous ECG leads, new left bundle-branch block (LBBB), or anterior ST depression consistent with posterior infarction. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is superior to streptokinase in achieving a higher rate of coronary artery patency; however, the key to efficacy lies in the speed of the delivery of therapy. High patency rate is achieved if platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist is combined with a half dose of thrombolytic agent as the initial reperfusion strategy.</p>
                                <h5>Streptokinase</h5>
                                <p>Acts with plasminogen to convert plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots, as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. Non-specific acts on both the free and fibrin bound plasminogen. Increase in fibrinolytic activity that degrades fibrinogen levels for 24-36h occurs with IV infusion of streptokinase. Adjunctive therapy with heparin not needed. Dose-1.5 million IU over 1 hour IV infusion. Local delivery by catheter admin 10,000-25000 IU loading dose then 4000 IU/min up to 75 minutes during angiography.</p>
                                <aside class="callout note"><p><strong>NB.</strong> For peripheral arterial occlusion admin loading dose IV infusion of 250,000 IU then 100,000 IU per hour for 1-3 days.</p></aside>
                                <h5>Anistreplase</h5>
                                <p>(Anisoylated Plasminogen- Streptokinase activator Complex) Non-fibrin-specific agent that activates conversion of plasminogen to plasmin and has half-life of 90 min. However, does not have any benefit over streptokinase, although has higher rate of allergic and bleeding complications. Easier to administer than t-PA, has lower cost and does not require heparinization. Dose- 30 IU over 2-5 min.</p>
                                <p>Other non-specific thrombolytic is Urokinase-human enzyme from the kidney.</p>
                                <h5>Alteplase, t-PA</h5>
                                <p>Fibrin-specific agent with brief half-life of 5 min. Adjunctive therapy with IV heparin necessary to maintain patency of arteries recanalized by t-PA, especially during first 24-48 h. Dose-15 mg IV initial bolus, followed by 50 mg IV over next 30 min, and then 35 mg IV over next h; total dose not to exceed 100 mg.</p>
                                <h5>Reteplase</h5>
                                <p>Recombinant plasminogen activator that forms plasmin after facilitating cleavage of endogenous plasminogen. Heparin and aspirin usually administered concomitantly and after reteplase. Dose-10 IU IV over 2 min, followed by second 10-IU IV dose after 30 min.</p>
