                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification of Thrombophlebitis</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Superficial</li>
                            <li>Deep</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In about 65% of all parts receiving I.V therapy superficial thrombophlebites develops because of immobility.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Of great significance is that mbolisation of thrombi from deep veins to the lungs may be fatal and at the -least -result in prolonged hospitalized.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes of Thrombophlebitis</h3>
                        <p>Three important of aetiology causes are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Stasis low of veneous flow.</li>
                            <li>Damage of the endothelial/inner layer/lining of the vein.</li>
                            <li>Hyper-coagulability of the blood.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Therefore, clients who are at high risk for development of thrombophlebitis are those who have conditions predisposing them to any of these three disorders.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) How Veneous Stasis comes about.</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) -Normal blood flow in the veneous system depends on the action of muscles in the extremities and on the functional adequacy of veneous values allowing flow in one direction only. Veneous stasis occurs if the values are dysfunctional or if the muscles of the extremities are inactive. It usually occurs in people who are obese; those with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF); those who are immobile for long periods; also pregnant women and women in the post partum period and Age.</li>
                            <li>Clients with arterial fibrillation are also at high risk because of stagnation of blood and the adding of blood flow caused by irregular ventricular contractions in response to fibrillations.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Drugs:</strong> Like steroids and quinine also predispose patients to stasis and clot formation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ii) Endothelial Damage</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Damage in the lining of the vein is caused by trauma or external pressure and occurs any time a vein- puncture is performed.</li>
                            <p>Damaged endothelium has decreased fibrinolytic properties predisposing to development of thrombus.</p>
                            <li>b) Increased endothelial damage can also be sustained when clients receiving I.V. therapy are receiving high dose antibiotics; potassium; chemotherapeutic agents or hypertonic solutions such as contrast media.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Other Factors Predisposing to Endothelial Inflammation or Damage are:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Presence of I.V. catheter in the same site for longer than 48 hours.</li>
                            <li>b) Use of contaminated I.V. equipment.</li>
                            <li>c) A fracture that also causes damage to the blood vessels.</li>
                            <li>e) Diabetes.</li>
                            <li>e) Burns.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">iii) Hyper Coagulation of Blood</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) This occurs in many hemolytic disorders particularly, polycythemia, severe anaemia and anti-thrombin (III) deficiency.</li>
                            <li>b) Clients with systematic infection in which endotoxins are released also have hypercoagulability.</li>
                            <li>c) Clients who take oral contraceptives especially those containing estrogen are at great risk of thrombo-embolic disease.</li>
                            <li>d) Smoking may cause hyper coangulability.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and fibrin adhere to form a thrombusesis.</p>
                        <p>A frequent site of a thrombus formation is the valvete of cusps of veins where veneous stasis allows accumulation of blood products. As the thrombus enlarges increased amounts of blood cells and fibrin collect around it producing a large chtain with a 'tail that eventually occludes the lumen of the vein. If a thrombus only partially occludes the vein of the blood flow continuous, the thrombus becomes covered by endothelial cells and the thrombotic process stops. If the thrombus does not become detached, it undergoes lysis or becomes firmly organized and adherent within 24 to 48 hours. The organized thrombi may detach giving rise to embolic. This embolic flow through the veneous circulation back to the heart and into the pulmonary circulation resulting to pulmonary embolism.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>They vary according to the size and location of the thrombus and the adequacy of collateral circulation around the obstructive process.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clients with superficial thrombophlebitis may have a palpable firm subcutaneous cord-like vein. The area surrounding the vein may be tender to touch, reddened and warm. There may be raised systemic temperature and leukocytosis. There may be also edema of the affected part.</li>
                            <li>Clients with deep thrombophlebitis may have no symptoms or have unilateral (1) leg edema, pain, warm skin and a temperature of greater than $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) If the cuff is involved, tenderness may be present on palpation with Homans' sign on dorsiflexion of the foot.</li>
                                    <li>b) If the inferior vena cava is involved both lower may-extremities may be;</li>
                                    <li>c) Oedematous and cyanotic. If the superior vena cava is involved both upper extremities as well as the neck and back become edematous and cyanotic.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) Diagnostic Studies</h4>
                        <p>Various diagnostic studies are used to determine the site and extent of the thrombus.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Coagulation Studies:</strong> Platelet count, bleeding time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time is checked.</li>
                            <li><strong>Veneous Doppler Evaluation:</strong> Is determination of veneous flow in deep removal, popliteal and posterior tibial veins.</li>
                            <li><strong>There is also Venogram:</strong> Is a radiographic definition of location and site of clot. It can also have felling defect in vein lumen and development of collateral circulation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lung Scan (Ventilation and Perfusion):</strong> Is a means of determining presence of pulmonary embolism and extent of resulting lung damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulmonary Arteriogram:</strong> Used to define the location and size of pulmonary embolism.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapeutic mx (Conservative mx)</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient is usually kept in bed after diagnosis with elevation of the affected extremity until the tenderness has subsided usually 5-7 days.</li>
                            <li>Warm moist heat may be used to relieve the pain and treat the inflammation.</li>
                            <li>Mild oral analysis such as aspirin and codeine are used to relieve pain for more severe pain non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents i.e. Ibuprofen may be used to treat inflammatory causes and to relieve pain.</li>
                            <li>Anti-coagulant therapy is usually used for deep vein thrombophlebitis and not superficial. The patient gets heparin I.V. for 10 days followed Warfar*in which is anticoagulant for 3 days.</li>
                            <li>If edema is present when the client becomes ambulant, elastic stockings are recommended. If edema persists the use of elastic stockings should be continued after discharge.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical Intervention</h4>
                        <p>Most clients are treated conservatively but a small percentage requires surgical intervention. The primary indication for surgical intervention is to prevent pulmonary emboli.</p>

                        <h5>Surgical Procedures Involved</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Veneous Thrombeectomy:</strong> Removal of an occluding clot through an incision in the vein.</li>
                            <li><strong>Interior nerve cava interruption:</strong> To prevent pulmonary emboli and the surgeon uses Teflon clips.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intracaval filter insertion:</strong> Done to patients who are very ill to undergo major surgery and it involves a caval filter device threaded into the right internal jugular vein and into the interior vena cava below the level of the renal veins through local anesthesia.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pharmacological Management</h4>
                        <p>The goals of anticoagulant therapy in the reaction of thrombophle biteis are to prevent:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Progression of the clot.</li>
                            <li>Development of a new thrombus.</li>
                            <li>Embolizsation</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>NOTE: Anticoagulant therapy does not dissolve the clot. Lysis of the clot begins simultaneously through the bodys intrinsic fibrinolytic system.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Precautions when using Anticoagulants</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Intramuscular injection of any drug is contra-indicated for patients receiving anticoagulants because of the risk of haematoma complications.</li>
                            <li>Patients on I.V. hepar*in shouldnt be given antibiotics and hydrocortisone co-currently because drug interaction may occur. The patient receiving anticoagulant therapy should be advised to seek medical advice before starting to take other medications.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Other drugs used apart from anticoagulants include indomethacin; Aspirin, Buta zelodine etc. These drugs alter platelet function.</p>

                            <li>The patients should be taught to avoid prolonged standing or sitting in a motionless position which is dependent.</li>
                            <li>Patients also be taught on importance of not smoking and the way to perform deep breathing and range of motion exercises.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition, the nurse should be able to recognize the patients at high risk with deep veneous thrombophlebitis. Avoid use of contraceptives.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Acute Intervention</h4>
                        <p>This nursing intervention is directed towards reduction of inflammation and prevention of emboli formation.</p>
