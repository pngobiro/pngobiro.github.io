                        <p>This occurs when ischemic intracellular changes become irreversible and necrosis results. Angina due to ischemia causes reversible cellular injury and infarction is the result of the sustained ischemia causing irreversible cellular death.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Incidence</h3>
                        <p>Pre-hospital mortality in clients with acute myocardial infarction is approximately $30 \%$ to $50 \%$. A substantial number of these deaths occur before hospitalization mortality among clients who reach hospital is about $5 \%$. Most of these deaths occur within the first 3 to 4 days.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cardiac cells can withstand ischemic conditions for about 20 minutes before cellular death begins.</li>
                            <li>Contractile function of the heart stops in the areas;</li>
                            <li>Of myocardial necrosis.</li>
                            <li>The degree of altered function depends on the area of the heart involved and the size of the infarct.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Most infarcts involve the left ventricle. This can be on the posterior lateral or posterior wall. An inferior myocardial infarction is called diaphragmatic.</p>
                        <ol start="5">
                            <li>The degree of pre-established collateral circulation also determines the severity of infarction.</li>
                            <li>The bodys response to cell death is inflammatory process within 24 hours leukocytes infiltrate the area. Enzymes are released from the dead cardiac cells and are important diagnostic indicators.</li>
                            <li>The proteolytic enzymes of the neutrophils remove all the necrotic tissue by the $2^{\text {nd }}$ or $3^{\text {rd }}$ day.</li>
                            <li>During this time the necrotic muscle wall is thin.</li>
                            <li>The development of the collateral circulation improves areas of poor perfusion and may limit the areas of injury and infarction.</li>
                            <li>At 10 to 14 days a week scar tissue forms the myocardium is considered to be especially vulnerable to increased stress because of the unstable;</li>
                            <li>State of the healing heart wall. The scarred tissue is often less compliant;</li>
                            <li>Than the surrounding fibres. This condition may be manifested by uncoordinated wall motion, ventricular dysfunction or pump failure.</li>

                        <p>NOTE: During the attack, they are similar to those of Angina.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Pain:</strong> Severe immobilizing chest pain not relieved by rest or nitrite administration. This pain is due to inadequate oxygen supply to the myocardium. It is described as heaviness, tightness or constriction. It lasts for about 20 minutes or more and described as more severe than Angina pain. On the other hand, some clients may not experience pain but may have discomfort, weakness or shortness of breath.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nausea and vomiting:</strong> Results from;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A. Reflex stimulation of the vomiting center by the severe pain.</li>
                                    <li>B. It can also result from vaso vago reflexes from the area of the infracted myocardium that affect the GIT.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Sympathetic Stimulation:</strong> During the initial phases of M.I., increased catcholimes i.e. nore and epinephrine are released. The increased sympathetic response result sin diaphoresis and vaso constriction of the peripheral blood vessels.</li>
                            <li>On physical examination, clients will be clammy; ashamed and cool condition referred to as a cold sweat.</li>
                            <li>Temperature may increase within the $1^{\text {st }} 24$ hours up to $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and may last as long as 1 week. This is a systematic manifestation of the inflammatory process caused by the infracted myocardium.</li>
                            <li>Cardiovascular manifestations i.e.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) BP and pulse rate may be elevated initially later the BP may drop due to decrease in cardiac output.</li>
                                    <li>b) Urine output may decrease.</li>
                                    <li>c) Rales may be noted in the lungs persisting for several hours to several days.</li>
                                    <li>d) Hepatic engorgement and peripheral edema may indicate overt cardiac failure.</li>
                                    <li>e) Jugular veins may be distended and have obvious pulsations indicating early right heart dysfunction and pulmonary congestion.</li>
                                    <li>f) The presence of murmurs may indicate valve incompetence.</li>
                                    <li>g) There may be splitting of heart sounds indicating left ventricular dysfunctions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                            <li>Diamorphine strong analgesic given for severe pain dose: 5 to 10 mgs I.V. during emergency and later I.M. Its absence gives morphine sulphate.</li>
                            <li>Antiemetic to relieve nausea and vomiting i.e. largactil; scopotamine, plasil/metrocheopramide 10 mg I.M., largactil I.V. $25-50 \mathrm{mg}$, stellazine 2 to 3 mg I.M. or stemetil 12.5 mgs I.M. These drugs can be continued orally as the patients condition improves.</li>
                            <li>Aspirin 300 mgs Nocte (Antiplatelet).</li>
                            <li>Streptokinase 1.5 mgt I.V.</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management during Acute State</h3>
                        <p>Acute nursing interventions for the patient/client with acute M.I. are best done in a specialized care unit such as I.C.U. The patient has to be here for 2 to 3 days and the rest hospitalization in the ward priorities for the client care in the initial stage/phase of recovery after M.I. include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pain assessment and relieve-give morphine.</li>
                            <li>Physical monitoring.</li>
                            <li>Promotion of rest and comfort.</li>
                            <li>Alleviation of stress and anxiety.</li>
                            <li>Emotional support.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol type="I">
                            <li>Give morphine to relieve pain and monitor its efficiency and patients response.</li>
                            <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> The patient has continued ECG monitoring and this should;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) Continue in the ward. The nurse should be able to identify dysthmias and eliminate them from EGG.</li>
                                    <li>b) Vital signs are taken 1/2 to 1 holy depending on patients condition.</li>
                                    <li>c) Intake and output be evaluated at least once a shift and physical assessment be carried out to detect deviation from the clients parameters.</li>
                                    <li>d) Check on the patients neck distention, heart and lung sounds and inspection of evidence of fluid retention.</li>
                                    <li>e) Assessment of patients oxygenation is required and the nares should be checked for crepitations and dryness.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Rest and Comfort:</strong> With the severe insult to the myocardium as in the case of infarction, it is important fro the nurse to promote rest and comfort bed rest be promoted during $1^{\text {st}}$ and $2^{\text {nd}}$ days in a quite room.
                                <p>This is because when the patient is resting, the body requires less work from the heart than when it is active. Therefore it is important to plan nursing and therapeutic actions to ensure adequate rest periods free from interruptions:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) The environment be very quiet,</li>
                                    <li>b) Bed clothes be smooth.</li>
                                    <li>c) Frequent oral care be given.</li>
                                    <li>d) Adequate warmth is required.</li>
                                    <li>e) Assurance that personnel are nearby and responsible for clients needs.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It is important that the client understands the reasons why the activities are limited.<br>
                                NOTE: In spite of these limitations, however, the patient is not immobilized.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Anxiety</strong> is present in all patients/clients in various degrees, the nurses role is to identify the source of anxiety and assist the client in reducing it i.e. if the patient is afraid of being alone, a family member is allowed to sit quietly by the bed side or to check in for the patient/client frequently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Emotional and Behavioral Reactions:</strong> These are varied and frequently follow a predictable response pattern i.e. denial, anger, anxiety and fear. Dependency, depression, realistic acceptance. The role of the nurse in intervention is to understand what the client is currently experiencing. To assist the client in testing reality and to support the use of constructive coping styles.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Arrange for rehabilitation of the patient (cardiac rehabilitation) which is the restoration of a person to an optimal state of function in 6 areas i.e. physiological, psychological, mental, economic, vocational and spiritual. Clients teaching is a continuous process. There should be close follow-up even after discharge at the special cardiac clinics.</li>
