                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Primary (Essential) Hypertension:</strong> Accounts for 90% of all cases of hypertension usually occurs between ages of 30 and 50 years. The cause is unknown though it has a familiar tendency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary Hypertension:</strong> Is elevated BP with an identified cause that can be often be corrected by surgery or medication. Accounts for less than $5 \%$ of hypertensions in adults. And $75 \%$ to $30 \%$ of hypertensions in young children.</li>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Risk Factors Predisposing One to Essential Hypertension</h4>
                        <ol type="I">
                            <li><strong>Excess Sodium Intake:</strong> This is because sodium causes water retention which causes the walls of the blood vessels to swell with resulting constricting of the lumen and increased systemic vascular resistance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Altered Renin Angiotensin Mechanism:</strong> Excess quantities of rennin re secreted by the kidneys in some people. This results in the conversion of the angiotensinogen to angiotensin. The angiotensin causes direct arterial constriction and a secondary increase in aldosterone. This is followed by retention of water and electrolytes with the result of hypertension.</li>
                            <li><strong>Excessive Mineral Corticoids:</strong> This is especially an increase in aldosterone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stress and Increased Sympathetic Activity:</strong> Factors such us anger, fear and exercise have physiological responses which are normally protective but if they persist, this result in an increased nervous activity of the sympathetic. Increased sympathetic nervous stimulation results in increased vascular vaso-constriction and increased heart rate. This also results in rennin release. This result in activation of rennin angiotensin mechanism and increased aldosterone secretion both leading to elevated blood pressure.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology of Hypertension</h3>
                        <p>For an arterial pressure to rise, there must be an increase either in cardiac output or systemic vascular resistance (arterial blood pressure) BP = Cardiac Output (Co) X Systematic Vascular Resistance (SVR) (B = CO X SVR)</p>
                        <p><strong>Cardiac Output:</strong> Is the stroke volume (cement of blood pumped from one ventricle per bit approximately 70 mls ) multiplied by the heart rate for 1 minute.</p>
                        <p><strong>Systemic Vascular Resistance:</strong> Refers primarily to the vaso-motor tone of the blood vessels in the peripheral vascular system. It is the force opposing the movement of blood. This force is created primarily in the small arteries and arterial and a small change in the diameter of the arterial creates a major cause (change in the systemic vascular resistance). It follows therefore that when SVR is increased a greater amount of pressure is required to pump blood throughout the body. The concept of SVR is so important in understanding arterial blood pressures that some clinicians have defined hypertension as increased SVR usually most people with hypertension have a normal cardiac output.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations of Hypertension</h3>
                        <p>Hypertension is often called the silent killer because symptoms dont usually develop until the disease is advanced. If symptoms develop as a late manifestation they are usually secondary to effects on blood vessels in the various organs to tissues or to the increased work load of the heart.</p>
                        <ol type="I">
                            <li><strong>Headache (Major Complaint):</strong> Which occurs frequently in the morning and disappears as the day goes on. It is usually in the occipital region and may be no more than a feeling of stiffness/tightness. It is thought that this type of headache is due to changes in cerebral spinal fluid (C.S.F) in the supine position, C.S.F pressure increases resulting in headache. When the person stands upright, the C.S.F pressure decreases and the headache disappears.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Other symptoms</strong></p>
                        <ol type="I" start="2">
                            <li>Easy fatigability, dizziness, palpitations, blurred vision, epistaxis (nose bleeding), hematuria, dyspnea,angina pains (overload on the heart), blood pressure constantly higher than $90 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{Hg}$ diastolic, vomiting and retinal hemorrhage, loss of vision due to papillary edema (optic disc of the eye edema), on the x-ray film, enlarge left ventricle is seen, proteinuria due to renal impairment.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Investigations</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient/clients BP measurements in both arms should be carefully evaluated to detect hypertension.</li>
                            <li>History taking which should include the time and duration of headache, family and social history.</li>
                            <li>Routine urinalysis: For blood urea and nitrogen and serum creatine are carried out to screen for renal involvement.</li>
                            <li>Measurements of serum electrolytes particularly potassium level is important to detect aldosterolism.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Blood glucose levels are very important to exclude diabetes mellitus and Cushings syndromes.</p>
                        <ol start="5">
                            <li>The patient care have ECG done to provide cardiac status and CXR provides baseline information regarding the heart size as well as aortic dilatation rib notching which occur in coarctation of the aorta.</li>
                            <li>Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) can be carried out to check on kidney deficiency.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The goal in treating hypertensive patients/clients is:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To prevent the mobility and mortality associated with high blood pressure.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The decision to initiate therapy depends on two major factors i.e.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>The severity of the blood pressure elevation.</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Non-drug therapeutic interventions in all persons either border line or sustained hypertension.</p>
                        <p>These measures include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Diet management</li>

                            <li><strong>Regular Exercise Advises:</strong> Regular isotonic exercises such as walking, jogging and swimming can help control blood pressure, promote relaxation and control body weight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stress Reduction and Management:</strong> The person should learn to identify events and agents that act as stressors in life and develop and implement methods to cope with them. This will help reduce BP and even control it. The patient needs to be taught relaxation techniques and also psychotherapy.</li>

                        <p>The goals of these are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To reduce and maintain the diastolic at less than $90 \mathrm{~mm} / \mathrm{Hg}$.</li>

                        </ol>
                        <p>The drugs used are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Beta Blockers i.e. propranol 40 mgs daily.</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nutritional Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Dietary management of hypertension consist of;</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Sodium restriction</li>
                            <li>Caloric restriction if the patient is overweight.</li>
                            <li>Restriction of cholesterol, fat and alcohol intake.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>A. Sodium Restriction</h5>
                        <p>A high sodium intake may limit the effectiveness of certain anti hypertensive drugs.</p>
                        <p>Restriction reduces the circulatory volume thus reducing the work of the heart. A common recommended restriction is 2 gm of sodium per day. This involves not adding salt in the preparation of foods or at meals and avoiding food known to be high in sodium.</p>
                        
                        <h5>B. Caloric Restriction</h5>
                        <p>Obesity has a high coloration with hypertension thus weight reduction has a significant effect on lowering BP. The amount of caloric restriction depends on the degree of obesity. The restriction of cholesterol and fats will retard the progress of arteriosclerosis.</p>

                            <li>Usually patients with severe hypertension are admitted in the ward on complete bed rest. Therefore, the nurse should ensure comfort and rest.</li>
                            <li>Thorough investigations are undertaken to identify the cause of hypertension.</li>
                            <li>Observations of vital signs are taken, temperature and respirations are taken 4 hourly but the BP and the pulse are taken 4 hourly; 2 to 4 hourly when the patient is standing or sleeping lying to detect postural hypotension.</li>
