                        <p>It is the most common pulmonary complication in hospitalized patients. Most pulmonary emboli arise from the thrombi in the deep veins in the legs. Other sides of origin include the right side of the heart especially with arterial fibrillation, upper extremities and the pelvic veins especially after surgery or child birth. Fatal pulmonary emboli originate most commonly in the removal and iliac veins.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Emboli: Are mobile clots that generally dont stop moving until they;</li>
                            <li>Lodge at a narrowed part of the circulating system. The lungs are an ideal location for the emboli to lodge due to its extensive arterial and capillary network.</li>
                            <li>The lower lobes are most frequently affected because they have a higher blood flow than other lobes.</li>
                            <li>Thrombus in the deep veins can dislodge spontaneously but a common.is jarring of the thrombus by mechanical forces such as a sudden standing and changes in the rate of blood flow. In addition to dislodged thrombi, other causes of primary thrombi include air emboli from improperly administered I.V. therapy, pulmonary emboli from fractured bone, amniotic fluid and tumors.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>The severity of the clinical manifestations depends on the size of the emboli and the number of blood vessels occluded.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sudden onset of unexplained dyspnea, tachypnea and tachycardia.</li>
                            <li>Cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, rales,fever, a accentuation of the pulmonic heart sound.</li>
                            <li>Sudden change in mentally as a result of mental.</li>
                            <li>Massive emboli may cause sudden collapse of patient with shock pallor, severe dyspnea and crushing chest pain.</li>
                            <li>The pulse is rapid and weak.</li>
                            <li>Blood pressure is low and ECG indicates right ventricular strain.</li>
                            <li>When rapid obstruction of $50\%$ or more of the pulmonary vascular bed occurs, acute pulmonale may result because the ventricles can no longer pump blood into the lungs.</li>
                            <li>Death occurs in more than $60\%$ of people with massive emboli.</li>
                            <li>Medium sized emboli often cause pleuritic chest pain accompanied by dyspnea, slight fever and a productive cough with blood stained sputum.</li>
                            <li>Physical examination may indicate tachycardia and a pleural friction rub.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>History and physical examination.</li>
                            <li>Lung scan.</li>
                            <li>Chest x-ray film.</li>
                            <li>Continuous ECG monitoring.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary angiography.</li>
                            <li>Venogram.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>When the diagnosis of thrombo embolic disease has been made, treatment musts be instituted immediately as this is a medical emergency.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Emergency Therapy</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Patient be put in bed in a sitting up position.</li>
                            <li>Resuscitative measures carried out.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen is administered by mask or cannula.</li>
                            <li>Establishments of I.V. root for drugs and I.V. infusions.</li>
                            <li>Patient is given continuous I.V. heparine 100 mgs , morphine $10-15 \mathrm{mg}$ I.V., Stat and PRN.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary embolectomy in life threatening situations may be done.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Objectives of Therapeutic Management (Treatment)</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To prevent further growth/multiplication of thrombi I the lower extremities.</li>
                            <li>To prevent embolization from the lower extremities to the pulmonary arteries.</li>
                            <li>To provide cardio pulmonary support in indicated.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Conservative Therapy</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient requires cardio pulmonary support where there is administration of oxygen by mask and cannula and in some conditions endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain respiration.</li>
                            <li>Respiration measures such as turning, coughing and deep breathing are necessary to prevent/treat atelectasis (lung collapse).</li>
                            <li>If shock is present, vaso pressor agents may be necessary to support circulation.</li>
                            <li>If heart failure is present, digitalis and diuretics are used.</li>
                            <li>Pain resulting from pleural irritation or reduced coronary blood flow is treated with narcotics usually morphine.</li>
                            <li>Property managed anticoagulant therapy is very effective in patients/clients with pulmonary emboli.</li>
                            <li>Heparin and warfarin may be given. Start with heparin and continue with warfarin.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical Intervention</h4>
                        <p>If the degree of pulmonary arterial obstruction is severe, usually greater than $50\%$ and the patient does not respond to conservative therapy, immediate embolectomy may be indicated. This is possible with the use of temporally cardio pulmonary bypass.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Thrombolytic agent i.e. Urokinase and streptokinase have been shown to dissolve pulmonary emboli within 24 to 48 hours. Both agents have been suggested for use in patients with massive emboli or in whom surgery is contra-indicated.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Management</h3>
                        <p>The prognosis/outcome of a client with pulmonary emboli is good if therapy is promptly instituted.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient is kept in bed in a semi fowlers position to facilitate breathing.</li>
                            <li>Patent I.V. line maintained for medication and I.V. line therapy.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen therapy be administered as per arterial blood gases results.</li>
                            <li>Careful monitoring of vital signs; ECG, blood gases and lung sounds is critical to assess the patients status.</li>
                            <li>The client is usually anxious because of pain, inability to breathe and fear of death. The nurse should carefully explain the situation and provide emotional support and reassurance and help thus to relieve the patients anxiety.</li>
                            <li>During the acute time, someone must be with the patient as much as possible.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Subsequent Management</h4>
                        <p>Clients affected by thrombo embolic processes require much psychological and emotional support. Because in addition with thrombo embolic process, they may be underlying another (underlying illness requiring lung treatment). Discharge planning is aimed at limiting progress of the condition and preventing complication thus the nurse therefore must reinforce the patient need to return to the health care facilities and follow up.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pulmonary infarction (death of the lung tissue).</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary hypertension.</li>
