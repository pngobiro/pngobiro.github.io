                        <p>Its mechanisms are poorly understood because there is usually a period of several weeks after the initial infection before the development of manifestations of myocarditis. Immunological mechanisms may play a role in the development of myocarditis.</p>
                        <p>The majority of infections are benign, self-limiting and sub-clinical, although viral myocarditis in infants and pregnant women may be virulent.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Chest Pain:</strong> The intense precordial chest pain is generally sharpest over the left precordium or may radiate to trapezius ridge and neck mimicking angina or sometimes to the epigastrium or abdomen mimicking abdominal or other non-cardiac pathological conditions. The pain is aggravated by lying supine, deep breathings, coughing, swallowing and moving the trunk and is eased by sitting up and leaning forward.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dyspnea:</strong> The dyspnea accompanying acute pericarditis is related to the clients need to breath in rapidly, shallow breaths to avoid chest pain and may be aggravated by fever.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pericardial Friction Rub:</strong> The hallmark finding in the acute pericarditis is the pericardial friction rub. The rub is a scratching, grating, high pitched sound, believed to arise from friction between the roughened pericardial and epicardial surfaces. It is best heard with stethoscope placed firmly at the lower left sternal border of the chest.</li>
                            <li>On Chest X-Ray: Pericardial effusion can be seen on chest x-ray film.</li>

                        <p>The management of acute pericarditis is directed forward identification and treatment of the underlying problem.</p>
                        <p>Antibiotics may be used to treat purulent pericarditis. The pain and inflammation of acute pericarditis is usually reaction by non-steroidal and anti-inflammatory agents i.e. high doses of salicylates i.e. 300 mg to 900 mg Qid or of indomethacin 25 to 500 mg orally Qid.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Care</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Patient is nursed in a complete bed rest in a sitting up position.</li>
                            <li>Assessment of the amount of quality and location of pain is important particularly in distinguishing the pain of pericarditis versus acute myocardial infarction. Also exclude ischaemic chest pains. Other vital signs are taken 2 to 4 hourly.</li>
                            <li>Pain relieve measures i.e. maintaining the client on bed rest with head of the bed elevated to $45^{\circ}$ and providing a padded over table for the client for leaning to relieve pain.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the side effects of prescribed anti inflammatory medications i.e. administration of the drugs with food or milk and instructing the patient to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking this drugs.</li>
                            <li>Patient is given high protein diet, light and attractive with plenty of fluids (to treat the fevers). Maintain the fluid balance chart to ensure the patient is getting enough within 24 hours.</li>
                            <li>Anxiety reducing measures including simple explanations completely of all procedures done.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The real potential for decreased cardiac output also exists for the client of acute pericarditis because of the possibility of the cardiac tamponade.</p>

                            <li><strong>Pericardial Effusion:</strong> This can cause compression of its adjacent structures if it is large.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cardiac Tamponade:</strong> Which develops as the pericardial effusion increases in size with failure of compensatory mechanisms to adjust to the continuing altered cardiac compliance.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The patient with pericardium tamponade is often confused, agitated and restless and has tachycardia and tachypnea with a low output state.</p>
