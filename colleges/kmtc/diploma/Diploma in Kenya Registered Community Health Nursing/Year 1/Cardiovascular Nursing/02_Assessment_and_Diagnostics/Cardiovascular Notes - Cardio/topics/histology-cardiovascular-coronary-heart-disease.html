                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Terminologies</h3>
                        <p>Arteriosclerotic heart disease, cardiovascular heart disease, ischemic heart disease, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, dysrhythmias. The term is used to describe disease mechanisms involved in the coronary heart disease are plug formation, atheromatous deposits and coronary deposits.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Etiology and Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>The major cause is aftherriosclerosis.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>It is characterized by focal deposits of cholesterol and lipids primarily within the intima wall of the artery. The genesis of plug formation is the result of complex interventions between the components of the blood and the elements forming the vascular wall. Intact normal endothelial cell is non-reactive to platelets and leukocytes as well as coagulation fibrinolytic and complement factors. However, the endothelial lining can be altered as a result of chemical injuries such as hyperlipidemia-or high shear stress such as hypertension with either type of endothelial alteration. Platelets are activated and release a growth factor that stimulates smooth muscle proliferation. The smooth muscle cell proliferation entraps which are calcified over time and form an irritant to the endothelium upon which the platelets adhere and aggregate. In the process, thrombin is generated and fibrin formation and thrombi occur. This process takes many years to develop that when it becomes symptomatic; the disease process is usually well advanced.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Risk Factors of C.H.D</h3>
                        <p>They are divided into two:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unmodifiable risk factors</li>
                            <li>Modifiable risk factors</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">I) Unmodifiable Risk Factors</h4>
                        <h5>a) Age, Gender and Race</h5>
                        <p>The incidence of coronary heart disease is greater for white middle-aged men. After the age of 60 years, the incidence on men and women equalizes although it may be more increased in women due to increased stress, increased cigarette smoking, presence of hypertension and use of birth control pills.</p>
                        <h5>b) Family History and Heredity</h5>
                        <p>Genetic predisposition is an important factor in the occurrence of coronary heart disease although the exact mechanism of inheritance isnt fully understood. Some congenital defects in coronary artery walls predispose to the formation of plugs.</p>
                        <h5>c) Diabetes mellitus</h5>
                        <p>This is because persons with diabetes have increased tendency toward connective tissue degeneration.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">II) Modifiable Risk Factors</h4>
                        <h5>a) Elevated Serum Lipids</h5>
                        <p>A person is at risk of developing coronary heart disease if serum cholesterol level is more than $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: The liver is capable of producing cholesterol from saturated fats even when the dietry intake of fats is severely limited.</p>
                        <h5>b) Hypertension</h5>
                        <p>It is related to the shearing stress causing injury to the endothelial lining. Arteriosclerosis in turn causes narrowed, thickened arterial walls and decreases the distensibility and extensibility of vessels.</p>
                        <h5>c) Smoking</h5>
                        <p>The risk of developing coronary heart diseases is 2-6 higher to cigarette smokers than nonsmokers. Nicotine in the cigarette smoke cause catecholamine release that causes an increased heart rate, increased blood pressure and peripheral vaso-constriction. These changes increase the cardiac work load necessity greater myocardial oxygen consumption. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ a by-product of combustion affects the oxygen carrying capacity of Hb by reducing the sites available for oxygen transport. Thus the effects of an increased cardiac workload combined with oxygen depleting effect of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from smoking significantly decrease the oxygen available to the myocardium.</p>
                        <p>Other factors are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Obesity</li>
                            <li>Sedentary life style</li>
                            <li>Stress and behavior patterns
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>(I) Type A Behavior includes:</dt>
                                    <dd>Perfection, hardworking, driving personality. They suppress anger and hostility.</dd>
                                    <dt>(II) Have a sense of time urgency.</dt>
                                    <dd>Are impatient and cause stress and within themselves often when a situation does not warrant it.</dd>
                                    <dt>(III) Type B Behavior:</dt>
                                    <dd>Easier going, take upsets in stride, know their limitations. They take time to relax, are not over achievers and are able to keep priorities in perspectives.</dd>

                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>Major three ones for coronary heart disease are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sudden cardiac death (major).</li>
                            <li>Angina pectoris.</li>
                            <li>Acute myocardial infarction.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">A. Sudden Cardiac Death</h4>
                        <p>This is unexpected collapse and cardio-pulmonary arrest of a previously well appearing person within minutes to one hour after the onset of acute symptoms. It occurs secondary to natural cause. The affected person may or may not have prior history of a cardiovascular disease.</p>
                        <h5>Significance</h5>
                        <p>This is the leading cause of death in industrialized nations.</p>
                        <h5>Etiology</h5>
                        <p>In most instances, sudden cardiac death occurs as a primary manifestation of coronary heart disease and victims usually have multi-vessels coronary arteriosclerosis. Persons who experience sudden cardiac death as a result of coronary heart disease fall into two groups.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Those who had acute myocardial infarction account for $25 \%$.</li>
                            <li>Those who didnt have an acute myocardial infarction $75 \%$.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In this group of $75 \%$, victims usually offer no warning signs and have no known symptoms.</p>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_12_c13b7741fde709106825g-30-1.jpg" alt="Text excerpt describing that these clients are at risk of recurrent sudden death due to continued electrical instability of the myocardium." class="content-image">
                        <p>ventricular fibrillation or both. These clients are at risk of recurrent sudden death probably because of continued electrical instability of the myocardial which cause the initial event to occur.</p>
                        <p>The $25 \%$ cases usually do have prodromal symptoms such as chest pain and dyspnea and they have less chances of recurrence.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Risk Factors to Development of Sudden Cardiac Death</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Male gender.</li>
                            <li>Family history of premature arteriosclerosis.</li>
                            <li>Cigarette smoking.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>Therapeutic Management for Services</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Survivors of sudden cardiac death generally require a diagnostic work up to determine whether they have had an acute myocardial infarction. Thus cereal cardiac ISO enzymes and ECGs must be obtained and the client treated accordingly.</li>
                            <li>In addition since most persons with sudden cardiac death have coronary heart disease secondary to multi vessel coronary to arteriosclerosis cardiac catheterization is indicated to determine the possible location and extent of coronary artery occlusion.</li>
                            <li>Coronary artery by-pass graft surgery may be indicated.</li>
                            <li>Drugs to correct dysrhythmias are used such as procainamide, quinidine etc.</li>
                            <li>The nurse caring for a survivor of sudden cardiac death needs to be attuned to client psychosocial adaption to this sudden brush with death as these clients develop a time bomb mentality. They fear the recurrence of cardio pulmonary arrest and may become anxious, angry and depressed. There families are likely to experience the same feelings. The nurse should provide emotional support.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">B. Angina Pectoris</h4>
                        <p><strong>Def:</strong> Is a transient chest pain due to myocardial sematemia. It is literally translated as pain/angina in the chest/pectoris.</p>
                        <h5>Characteristics of this Pain</h5>
                        <p>It usually lasts for a few minutes 3-5minutes.and subsides when the precipitating factor usually exertion is relieved. Typical exertional angina should not persist longer than 20 minutes after a rest or administration of nitro glycerin.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Pathophysiology</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Myocardial ischemia develops when the demand for myocardial oxygen exceeds.</li>
                            <li>The ability of the coronary arteries to supply it. The primary reason fro insufficient flow is narrowing of the coronary arteries by arteriosclerosis.</li>
                            <li>Although skeletal muscles extracts only $20 \%$ of available oxygen and maintains a reserve, the myocardium at rest extracts $75-85 \%$ of the available oxygen. If myocardial needs of oxygen are not met from this near maximum extraction, coronary blood flow is increased through vaso-dilation and increased rate of flow.</li>
                            <li>In a person with coronary artery disease, coronary arteries are unable to dilate to meet increased metabolic needs because they are already chronically dilated beyond the obstructed area. For ischemia due to arteriosclerosis to occur,</li>
                            <li>The artery is usually $75 \%$ or more stenosed. In addition, the diseased heart has difficult increasing blood flow, this creates an oxygen deficit and in arteriosclerotic stenosis oxygen deficit is also caused by coronary artery spasms and thrombosis.</li>
                            <li>The left ventricle is more susceptible to ischemia and injury because of its higher myocardial oxygen demand, larger mass, higher wall tension and higher systemic pressures usually.</li>
                            <li>Ischemia causes transient left ventricular dysfunction resulting in an increased left ventricular diastolic pressure. On the cellular level, the myocardium becomes cyanotic within the $1^{\text {st }} 10$ seconds of coronary ceases after several minutes depriving the myocardial cells off glucose for aerobic metabolism.</li>
                            <li>Anaerobolic metabolism begins and lactic acid accumulates myocardial nerve fibers are irritated by increased lactic acid and transmits a pain message to the cardiac nerves and upper thoralic posterior roots (the reason for referred cardiac pain to the left shoulder and arm).</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>Precipitating Factors to Angina Pain</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Physical Exertion which increases the heart rate. Increasing the heart rate decreases the time the heart spends in diastole which is the time of greatest coronary blood flow. Examples of exertions are walking outdoor, wrecking leaves, painting or lifting heavy object.</li>
                            <li>Strong Emotions which stimulate the symphathetic nervous system and increase the work of the heart. This results in an increase in heart rate; blood pressure and myocardial contractivity.</li>
                            <li>Consumption of a Heavy Meal: These increases the workload of the heart and during the digestion process, blood is diverted to the GI system causing a low flow rate in the coronary arteries.</li>
                            <li>Temperature Extremes: Either hot or cold which increase the workload of the heart. This is because the blood vessels constrict in response to a cold stimulus and dilate and pools in the skin in response to a hot stimulus. Cold weather also causes increased metabolism to maintain internal temperature regulation.</li>
                            <li>Cigarette Smoking: Causes vaso constriction, increased heart rate and reduces oxygen carrying capacity of the blood.</li>
                            <li>Sexual activity: Increases the cardiac workload and sympathetic stimulation.</li>
                            <li>Stimulants: Such as cocaine or caffeine cause increased heart rate and subsequent myocardial oxygen demand.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h5>Types of Angina</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Stable Angina:</strong> Refers to chest pain occurring intermittently over along period of time with the same pattern of onset, duration and intensity of symptoms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Unstable Angina:</strong> It is unpredictable, easily provoked by minimal or no exercise occurs during sleep or at total rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prinzmetals Angina:</strong> Often occurs at rest and is as a result of spasm of a major coronary artery.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nocturnal Angina:</strong> Occurs at night but not necessarily when the person is in the recumbent position or during sleep.</li>
                            <li><strong>Angina Decubitus:</strong> Is chest pain that occurs only while the person is lying down and is usually relieved by standing or sitting.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <p><strong>Description of this pain:</strong> It is an unpleasant feeling often described as a constrictive squeezing, heavy choking/suffocating sensation. It appears sub_sternally. The sensation may occur in the neck or radiate to the shoulders and down in the arms. Often the patient will c/o the pain between the shoulder blades. It often occurs in the left side.</p>
                            <li>Severe indigestion or burning.</li>
                            <li>Depending on the severity of the Anginat attack the patient may remain motionless or may clench a fist over the sternal area.</li>
                            <li>The patient often refers to a feeling of anxiety and impending doom.</li>
                        </ol>
