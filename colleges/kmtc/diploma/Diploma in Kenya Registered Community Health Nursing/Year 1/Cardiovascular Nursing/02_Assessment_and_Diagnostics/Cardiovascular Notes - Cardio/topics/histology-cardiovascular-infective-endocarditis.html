                        <p><strong>Occurrence:</strong> The frequency is now seen in older adults, clients after prosthetic valve placement and intravenous drug abusers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Prognosis:</strong> The prognosis has changed with introduction of antibiotics because before then, infective endorcarditis was almost always fatal. The mortality rate is now 20 to $40 \%$.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Acute Form:</strong> Has a shorter clinical course with a more rapid onset increased toxicity and a more pathogenic/virulent causative micro organism that is staphylococcus aureus.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <p>Initially it was being caused by bacteria but of late micro organisms such as fungi, Chlamydia and rickettsia have been identified.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: These micro organisms get entry into the heart because of surgical interventions, intravenous injections and invasive diagnostic procedures.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>The vegetation form that is the primary lesions of infective endocarditis consist of fibrin, leucocytes, platelets and microbes that adhere to the valve surface or endocardium. The loss of these fragile vegetations into the circulation results in embolization. In left sided heart vegetations systemic embolization occurs progressing to the organs particularly the kidney, spleen and brain and there may be limp infarction. Right sided heart lesions embolize to the lungs. The infarction may be spread locally to cause damage to the valvers or to their supporting structures. The resulting valvular incompetence and eventual invasion of the myocardium in the ongoing disease results in C.C.F, generalized myocardial dysfunction and continued sepsis.</p>

                        <p>Clients with various anatomical abnormalities of the heart or great vessels are at great risk of contracting endocarditis. Prophylactic treatment is recommended for patients with some common cardiac heart conditions before they undergo certain surgical conditions.

It is important that these at risk of developing endocarditis are identified and educated to avoid nosocomial infections, fatigue to maintain good oral hygiene, to visit the dentist at regular intervals and to take prophylactic antibiotic therapy before any invasive procedure.</p>

                        <h5>b) Acute Intervention</h5>
                        <p>Patient with infective hospitalization for 2 to 4 weeks. Physical assessment and history taking are done. In particular, there should be frequent monitoring of body temperature as fever is one of the common early signs. Measures to reduce fever are employed. Bed rest is necessary when there is fever or complications such as heart done are present. Otherwise, the patient may be ambulant and perform moderate activities. Heart sounds should be assessed with vital signs to detect a change in the character of the cardiac murmur and presence of extra diastolic sounds. Arthralgia is a common problem and may involve multiple joints and be accompanied by myalgia. The patient should be assessed for joint tenderness, range of motions and muscle tenderness. The oral mucosa, upper chest and lower extremities should be examined for petechial (bleeding spots of blood under skin). A general assessment of systems should be completed to facilitate recognition of hemodynamic and embolic complications.</p>
                        <p>Laboratory data should be monitored to determine the effectiveness of long term high dose antibiotic therapy received by the client. The I.V. line should be monitored for patency and antibiotics given as scheduled monitor the side effects of these antibiotic or drugs given.</p>
                        <p>To prevent consequences from immobility, the patient should wear anti-embolism stockings, perform range of motion exercises and turn, cough and deep breathe every 2 hours. The patient may experience anxieties and fear associated with the illness, provide support during this period and employ measures to reduce fears and anxieties.</p>

                        <h5>c) Chronic Management</h5>
                        <p>This focuses on the education of the patient regarding the nature of the disease and on the reduction on the risk of re-infection. The patient is taught about symptoms that may indicate recurrent infections such as fever, fatigue, malaise, chills and the importance of seeking medical assistance if any of these symptoms occur. The patient needs to be instructed about the need for prophylactic antibiotic therapy before any invasive procedure is performed to prevent reoccurrence. The nurse must explain to the client the relationship of follow-up care, good nutrition and early reaction of common infections to maintain good health.</p>
