                        <p><strong>Rheumatic Fever:</strong> Is an inflammatory disease of the heart potentially involving all layers (endocardium, myocardium and pericardium), the resulting damage to the heart.</p>
                        <p>From rheumatic fever is called rheumatic heart disease a chronic condition characterized by scaring and deformity of the heart valves.</p>
                        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Acute rheumatic fever is a complication of up to $3 \%$ of sporadic upper respiratory infections called by group; A Beta haemolytic streptococci species. Initial and reccurant episodes of acute respiratory infection are most common from ages 6 m through 15 years.</p>
                        <p>Most recurrences occur within 2 years of the initial episodes. Recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever are 2 s as common between ages of 11 and 22 years as after the age of 22. The frequency of rheumatic recurrence after streptococcal infection is greater in those with rheumatic heart disease than in those who havent had cardiac injuries during frequent attacks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Etiology/Cause</h3>
                        <p>Rheumatic fever almost always occur as a delayed sequence usually 2 to 3 weeks to a group; A Beta haemolytic streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory system usually a pharyngeal infections. In addition to the infecting organism, other factors play a predisposing role in the development of rheumatic fever. They include;</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Social economic factors i.e. low social income groups, crowded living conditions, neglected inadequate treatment, poor nutrition and a lowered state of health.</li>
                            <li>There seems to be a familial tendency toward rheumatic fever which may be genetically related possibly due to an altered immune response.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>The coloration of streptococcal pharyngitis with rheumatic fever is conclusive but the pathogenic mechanisms by which streptococcal infection causes inflammation of the heart and other tissues are not well defined. The organisms is not demonstrated in the lesions when rheumatic fever appears several days or weeks after acute pharyngitis manifestations of acute rheumatic fever appear to be related (in susceptible patients) to abnormal immunological response to an upper respiratory infection with a beta haemolytic streptococcal. Acute rheumatic fever probably affect joints, CNS and the skin because of an abnormal humoral and cell related immune response to group A beta haemolytic streptococcal cell membrane antigens. It is possible that these antigens cross react with other tissues and bind to receptors on heart, muscle, joint and brain cells triggering immune and inflammatory responses.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cardiac lesions and Valvular Deformities</h4>
                        <p>About $40 \%$ of acute rheumatic fever episodes are marked by carditis and all layers of the heart may be involved. This generalized involvement gives rise to the term rheumatic. Rheumatic endocarditis is found primarily in the valves with swelling and erosion of values reflexes.</p>
                        <p>Vegetations form in areas of erosion from deposits of blood cells and fibrin. These lesions initially create fibrous thickening of the value commissures chordate tendinealand fibrosis of the papillary muscle. The values may become stenotic and insufficient. The initial and cortic values are most commonly affected. Less commonly involved are the tricuspid value and rarely pulmonary values. Value leaflets may fuse and become thickened or even calcified resulting in stenosis. Reduction in the mobility of value leaflets may occur with failure of the leaflets to oppose, regurgitation and result afterwards. Myocardial involvement is characterized by aschoff bodies which are nodules formed by a reaction to inflammation and accompanying swelling, fragmentation of collagen fibres. As aschoff bodies age, they become more fibrous and scarred tissue is formed in the myocardium. In addition to the aschoffs, a defused cellular infiltration is present interstitial tissues of the myocardial. Rheumatic pericarditic affects both layers of the pericardium which becomes thickened and covers with fibrous exudates a serousengunes pericardial fluid may be present.</p>
                        <p>When healing occurs, fibrosis and adhesions develops partially or completely obliterate the pericardial sac extra cardiac lesions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Extra Cardiac Lesions</h4>
                        <p>Lesions of rheumatic fever are systematic involving especially the connective tissues i.e.</p>
                        <ol>

                            <li>CNS: Chorea</li>
                            <li>Ahrginatum (Erythema maxginatum)</li>
                            <li>Lungs: Fibrinous pleuring and rheumatic pneumonitis</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>Diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is suggested of clustering of signs and symptoms as well as lab findings. The presence of 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criterions, indicate a high possibility of acute rheumatic fever. Either combination must have evidence of an existing streptococcal infection.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">A. MAJOR CRITERIA</h4>
                        <p>Because the five major manifestations of rheumatic fever (carditis, migratory polyarthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules) can appear alone or in combination. Rheumatic fever has many clinical patterns fever is a prominent syndrome but is not specific.</p>
                        
                        <h5>a) Migratory Polyarthritis</h5>
                        <p>Joints generally the large ones such as the wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees and lips snow limited range of motion, extreme tenderness swelling and inflammation.</p>
                        <p>The arthritis is migratory and reversible in nature of progression polyarthritis. Others during the $1^{\text {st }}$ to 2 weeks during the febrile period and lasts for a few days in certain affected joints before moving to other joints.</p>

                        <h5>b) Carditis</h5>
                        <p>It is seen in approximately $30 \%$ of children who have acute rheumatic fever. Inflammatory, hemorrhagic, bullous known aschoffs balies/nodules form in the interstitial tissues of the heart in response to rheumatic myocarditis. An organic heart murmurs not usually present usually from mitral or aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis are heard.</p>

                        <h5>c) Chorea (Sydenhams chorea: St. Vitus Dance)</h5>
                        <p>It is the major CNS manifestation. It is characterized by involuntary random muscular movements of the extremities, involuntary facial grimaces, weakness, ataxia which tends to intensify with voluntary activities. The child has emotional liability, speech disturbance and severe muscle weakness.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Children with chorea may be considered fidgety or restless and judged to be behavior problem.</p>
                        <p>Attempts to control fine motor activities and intensifies involuntary movements, whereas sleep and rest relieve them. These clinical manifestations may last for months before disappearing.</p>

                        <h5>d) Erythema Marginatum</h5>
                        <p>These are less common features of rheumatic fever. They are bright pink like map like macular lesions which eventually join together in a connective pattern giving a chicken wire decoration on the skin (appearance). Mainly found on the trunk or inner aspects of the upper arm and thigh but never on the face. Characteristically these lesions are evanescent and can be encouraged to appear with application of heat. They are neither puritic nor itching and also not raised. The rashes are usually transitory that is lasting for a few hours and may reoccur intermittently for months.</p>

                        <h5>e) Subcutaneous Nodules</h5>
                        <p>Are firm small hard painless swellings and most commonly over bony prominences. For example, knees, elbows, spine, scapula, knuckles, ankles, scalp and spinous processes of the vertebra. They frequently arent noticed by the person because the skin overlying nodules moves freely and is not inflamed. They gradually resolve over a period of time with no residue.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">B. MINOR MANIFESTATIONS</h4>

                            <li>Aspirins and Steroids: Are the two anti inflammatory agents most widely used in the management of acute rheumatic fever. Both are effective in controlling fever and join manifestations. Salicylates are used when arthritis is the main manifestations and steroids if severe carditis is present.</li>
                            <li>Bed rest: Prolonged periods of bed rest have previously been recommended but the patient without carditis may be ambulant as soon as the symptoms have subsided and may return to normal activities when the anti-inflammatory therapy has been discontinued.

                                </ol>
                                <ol type="A">
                                    <li>The nurse must administer antibiotics as ordered to treat the streptococcal infections and teach the patient that oral antibiotic therapy requires faithful adherence to the full 10 day course of therapy.</li>
                                    <li>Tepid sponge bath should be given to relieve fever and antipyretics should be administered as prescribed.</li>
                                    <li>Oral fluids should be encouraged if the patient is able to swallow or I.V. fluids be administered as prescribed.</li>
                                    <li>Promotion of optimal rest is essential to reduce cardiac workload and diminish the metabolic need of the body.</li>
                                    <p>The major role of the nurse to ensure bed rest is to assist the patient and relatives to understand the need for bed rest (amount) ordered by the physician.</p>
                                    <li>The nurse should ensure the patient doesnt develop constipation, decreased muscle tone which will lead to foot drop, skin break down, excessive weight gain and boredom.</li>
                                    <li>Arranging for light activities which can be done in bed is encouraged.</li>
                                    <li>Relieve of joint pain or bronchitis is an important nursing goal. Painful joints should be positioned for relieving of painful joints;</li>
                                    <li>Proper alignment. Removal of covers from painful joints can be done with a bed cradle. Heat may be applied and salicylates may be administered to relieve joint pains.</li>
                                    <li>Other measures to reduce discomfort during acute laze-state include:
                                        <ol type="a">
                                            <li>Planning the care such that the patient is not disturbed frequently.</li>
                                            <li>The only reaction of chorea is prevention of injury during the period when involuntary jerking and possibly violent movements occur. Protective measures include bed rails, padding on the sides of the bed/chair to prevent injury, rest rings, thick clothing and mittens to prevent bruising of the skin, assistance during walking to prevent falling and also feeding the patients to prevent injuries from use of feeding implements/equipment.</li>
                                            <li>Psychological and emotional care can be more important than physical care because children and young clients are the primary clients and the heart is often viewed as the center of life. Any alteration in cardiac function may be perceived as a threat to the persons body image.</li>
                                            <li>To evaluate the progression or regression of the disease process the nurse should assess the patient for remission of symptoms. This includes;
                                                <ul>

                                                    <li>Resting and sleeping heart rates. This is because an accelerated sleeping heart rate in the presence of a febrile state is an indication of cardiac involvement.</li>
                                                    <li>The lab tests be monitored for return to normal ranges.</li>

                                    <li>The patient should be taught about the disease process, possible sequence and need for prophylactic antibiotics.</li>
                                    <li>The ongoing client education and reinforcement encourages good health practices. The patient should also be cautioned about the possibility of development of valvular heart disease.</li>
                                    <li>Nurse should teach the patient to seek medical attention i.e. excessful fatigue, dizziness, palpitations or dyspnea on exertion develops.</li>
                                    <li>The child with cardiac manifestations of the disease i.e. aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis or insufficiency must be followed regularly with additional testing to determine the progression or regression of the lesions.</li>

                        <p>Prognosis of this disease is generally good. The degree of carditis and subsequent damage to cardiac structures are of primary concerns since they will be reflected in the levels of activity restrictions in the future with each recurrence of streptococcal infection the likelihood for potential need for valvte replacement increases therefore prevention of recurrences is a high priority.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications of Rheumatic Fever</h3>
                        <p>NOTE: Once or evidence of rheumatic fever has abated rheumatic fever doesnt occur in the absence of a new streptococcal infection. If the initial episode isnt associated with carditis there is little likelihood of subsequent damage if repeated attacks dont occur.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Chronic rheumatic carditis which results from changes in valvular structures that may occur months to years after an attack of acute rheumatic fever.</li>
                            <li>Rheumatic endocarditis can result in fibrous tissue growth to valve-valve leaflets chordae tendineae with scarring and contractures.</li>
                            <li>Other valves that may also be affected are the aortic and the tricuspid values.</li>

                        <p>Mainly involves the mitral and aortic valves.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chronic Valvular Disease</h3>
                        <p>This condition usually occurs as a result of the inflammation of the valve cusps/flaps leading to their distortion fibrosis and calcification. The valves therefore become ineffective in performing their normal functions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Terminologies used in Connection to Chronic Valvular Disease</h4>
                        <p><strong>Stenosis:</strong> Narrowing of the valves.<br>
                        <strong>Incompetence:</strong> Inadequate closure of the valves.<br>
                        <strong>Regurgitation:</strong> Back flow of blood as a result of incompetence.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of Chronic Valvular Disease</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mitral valyte disease.</li>
                            <li>Aortic Valve disease.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary and tricuspid valve disease.
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li><strong>Mitral Valve Disease:</strong> In half of the people suffering from this disease, more than $50 \%$ of them have a history of rheumatic fever. Mitral stenosis is more common than mitral incompetence although in some cases, they may occur simultaneously. The lungs become very congested causing shortness of breath and tiredness. Acute pulmonary edema may occur. Arterial fibrillation is usually present and left heart failure gradually appears.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Aortic Valvular Disease:</strong> In this condition, aortic valve stenosis or incompetence may occur. The main result is the enlargement of the heart called cardiac hypertrophy. The left ventricular failure eventually occurs followed by right heart failure. Main symptoms are; dyspnea, tiredness and angina.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pulmonary and Tricuspid Valve Disease.</strong> Tricuspid valve disease is usually due to rheumatic heart disease and is associated with mitral and aortic valve disease. In both cases, right heart failure occurs and back pressure is transmitted via inferior vena_cava into the systemic circulation.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Chronic Valvular Disease</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Same as for congestive heart failure.</li>
                            <li>Cardiac surgery may be performed i.e. valvotomy dilatation of the valves.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Valve Replacement: There are two types i.e.</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Homo Graft: Using human tissue.</li>
                            <li>Hetero Graft: Non-human tissues are used.</li>
                            <li>Mechanical valves which are plastic valves.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>NOTE: There is usually risk of infection associated with the type of surgery and therefore the need for antibiotics and analgesics.</p>
                        <p>Incase mechanical valve is inserted their, anticoagulant therapy is indicated to prevent thrombosis around the valyte. Cardiac surgery is usually a very major operation and the patient needs to be nursed and treated in the ICU for a few days and on I.V. fluids and blood transfusion as indicated.</p>
