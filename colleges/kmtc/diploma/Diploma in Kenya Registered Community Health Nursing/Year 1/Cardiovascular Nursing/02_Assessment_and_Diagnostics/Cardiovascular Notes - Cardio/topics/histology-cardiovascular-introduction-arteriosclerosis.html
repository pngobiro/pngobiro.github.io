                        <p><strong>Def:</strong> Is the hardening and thickening of the walls of the smaller arteries. Peripheral chronic arterial occlusive disease involves progressive narrowing and eventual obstruction of the arteries to the extremities occurring predominantly on the legs. Others areas where it may occur may affect the aorta: iliac, fremorval artery; popliteal; tibial or any combination of these areas.</p>
                        <p><strong>Incidence:</strong> Usually occurs in the $6^{\text {th }}$ and $8^{\text {th }}$ decades of life. Affects primarily men and has a family tendency (genetic).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Predisposing Factors</h3>
                        <p>There are three most significant factors which are risk for peripheral arterial disease i.e.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Cigarette smoking</li>
                            <li>Hyperlipidemia</li>
                            <li>Hypertension</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Other factors are;</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Diabetes mellitus</li>
                            <li>Positive family history</li>
                            <li>Obesity</li>
                            <li>Sedentary life style</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>Chronic arterial obstruction leads to progressively inadequate oxygenation of the tissues supplied by the obstructed arteries. The pan attributable to that ischemia is produced by the end products of anaerobic cellular metabolism such as lactic acid. This usually occurs in the larger muscle groups of the legs during exercise. Once the p+ stops exercising, the metabolites are cleared and the pain subsides. But as the disease advances in progress, the pain develops even at rest. This finding indicates insufficient blood flow to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The p+ may notice resting foot pain more often at right and a chief partial relieve by lowering the limb below heart level.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>The severity of clinical manifestations depends on the site and extent of occlusion as well as the adequacy of collateral circulation. The classic symptom of peripheral arterial disease is intermittent claudication defined as Ischemic muscle pain that is precipitated by a predictable amount of exercise and relieved by resting. For example;</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Occlusive disease of the iliac arteries may cause claudication in the buttocks and upper part of the thighs.</li>
                            <li>b) Disease involving the removal or popliteal arteries may cause claudication in the cuff.</li>
                            <li>c) If disease extends into the external iliac arteries, impotence may result.</li>
                            <li>d) If the disease becomes more severe, the limb will progress to ulceration and gangrenous necrosis (tissue dies and rot).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Paresthesia:</strong> Manifested as numbness or tingling occurring in the toes or feet as a result of nerve tissue ischemia.</p>
                        <p><strong>True Peripheral Neuropathy:</strong> As a result of progressive long standing arterial obstruction seen mainly in diabetics. It produces excruciating shotting (burning pain the extremities). This gradually if ignored progresses to loss of both sensation and deep pain as a result of diminished perfusion to nerve tissue cells.</p>
                        <p>On physical examination the limb appears pallor or blanching due to inadequate blood flow. When the limb is allowed to hang in a dependent position, there is hyperemia (reduces of the skin) and a bluish or dusky appearance.</p>
                        <p><strong>The skin:</strong> Becomes shinny and taut and there is loss of hair on lower legs.<br>
                        <strong>On palpation:</strong> There may be diminished or absent pedal, popliteal or removal pulses.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>History and physical examination including palpation of peripheral pulses.</li>
                            <li>Oscillometry will be done to determine pulse volume to the amplitude of pulsation.</li>
                            <li>Doppler ultrasound will be done to measure the velocity of the blood flow through the vessel.</li>
                            <li>Angiography is used to delineate the location and extent of the disease process.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>There are two forms of management i.e.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Therapeutic</li>
                            <li>Surgical</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">a) Therapeutic Management/Conservative Management</h4>
                        <p>Its objectives include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Protecting the extremity from trauma.</li>
                            <li>Slowing the progression of arterial sclerosis.</li>
                            <li>Decreasing vaso-spasm.</li>
                            <li>Preventing and controlling infection.</li>
                            <li>Improving collateral circulation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The clients risk factors should be assessed and proper intervention should begin regarding cessation of smoking; weight reduction if indicated and control of lipid disorders. Hypertension also needs to be properly managed. Slow progressive and physical activity should be encouraged to help develop collateral circulation. For example, the p+ should be out of bed at least four times a day; walk for 30 minutes twice a day as tolerated and stop if pain occurs but after a rest-break, the client should continue walking. Keep the foot of the bed in the reverse Trendelenburg position at $10^{\circ}$.</p>
                        <p>Soaking of the affected part and application of a topical antibiotic may be advised to treat or prevent infection. If ulceration is present, the affected foot should be kept clean and dry. Covering the foot with a dry sterile dressing helps to protect the extremity from trauma and avoid infection.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">b) Surgical Management</h4>
                        <p>Indications to this;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When the symptoms of intermitted claudication becomes incapacitating.</li>
                            <li>When ulceration or gangrene is severe enough to threaten the viability of the limb. The latter problem will likely progress unless arterial circulation can be restored.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Various surgical approaches can be used to improve arterial blood flow beyond stenotic or occluded artery i.e.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bypass operation (most common): with autogenous vein or synthetic graft material to carry/bypass blood around the lesion.</li>
                            <li>The other surgical option include: Endarterectomy which means opening the artery and removing the obstructing plug.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>And patch graft angioplasty: Means opening the artery; removing the plug; gawing a patch to the artery opening to widen the lumen.</p>
                        <ol start="3">
                            <li>For clients who are not suitable candidates for extensive surgery or in whom the surgical option are impossible, the blood flow to the peripherally may be increased through surgical interruption of the sympathetic nerves supplying the blood vessel of the affected limb. Rationale: Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in constriction of the blood vessel. So sympatectomy prevents this vaso-constriction hence causing permanent dilatation.</li>
                            <li>Amputation: Is the last surgical intervention, but it may be required if gangrene is extensive; infection is present in the bone osteomyelitis); and or major arteries in the limb are occluded precluding the possibility of bypass surgery.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>NB: Every effort is made to preserve as much of the limb as possible so that the potential for rehabilitation with orthotic shoes or prosthesis is optimized.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pharmacological Management</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Although various drugs are commonly prescribed to treat peripheral arteriosclerosis disease, no specific agent is known to be effective especially pentoxifylline (Trental) which increase erythrocyte flexibility and reduces blood viscosity thus improving the supply of oxygenated blood to ischemic muscle.</li>
                            <li>Although it is not conclusive that anticoagulants and antiplatelet aggregating agents i.e. aspirin improves circulation through diseased arteries, they are sometimes used after arterial bypass surgery to promote graft patency.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nutritional Management Consideration</h4>
                        <p>If the client has evidence of arteriosclerosis, the following should be encouraged:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Caloric adjustment so that optimum weight can be achieved.</li>
                            <li>b) Decrease of dietary cholesterol to less than 300 mg per day.</li>
                            <li>c) Substantial reduction in saturated dietary fat.</li>
                            <li>d) Restriction of sodium to 2 g per day if oedema is present.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Management</h3>
                        <p>The client needs to be assessed and nursing diagnosis made. The nursing diagnoses are determined when the problems and aetiological factors are supported by clinical data. Nursing diagnosis related to chronic arteriosclerosis occlusive disease may include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Altered tissue perfusion related to decreased arterial blood flow.</li>
                            <li>Impaired skin integrity related to decreased peripheral circulation; altered sensation and increased susceptibility to infection.</li>
                            <li>Pain related to ischaemia and exercise.</li>
                            <li>Activity intolerance related to imbalance to oxygen supply and demand.</li>
                            <li>High risk for injury related to decreased sensation and tissue hypoxia.</li>
                            <li>Anticipatory grieving related potential loss of the disease part.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing Intervention</h4>
                        <p><strong>i) Health Promotion and Maintenance:</strong> The client should be assessed for risk factors and be taught how to control them. The nursing role in client education in the p+ care facility is important in identifying high risk clients. For example, the nurse should also be involved at the community level such as in screening clinic for hypertension; youth education on hazards of cigarette smoking; assisting families in diet modification to reduce the intake of animal fat and refined sugars; proper care of the feet and the avoidance of injuries to the extremities.</p>
                        <p>Clients with positive family history of cardiac; diabetes or vascular disease need to be encouraged to obtain regular follow-up care.</p>
                        <p><strong>Acute Intervention:</strong> This is after surgical intervention where the p+ is placed in ICU or recovery area for close observation to be taken.</p>
                        <p><strong>Observations taken</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) The operative extremity should be checked every 15 minutes. Initially and then hourly for colour; temperature; capillary refill and palpate for the presence of peripheral pulses distal to the operative site. These findings should be compared with the events preoperative baseline and with findings in the opposite limb.</li>
                            <li>b) Other vital observations are taken. When the client is transferred from ICU or recovery room, nursing care should focus on continued circulatory assessment and monitoring for the development of potential complications.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Symptoms such as recurrent of severe ischaemic pain; loss of pulse or pulses; numbness or tingling and or cold temperature change may indicate occlusion on the bypass graft and should be reported to the surgeon immediately. On the $2^{\text {nd }}$ or $3^{\text {rd }}$ post operative day the p+ should be out off bed 3 to 4 times daily; sitting for prolonged period of time may be discouraged because leg dependency promotes oedema and depending on the location of the bypass may impede flow through the graft. Sitting is only limited to meal time and bathroom privileges only other time the pts should be lying. If oedema develops the leg should be elevated above heart level. If no complications are present discharge from the hospital can be anticipated 7-10 days post operatively.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Chronic/Subsequent Management</h4>
                        <p>Arteriosclerosis is not localized to the lower extremities but is a systemic disease process. The overall approach in the control of arteriosclerosis involves: management of risk factors. This is by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Tobacco in any form is totally contra-indicated not only because of the vaso constrictive effects of ricotine but also because tobacco smoke impaires transport and cellular utilization of oxygen and increases blood viscosity.</li>
                            <li>b) The client be given health education on the right diet; programmed exercises meticulous foot care; to improve collateral circulation through the exercises. The client should be taught to avoid injuries to extremities for skin color; scraps; motting or lesions in the texture of the skin or subcutaneous fat or reduction of skin or hair growth. Any ulceration or inflammation be reported to the health care provider. Skin temperature be noted and capillary refill of the fingers and toes be tested. They should be advised to avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Measures to avoid compromising circulation should be implemented including tight bands or socks; tight nylon gathers; tight waist bands; shops should not be taled tightly and new shoes should be worn gradually.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications of Arteriosclerosis</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a) Chronic peripheral progresses slowly and prolonged ischemia leads to atrophy on the skin and underlying structures.</li>
                            <li>b) Because of decreased ability to heal infections and necrosis may result from trauma to the feet.</li>
                            <li>c) The ischemic ulcers caused by arterial-insufficiency most commonly occurs over bony prominences on the toes and feet.</li>
                            <li>d) If severe ischemia persist gangrene will develop.</li>
