                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Heart Sound Variation</h3>
                        <p>Heart sound variations when listening to heart sounds, note their volume (normal, diminished, loud) and whether physiological splitting is present. Relative positions of heart sounds and added sounds in auscultation. Sounds in red are high-pitched. <strong>(A1)</strong> Aortic component of second heart sound; <strong>EC:</strong> ejection click; <strong>MSC:</strong> mid systolic click; <strong>OS:</strong> opening snap; <strong>P2:</strong> pulmonary component of second heart sound;.</p>
                        <p>Physiological splitting of the second heart sound is when the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) occurs earlier than that of pulmonary valve closure (P2). It occurs inspiration and is more common in the young. It is caused by increased venous return and negative intrathoracic pressure. This delays right ventricular emptying and pulmonary valve closure, at the same time that pooling of blood in the pulmonary capillary bed hastens left ventricular emptying and aortic valve closure.</p>
                        <p>Reverse splitting of the second heart sound can occur in conditions where aortic valve closure is delayed, such as left bundle branch block or paced right ventricle, or where pulmonary valve closure occurs early, such as in the Bform of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.</p>
                        <p>Wide fixed splitting of the secondheart sound occurs in atrial septal defect.</p>
                        <p>A third heart sound may be heard soon after the second heart sound. It is thought to be due to rapid, high-volume filling of the left ventricle. As such, it is found in pathological (left ventricular failure) as well as physiological (athletic heart, pregnancy) states.</p>
                        <p>A fourth heart sound may be heard just before the first sound. This is caused by atrial contraction filling a stiff left ventricle, e.g., hypertensive heart or diastolic heart failure.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Murmurs</h3>
                        <p>When you have considered these heart sound variations move on to consider the gaps between the heart sounds. If you hear a murmur, first establish whether it occurs in systole or diastole (time against the carotid pulse if necessary). Then determine its length and, if short, its exact position (early, mid, or late; systole or diastole).</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Added Sounds</h3>
                        <p>An opening snap occurring after the second heart sound represents a diseased mitral valve opening to a stenotic position. An ejection click soon after the firstheart sound occurs in aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis. A mid systolic click's heard in mitral valve prolapse.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">After Listening to the Heart</h3>
                        <p>Listen to the base of the lungs for the fine inspiratory crackles of pulmonary edema. If you suspect right-sided cardiac pathology, palpate the liver, which will be enlarged, congested, and possibly pulsatile in cases of right ventricular failure of tricuspid valve disease. Also, check the patient's ankles for swelling.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Summary</h3>
                        <p>A careful clinical examination can reveal much about the condition of your patient's heart. In addition, noting the findings of a full examination will greatly facilitate specialist referral. In an age of high technology, skilled clinical examination has yet to be surpassed in terms of convenience, safety, and value for money.</p>
