\section*{Cardiovascular examination}

Examination of the cardiovascular focuses on 5 structures:
1. General appearance of the patient
2. Physical signs associated with arterial circulation
3. Physical signs associated with venous circulation
4. Physical signs of the heart
5. Physical signs of the lungs

Examination of the system involves the following specific examination:
I. Examination of pallor
II. Cyanosis
III. Edema
IV. Signs of endocarditis
V. Taking pulse at different sites
VI. Examination of the lungs
VII. Measurements of the jugular venous pressure
VIII. Examination of the heart
IX. examination of the peripheral circulation

\section*{PALLOR}

Ask the patient to be seated or lie supine facing you
Ask the patient to look up, pull the lower eye lids and look for paleness in the lower palpebral conjunctiva.

Also look for pallor in palms, nail beds and tongue.

\section*{Causes}
- heart disease
- peripheral vascular disease
- anemia
- malnutrition
- anorexia
- bradycardia
- leukemia
- shock

\section*{CYANOSIS}

It is the bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membrane due to increased deoxyhaemoglobin in blood.

There are two types of cyanosis:
Central cyanosis-examine the tongue, soft palate, bucal mucosa, lower pulpebral conjunctiva and peripheral sites. Causes could be congenital heart disease

Peripheral cyanosis-the extremities i.e the hands and the feet causes could be congestive heart failure and frost bites

To differentiate central and peripheral cyanosis massage the ear lobule for 30 seconds, bluish discoloration disappear in peripheral cyanosis whereas it remains the same in c central cyanosis

\section*{OEDEMA}

It is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. It can be generalized or localized, pitting or non pitting

\section*{Sites to examine}
I. face
II. sacrum
III. abdomen
IV. extremities

Ascites- fluid thrill and shifting dullness over abdomen
Pleural effusion- percussion over lungs
Pericardial effusion --percussion over the pericardium

To check pitting edema, apply pressure over bonny background with your thumb for 30 seconds , look for pitting and allow it for 15 seconds to disappear.

When edema is present you will determine the severity of edema and whether it is pitting and non pitting. Report the findings

\section*{SIGNS OF ENDOCARDITIES}
$\checkmark$ fever
$\checkmark$ malaise
$\checkmark$ night sweats
$\checkmark$ chills

\section*{TAKING PULSE}

Arterial pulse is the palpable pressure wave form transmitted along arterial wall and generated at root of aorta during cardiac cycle.

\section*{SITES OF TAKING PULSE}

Radial pulse-on the thumb side of the wrist
Temporal pulse- lateral to the eye brow on the temporal bone
Bronchial pulse- medial aspect of the cabital fossa
Femoral pulse- upper inner aspect for the thigh
Carotid pulse- s8ide of the neck
Dorsalis pedis pulse- upper surface of the foot
Posterior tibial pulse- behind the lateral malleolus
Popliteal pulse- behind the knee

\section*{EXAMINATION OF THE LUNGS}

\section*{MEASUREMENTS OF THE JUGULAR VENOUS PRESSURE (JVP)}

The jugular vein is the nearest to the input side of the heart and the pressure measured gives an approximate of the pressure in the right atrium of the right heart. The jugular pulsation reflects the sequence of pressure changes within the right atrium

\section*{HOW TO MEASURE JVP}

Properly expose the patient. The patient must be inclined at 45 degrees and the head must be supported with a pillow the relax the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The light source should be shined across the right side of the neck. Look for pulsation from the right side of the neck behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Take two rulers and keep the first one vertically from the sterna angle and the other ruler horizontally from the highest point of visible pulsation. The reading on vertical ruler at the point of intersection between the two rulers gives the JVP value. If the right atrial pressure is low Patient should be in recumbent position for the JVP to be seen. If the right atrial pressure is high, patient should sit upright for the JVP to be seen.

\section*{CAUSES ELEVATED JVP}
a) Right heart failure
b) Superior vena cava obstruction
c) Fluid overload
d) Constrictive pericardities
e) Pericardial effusion
f) COPD

CAUSES OF FALL IN JVP
I. Hypovolemic shock

\section*{EXAMINATION OF THE HEART}

\section*{Heart sound variation}

Heart sound variations when listening to heart sounds, note their volume (normal, diminished, loud) and whether physiological splitting is present.Relative positions of heart sounds and added sounds in auscultation. Sounds in red are high-pitched. (A1)Aortic component of second heart sound; EC: ejection click; MSC: mid systolic click; OS: opening snap; P2: pulmonary component of second heart sound;. Physiological splitting of the second heart sound is when the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) occurs earlier than that of pulmonary valve closure (P2). It occurs inspiration and is more common in the young. It is caused by increased venous return and negative intrathoracic pressure. This delays right ventricular emptying and pulmonary valve closure, at the same time that pooling of blood in the pulmonary capillary bed hastens left ventricular emptying and aortic valve closure. Reverse splitting of the second heart sound can occur in conditions where aortic valve closure is delayed, such as left bundle branch block or paced right ventricle, or where pulmonary valve closure occurs early, such as in the Bform of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Wide fixed splitting of the secondheart sound occurs in atrial
septal defect.A third heart sound may be heard soon after the second heart sound. It is thought to be due to rapid, high-volume filling of the left ventricle. As such, it is found in pathological (left ventricular failure) as well as physiological (athletic heart, pregnancy) states. A fourth heart sound may be heard just before the first sound. This is caused by atrial contraction filling a stiff left ventricle, e.g., hypertensive heart or diastolic heart failure.

\section*{Murmurs}

When you have considered these heart sound variations move on to consider the gaps between the heart sounds. If you hear a murmur, first establish whether it occurs in systole or diastole (time against the carotid pulse if necessary). Then determine its length and, if short, its exact position (early, mid, or late; systole or diastole).

\section*{Added sounds}

An opening snap occurring after the second heart sound represents a diseased mitral valve opening to a stenotic position. An ejection click soon after the firstheart sound occurs in aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis. A mid systolic click's heard in mitral valve prolapse.

\section*{After listening to the heart}

Listen to the base of the lungs for the fine inspiratory crackles of pulmonary edema. If you suspect right-sided cardiac pathology, palpate the liver, which will be enlarged, congested, and possibly pulsatile in cases of right ventricular failure of tricuspid valve disease. Also, check the patient's ankles for swelling.

\section*{Summary}

A careful clinical examination can reveal much about the condition of your patient's heart. In addition, noting the findings of a full examination will greatly facilitate specialist referral. In an age of high technology, skilled clinical examination has yet to be surpassed in terms of convenience, safety, and value for money.

\section*{CADIOVASCULAR EXAMINATION}

Examination of the cardiovascular focuses on 5 structures:
1. General appearance of the patient
2. Physical signs associated with arterial circulation
3. Physical signs associated with venous circulation
4. Physical signs of the heart
5. Physical signs of the lungs

Examination of the system involves the following specific examination:
I. Examination of pallor
II. Cyanosis
III. Edema
IV. Signs of endocarditis
V. Taking pulse at different sites
VI. Measurements of the jugular venous pressure
VII. Examination of the heart
VIII. examination of the peripheral circulation

\section*{PALLOR}

Ask the patient to be seated or lie supine facing up,
Ask the patient to look up, pull the lower eye lids and look for paleness in the lower palpebral conjunctiva.

Also look for pallor in palms, nail beds and tongue.

\section*{Causes}
- heart disease
- peripheral vascular disease
- anemia
- malnutrition
- anorexia
- bradycardia
- leukemia
- shock

\section*{CYANOSIS}

It is the bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membrane due to increased deoxyhaemoglobin in blood.

There are two types of cyanosis:
Central cyanosis-examine the tongue, soft palate, bucal mucosa, lower pulpebral conjunctiva and peripheral sites. Causes could be congenital heart disease

Peripheral cyanosis-the extremities i.e. the hands and the feet causes could be congestive heart failure and frost bites

To differentiate central and peripheral cyanosis massage the ear lobule for 30 seconds, bluish discoloration disappear in peripheral cyanosis whereas it remains the same in c central cyanosis

\section*{OEDEMA}

It is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitium. It can be generalized or localized, pitting or non-pitting

\section*{Sites to examine}
I. face
II. sacrum
III. abdomen
IV. extremities

Ascites- fluid thrill and shifting dullness over abdomen
Pleural effusion- percussion over lungs
Pericardial effusion -percussion over the pericardium

To check pitting edema, apply pressure over bonny background with your thumb for 30 seconds , look for pitting and allow it for 15 seconds to disappear.

When edema is present you will determine the severity of edema and whether it is pitting and non-pitting. Report the findings

\section*{SIGNS OF ENDOCARDITIES}
$\checkmark$ fever
$\checkmark$ malaise
$\checkmark$ night sweats
$\checkmark$ chills

\section*{TAKING PULSE}

Arterial pulse is the palpable pressure wave form transmitted along arterial wall and generated at root of aorta during cardiac cycle.

SITES OF TAKING PULSE
1. Radial pulse-on the thumb side of the wrist
2. Temporal pulse- lateral to the eye brow on the temporal bone
3. Bronchial pulse- medial aspect of the cabital fossa
4. Femoral pulse- upper inner aspect for the thigh
5. Carotid pulse- side of the neck
6. Dorsalis pedis pulse- upper surface of the foot
7. Posterior tibial pulse- behind the lateral malleolus
8. Popliteal pulse- behind the knee

\section*{MEASUREMENTS OF THE JUGULAR VENOUS PRESSURE (JVP)}

The jugular vein is the nearest to the input side of the heart and the pressure measured gives an approximate of the pressure in the right atrium of the right heart. The jugular pulsation reflects the sequence of pressure changes within the right atrium

\section*{HOW TO MEASURE JVP}

Properly expose the patient. The patient must be inclined at 45 degrees and the head must be supported with a pillow to relax the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The light source should be shined across the right side of the neck. Look for pulsation from the right side of the neck behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Take two rulers and keep the first one vertically from the sterna angle and the other ruler horizontally from the highest point of visible pulsation. The reading on vertical ruler at the point of intersection between the two rulers gives the JVP value. If the right atrial pressure is low Patient should be in recumbent position for the JVP to be seen. If the right atrial pressure is high, patient should sit upright for the JVP to be seen.

\section*{CAUSES ELEVATED JVP}
a) Right heart failure
b) Superior vena cava obstruction
c) Fluid overload
d) Constrictive pericardities
e) Pericardial effusion
f) COPD

\section*{CAUSES OF FALL IN JVP}
I. Hypovolemic shock

\section*{EXAMINATION OF THE HEART}

\section*{Heart sound variation}

Heart sound variations when listening to heart sounds, note their volume (normal, diminished, loud) and whether physiological splitting is present.Relative positions of heart sounds and added sounds in auscultation. Sounds in red are high-pitched. (A1)Aortic component of second heart sound; EC: ejection click; MSC: mid systolic click; OS: opening snap; P2: pulmonary component of second heart sound;. Physiological splitting of the second heart sound is when the sound of aortic valve closure (A2) occurs earlier than that of pulmonary valve closure (P2). It occurs inspiration and is more common in the young. It is caused by increased venous return and negative intrathoracic pressure. This delays right ventricular emptying and pulmonary valve closure, at the same time that pooling of blood in the pulmonary capillary bed hastens left ventricular emptying and aortic valve closure. Reverse splitting of the second heart sound can occur in conditions where aortic valve closure is delayed, such as left bundle branch block or paced right ventricle, or where pulmonary valve closure occurs early, such as in the Bform of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Wide fixed splitting of the secondheart sound occurs in atrial
septal defect.A third heart sound may be heard soon after the second heart sound. It is thought to be due to rapid, high-volume filling of the left ventricle. As such, it is found in pathological (left ventricular failure) as well as physiological (athletic heart, pregnancy) states. A fourth heart sound may be heard just before the first sound. This is caused by atrial contraction filling a stiff left ventricle, e.g., hypertensive heart or diastolic heart failure.

\section*{Murmurs}

When you have considered these heart sound variations move on to consider the gaps between the heart sounds. If you hear a murmur, first establish whether it occurs in systole or diastole (time against the carotid pulse if necessary). Then determine its length and, if short, its exact position (early, mid, or late; systole or diastole).

\section*{Added sounds}

An opening snap occurring after the second heart sound represents a diseased mitral valve opening to a stenotic position. An ejection click soon after the firstheart sound occurs in aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis. A mid systolic click's heard in mitral valve prolapse.

\section*{After listening to the heart}

Listen to the base of the lungs for the fine inspiratory crackles of pulmonary edema. If you suspect right-sided cardiac pathology, palpate the liver, which will be enlarged, congested, and possibly pulsatile in cases of right ventricular failure of tricuspid valve disease. Also, check the patient's ankles for swelling.

\section*{Summary}

A careful clinical examination can reveal much about the condition of your patient's heart. In addition, noting the findings of a full examination will greatly facilitate specialist referral. In an age of high technology, skilled clinical examination has yet to be surpassed in terms of convenience, safety, and value for money.
