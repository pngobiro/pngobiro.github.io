                                <p>Atherosclerosis is the major cause of coronary artery disease. Atherosclerosis comes from two Greek wards adhere meaning fatty mush and skleros meaning hard. Thus atherosclerosis begins as soft deposits of fat that harden with age.</p>
                                <p>The atheroma (fatty deposits) has a high affinity for the coronary arteries.</p>

                        <p>Coronary heart disease is a progressive disease that takes many years to develop. The stages of development in atherosclerosis are: -</p>

                                <strong>Fatty streak</strong>
                                <p>Are the earliest lesions of atherosclerosis. Are characterized by lipid- filled smooth muscle cells. As streaks of fat develop within the smooth muscle cells, a yellow tinge appears.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Fibrous Plague</strong>
                                <p>This is the beginning of the progressive changes in the endothelium of the arterial wall. Low density lipoproteins and growth factors from platelets stimulate smooth muscle proliferation and thickening of the arterial wall.</p>
                                <p>Lipoproteins (carrier proteins within the blood stream) transport cholesterol and other lipids into the arterial wall.</p>
                                <p>Collagen covers the fatty streak and forms a fibrous plague with a grayish or whitish appearance.</p>
                                <p>The result is a narrowing of the vessel lumen and a reduction in blood flow to the distal tissues.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Complicated lesion</strong>
                                <p>Is the final stage in the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. As the fibrous plague grows, continued inflammation can result in plague instability, ulceration and rupture.</p>
                                <p>Platelets accumulate in large numbers, leading to a thrombus. The thrombus may adhere to the wall of the artery, leading to further narrowing or total occlusion of the artery.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Risk factors are characteristics or conditions that are associated with a high incidence of coronary artery disease. They are classified as non-modifiable & modifiable as follows:</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">NON-MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Age</strong> - The incidence of coronary artery disease is highest among the elderly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family history and genetics</strong> - Genetic predisposition plays a role in the occurrence of coronary artery disease.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Modifiable Risk Factors</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Elevated Serum Lipids</strong> - Elevated serum lipid level is a risk factor for coronary artery disease.
                                <p>For lipids to be used and transported by the body they must become soluble in blood by combining with proteins.</p>
                                <p>Lipids combine with proteins to form lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are vehicles for fat mobilization and transport, and vary in composition.</p>
                                <p>They are classified as high density lipoproteins (HDLs, LDLs, and very low density lipoproteins VLDLs).</p>
                                <p>High density lipoproteins contain more protein by weight and fewer lipids than any other lipoprotein.</p>
                                <p>HDLs carry lipids away from the arteries and to the liver for metabolism. This process of HDL transport prevents lipid accumulation within the arterial walls. Therefore, the higher the HDL levels, in the blood, the lower the risk of coronary artery disease.</p>
                                <p>HDL levels are higher in children and women, decrease with age and are low in persons with coronary artery disease. Physical activity, moderate alcohol consumption and estrogen administration increase HDL levels.</p>
                                <p>Low density lipoproteins contain more cholesterol than any other lipoproteins and have an affinity for arterial walls.</p>
                                <p>Thus they may deposit cholesterol directly on the walls of arteries. Elevated LDL levels are associated with an increased incidence of coronary artery disease. Therefore, low LDL, levels are not desirable. Life style factors that can contribute to elevated triglycerides include high alcohol consumption, high intake of refined carbohydrates and simple sugars and physical inactivity.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Hypertension</strong>
                                <p>Hypertension is a blood pressure greater than $I40/90 mmHg$. The stress of elevated blood pressure increases the rate of atherosclerotic development. Atherosclerosis cause narrowed, thickened arterial walls and decreases the elasticity of blood vessels.</p>
                                <p>More force is required to pump blood through diseased arteries, and this increased force is reflected in a higher blood pressure.</p>
                                <p>This increased work load results in left ventricular hypertrophy & decreased stroke volume with each contraction.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Tobacco use</strong>
                                <p>Tobacco use is a risk factor in coronary artery disease. Tobacco use decreases estrogen levels, placing premenopausal women at greater risk for coronary artery disease.</p>
                                <p>Nicotine in tobacco smoke causes catecholamine i.e. epinephrine, norepinephrine release. These neurohormones cause an increased heart rate, peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure.</p>
                                <p>These changes increase the cardiac workload necessitating greater myocardial oxygen consumpatiention.</p>
                                <p>Nicotine also increases platelet adhesion, which increases the risk of emboli formation. Carbon monoxide, a by-product of combustion found in tobacco smoke, affects oxygen, carrying capacity of hemoglobin by reducing the sites available for oxygen transport.</p>
                                <p>Thus the effects of an increased cardiac workload, combined with the oxygen depleting effect of carbon monoxide, decreases the oxygen available to the myocardium.</p>
                                <p>Carbon monoxide is also a chemical irritant thus causing injury to the endothelium.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Physical inactivity</strong>
                                <p>Physical inactivity implies a lack of adequate physical exercise on a regular basis. Examples of physical activity is brisk walking. Physically active people have increased HDL levels. Exercise enhances fibrinolytic activity thus reducing the risk of clot formation. Exercise training for those who are physically inactive decreases the risk of CAD through more efficient lipid metabolism, increased HDL production, and more efficient oxygen extraction by the working muscle groups thereby decreasing the cardiac workload.</p>
                                <p>For those individuals with CAD, regular physical activity reduces symptoms, improves functional capacity and improves other risk factors such as insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.</p>

                                <strong>Obesity</strong>
                                <p>Obesity is defined as a body mass index (MBI) of greater than $30 kg/m2$. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on weight & height. Obese persons may produce increased levels of LDLs & triglycerides which are strongly implicated in atherosclerosis.</p>
                                <p>As obesity increases, the heart size grows causing increased myocardial oxygen consumption. There is an increase in insulin resistance in obese individuals.</p>

                            <li>The pain maybe relieved by rest and vasodilation of the coronary arteries by medications such as nitroglycerin.</li>
                            <li>Angina is the clinical manifestation of myocardial ischemia.</li>
                            <li>When the demand for myocardia oxygen exceeds the ability of the coronary arteries to supply the heart with oxygen, myocardial ischemia occurs.</li>
                            <li>Either an increased demand for oxygen or a decreased supply of oxygen can lead to myocardial ischemia.</li>
                            <li>The primary reason for insufficient blood flow is narrowing of coronary arteries by atherosclerosis.</li>
                            <li>For Ischemia caused by atherosclerosis to occur, the artery is usually obstructed (stenosed)</li>
                            <li>On the cellular level, the myocardium becomes hypoxic within the $1^{st}$ 10 seconds of coronary occlusion.</li>
                            <li>With total occlusion of the coronary artery, contractility ceases after several minutes, depriving the myocardial cells of oxygen & glucose for aerobic metabolism.</li>
                            <li>Anaerobic metabolism begins and lactic acid accumulates.</li>
                            <li>Lactic acid irritates myocardial nerve fibers & transmits a pain message to the cardiac nerves and upper thoracic posterior nerve roots.</li>

                                <p>Refers to chest pain that occurs intermittently over a long period with the same pattern of onset, duration and intensity of symptoms.</p>
                                <p>The chest pain is described as constrictive, squeezing, heavy, chocking or suffocating sensation.</p>
                                <p>The pain radiates to various locations i.e. the jaw, shoulders, & down the arms. The pain usually lasts for a few minutes (5-15 minutes) and subsides when the precipitating factor is relieved.</p>

                                <p>Chest pain that occurs at rest, usually in response to spasm of a major coronary artery. The spasm may occur in the absence of CAD. Strong contraction (spam) of smooth muscle in the coronary artery results from increased intracellular calcium.</p>
                                <p>Factors precipitating coronary artery spasm include increased myocardial oxygen demand and increased levels of certain substances such as tobacco, smoke and histamines.</p>
                                <p>Calcium channel blockers i.e. nifedipine, amlodipine or nitrates (nitroglycerin) are used to control the angina.</p>

                                    <li>This is severe, immobilizing chest pain that is not relieved by rest, position change or nitrate administration.</li>
                                    <li>Pain is persistent and usually described as a heaviness, pressure, tightness, burning constriction or crushing.</li>
                                    <li>Common locations are sub-sternal and epigastric areas.</li>
                                    <li>The pain may radiate to the back, neck, jaw or arms.</li>
                                    <li>It may occur when the patient is active or at rest, a sleep or awake.</li>

                                    <li>Patients with diabetes may experience silent (asymptomatic) myocardial infarction due to cardiac neuropathy and present with a typical symptoms of dyspnea.</li>

                                <p>During the initial phase of myocardial infarction, the ischemic myocardial cells release catecholamine (norepinephrine & epinephrine) that are normally found in these cells.</p>
                                <p>This results in release of glycogen, diaphoresis and vasoconstriction of peripheral blood vessels.</p>

                                <p>In response to the release of catecholamine, blood pressure & heart rate may be elevated initially.</p>
                                <p>Later, blood pressure may drop because of decreased cardiac output. This may result in decreased renal perfusion & urine output. Presence of crackles suggest left ventricular dysfunction. Jugular venous distention, hepatic engorgement and peripheral edema may indicate right ventricular dysfunction.</p>

                                <p>The patient maybe nauseated & vomit. Nausea & vomiting can result from reflex stimulation of the vomiting center by the severe pain.</p>
                                <p>These symptoms can also result from vasovagal reflexes initiated from the area of the infarcted myocardium.</p>

                            <li>The body's response to cell death is the inflammatory process.</li>
                            <li>Within 24hrs, leukocytes infiltrate the area.</li>
                            <li>The dead cardiac cells release enzymes.</li>
                            <li>The proteolytic enzymes of the neutrophils and macrophages begin to remove necrotic tissue.</li>
                            <li>Catechoramine-meidated lipolysis & glycogenolysis occur.</li>
                            <li>This allows the increased plasma glucose & free tatty acids to be used by the oxygen depleted myocardium for anaerobic metabolism.</li>
                            <li>The collagen matrix is laid down to form scar tissue.</li>
                            <li>The scarred area is often less compliant than the surrounding fibers, and this condition is manifested by ventricular dysfunction or heart failure.</li>
                            <li>The normal myocardium hypertrophies and dilates in an attempt to compensate for the infarcted muscle, a process called ventricular remodeling.</li>
                            <li>Remodeling of normal myocardium can lead to the development of heart failure.</li>
