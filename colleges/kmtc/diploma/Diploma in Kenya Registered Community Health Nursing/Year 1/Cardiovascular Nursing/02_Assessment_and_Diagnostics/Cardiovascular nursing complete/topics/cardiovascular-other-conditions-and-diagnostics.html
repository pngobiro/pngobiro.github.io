                        <ul>
                            <li>Infective endocarditis occurs when blood flow turbulence within the heart allows the causative organisms to infect previously damaged valves or other endothelial surfaces.</li>
                            <li>The infection may spread locally and damage the valves or their supporting structures</li>
                            <li>This causes dysrhythmias, valve incompetence and eventual invasion of the myocardium leading to heart failure and sepsis.</li>

                                    <li>It is caused by diseases such as heavy alcohol intake, viral infection, e.g. influenza, chemotherapeutic drugs, thyrotoxicosis, myxedema genetic predisposition.</li>
                                    <li>Microscopic examination of the muscle tissue shows diminished contractile elements of the muscles fibers and diffuse necrosis of myocardial cells.</li>
                                    <li>The results are poor systolic function.</li>
                                    <li>The structural changes decrease the amount of blood ejected from the ventricles with systole, increasing the amount of blood remaining in the ventricle after contraction.</li>
                                    <li>Less blood is then able to enter the ventricles during diastole resulting to increased pulmonary and systemic venous pressures.</li>

                                    <li>The increased thickness of the heart muscles reduces the size of the ventricular cavities and causes the ventricles to take a longer time to relax after systole.</li>
                                    <li>The hypertrophied cardiac muscles cell are disorganized, oblique and perpendicular to each other decreasing the effectiveness of contractions and increasing the risk of dysrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia.</li>
                                    <li>In hypertrophied cardiomyopathy, the coronary arteriole walls are thickened which decreases the internal diameter of the arterioles.</li>
                                    <li>The narrow arterioles restrict the blood supply to the myocardium, causing numerous small areas of ischemia and necrosis.</li>

                        <p>The most common complication of hypertension are target organ diseases such as the following:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Hypertensive heart disease e.g.</strong>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Coronary artery disease</strong>-hypertension disrupts the coronary artery endothelium.
                                        <p>This disruption exposes the intimal layer to activated white blood cells and platelets. The changes in the artery result in a stiffened arterial wall and a narrowed internal lumen and account for a high incidence of coronary artery disease, angina and M.I</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Heart failure</strong>-occurs when the heart's compensatory adaptations are overwhelmed and the heart can no longer pump enough blood to meet the metabolic needs of the body. Contractility is depressed, smoke volume and cardiac output is decreased. The patient may complain of dyspnea, fatigue etc.:
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Cerebrovascular disease</strong>- high blood pressure predisposes one to development of stroke.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nephrosclerosis</strong>-hypertension needs to end stage renal disease.</li>
                            <li><strong>Retinal damage</strong>- high blood pressure cause damage to the retinal vessels manifested by blurring of vision, retinal hemorrhage and loss of vision.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MANAGEMENT</h3>
                        <p>Teach about lifestyle modification such as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Weight reduction</strong> of obese individuals to reduce the risk of hypertension.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consumption of low sodium diet</strong> to reduce the risk of hypertension</li>
                            <li><strong>Moderation of alcohol consumption</strong>-- reduce alcohol consumption to lower the risks of developing hypertension.</li>
                            <li><strong>Physical activity</strong>- engage in regular exercise several time a week to lower the risk of developing high blood pressure</li>
                            <li><strong>Avoidance of tobacco products</strong> such as cigarette smoke-it contains nicotine which causes vasoconstriction and high blood pressure</li>
                            <li>-Give diet rich in fruits, vegetable, and low fat dairy foods with reduced saturated fats to lower blood pressure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Advice the patient to regularly monitor blood pressure to ensure it is well maintained. Give antihypertensive drugs such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diuretics such as loop diuretics to control blood pressure</li>
                            <li>Beta blockers i.e. atenolol to lower blood pressure, vasodilators i.e. hydralazine to lower blood pressure.</li>
                            <li>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril</li>
                            <li>Teach patient and family members about compliance to treatment regimen and side effects.</li>

                        <p>The course of the catheter is followed with fluoroscopy and radiographs may be taken. An ECG is monitored on an oscilloscope. As the catheter tip passes through the chambers and vessels of the heart, blood pressure is monitored and blood samples are taken to study the oxygen content.</p>
                        <p>Many conditions may be accurately identified and assessed including congenital heart disease, tricuspid stenosis and valvular incompetence.</p>
