                        <p>The organized thrombi may detach and result in emboli. Turbulence of blood flow is a major contributing factor to embolization. The thrombus can become an embolus that flows through the venous circulation to the heart and lodges in the pulmonary circulation, becoming pulmonary emboli.</p>

                        <p>Pulmonary embolism. Chronic venous insufficiency which results from valvular destruction, allowing retrograde venous blood flow.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MANAGEMENT</h3>
                        <p>Preventive measure includes mobilization of patients that can ambulate. Turn patient on bed rest two hourly. Encourage patients to wear anti embolic stockings to increase venous blood flow velocity, prevent venous wall dilation and improve venous valve function.</p>
                        <p>Give anticoagulants to prevent clot formation or to prevent propagation of the clot and development of any new thrombi.</p>
                        <p>Examples of anticoagulants are vitamin k antagonists, warfarin etc. Instruct the patient to avoid constrictive clothing. Give a well-balanced diet including calcium and vitamin E as these affect coagulations. Encourage proper hydration to prevent additional hypercoagulability of the blood, which may occur with dehydration.</p>
                        <p>Encourage exercise as tolerated by the patient.</p>

                        <p>This is the inflammation i.e. (redness, tenderness warmth, mild edema) of a superficial vein without the presence of a thrombus (clot).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Embolism</h3>
                        <p>An abnormal condition in which an embolus travels through the blood stream and become lodged in a blood vessel. Symptoms vary with the character of the embolus, the degree of occlusion that results and the size, nature and location of the occluded vessel.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Atherosclerosis</h3>
                        <p>A common disorder characterized by yellowish plague of cholesterol, other lipids and cellular debris in the inner layers of the walls of arteries. It usually occurs with aging & is often associated with tobacco use, obesity, hypertension, elevated low density lipoprotein and depressed high density lipoprotein levels, and diabetes mellitus. The condition begins as a fatty streak and gradually builds to a fibrous plague or atheromatous lesion. The vessel walls become thick, fibrotic and calcified & the lumen narrows, resulting in reduced blood flow to organs normally supplied by the artery. The plague eventually creates a risk for thrombosis & is one of the major causes of coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, Myocardial infarction etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Arteriosclerosis</h3>
                        <p>A disorder characterized by thickening, loss of elasticity and calcification of aerial walls. It results in decreased blood supply to the cerebrum, & lower extremities. The condition develops with aging & in hypertension, diabetes mellitus etc.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Gangrene</h3>
                        <p>Necrosis or death of tissue, due to ischemia or bacterial invasion. It occurs as a complication of diabetes mellitus where the lower extremities become gangrenous.</p>
