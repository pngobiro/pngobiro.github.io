                        <p>Rheumatic fever is caused by group A streptococcal bacterium which causes pharyngitis.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Following infection of the pharyngeal and tonsils with streptococcal bacteria, the body forms immunologic response to group A streptococcal cell membrane antigen.</li>
                            <li>Rheumatic fever affects the heart, skin, joints and central nervous system.</li>
                            <li>Rheumatic endocarditis occurs in the valves, with swelling and erosion of the valve leaflets.</li>
                            <li>Deposits of fibrin and blood cells in areas of erosion occurs in the valves.</li>
                            <li>Valve leaflets may fuse and become thickened or calcified, resulting in stenosis.</li>
                            <li>Reduction in the mobility of valve leaflets may occur with failure of the leaflets to close properly, resulting in regurgitation.</li>
                            <li>The mitral and aortic valves are most commonly affected.</li>
                            <li>Myocardial involvement is characterized by nodules formed by a reaction to inflammation with swelling and destruction of collagen fibers.</li>
                            <li>With time, the nodules become more fibrous, and scar tissue forms in the myocardium.</li>
                            <li>Rheumatic pericarditis develops and affects both layers of the pericardium. The layers become thickened.</li>
                            <li>The lesions of rheumatic fever are systemic and involve the skin, joints and central nervous system.</li>
                            <li>Painless subcutaneous nodules, arthritis may develop.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical manifestations</h3>
                        <p><strong>Carditis</strong> (inflammation of endocardium, myocardium & pericardium) This is manifested by a heart murmur of mitral or aortic regurgitation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Arthritis</strong> - Inflammation of joints whereby synovial membranes of joints are affected causing swelling, redness, tenderness, & limitation of motion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chorea</strong> is a central nervous system manifestation which is characterized by involuntary movements of the face and limbs, muscle weakness and disturbance of speech and gait.</p>
                        <p><strong>Erythema marginatum</strong> which are lesions occurring on the trunk and proximal extremities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Subcutaneous nodules</strong> - are firm small hard painless swellings located over extensor surfaces of joints such as the knees, wrists and elbows.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fever</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Polyarthralgia</strong> ( painful joints ).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications of Rheumatic fever</h3>
                        <p><strong>Chronic rheumatic carditis</strong> - results from changes in valvular structure. Rheumatic endocarditis result in fibrous tissue growth in valve leaflets with scarring and contractures. Valves most affected are the mitral, aortic and tricuspid.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Drug therapy</h4>
                        <p>Antibiotic therapy eliminates residual group A streptococcal bacteria remaining in the tonsils and pharynx. They also prevent the spread of organisms to close contacts. Examples of antibiotics is Amoxicillin. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids are the anti-inflammatory agents most widely used in the management of rheumatic fever.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Nursing Management</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Health educate patient about preventive measures such as early detection and immediate treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.</li>
                            <li>Administrative medications i.e. antibiotics such as penicillin.</li>
                            <li>Teach patient the importance of drug compliance.</li>
                            <li>Administer NSAIDs & corticosteroids as prescribed.</li>
                            <li>Monitor fluid intake & output as appropriate.</li>
                            <li>Promote rest periods between activities to reduce the cardiac workload and diminish the metabolic needs of the body.</li>
                            <li>Position painful joints for comfort and proper alignment.</li>
                            <li>Teach about a well-balanced diet and hygiene practices to promote patient’s well being.</li>
                            <li>Teach patient to seek medical attention if symptoms such as excessive fatigue, dizziness, palpitations or dyspnea develop.</li>

                            <li>However, they also occur in adults due to cardiovascular disease, Aids and the use of antiparkinsonian drugs.</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>Rheumatic endocarditis causes scarring of the valve leaflets. Contractures and adhesions develop between the junctional areas. The stenotic mitral valve takes on a "fish mouth" shape because of the thickening and shortening of the mitral valve structures. These structural deformities cause obstruction of blood flow and create a pressure difference between the left atrium of the left ventricle during diastole. Left atria pressure and volume increase. This causes higher pulmonary vasculature pressure and then hypertrophy of the pulmonary vessels.</p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>Chest pain from decreased cardiac output and coronary perfusion</li>
                            <li>Seizures or stroke from emboli which can arise from blood stasis in the left atrium due to atrial fibrillation</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Mitral valve regurgitation</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Etiology</h4>

                            <li>Myocardial infarction</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>NB/ Mitral valve is situated between the left atrium and the left ventricle. It has two cusps. Mitral valve allows blood to flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle but prevents blood from flowing back into the atrium.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h4>
                        <p>Mitral valve regurgitation allows blood to flow backward from the left ventricle to the left atrium due to incomplete valve closure during systole. The left ventricle and left atrium both work harder to preserve an adequate cardiac output. This additional volume results to left atria enlargement, left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy & decrease in cardiac output.</p>
