                        <p>In heart failure, the overloaded heart resorts to compensatory mechanisms to try to maintain adequate cardiac output. The main compensatory mechanisms include:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                <strong>Sympathetic nervous system activation</strong>
                                <p>In response to an inadequate stroke volume and cardiac output, there is increased sympathetic nervous system activation, resulting in the increased release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). This results in increased heart rate, increased myocardial contractility and peripheral vasoconstriction.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Neuro hormonal response</strong>
                                <p>As the cardiac output falls, blood flow to the kidney decreases. This is sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidneys as decreased volume. In response, the kidneys release renin which converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is subsequently converted to angiotensin II by a converting enzyme made in the lungs. Angiotensin II causes the following:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, which results in sodium and water retention</li>
                                    <li>Increased peripheral vasoconstriction, which increases blood pressure.</li>
                                    <li>This response is known as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system cascade.</li>
                                    <li>Low cardiac output causes a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure.</li>
                                    <li>The posterior pituitary gland then secretes antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin.</li>
                                    <li>ADH increases water reabsorption in the renal tubules, causing water retention and therefore increased blood volume.</li>
                                    <li>As a result, blood volume is increased in a person who is already volume overloaded.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <strong>Dilation</strong>
                                <p><dfn id="term-dilation">Dilation</dfn> is an enlargement of the chambers of the heart. It occurs when pressure in the heart chambers is elevated overtime. The muscle fibers of the heart stretch in response to the volume of blood in the heart at the end of diastole. The degree of stretch is directly related to the force of the contraction (systole). This increased contraction initially leads to increased cardiac output and maintenance of arterial blood pressure and perfusion. Dilation starts as an adaptive mechanism to cope with increasing blood volume. Eventually this mechanism becomes inadequate because the elastic elements of the muscle fibers are overstretched and can no longer contract effectively, thereby decreasing the cardiac output.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Hypertrophy</strong>
                                <p><dfn id="term-hypertrophy">Hypertrophy</dfn> is an increase in the muscle mass and cardiac wall thickness in response to overwork and strain. It occurs slowly because it takes time for this increased muscle tissue to develop. Hypertrophy follows persistent/chronic dilation and thus further increases the contractile power of the muscle fibers. This will lead to an increase in cardiac output and maintenance of tissue perfusion.</p>
                                <p>NB: Cardiac compensation occurs when compensatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining an adequate cardiac output that is needed for tissue perfusion. Cardiac decompensation occurs when these mechanisms can no longer maintain adequate cardiac output and inadequate tissue perfusion results.</p>

                                    <li>It is caused by the reabsorption of fluid from dependent body areas when the patient is recumbent. The patient awakens in a panic, has feelings of suffocation, and has a strong desire to seek relief by sitting up</li>
                                    <li>The patient develops adaptive behavior such as sleeping with two or more pillows to aid breathing</li>

                                <p>This is accumulation of fluid in the tissues. It may occur in dependent body areas (peripheral edema), liver (Hepatomegaly), abdominal cavity (ascites) and lungs (pulmonary edema and pleural effusion). If the patient is in bed, sacral and scrotal edema may develop.</p>

                                <p>Heart failure with decreased cardiac output causes impaired renal perfusion and decreased urinary output during the day. However, when the patient lies down at night, fluid movement from interstitial spaces back into the circulatory system is enhanced. This causes increased renal blood flow and diuresis. The patient may complain of having to void 6 or 7 times during the night.</p>

                                <p>The skin of people with heart failure may appear dusky. This is because tissue capillary oxygen extraction is increased. The skin may also be cool and damp to the touch. The lower extremities are shiny and swollen, with diminished or absent hair growth.</p>

                                <p>Chronic heart failure causes enlargement of the chambers of the heart. This enlargement (stretching of the atrial and ventricular tissues) may causes an alteration in the normal electrical pathway, especially in the atria. Numerous sites in the atria fire spontaneously and rapidly (atrial fibrillation), and the organized spread of atrial depolarization (contraction or systole) no longer occurs. Atrial fibrillation also promotes thrombus formation within the atria which may break loose and form emboli. This puts the patients at risk for developing stroke.</p>

                                <p>Loop diuretics e.g. furosemide (Lasix) is administered. Mechanism of action of furosemide is that it acts in the kidneys to stimulate excretion of sodium chloride and water. This decreases venous return (preload) thereby reducing the amount of volume returned to the left ventricle during diastole. By decreasing venous return to the left ventricle and thereby reducing pre-load the left ventricle may contract more efficiently and improve cardiac output. This increases left ventricular function, decreases pulmonary vascular pressures and improves gas exchange. side effects - reduction in serum potassium levels, ototoxicity.</p>

                                <strong>Vasodilators</strong>
                                <p>Vasodilators reduce circulating volume by decreasing pre-load. They also increase coronary artery circulation by dilating the coronary arteries. Thus they reduce pre-load and increases myocardial oxygen supply. They therefore improve myocardial contraction, increases cardiac output and reduces pulmonary congestion. Examples of vasodilators are nitroglycerin (given iv, sodium nitroprusside (Nipride) (given iv). nursing responsibilities when giving vasodilators are: Assess blood pressure before administration and continuously during administration. Too rapid rate of I.V administration can reduce blood pressure too quickly therefore, it should be administered slowly.</p>

                                <p>The conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin II requires the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ACE inhibitors act by blocking this enzyme resulting in decreased levels of angiotensin II. As a result, plasma aldosterone levels are also reduced.

                            <li>Causes of digitalis toxicity include hypokalemia due to the use of potassium - depleting diuretics such as loop diuretics (Lasix)</li>
                            <li>Low serum potassium enhances the action of digitalis, causing a therapeutic dose to achieve toxic levels</li>
                            <li>Hyperkalemia, inhibits the action of digitalis causing a therapeutic dose to become sub therapeutic</li>
                            <li>Thus monitoring serum potassium levels of patients receiving digitalis preparations and potassium depleting and potassium sparing diuretics is essential</li>
