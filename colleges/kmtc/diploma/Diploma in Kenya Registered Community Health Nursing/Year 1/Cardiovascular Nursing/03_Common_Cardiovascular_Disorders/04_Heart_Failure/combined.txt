\section*{CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE}

Def: Congestive cardiac failure is a clinical syndrome resulting from a structural or fxnal cardiac disorder with impaired ability of the ventricles to fill or eject blood at a rate commensurate to the body's metabolic demands.

\section*{Epidemiology}

Heart failure is frequently due to coronary artery disease. The prevalence rises from about 1\% at $50-59 \mathrm{yrs}$ to between $5-10 \%$ at $80-89 \mathrm{yrs}$.
In the UK, most of the patients with heart failure are > 65yrs. Congestive cardiac failure carries a poor prognosis with about $50 \%$ of patients with LV dysfxn dying within 2 yrs of diagnosis. Many of the patients with CCF die from:-
- Sudden cardiac dysarrhythmias
- Myocardial dysfxn

\section*{Aetiology of CCF}
- Pump Failure
- Muscle dysfxn; IHD, Cardiomyopathy, poisons.
- Restricted filling; mitral stenosis, pericarditis, cardiac tamponade.
- Heart rate abnormality
- Excess preload
- Regurgitant valves
- High output states; anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, thiamine deficiency.
- Chronic Excess after Load
- Long standing HTN
- Others
- infections
- electrolyte imbalance

\section*{Precipitants of heart failure}
1. Anaemia
2. Infections including pneumonia and infective endocarditis
3. Uncontrolled HTN
4. Uncontrolled hyperglyceamia
5. Thyrotoxicosis -patients with heart failure must have the thyroid gland examined
6. Excessive exercise
7. Drugs - NSAIDS, steroids, Ca CBs
8. Pulmonary embolism
9. Patients already on medication (for CCF) and are non- compliant
10. Substance abuse
11. A new MI
12. Pregnancy
13. Arrhythmias
14. Electrolyte imbalance of whatever cause

\section*{Pathophysiology}

The pathophysiologic changes are usually due to overwhelmed compensatory mechanisms for the heart to meet the body's metabolic demands. The pathology results from:-
i) Haemodynamic changes
- Decreased output due to systolic dysfxn and decreased filling due to diastolic dysfxn
- The ejection fraction; a measure of EDV is decreased in systolic dysfxn as occurs in decreased ventricular contractility like MI, myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy.
- Systolic dysfxn also occurs in ventricular outflow obstruction (pressure overload) as in HTN,AS, PS, or it can occur in ventricular inflow obstruction as in MS, TS or in ventricular volume overload like in MR, AR, VSD \& ASD.
- Diastolic dysfxn results from impaired relaxation. In normal physiology, the heart's filling is passive, mostly from the normal atria. A second filling; atrial kick also brings residual blood into the heart.
- The early/atrial kick ratio is normally greater than one (1) or 2 but in diastolic dysfxn, the E.A ratio (measured using echo) is $<1$. In diastolic dysfxn, the ejection fraction is normal and CO may be initially normal but with time, LV end diastolic pressure is shifted to the left leading to CCF.
- Diastolic dysfxn can occur in:-
- Constrictive pericarditis
- Restrictive cardiomyopathy
- LVH
- Cardiac tamponade
ii) Neurohormonal changes

A fall in cardiac output usually activates counter regulatory neurohormonal mechanisms that in normal physiological circumstances would support cardiac fxn.
Stimulation of the RAAS leads to vasoconstriction, salt and water retention, and sympathetic activation mediated by angiotensin II, which is a potent constrictor of arterioles both in the kidney and systemic circulation. This may initially maintain cardiac output through increased myocardial contractility, HR and peripheral vasoconstriction. But prolonged sympathetic stimulation leads to cardiac myocyte apoptosis, hypertrophy and focal myocardial necrosis.
Salt and water retention is promoted by the release of aldosterone, endothelin, severe heart failure and ADH. Natriuretic peptides act as physiological antagonists to the fluid conserving effect of aldosterone.
iii) Cellular changes and remodelling

After myocardial infarction, cardiac contractility is impaired and neurohormonal activation may lead to hypertrophy of non -infarcted segments, with thinning, dilatation and expansion of the infarcted segment (remodelling). This may lead to further deterioration in ventricular fxn and worsening heart failure.
Remodelling leads to changes in calcium handling, adrenergic receptors, contractile apparatus and myocyte structure.
NB: Mediators of cardiac remodelling
i) Norepinephrine and epinephrine (toxic to the heart muscles)
ii) Aldosterone
iii) ADH
iv) Cytokines - These are secreted by macrophages, lymphocytes, monocytes which release IL and TNF that are important in the cycle of myocyte hypertrophy and cell death.
IL - 1 may accelerate myocyte hypertrophy, endothelin is a potent vasconstrictor and excessive endothelin release may be responsible for pulmonary arterial HTN and LVF. It's also associated with myocyte growth and deposition of matrix.

\section*{Clinical syndromes of heart failure}
1. Left ventricular failure
2. Right ventricular failure
3. Systolic heart failure - inadequate cardiac or forward failure.
4. Diastolic heart failure ( backward failure)
5. High output failure - associated with high cardiac output ( A-V shunt, beriberi, severe anaemia or thyrotoxicosis) and elevation in pulmonary venous pressure.
6. Biventricular heart failure (Lt +Rt ventricular failure)
7. Acute and chronic heart failure

\section*{Presentation}

S + S are not sensitive and specific and include:
- Dyspnoea, fatigue due to fluid retention.
- Pulmonary or peripheral oedema due to fluid retention. Patient could even have anarsaca.
- Orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea or nocturnal cough with sputum production.
- Wheeze (cardiac asthma)
- Weight loss and muscle wasting ( cardiac cachexia)
- In RVF - patient has peripheral oedema or anarsaca, abdominal distension due to ascites, breathlessness, nausea, anorexia, facial engorgement, pulsation in the neck.

\section*{Framingham clinical criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure:}

\section*{Major criteria}
1. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND) -Depression of resp. centre makes patient wake up at night once $\mathrm{PaO}_{2}$ levels fall. PND is also called cardiac asthma.
2. Orthopnoea - redistribution of retained fluid leads to increase in venous return to the heart.
NB: The above 2 features occur with fluid retention.
3. Elevated JVP
4. Rales or crackles
5. Cardiomegally on CXR
6. $\mathrm{S}_{3}$ gallop
7. Plain pulmonary oedema on CXR
8. Weight loss of $>4.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ in 5 days in response to treatment for heart failure.

\section*{Minor criteria}
1. Bilateral leg oedema
2. Nocturnal cough
3. Dyspnoea on ordinary exertion
4. Hepatomegally
5. Pleural effusion
6. Tachycardia $>120 / \mathrm{min}$
7. Weight loss $>4.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ in 5 days in response to treatment.

\section*{Diagnosis of heart failure}

2Major criteria or
1Major and 2 minor
Diagnosis of heart failure is usually made from:-

\section*{1. History}
i) Precipitants must be looked for in the history
ii) Look for the underlying cause
- Identify the cause and if reversible correct it and the patient will be fine.
- Congenital valvular lesions
- Symptoms of heart failure from childhood.
- Recurrent admissions from childhood
- Failure to thrive

v) CXR - for Framingham classification to rule out underlying pathology; cardiomyopathy, ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary oedema, pericardial effusion or pleural effusion.
- Kerley ABC lines -linear opacities seen on CXR in patients with pulmonary oedema.
- Kerley A lines - longer, at least 2 cm , unbranching, crossing diagonally from periphery to hilar in the inner $1 / 2$ of lungs. Are due to distension of anastomotic channels between periphery \& central channels.

7. BNP - Cardiac myocyte necrosis
-Is an expensive test
-A normal plasma level excludes heart failure

\section*{Stages of heart failure (structural)}

Stage A - A patient who has risk factors for heart failure e.g DM, smoking etc, but has no structural heart disease or symptoms
Stage B- A patient with a structural heart dz e.g cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease but is asymptomatic.

\section*{Classification of severity for heart failure}

\section*{The New York heart association classification}

This usually indicates the class or degree of heart failure, associated symptoms and activity limitation.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Class / degree & Symptoms and activity limitation \\
\hline Class I - None & No symptoms from ordinary activity \\
\hline Class II - Mild HF & \begin{tabular}{l}
Comfortable at rest or during mild exertion. \\
Dyspnoea on ordinary activity
\end{tabular} \\
\hline Class III - Mod. HF & Symptomatic with any activity \\
\hline Class IV - Severe HF & Symptoms at rest - confined to bed or chair \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Management of heart failure Aims}
- To reduce symptoms
- To reduce morbidity
- To improve the quality of life
A. Quick assessment of patient
- Resuscitate patient with decompensated HF (patient with rapidly developing cardiogenic pulmonary oedema).
- Prop up patient
- Give oxygen while checking $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation
- I.V frusemide (slowly) is more effective than oral; larger doses are required in renal failure.
- Opiates -Sedates patient, decrease anxiety and helps patient meet metabolic needs.
- Nitrates especially if systolic BP $\geq 100 \mathrm{mmHg}$
B. Non pharmacological management
1. Correct all precipitants
2. Lifestyle modification
- Comply with medications
- Salt restriction ( $2 \mathrm{~g} /$ day )
- Alcohol ceasation
- Stop smoking
- Exercise training for ambulatory patients
- Limit fluid intake (input /output chart) to avoid hyponatraemia.
3. Look for underlying cause and treat or modify.
- HTN - optimize anti - HTN regime
- DM - control sugars
- Manage any coronary syndromes
- Arrhythmias - anticoagulate

Pharmacotherapy
- Manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
I) Asymptomatic LV systolic dysfxn
- ACE -I
- Health education
- Risk factors
- Rx precipitants
II) Symptomatic LV systolic failure
1. Start with loop diuretics
- Frusemide 40 mg - 80 mg preferably as OD dose, all at once rather than divided doses.
- Frusemide gives symptomatic relief of fluid retention.
- Monitor U/E, weight loss $1 \mathrm{~kg} /$ day. Frusemide is a rapid response drug, if patient not losing weight, change to thiazide diuretic preferably I.V.
2. ACE - I - Consider in all patients with LV systolic dysfxn

ACE -I commonly used
- Captoprill
- Lisinopril
- Enalapril

ACE -I - Improves heart failure symptoms
- Prolongs life
- Reduces mortality

Principles
- Response is immediate
- Once patient is losing fluid, no worsening of symptoms.
- Start with a low dose slowly

Enalapril $10-20 \mathrm{mg}$ BD
Captopril 6.25 mg TID max 50 mg
Lisinopril 5 mg OD - max 40 mg OD
Over 1-2 wks - you can double the dose to the max dose depending on response.
Monitor -cough - usually due to increased bradykinin levels
If patient develops uncontrollable cough, change to ARB
U/E - Hyperkalemia, azotemia. Candesartan, valsartan (ARBs) tested and found to be good but do not give in patients with MI.

ARBs usually reserved for patients intolerant of ACE-I.
3. B - Blockers - only given when patient is generally stable and the BP is good.

CI - Asthma
- COPD
- Hypotension
- $2^{\text {nd }}$ or $3^{\text {rd }}$ degree heart block, bradycardia \& sinus syndrome.

BB commonly used:
- Carvedilol - beta and alpha blocker, anti -oxidant
- Metoprolol (selective $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ )
- Bisoprolol
- Nevibolol

BB - Improve LV ejection fraction \& survival in patients with symptomatic LV dysfxn.
Always start at a low dose and titrate to target max doses e.g.
Carvedilol 3.125 mg BD - $25-50 \mathrm{mg}$ BD
Bisoprolol 1.25 mg OD - decreased $5-10 \mathrm{mg}$ OD
Metoprolol 12.5 mg OD - max 25 mg
NB: $1^{\text {st }}$ one month, patient may get worsening of symptoms because of sympathetic effect which is blocked.
Long term effect - down regulation alters over time.
The effects are usually long term, not short term.
4. ARB - Can be used as substitute to $\mathrm{ACE}-\mathrm{I}$ or as an adl on therapy in HF.
5. Aldosterone blockers / antagonists
- Spironolactone - indicated if low ejection fraction $<40 \%$
- Dose 25-50mg daily
- It improves endothelial dysfxn (nitric oxide bioavailability) and prevents remodelling
- Decreases mortality by 30\%
- Is $\mathrm{K}^{+}$sparing
- Eplerenone $25-50 \mathrm{mg}$ OD - New York heart association class III.
6. Digoxin - for purely heart failure, start with low dose digoxin 0.125 mg OD.
- It reduces rate of hospitalization
- Offers symptomatic relief benefits
- Good at controlling fibrillation
- No mortality benefits

NB: No significant improvement in survival rates.
7. Vasodilators
- Nitrates together with hydrallazine (combination);
- Indications - failure to control symptoms with all above drugs.
- Hydrallazine 25 mg tid plus
- Isosorbide nitrate 40 mg tid

The combination of hydrallazine \& nitrate has more benefits in blacks than whites.
- Provides an alternative in patients with ACE -I intolerance or those who may require additional therapy for BP.
- Reduces mortality in symptomatic patients ( mortality benefit)
- Reduces rate of hospitalization
- Improves quality of life
D) Management of refractory heart failure
- Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD.

\section*{Indications}
- After cardiac arrest
- Ventricular tachycardia that is defibrillating
- Lt ventricular assists device indications include;
- Very slow ejection fraction < 30\%
- Severe myocardial infarction
- If nothing is working then consider heart transplant.

\section*{Diastolic heart failure}

Management - manage underlying cause
- Use drugs that manage fluid retention ( diuretics)

HEART FAILURE

\section*{Introduction:}
-Definition: It is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac disorders that impair the ability of ventricles to fill or eject blood (to meet the metabolic needs of the body) [Hinkle \& Cheever, 2014]
- Fluid buildup in the heart from myocardium that can't provide sufficient cardiac output
- Usually occurs in a damaged left ventricle but may occur in right ventricle, either primarily or secondary to left-sided heart failure
- Heart failure (HF) was referred to congestive heart/Cardiac failure (CHF or CCF) due to many patients present with pulmonary or peripheral congestion with oedema
- Currently, HF is recognized as clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of fluid overload or inadequate tissue perfusion
- Fluid overload and decreased tissue perfusion occurs when heart cannot generate sufficient cardiac output(CO) to meet body's demand for oxygen and nutrients
- In heart failure, impaired contraction of the heart (systolic dysfunction) or filling of the heart (diastolic dysfunction) may cause pulmonary or systemic congestion

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Given according to the cause:
- Left-sided verses right-sided failure
- Systolic or diastolic failure
- Low-output or high output failure
- Acute or chronic failure
- Forward or backward failure

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Left-sided Heart Failure:
$\checkmark$ Pumping ability of the left ventricle fails and cardiac output falls
$\checkmark$ Blood backs up in the left atrium and lungs, causing pulmonary congestion and decreased cardiac output.
$\checkmark$ Causes include: hypertension, myocardial infarction of left ventricle, or valvular heart disease
- Right-sided Heart Failure: (Cor pulmonale)
$\checkmark$ Ineffective contractile function of the right ventricle leads to blood backing up into the right atrium, in the vena cava and the peripheral circulation (venous system), which results in peripheral edema and engorgement of the kidneys and other organs.
$\checkmark$ Causes include: severe pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction of right ventricle.

\section*{Systolic or diastolic failure}

\section*{Systolic heart failure:}
- Due to ventricle failure to contract adequately to eject enough blood through aorta into arterial system. Causes decreased ventricular blood ejection
- Caused by loss of myocardial cells in ischemia, myocardial infarction (contractile dysfunction), cardiomyopathy or inflammations, increased afterload (hypertension), mechanical abnormalities (e.g. valvular disease)
- manifested in effects of low CO e.g. weakness, fatigue, exercise intolerance
$>$ Over time, it causes left ventricle dilatation and hypertrophy

\section*{Diastolic heart failure:}
- Occurs when heart is unable to completely relax (stiffness and non-compliant heart muscle) in diastole, thus disrupts normal filling
- Passive diastole filling decreases thereby decreasing stroke volume and cardiac output, but increases atrial contraction to preload
- Diastolic function occurs from chronic hypertension ( most common), decreased ventricular compliance due to hypertrophy, and impaired heart muscle contraction
- Manifested by dyspnoea, tachypnoea, respiratory crackles in if left ventricle affected and pulmonary hypertension. Neck vein distension, liver enlargement, anorexia, nausea, if right ventricle is affected

\section*{Low-output VS high-output failure: \\ -Low-output failure}
- Develops when there is a decrease in the biventricular output resulting from: coronary heart disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and other primary cardiac disorders.
-High-output failure (increased/normal cardiac output)
- Hypermetabolic states increases CO to maintain blood flow and O2 to tissues
- This activates compensatory mechanisms to increase CO thus further increasing O2 demand
- Though high CO, the heart is unable to meet increased demands of the tissues and thus fails
- Causes include: septicemia, anaemia, hyperthyroidism or AV shunting

\section*{Acute VS chronic failure:}
-Acute failure: it's life-threatening and occurs abruptly resulting from myocardial injury e.g. massive myocardial infarction manifested by sudden decrease in cardiac function and signs of decreased CO. Manifests as pulmonary oedema and congestion
- Chronic failure: progressive (gradual) decline or deterioration of heart muscle, which allows compensatory mechanisms to come into play. It causes decreased cardiac output.
$\checkmark$ Causes include: cardiomyopathies, valvular disease, or coronary heart disease (CHD)

\section*{Pathophysiology of Compensatory mechanism leading to heart failure}
- There are three primary compensatory mechanisms are:
1. The Frank-Starling mechanism: that is, the greater the stretch of the cardiac muscle, the greater the force of contraction. This increases contractile force thereby increasing CO. Complications include: increased myocardial demand; limited by overstretching.

\section*{pathophysiology}
2. Neuroendocrine response including activation of SNS and RAAS
- Decreased CO induces SNS and catecholamine release, thereby increasing HR, BP, contractility, vascular resistance and venous return.
- Complications include: tachycardia, decreased filling time, low CO, increased vascular resistance, increased myocardial work and O2 demand

\section*{pathophysiology}
- Decreased CO and renal perfusion induce reninangiotensin system. This causes vasoconstriction and increased BP. Complications include: increased myocardial work, renal vasoconstriction, and decreased renal perfusion
- ACE converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which stimulates aldosterone release from renal cortex resulting in salt and water retention by kidneys, and increased vascular volume overload and vasoconstriction, increasing BP and afterload. Complications include: increased preload and afterload; pulmonary congestion; increased stress on ventricular wall (increased cardiac work-load).

\section*{pathophysiology}
- ADH is released from neurohypophysis, which inhibits water excretion; while atrial natriuretic factor that is released from the heart increases Na excretion and diuresis. Complications include; fluid retention and increased preload and afterload
- Blood flow is redistributed to vital organs (heart and brain) thereby decreasing perfusion of other organ systems, skin and muscles. Complications include: renal failure, anaerobic metabolism, and lactic acidosis.

\section*{pathophysiology}
3. Ventricular hypertrophy:
- Increased cardiac workload causes myocardial muscle to hypertrophy and ventricles to dilate.
- This in turn leads to increased contractile force to maintain CO.
- This effect complicates into: increased myocardial O2 demand and cellular enlargement
- The enlarged myocardial cells become dysfunctional and die early (apoptosis), thus leading to low CO.

\section*{causes}
- Mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, or atrial fibrillation
- Mitral and aortic insufficiency
- Arrhythmias
- Hypertension
- Atherosclerosis with myocardial infarction (MI)
- Myocarditis
- Ventricular and atrial septal defects
causes
- Endocarditis
- Pregnancy
- Thyrotoxicosis
- Pulmonary embolism
- Infections
- Anaemia
- Emotional
- Increased sodium or water intake
- Renal failure

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril
- Angiotensin-receptor blockers, such as losartan, valsartan, and irbesartan to prevent action of angiotensin II and produce vasoconstriction and increased salt and water excretion. Full effect experienced after 3-6 weeks.
- Calcium channel blockers, such as amiodipine, felodipine, nefedipine, verapamil to block movement of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}++$ into cells, causing vasodilation and decreased HR, conractility and systemic vascular resistance
-Potassium -sparing diuretics e.g. amiloride and spilonolactone (Aldactone) for exchange of $\mathrm{K}+$ and $\mathrm{Na}+$ in distal renal tubules and reduce excretion of $\mathrm{K}+, \mathrm{H}+, \mathrm{Ca}++$ and $\mathrm{Mg}++$
- Beta-adrenergic blockers, such as atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol (inderal) and carvedilol
- Anticoagulants, such as warfarin
- Morphine- decreases preload and afterload in acute decompesated heart failure and pulmonary oedema, dilates pulmonary and systemic blood vessels.

\section*{HEART FAILURE}

\section*{Definition:}

It's the pathophysiologic state in which impaired cardiac function is unable to maintain an adequate circulation for the metabolic needs of the tissues of the body, which may be acute or chronic.

The term congestive heart failure (CHF) is used for the chronic form of heart failure in which the patient has evidence of congestion of peripheral circulation and of lungs.

\section*{AETIOLOGY AND MECHANISMS}

Heart failure may be caused by one or in combination of the following factors,
1. INTRINSIC PUMP FAILURE
2. INCREASED WORKLOAD ONTHE HEART
3. IMPAIRED FILLING OF CARDIAC CHAMBERS.

\section*{1.INTRINSIC PUMP FAILURE}
- weakening of the ventricular muscle due to disease so that the heart fails to act as an efficient pump is the most common and most important cause of heart failure
- Diseases responsible for this are;-
1) Ischaemic heart disease
2) Myocarditis
3) Cardiomyopathies
4) Metabolic disorders e.g. beriberi
5) Disorders of the rhythm e.g. atrial fibrillation and flutt

\section*{Ischaemic heart disease}
- Ischemic heart disease develops when cholesterol particles in the blood begin to accumulate on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form.
- These deposits narrow the arteries and eventually block the flow of blood.
- This decrease in blood flow reduces the amount of oxygen supplied to the heart muscle.

\section*{Ischemic Heart Disease}

\section*{Myocarditis}
- Refers to an inflammatory response within the myocardium that is not secondary to ischemic events or cardiac rejection in the setting of transplantation
- The presence of myocyte necrosis triggered by viruses and augmented by autoimmunity is believed to be behind the whole process
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_28_d0d81d2c030cd114a743g-10.jpg?height=1660&width=1391&top_left_y=66&top_left_x=54)

\section*{Myocarditis}

Inflammation of heart muscle

\section*{Cardiomyopathies}
- any structural or functional disease of heart muscle that is marked especially by enlargement of the heart, by hypertrophy of cardiac muscle, or by rigidity and loss of flexibility of the heart walls and that may be idiopathic or attributable to a specific cause (such as heart valve disease, untreated high blood pressure, or viral infection

\section*{Types of Cardiomyopathy}

There are three main types of cardiomyopathydilated, hypertrophic, and restrictive. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the ventricles enlarge. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the walls of the ventricles thicken and become stiff. In restrictive cardiomyopathy, the walls of the ventricles become stiff, but not necessarily thickened.

Restrictive Cardiomyopathy

Dilated
Cardiomyopathy

\section*{2. INCREASED WORKLOAD ON THE HEART.}
- Increased mechanical load on the heart results in increased myocardial demand resulting in myocardial failure.
- Increased load on the heart may be in the form of
1. Increased pressure load
2. Increased volume load

\section*{Increased pressure load}
- Due to:
a) Systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
b) Valvular disease e.g. mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis,
c) pulmonary stenosis.
d) Chronic lung diseases

\section*{Increased volume load}
- occurs when a ventricle is required to eject more than normal volume of the blood resulting in cardiac failure
- Maybe seen in:
a) Valvular insufficiency
b) Severe anaemia
c) Thyrotoxicosis
d) Arteriovenous shunts
e) Hypoxia due to lung diseases.

\section*{3. IMPAIRED FILLING OF CARDIAC CHAMBERS}
- Decreased cardiac output and cardiac failure may result from extra-cardiac causes or defect in filling of the heart:
a) Cardiac tamponade e.g.
a) haemopericardium,
b) hydropericardium
b) Constrictive pericarditis.

\section*{Cardiac tamponade}
- Cardiac tamponade, also known as pericardial tamponade, is when fluid in the pericardium (the sac around the heart) builds up, resulting in compression of the heart
- Common causes of cardiac tamponade include cancer, kidney failure, chest trauma, myocardial infarction, and pericarditis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_28_d0d81d2c030cd114a743g-18.jpg?height=1210&width=1984&top_left_y=543&top_left_x=360)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_28_d0d81d2c030cd114a743g-19.jpg?height=1698&width=2227&top_left_y=66&top_left_x=184)

\section*{Constrictive pericarditis.}
- Constrictive pericarditis occurs when the pericardium (a thin tissue sac that surrounds the heart) becomes thickened and scarred.
- This can make it difficult for the heart to expand with blood.

\section*{TYPES OF HEART FAILURE}
1. ACUTE OR CHRONIC,
2. RIGHT-SIDED OR LEFTSIDED
3. FORWARD OR BACKWARD FAILURE.

\section*{ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEART FAILURE.}

\section*{1)Acute heart failure.}
- Sudden and rapid development of heart failure occurs in the following conditions:
i. Larger myocardial infarction
ii. Valve rupture
iii. Cardiac tamponade
iv. Massive pulmonary embolism
v. Acute viral myocarditis
vi. Acute bacterial toxaemia
- In acute heart failure, there is sudden reduction in cardiac
output resulting in systemic hypotension but oedema
does not occur.
- Instead, a state of cardiogenic shock and cerebral
hypoxia develops.

\section*{2) Chronic heart failure.}
- More often, heart failure develops slowly
- compensatory mechanisms like tachycardia, cardiac dilatation and cardiac hypertrophy try to make adjustments so as to maintain adequate cardiac output.
- This often results in well-maintained arterial pressure and there is accumulation of oedema
- Observed in;
I. Myocardial ischaemia from atherosclerotic coronary artery disease
II. Multivalvular heart disease
III. Systemic arterial hypertension
IV. Chronic lung diseases resulting in hypoxia and pulmonary arterial hypertension
V. Progression of acute into chronic failure
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_28_d0d81d2c030cd114a743g-25.jpg?height=1713&width=2358&top_left_y=81&top_left_x=71)

\section*{LEFT-SIDED AND RIGHT-SIDED HEART FAILURE. 1)Left-sided heart failure}
- Functionally, the left and right heart act as independent units
- Left sided heart failure is initiated by stress to the left heart.
- The major causes are as follows:
1. Systemic hypertension
2. Mitral or aortic valve disease (stenosis)
3. Ischaemic heart disease
4. Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditis.
5. Restrictive pericarditis
- The clinical manifestations of left-sided heart failure result from decreased left ventricular output and hence there is accumulation of fluid upstream in the lungs

Accordingly, the major pathologic changes are as under:
i) Pulmonary congestion and oedema causes dyspnoea and orthopnoea.
ii) Decreased left ventricular output causing hypoperfusion and diminished oxygenation of tissues e.g.
a) Kidneys- causing ischaemic acute tubular necrosis,
b) Brain causing hypoxic encephalopathy,
c) Skeletal muscles causing muscular weakness and fatigue.

\section*{Pulmonary Edema causes Dyspnea:}
- Initially, DOE.
- then PND.
- Then dyspnea at rest.
- Caused by...LV failure.

\section*{2)Right-sided heart failure}
- Right-sided heart failure occurs more often as a consequence of left-sided heart failure.
- However, some conditions affect the right ventricle primarily, producing right-sided heart failure. These are as follows:
1. As a consequence of left ventricular failure.
2. Cor pulmonale in which right heart failure occurs due to intrinsic lung diseases.
3. Pulmonary or tricuspid valvular disease.
4. Pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary thromboembolism.
5. Myocardial disease affecting right heart.
6. Congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunt.
- Whatever be the underlying cause, the clinical manifestations of right-sided heart failure are upstream of the right heart such as
- systemic (due to caval blood) and Portal venous congestion,
- and reduced cardiac output

LEFTSIDED VFAILURE
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_28_d0d81d2c030cd114a743g-31.jpg?height=1289&width=1107&top_left_y=414&top_left_x=148)

\section*{RIGHT SIDED FAILURE}
(Cor Pulmonale)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_28_d0d81d2c030cd114a743g-31.jpg?height=1251&width=1021&top_left_y=462&top_left_x=1371)

Accordingly, the pathologic changes are as under:
i) Systemic venous congestion in different tissues and organs e.g. subcutaneous oedema on dependent parts, passive congestion of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, ascites, hydrothorax, congestion of leg veins and neck veins.
ii) Reduced cardiac output resulting in circulatory stagnation causing anoxia, cyanosis and coldness of extremities.
In summary, in early stage the left heart failure manifests with features of pulmonary congestion and decreased
left ventricular output, while the right heart failure presents
with systemic venous congestion and involvement of the liver and spleen.
CHF, however, combines the features of both left and right heart failure.

\section*{BACKWARD AND FORWARD HEART FAILURE.}

The mechanism of clinical manifestations resulting from heart failure can be explained on the basis of mutually interdependent backward and forward failure.

Backward heart failure: According to this concept, either of the ventricles fails to eject blood normally, resulting in rise of end-diastolic volume in the ventricle and increase in volume and pressure in the atrium which is transmitted Backward producing elevated pressure in the veins.

Forward heart failure: According to this hypothesis, clinical manifestations result directly from failure of the heart to pump blood causing diminished flow of blood to the tissues, especially diminished renal perfusion and activation of renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system.

\section*{COMPENSATORY MECHANISMS:}

\section*{CARDIAC HYPERTROPHY AND DILATATION:}

In order to maintain normal cardiac output, several compensatory mechanisms play a role as under:
1. Compensatory enlargement in the form of cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac dilatation, or both.
2. Tachycardia(i.e. increased heart rate) due to activation of neuro-humoral system e.g. release of norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide, activation of renin-angiotensin aldosterone mechanism.
According to Starling's law on pathophysiology of heart, the failing dilated heart, in order to maintain cardiac performance, increases the myocardial contractility and thereby attempts to maintain stroke volume.
This is achieved by increasing the length of sarcomeres in dilated heart.
Ultimately, however, dilatation decreases the force of contraction and leads to residual volume in the cardiac chambers causing volume overload resulting in cardiac failure that ends in death.

\section*{Cardiac Hypertrophy:}

Hypertrophy of the heart is defined as an increase in size and weight of the myocardium.

It generally results from increased pressure load while increased volume load (e.g. valvular incompetence) results in hypertrophy with dilatation of the affected chamber due to regurgitation of the blood through incompetent valve.

The atria may also undergo compensatory changes due to increased workload.

The basic factors that stimulate the hypertrophy of the myocardial fibres are not known. It appears that stretching of myocardial fibres in response to stress induces the cells to increase in length.

The elongated fibres receive better nutrition and thus increase in size. Other factors which may stimulate increase in size of myocardial fibres are anoxia (e.g. in coronary atherosclerosis) and influence of certain hormones (e.g. catecholamines, pituitary growth hormone).

\section*{CAUSES.}

Hypertrophy with or without dilatation may involve predominantly the left or the right heart, or both sides.
Left ventricular hypertrophy
The common causes are as under:
i) Systemic hypertension
ii) Aortic stenosis and insufficiency
iii) Mitral insufficiency
iv) Coarctation of the aorta
v) Occlusive coronary artery disease
vi) Congenital anomalies like septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus
vii) Conditions with increased cardiac output e.g. thyrotoxicosis, anaemia, arteriovenous fistulae.

\section*{Right ventricular hypertrophy}

Most of the causes of right ventricular hypertrophy are due to pulmonary arterial hypertension.
These are as follows:
i) Pulmonary stenosis and insufficiency
ii) Tricuspid insufficiency
iii) Mitral stenosis and/or insufficiency
iv) Chronic lung diseases e.g. chronic emphysema, bronchiectasis, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary vascular disease etc.
v) Left ventricular hypertrophy and failure of the left ventricle.

\section*{Cardiac Dilatation}

Quite often, hypertrophy of the heart is accompanied by cardiac dilatation. Stress leading to accumulation of excessive volume of blood in a chamber of the heart causes increase in length of myocardial fibres and hence cardiac dilatation as a compensatory mechanism.

\section*{CAUSES.}

Accumulation of excessive volume of blood within the cardiac chambers from the following causes may result in dilatation of the respective ventricles or both:
i) Valvular insufficiency (mitral and/or aortic insufficiency in left ventricular dilatation, tricuspid and/or pulmonary insufficiency in right ventricular dilatation)
ii) Left-to-right shunts e.g. in VSD
iii) Conditions with high cardiac output e.g. thyrotoxicosis, arteriovenous shunt
iv) Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditis
v) Systemic hypertension.

\section*{MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.}

Hypertrophy of the myocardium without dilatation is referred to as concentric and when associated with dilatation is called eccentric
The weight of the heart is increased above normal, often over 500 gm.
However, excessive epicardial fat is not indicative of true hypertrophy.
Grossly: Thickness of the left ventricular wall (excluding trabeculae carneae and papillary muscles) above 15 mm is indicative of significant hypertrophy.
In concentric hypertrophy, the lumen of the chamber is smaller than usual, while in eccentric hypertrophy the lumen is dilated. In pure hypertrophy, the papillary muscles and trabeculae carneae are rounded and enlarged, while in hypertrophy with dilatation these are flattened.

Microscopically: there is increase in size of individual muscle fibres. There may be multiple minute foci of degenerative changes and necrosis in the hypertrophied myocardium.
These changes appear to arise as a result of relative hypoxia of the hypertrophied muscle as the blood supply is inadequate to meet the demands of the increased fibre size. Ventricular hypertrophy renders the inner part of the myocardium more liable to ischaemia.
Electron microscopy reveals increase in the number of myofilaments comprising myofibrils, mitochondrial changes and multiple intercalated discs which are active sites for the formation of new sarcomeres. Besides, the nucleic acid content determinations have shown increase in total RNA and increased ratio of RNA to DNA content of the hypertrophied myocardial fibres.
