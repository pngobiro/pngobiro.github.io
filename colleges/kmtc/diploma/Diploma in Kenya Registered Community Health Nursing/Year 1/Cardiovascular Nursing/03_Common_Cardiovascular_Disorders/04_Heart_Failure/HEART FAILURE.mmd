HEART FAILURE

\section*{Introduction:}
-Definition: It is a clinical syndrome resulting from structural or functional cardiac disorders that impair the ability of ventricles to fill or eject blood (to meet the metabolic needs of the body) [Hinkle \& Cheever, 2014]
- Fluid buildup in the heart from myocardium that can't provide sufficient cardiac output
- Usually occurs in a damaged left ventricle but may occur in right ventricle, either primarily or secondary to left-sided heart failure
- Heart failure (HF) was referred to congestive heart/Cardiac failure (CHF or CCF) due to many patients present with pulmonary or peripheral congestion with oedema
- Currently, HF is recognized as clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of fluid overload or inadequate tissue perfusion
- Fluid overload and decreased tissue perfusion occurs when heart cannot generate sufficient cardiac output(CO) to meet body's demand for oxygen and nutrients
- In heart failure, impaired contraction of the heart (systolic dysfunction) or filling of the heart (diastolic dysfunction) may cause pulmonary or systemic congestion

\section*{Pathophysiology}

Given according to the cause:
- Left-sided verses right-sided failure
- Systolic or diastolic failure
- Low-output or high output failure
- Acute or chronic failure
- Forward or backward failure

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Left-sided Heart Failure:
$\checkmark$ Pumping ability of the left ventricle fails and cardiac output falls
$\checkmark$ Blood backs up in the left atrium and lungs, causing pulmonary congestion and decreased cardiac output.
$\checkmark$ Causes include: hypertension, myocardial infarction of left ventricle, or valvular heart disease
- Right-sided Heart Failure: (Cor pulmonale)
$\checkmark$ Ineffective contractile function of the right ventricle leads to blood backing up into the right atrium, in the vena cava and the peripheral circulation (venous system), which results in peripheral edema and engorgement of the kidneys and other organs.
$\checkmark$ Causes include: severe pulmonary disease and myocardial infarction of right ventricle.

\section*{Systolic or diastolic failure}

\section*{Systolic heart failure:}
- Due to ventricle failure to contract adequately to eject enough blood through aorta into arterial system. Causes decreased ventricular blood ejection
- Caused by loss of myocardial cells in ischemia, myocardial infarction (contractile dysfunction), cardiomyopathy or inflammations, increased afterload (hypertension), mechanical abnormalities (e.g. valvular disease)
- manifested in effects of low CO e.g. weakness, fatigue, exercise intolerance
$>$ Over time, it causes left ventricle dilatation and hypertrophy

\section*{Diastolic heart failure:}
- Occurs when heart is unable to completely relax (stiffness and non-compliant heart muscle) in diastole, thus disrupts normal filling
- Passive diastole filling decreases thereby decreasing stroke volume and cardiac output, but increases atrial contraction to preload
- Diastolic function occurs from chronic hypertension ( most common), decreased ventricular compliance due to hypertrophy, and impaired heart muscle contraction
- Manifested by dyspnoea, tachypnoea, respiratory crackles in if left ventricle affected and pulmonary hypertension. Neck vein distension, liver enlargement, anorexia, nausea, if right ventricle is affected

\section*{Low-output VS high-output failure: \\ -Low-output failure}
- Develops when there is a decrease in the biventricular output resulting from: coronary heart disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and other primary cardiac disorders.
-High-output failure (increased/normal cardiac output)
- Hypermetabolic states increases CO to maintain blood flow and O2 to tissues
- This activates compensatory mechanisms to increase CO thus further increasing O2 demand
- Though high CO, the heart is unable to meet increased demands of the tissues and thus fails
- Causes include: septicemia, anaemia, hyperthyroidism or AV shunting

\section*{Acute VS chronic failure:}
-Acute failure: it's life-threatening and occurs abruptly resulting from myocardial injury e.g. massive myocardial infarction manifested by sudden decrease in cardiac function and signs of decreased CO. Manifests as pulmonary oedema and congestion
- Chronic failure: progressive (gradual) decline or deterioration of heart muscle, which allows compensatory mechanisms to come into play. It causes decreased cardiac output.
$\checkmark$ Causes include: cardiomyopathies, valvular disease, or coronary heart disease (CHD)

\section*{Pathophysiology of Compensatory mechanism leading to heart failure}
- There are three primary compensatory mechanisms are:
1. The Frank-Starling mechanism: that is, the greater the stretch of the cardiac muscle, the greater the force of contraction. This increases contractile force thereby increasing CO. Complications include: increased myocardial demand; limited by overstretching.

\section*{pathophysiology}
2. Neuroendocrine response including activation of SNS and RAAS
- Decreased CO induces SNS and catecholamine release, thereby increasing HR, BP, contractility, vascular resistance and venous return.
- Complications include: tachycardia, decreased filling time, low CO, increased vascular resistance, increased myocardial work and O2 demand

\section*{pathophysiology}
- Decreased CO and renal perfusion induce reninangiotensin system. This causes vasoconstriction and increased BP. Complications include: increased myocardial work, renal vasoconstriction, and decreased renal perfusion
- ACE converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which stimulates aldosterone release from renal cortex resulting in salt and water retention by kidneys, and increased vascular volume overload and vasoconstriction, increasing BP and afterload. Complications include: increased preload and afterload; pulmonary congestion; increased stress on ventricular wall (increased cardiac work-load).

\section*{pathophysiology}
- ADH is released from neurohypophysis, which inhibits water excretion; while atrial natriuretic factor that is released from the heart increases Na excretion and diuresis. Complications include; fluid retention and increased preload and afterload
- Blood flow is redistributed to vital organs (heart and brain) thereby decreasing perfusion of other organ systems, skin and muscles. Complications include: renal failure, anaerobic metabolism, and lactic acidosis.

\section*{pathophysiology}
3. Ventricular hypertrophy:
- Increased cardiac workload causes myocardial muscle to hypertrophy and ventricles to dilate.
- This in turn leads to increased contractile force to maintain CO.
- This effect complicates into: increased myocardial O2 demand and cellular enlargement
- The enlarged myocardial cells become dysfunctional and die early (apoptosis), thus leading to low CO.

\section*{causes}
- Mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, or atrial fibrillation
- Mitral and aortic insufficiency
- Arrhythmias
- Hypertension
- Atherosclerosis with myocardial infarction (MI)
- Myocarditis
