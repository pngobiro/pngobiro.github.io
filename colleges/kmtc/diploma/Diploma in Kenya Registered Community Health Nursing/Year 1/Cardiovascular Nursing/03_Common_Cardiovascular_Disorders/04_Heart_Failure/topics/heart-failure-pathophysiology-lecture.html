                        <p>Ischemic heart disease develops when cholesterol particles in the blood begin to accumulate on the walls of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form.</p>
                        <p>These deposits narrow the arteries and eventually block the flow of blood.</p>
                        <p>This decrease in blood flow reduces the amount of oxygen supplied to the heart muscle.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">LEFT-SIDED AND RIGHT-SIDED HEART FAILURE.</h3>
                        <h4>1) Left-sided heart failure</h4>
                        <p>Functionally, the left and right heart act as independent units</p>
                        <p>Left sided heart failure is initiated by stress to the left heart.</p>
                        <p>The major causes are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Systemic hypertension</li>
                            <li>Mitral or aortic valve disease (stenosis)</li>
                            <li>Ischaemic heart disease</li>
                            <li>Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditis.</li>
                            <li>Restrictive pericarditis</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The clinical manifestations of left-sided heart failure result from decreased left ventricular output and hence there is accumulation of fluid upstream in the lungs</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, the major pathologic changes are as under:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) Pulmonary congestion and oedema causes dyspnoea and orthopnoea.</li>
                            <li>ii) Decreased left ventricular output causing hypoperfusion and diminished oxygenation of tissues e.g.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>a) Kidneys- causing ischaemic acute tubular necrosis,</li>
                                    <li>b) Brain causing hypoxic encephalopathy,</li>
                                    <li>c) Skeletal muscles causing muscular weakness and fatigue.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>Pulmonary Edema causes Dyspnea:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Initially, DOE.</li>
                            <li>then PND.</li>
                            <li>Then dyspnea at rest.</li>
                            <li>Caused by...LV failure.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h4>2) Right-sided heart failure</h4>
                        <p>Right-sided heart failure occurs more often as a consequence of left-sided heart failure.</p>
                        <p>However, some conditions affect the right ventricle primarily, producing right-sided heart failure. These are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>As a consequence of left ventricular failure.</li>
                            <li>Cor pulmonale in which right heart failure occurs due to intrinsic lung diseases.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary or tricuspid valvular disease.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary thromboembolism.</li>
                            <li>Myocardial disease affecting right heart.</li>
                            <li>Congenital heart disease with left-to-right shunt.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Whatever be the underlying cause, the clinical manifestations of right-sided heart failure are upstream of the right heart such as systemic (due to caval blood) and Portal venous congestion, and reduced cardiac output</p>
                        
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_28_d0d81d2c030cd114a743g-31-1.jpg" alt="Diagram illustrating the effects of left-sided heart failure, leading to pulmonary congestion." class="content-image">

                        <p>Accordingly, the pathologic changes are as under:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) Systemic venous congestion in different tissues and organs e.g. subcutaneous oedema on dependent parts, passive congestion of the liver, spleen, and kidneys, ascites, hydrothorax, congestion of leg veins and neck veins.</li>
                            <li>ii) Reduced cardiac output resulting in circulatory stagnation causing anoxia, cyanosis and coldness of extremities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In summary, in early stage the left heart failure manifests with features of pulmonary congestion and decreased left ventricular output, while the right heart failure presents with systemic venous congestion and involvement of the liver and spleen. CHF, however, combines the features of both left and right heart failure.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">BACKWARD AND FORWARD HEART FAILURE.</h3>
                        <p>The mechanism of clinical manifestations resulting from heart failure can be explained on the basis of mutually interdependent backward and forward failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Backward heart failure:</strong> According to this concept, either of the ventricles fails to eject blood normally, resulting in rise of end-diastolic volume in the ventricle and increase in volume and pressure in the atrium which is transmitted Backward producing elevated pressure in the veins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Forward heart failure:</strong> According to this hypothesis, clinical manifestations result directly from failure of the heart to pump blood causing diminished flow of blood to the tissues, especially diminished renal perfusion and activation of renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CARDIAC HYPERTROPHY AND DILATATION:</h3>
                        <p>In order to maintain normal cardiac output, several compensatory mechanisms play a role as under:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Compensatory enlargement in the form of cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac dilatation, or both.</li>
                            <li>Tachycardia(i.e. increased heart rate) due to activation of neuro-humoral system e.g. release of norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide, activation of renin-angiotensin aldosterone mechanism.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>According to Starling's law on pathophysiology of heart, the failing dilated heart, in order to maintain cardiac performance, increases the myocardial contractility and thereby attempts to maintain stroke volume. This is achieved by increasing the length of sarcomeres in dilated heart. Ultimately, however, dilatation decreases the force of contraction and leads to residual volume in the cardiac chambers causing volume overload resulting in cardiac failure that ends in death.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cardiac Hypertrophy:</h3>
                        <p>Hypertrophy of the heart is defined as an increase in size and weight of the myocardium.</p>
                        <p>It generally results from increased pressure load while increased volume load (e.g. valvular incompetence) results in hypertrophy with dilatation of the affected chamber due to regurgitation of the blood through incompetent valve.</p>
                        <p>The atria may also undergo compensatory changes due to increased workload.</p>
                        <p>The basic factors that stimulate the hypertrophy of the myocardial fibres are not known. It appears that stretching of myocardial fibres in response to stress induces the cells to increase in length.</p>
                        <p>The elongated fibres receive better nutrition and thus increase in size. Other factors which may stimulate increase in size of myocardial fibres are anoxia (e.g. in coronary atherosclerosis) and influence of certain hormones (e.g. catecholamines, pituitary growth hormone).</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CAUSES.</h3>
                        <p>Hypertrophy with or without dilatation may involve predominantly the left or the right heart, or both sides.</p>
                        <h4>Left ventricular hypertrophy</h4>
                        <p>The common causes are as under:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) Systemic hypertension</li>
                            <li>ii) Aortic stenosis and insufficiency</li>
                            <li>iii) Mitral insufficiency</li>
                            <li>iv) Coarctation of the aorta</li>
                            <li>v) Occlusive coronary artery disease</li>
                            <li>vi) Congenital anomalies like septal defects and patent ductus arteriosus</li>
                            <li>vii) Conditions with increased cardiac output e.g. thyrotoxicosis, anaemia, arteriovenous fistulae.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Right ventricular hypertrophy</h4>
                        <p>Most of the causes of right ventricular hypertrophy are due to pulmonary arterial hypertension. These are as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) Pulmonary stenosis and insufficiency</li>
                            <li>ii) Tricuspid insufficiency</li>
                            <li>iii) Mitral stenosis and/or insufficiency</li>
                            <li>iv) Chronic lung diseases e.g. chronic emphysema, bronchiectasis, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary vascular disease etc.</li>
                            <li>v) Left ventricular hypertrophy and failure of the left ventricle.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Cardiac Dilatation</h3>
                        <p>Quite often, hypertrophy of the heart is accompanied by cardiac dilatation. Stress leading to accumulation of excessive volume of blood in a chamber of the heart causes increase in length of myocardial fibres and hence cardiac dilatation as a compensatory mechanism.</p>
                        <h4>CAUSES.</h4>
                        <p>Accumulation of excessive volume of blood within the cardiac chambers from the following causes may result in dilatation of the respective ventricles or both:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>i) Valvular insufficiency (mitral and/or aortic insufficiency in left ventricular dilatation, tricuspid and/or pulmonary insufficiency in right ventricular dilatation)</li>
                            <li>ii) Left-to-right shunts e.g. in VSD</li>
                            <li>iii) Conditions with high cardiac output e.g. thyrotoxicosis, arteriovenous shunt</li>
                            <li>iv) Myocardial diseases e.g. cardiomyopathies, myocarditis</li>
                            <li>v) Systemic hypertension.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES.</h3>
                        <p>Hypertrophy of the myocardium without dilatation is referred to as concentric and when associated with dilatation is called eccentric The weight of the heart is increased above normal, often over 500 gm. However, excessive epicardial fat is not indicative of true hypertrophy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Grossly:</strong> Thickness of the left ventricular wall (excluding trabeculae carneae and papillary muscles) above 15 mm is indicative of significant hypertrophy. In concentric hypertrophy, the lumen of the chamber is smaller than usual, while in eccentric hypertrophy the lumen is dilated. In pure hypertrophy, the papillary muscles and trabeculae carneae are rounded and enlarged, while in hypertrophy with dilatation these are flattened.</p>
                        <p><strong>Microscopically:</strong> there is increase in size of individual muscle fibres. There may be multiple minute foci of degenerative changes and necrosis in the hypertrophied myocardium. These changes appear to arise as a result of relative hypoxia of the hypertrophied muscle as the blood supply is inadequate to meet the demands of the increased fibre size. Ventricular hypertrophy renders the inner part of the myocardium more liable to ischaemia.</p>
                        <p><strong>Electron microscopy</strong> reveals increase in the number of myofilaments comprising myofibrils, mitochondrial changes and multiple intercalated discs which are active sites for the formation of new sarcomeres. Besides, the nucleic acid content determinations have shown increase in total RNA and increased ratio of RNA to DNA content of the hypertrophied myocardial fibres.</p>
