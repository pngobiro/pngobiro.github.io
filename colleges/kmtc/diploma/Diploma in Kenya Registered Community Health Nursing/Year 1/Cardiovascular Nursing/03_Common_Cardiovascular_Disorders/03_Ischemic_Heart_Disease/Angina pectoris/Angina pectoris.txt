\section*{Arrhythmias}

\section*{Dr Wainaina Samuel}

\section*{Arrhythmias}
- Arrhythmias and conduction disorders are caused by abnormalities in the generation or conduction of these electrical impulses or both.
- Any heart disorder, including congenital abnormalities of structure or function, can disturb rhythm.
- Systemic factors that can cause or contribute to a rhythm disturbance include electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, hormonal imbalances, and drugs and toxins.

\section*{Normal cardiac rhythm}
- The resting sinus heart rate in adults is usually 60 to 100 beats/min.
-
- Sinus bradycardia occur in young people, particularly athletes, and during sleep.
- Sinus tachycardia occur during exercise, illness, or periods of intense emotion through sympathetic neural and circulating catecholamine drive.
- Normally, a marked diurnal variation in heart rate occurs, with lowest rates just before early morning awakening.
- A slight increase in rate during inspiration with a decrease in rate during expiration (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) is also normal;

\section*{Pathophysiology}
- Rhythm disturbances result from abnormalities of impulse formation, impulse conduction, or both.
- Bradyarrhythmias result from decreased intrinsic pacemaker function or blocks in conduction, principally within the AV node or the His-Purkinje system.
- Tachyarrhythmias are caused by reentry.
- Reentry is the circular propagation of an impulse around 2 interconnected pathways with different conduction characteristics and refractory periods

\section*{Electrocardiogram(ECG)}
- Most cardiac electrical activity is represented on the ECG although SA node, AV node, and His-Purkinje depolarization does not involve enough tissue to be detected.
- The P wave represents atrial depolarization. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization, and the T wave represents ventricular repolarization.

\section*{QRS COMPLEX}

$\mathrm{mm} / \mathrm{mV} \quad 1$ square $=0.04 \mathrm{sec} / 0.1 \mathrm{mV}$

\section*{Interpretation of the QRS}
- The PR interval is Complemeter beginning of atrial activation to the beginning of ventricular activation.
- Much of this interval reflects slowing of impulse transmission in the AV node.
- The R-R interval represents the ventricular rate.
- The QT interval represents the duration of ventricular depolarization.
- Normal values for the QT interval are slightly longer in women; they are also longer with a slower heart rate.

\section*{Symptoms and Signs}
- Palpitations (sensation of skipped beats or rapid or forceful beats),
- Hemodynamic compromise (eg, dyspnea, chest discomfort, presyncope, syncope),
- Cardiac arrest.
- Polyuria results from release of atrial natriuretic peptide during prolonged supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs).

\section*{Diagnosis}
- The ECG is primary tool of diagnosis
- The key diagnostic features are .
1. Rate of atrial activation
2. Rate and regularity of ventricular activation
3. The relationship between the two

\section*{Classification of Arrhythmias}
1. Bradyarrhythmias
- ECG diagnosis of bradyarrhythmias depends on the presence or absence of $P$ waves, morphology of the $P$ waves, and the relationship between $P$ waves and QRS complexes
2. Tachyarrhythmias
- Tachyarrhythmias are defined by the QRS complexes

\section*{Bradyarrhythmias}

\section*{1. AV block is indicated by a bradyarrhythmia with no relationship between $P$ waves and QRS complexes and more $P$ waves than QRS complexes}
2. Absence of AV block is indicated by a regular QRS bradyarrhythmia with a $1: 1$ relationship between P waves and QRS complexes.

\section*{Tachyarrhythmias}
- Atrial fibrillation (AF): Atrial ECG signals (usually best seen in lead V1) that are continuous, irregular in timing and morphology, and very rapid (> 300 beats/min) without discrete $P$ wave
- Atrial flutter: Regular, discrete, uniform atrial signals (usually best seen in leads II, III, and aVF) without intervening isoelectric periods, usually at rates > 250 beats/min

\section*{Treatment}
- The need for treatment of arrhythmias depends on the symptoms and the seriousness of the arrhythmia.
- Treatment is directed at causes.
- direct antiarrhythmic therapy, including
1. antiarrhythmic drugs,
2. cardioversion-defibrillation,
3. implantable cardioverter-defibrillators(ICDs),
4. pacemakers
5. catheter ablation
6. surgery
