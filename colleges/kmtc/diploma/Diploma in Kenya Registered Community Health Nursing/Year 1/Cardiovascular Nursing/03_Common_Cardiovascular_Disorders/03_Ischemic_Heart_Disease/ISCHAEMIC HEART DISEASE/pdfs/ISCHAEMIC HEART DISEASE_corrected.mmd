# ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE BY KIMINA

* Also known as CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD)
* IHD is a condition in which there is insufficient blood supply to the myocardium to meet functional demand.
* Imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand.
* Caused mainly by ATHEROSCLEROSIS OF CORONARY ARTERY.
* There are 4 basic clinical syndrome of IHD

## Clinical Syndrome of IHD

* Angina pectoris: in this case ischaemia causes pain but is insufficient to cause myocardial death. 3 types of Angina:
  * Stable angina: occurs on exertion
  * Variant angina (Prinzmetal): due to coronary artery spasm
  * Unstable Angina: occurs progressively or even at rest
* Acute myocardial infarction: the severity or duration of ischaemia is enough to cause cardiac myocytes death.
* Chronic Ischaemic heart disease: it refers to progressive cardiac decompensation (heart failure) following myocardial infarction
* Sudden cardiac death: this results from lethal arrhythmia

## RISK FACTORS

### Modifiable
* Cigarette smoking
* Hyperlipidemia
* Hypertension
* Diabetes
* High density lipoprotein levels
* Obesity

### Non-modifiable
* Age
* Male sex
* Family history

## Other Risk Factors
* Physical inactivity
* Diet
* Alcohol consumption
* Oral contraceptives

## Pathogenesis of IHD
* The underlying pathogenesis of IHD is ATHEROSCLEROSIS.
* Can affect any artery in the body, tends to occur at sites of altered arterial shear stress such as bifurcation.
* Starts with any abnormal endothelial function
* Inflammatory cells, predominantly monocytes, bind to receptor expressed by endothelial cells
* Migrate to intima
* Take up oxidized low density lipoprotein particles
* Become lipid laden macrophages or foam cells

## Pathogenesis (continued)
* As foam cells die, they release their lipid pool in intimal space with cytokines and growth factor
* In response smooth muscle cells migrate from the media of the arterial wall into the intima
* Lipid core will be covered by smooth muscle cells matrix
* Form stable atherosclerotic plaque that will remain asymptomatic until it becomes large enough to obstruct arterial flow.

## Disease Progression
* IHD occurs because of inadequate coronary perfusion relative to myocardial demand
* Can result from a combination of:
  * Pre-existing (fixed) atherosclerotic occlusion of coronary artery
  * New superimposed thrombosis and/or vasospasms
* A lesion obstructing 70-75% or more of a vessel lumen is referred to as CRITICAL STENOSIS and it causes asymptomatic ischaemia (Angina) only in the setting of increased demand.
* A fixed stenosis of $90\%$ can lead to inadequate coronary blood flow even at rest (unstable angina)
* If a coronary artery develops an atherosclerotic occlusion at a slow rate it stimulates collateral blood flow from other major epicardial vessels.
* Such collateral perfusion can then protect against myocardial infarction even in setting of a complete vascular occlusion
* Acute coronary occlusions cannot spontaneously recruit collateral flow and will result in infarction

## Role of Acute Plaque Change
* In most patients, unstable angina, infarction and sudden cardiac death all occur because of abrupt plaque change followed by thrombosis.
* The initiating events is typically disruption of a plaque due to the following:
  * Rupture or ulceration of plaques: this exposes highly thrombogenic plaque constituents or the underlying subendothelial basement membrane
  * Hemorrhage into the core of plaque: this results in expansion of plaque volume and worsening of luminal occlusion

## Role of Thrombus
* Thrombus associated with a disrupted plaque is critical to pathogenesis of IHD.
* Partial vascular occlusion by a newly formed thrombus on a disrupted atherosclerotic plaque can worsen with time and lead to unstable angina or sudden death.
* Partial luminal occlusion can compromise blood flow sufficiently to cause a small infarction of the innermost zone of the myocardium.

## ANGINA
* A type of chest pain, not a disease but a symptom of an underlying heart problem especially IHD
* Described as heavy, tight or gripping.
* Types of Angina:
  * Stable angina: pain that occurs on exertion when blood supply to myocardium is inadequate, usually due to severe significant narrowing of coronary arteries. Relieved by rest
  * Variant (Prinzmetal's) angina: occurs without provocation usually at rest as a result of coronary artery spasm, more frequently in women.
  * Unstable angina: clinically characterized by progressive symptoms

## MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
* Is defined as death of myocardial tissue caused by ischaemia.
* Popularly known as HEART ATTACK.
* An MI occurs when there is diminished blood supply to heart which leads to myocardial cell damage
* Contractile function stops in the necrotic area of heart
* Ischaemia results from blockage of coronary vessels
* This blockage is often as a result of thrombus that is superimposed on an ulcerated or unstable atherosclerotic plaque formation in coronary artery

## Pathophysiology
* Ischaemia develops when there is an increased demand for oxygen or decreased supply of oxygen.
* It can develop within 10 seconds and if it lasts longer than 20 minutes irreversible cell and tissue death occurs
* Myocardial cell death begins at the endocardium, the area most distal to the arterial blood supply
* As vessel occlusion continues cell death spreads to the myocardium and eventually to the epicardium

## Severity Factors
* Severity of an MI depends on three factors:
  * Level of occlusion
  * Length of time of occlusion
  * Presence or absence of collateral circulation

## Clinical Features
* Severe crushing substernal chest pain or discomfort that can radiate to the neck, jaw, epigastric or left arm
* In contrast to the pain of Angina pectoris, the pain of MI typically lasts for 20 mins to several hours and is not relieved by rest or nitrate administration.
* Pulse is generally rapid and weak and patients can be diaphoretic.
* Dyspnoea is common and is caused by impaired myocardial contractility and dysfunction
* With massive MI (>40\% of left ventricle) cardiogenic shock develops

## ECG ABNORMALITIES
* They include changes such as:
  * Q-waves: indicating transmural infarcts
  * S-T segment abnormalities and T-wave inversion: represents abnormalities in MI

## Laboratory Evaluation
* Based on measuring the blood levels of intracellular macromolecules that leak out of injured myocardial cells through damaged cell membrane.
* They include:
  * Myoglobin
  * Cardiac troponins I and T
  * Creatinine kinase-myocardial band
  * Lactate dehydrogenase
* Troponins and CK-MB have high specificity and sensitivity to myocardial damage.
* TnI and TnT are not normally detected in the circulation but after 2-4 hrs and reaches peak at 48 hrs, their levels remain elevated for 7-10 days.
