                        <p>Its mechanisms are poorly understood because there is usually a period of several weeks after the initial infection before the development of manifestations of myocarditis. Immunological mechanisms may play a role in the development of myocarditis.</p>
                        <p>The majority of infections are benign, self-limiting and sub-clinical, although viral myocarditis in infants and pregnant women may be virulent.</p>

                            <li>Vital signs are taken 2 to 4 hourly.</li>
                            <li>Investigations are done to find out the underlying course and state of the heart.</li>
                            <li>Patient may require oxygen therapy and maintenance of stand by emergency equipment and general supportive measures used for management of myocarditis.</li>
                            <li>Drugs used.
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li><strong>Digoxin:</strong> Small doses are given with myocarditis patients because patients are more sensitive to adverse effects of digoxine.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Immune suppressive therapy with drugs like prednisolone, cyclo-sporine.</strong> These drugs reduce myocardial inflammation and prevent irreversible myocardial damage.</li>

                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Presence of polymorph nuclea leucocytes.</li>
                            <li>Increased pericardial vascularity.</li>
                            <li>Fibrin deposition on the visceral pericardium which often results to the acute injury by exudation of fluid.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestation</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Chest Pain:</strong> The intense pleuritic chest pain is generally sharpest over the left precordium or retrosternally but may radiate to trapezius ridge and next mimicking angina or sometimes to the epigastrium or abdomen mimicking abdominal or other noncardial pathological conditions. The pain is aggravated by lying supine, deep breathings, coughing, swallowing and moving the trunk and is eased by sitting up and leaning forward.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dysponea:</strong> The dysponea accompanying acute pericarditis is related to the client's need to breath in rapidly, shallow breaths to avoid chest pain and may be aggravated by fever.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pericardial Friction Rub:</strong> The hallmark finding in the acute pericarditis is the pericardial friction rub. The rub is a scratching, grating, high pitchest sound, believed to arise from friction between the roughened pericardial and epicardial surfaces. It is best heard with stethoscope placed firmly at the lower left sternal border of the chest.</li>
                            <li>On Chest X-Ray: Pericardial effusion can be seen on chest x-ray film.</li>
                            <li>Fever</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>ECG</li>
                            <li>CT scan (brain scan)</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <p>The management of acute pericarditis is directed forward identification and treatment of the underlying problem.</p>
                        <p>Antibiotics maybeused to treat purulent pericarditis. The pain and inflammation of acute pericarditis is usually reaction by non-steroidal and anti inflammatory agents i.e. high doses of salicylates i.e. 300 mg to 900 mg Qid or of indomethacin 25 to 500 mg orally Qid.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Care</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Patient is nursed in a complete bed rest in a sitting up position.</li>
                            <li>Assessment of the amount of quality and location of pain is important particularly in distinguishing the pain of pericarditis versus acute myocardial infarction. Also exclude ischaemic chest pains. Other vital signs are taken 2 to 4 hourly.</li>
                            <li>Pain relieve measures i.e maintaining the client on bed rest with head of the bed elevated to $45^{\circ}$ and providing a padded over table for the client for leaning to relieve pain.</li>
                            <li>Monitor the side effects of prescribed anti inflammatory medications i.e. administration of the drugs with food or milk and instructing the patient to avoid alcoholic beverages while taking this drugs.</li>
                            <li>Patient is given high protein diet, light and attractive with plenty of fluids (to treat the fevers). Maintain the fluid balance chart to ensure the patient is getting enough within 24 hours.</li>
                            <li>Anxiety reducing measures including simple explanations completely of all procedures done.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The real potential for decreased cardiac output also exists for the client of acute pericarditis because of the possibility of the cardiac tamponade.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications of Pericarditis</h3>

                            <li><strong>Pericardial Effusion:</strong> This can cause compression of its adjoining structures if it is large.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cardiac Tamponade:</strong> Which develops as the pericardial effusion increases in size with failure of compensatory mechanisms to adjust to the continuing altered cardiac compliance.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The patient with pericardium tamponade is often confused, agitated and restless and has tachycardia and tachpnoea with a low output state.</p>
                        <p>The neck veins are usually markedly distended because of jugular vein pressure elevation and a significant pulses paradoxisus is present.</p>

                        <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Acute rheumatic fever is a complication of up to 3% of sporadic upper respiratory infections called by group; A Beta haemolytic streptococci species. Initial and reccurant episodes of acute respiratory infection are most common from ages 6 m through 15 years.</p>
                        <p>Most recurrences occur within 2 years of the initial episodes. Recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever are 2's as common between ages of 11 and 22 years as after the age of 22. The frequency of rheumatic recurrence after streptococcal infection is greater in those with rheumatic heart disease than in those who haven't had cardiac injuries during frequent attacks.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Aetiology/Cause</h3>
                        <p>Rheumatic fever almost always occur as a delayed sequence usually 2 to 3 weeks to a group; A Beta haemolytic streptococcal infections of the upper respiratory system usually a pharyngeal infections. In addition to the infecting organism, other factors play a predisposing role in the development of rheumatic fever. They include;</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Social economic factors i.e. low social income groups, crowded living conditions, neglected inadequate treatment, poor nutrition and a lowered state of health.</li>
                            <li>There seems to be a familial tendency toward rheumatic fever which may be genetically related possibly due to an altered immune response.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>The coloration of streptococcal pharyngitis with rheumatic fever is conclusive but the pathogenic mechanisms by which streptococcal infection causes inflammation of the heart and other tissues are not well defined. The organisms is not demonstrated in the lesions when rheumatic fever appears several days or weeks after acute pharyngitis manifestations of acute rheumatic fever appear to be related (in susceptible patients) to abnormal immunological response to an upper respiratory infection with a beta haemolytic streptococcal. Acute rheumatic fever probably affect joints, CNS and the skin because of an abnormal humoral and cell related immune response to group A beta haemolytic streptococcal cell membrane antigens. It is possible that these antigens cross react with other tissues and bind to receptors on heart, muscle, joint and brain cells triggering immune and inflammatory responses.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Cardiac lesions and Valvular Deformities</h4>
                        <p>About 40% of acute rheumatic fever episodes are marked by carditis and all layers of the heart may be involved. This generalized involvement gives rise to the term rheumatic. Rheumatic endocarditis is found primarily in the valves with swelling and erosion of values reflexes. Vegetations form in areas of erosion from deposits of blood cells and fibrin. These lesions initially create fibrous thickening of the value commissures chordate tendinealand fibrosis of the papillary muscle. The valves may become stenotic and insufficient. The initial and cortic values are most commonly affected. Less commonly involved are the tricuspid value and rarely pulmonary values. Value leaflets may fuse and become thickened or even calcified resulting in stenosis. Reduction in the mobility of value leaflets may occur with failure of the leaflets to oppose, regurgitation and result afterwards. Myocardial involvement is characterized by aschoff bodies which are nodules formed by a reaction to inflammation and accompanying swelling, fragmentation of collagen fibres. As aschoff bodies age, they become more fibrous and scarred tissue is formed in the myocardium. In addition to the aschoffs, a defused cellular infiltration is present interstitial tissues of the myocardial. Rheumatic pericarditic affects both layers of the pericardium which becomes thickened and covers with fibrous exudates a serosanguineous pericardial fluid may be present.</p>
                        <p>When healing occurs, fibrosis and adhesions develops partially or completely obliterate the pericardial sac extra cardiac lesions.</p>

                        <p>Because the five major manifestations of rheumatic fever (carditis, migratory polyarthritis, chorea, erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules) can appear alone or in combination. Rheumatic fever has many clinical patterns fever is a prominent syndrome but is not specific.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">a) Migratory Polyarthritis</h5>
                        <p>Joints generally the large ones such as the wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees and lips snow limited range of motion, extreme tenderness swelling and inflammation.</p>
                        <p>The arthritis is migratory and reversible in nature of progression polyarthritis. Others during the $1^{\text {st }}$ to 2 weeks during the febrile period and lasts for a few days in certain affected joints before moving to other joints.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">b) Carditis</h5>
                        <p>It is seen in approximately 30% of children who have acute rheumatic fever. Inflammatory, haemorrhagic, bullous known Aschoff bodies/nodules form in the interstitial tissues of the heart in response to rheunatic myocarditis. An organic heart murmurs not usually present usually from mitial or aortic regurgitation or mitral stenosis are heard.</p>
                        
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">c) Chorea (Sydenham's chorea: St. Vitus Dance)</h5>
                        <p>It is the major CNS manifestation. It is characterized by involuntary random muscular movements of the extremities, involuntary facial grimaces, weakness, ataxia which tends to intensify with voluntary activities. The child has emotional liability, speech disturbance and severe muscle weakness.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Children with chorea may be considered fidgety or restless and judged to be behavior problem.</p>
                        <p>Attempts to control fine motor activities and intensifies involuntary movements, whereas sleep and rest relieve them. These clinical manifestations may last for months before disappearing.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">d) Erythema Marginatum</h5>
                        <p>These are less common features of rheumatic fever. They are bright pink like map like macular lesions which eventually join together in a connective pattern giving a chicken wire decoration on the skin (appearance). Mainly found on the trunk or inner aspects of the upper arm and thigh but never on the face. Characteristically these lesions are evanescent and can be encouraged to appear with application of heat. They are neither puritic nor itching and also not raised. The rashes are usually transitory that is lasting for a few hours and may reoccur intermittently for months.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">e) Subcutaneous Nodules</h5>
                        <p>Are firm small hard painless swellings and most commonly over bony prominences. For example, knees, elbows, spine, scapula, knuckles, ankles, scalp and spinous processes of the vertebra. They frequently aren't noticed by the person because the skin overlying nodules moves freely and is not inflamed. They gradually resolve over a period of time with no residue.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(ii) Acute Intervention</h4>
                        <p><strong>Primary goals of managing a patient with acute rheumatic fever are;</strong></p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>To control and alleviate the infecting organisms.</li>
                            <li>To prevent cardiac complications.</li>
                            <li>Relieve joint paint; fever and other symptoms.</li>
                            <li>Support the patient psychologically and emotionally.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>A.</strong> The nurse must administer antibiotics as ordered to treat the streptococcal infections and teach the patient that oral antibiotic therapy requires faithful adherence to the full 10 day course of therapy.</p>
                        <p><strong>B.</strong> Tepid sponge bath should be given to relieve fever and antipyretics should be administered as prescribed.</p>
                        <p><strong>C.</strong> Oral fluids should be encouraged if the patient is able to swallow or I.V. fluids be administered as prescribed.</p>
                        <p><strong>D.</strong> Promotion of optimal rest is essential to reduce cardiac workload and diminish the metabolic need of the body.</p>
                        <p>The major role of the nurse to ensure bed rest is to assist the patient and relatives to understand the need for bed rest (amount) ordered by the physician.</p>
                        <p><strong>E.</strong> The nurse should ensure the patient doesn't develop constipation, decreased muscle tone which will lead to foot drop, skin break down, excessive weight gain and boredom.</p>
                        <p><strong>F.</strong> Arranging for light activities which can be done in bed is encouraged.</p>
                        <p><strong>G.</strong> Relieve of joint pain or bronchaditis is an important nursing goal. Painful joints should be positioned for relieving of painful;</p>
                        <p><strong>H.</strong> Proper alignment. Removal of covers from painful joints can be done with a bed cradle. Heat may be applied and salicylates may be administered to relieve joint pains.</p>
                        <p><strong>I.</strong> Other measures to reduce discomfort during acute laze include:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Planning the care such that the patient is not disturbed frequently.</li>
                            <li>The only reaction of chorea is prevention of injury during the period when involuntary jerking and possibly violent movements occur. Protective measures include bed rills, padding on the sides of the bed/chair to prevent injury, rest rings, thick clothing and mittens to prevent bruising of the skin, assistance during walking to prevent falling and also feeding the patients to prevent injuries from use of feeding implements/equipment.</li>
                            <li>Psychological and emotional care can be more important than physical care because children and young clients are the primary clients and the heart is often viewed as the center of life. Any alteration in cardiac function may be perceived as a threat to the person's body image.</li>
                            <li>To evaluate the progression or regression of the disease process the nurse should assess the patient for remission of symptoms. This includes;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Monitoring intake and output.</li>
                                    <li>Daily weight.</li>
                                    <li>Resting and sleeping heart rates. This is because an accelerated sleeping heart rate in the lisence of a febrile state is an indication of cardiac involvement.</li>
                                    <li>The lab tests be monitored for return to normal ranges.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <li>The patient should be taught about the disease process, possible sequence and need for prophylactic antibiotics.</li>
                            <li>The ongoing client education and reinforcement encourages good health practices. The patient should also be cautioned about the possibility of development of valvular heart disease.</li>
                            <li>Nurse should teach the patient to seek medical attention i.e. excessful fatigue, dizziness, palpitations or dysponea on exertion develops.</li>
                            <li>The child with cardial manifestations of the disease i.e. aortic regurgitation or mitial stenosis or insufficiency must be followed regularly with additional testing to determine the progression or regression of the lesions.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The nurse should encourage the patient and relatives to it with follow-up care even though the condition has improved.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Outcome of Rheumatic Fever</h3>
                        <p>Prognosis of this disease is generally good. The degree of carditis and subsequent damage to cardiac structures are of primary concerns since they will be reflected in the levels of activity restrictions in the future with each recurrence of streptococcal infection the likelihood for potential need for value replacement increases therefore prevention of recurrences is a high priority.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications of Rheumatic Fever</h3>
                        <p>NOTE: Once or evidence of rheumatic fever has abated rheumatic fever doesn't occur in the absence of a new streptococcal infection. If the initial episode isn't associated with carditis there is little likelihood of subsequent damage if repeated attacks don't occur.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Chronic rheumatic carditis which results from changes in valvular structures that may occur months to years after an attack of acute rheumatic fever</li>
                            <li>Rheumatic endocarditis can result in fibrous tissue growth to value leaflets chord tendinae will scarring and contractures.</li>
                            <li>Other valves that may also be affected are the aortic and the tricuspid valves.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Rheumatic Heart Disease (Chronic Valvular Disease)</h3>
                        <p>Mainly involves the mitral and aortic valves.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Chronic Valvular Disease</h3>
                        <p>This condition usually occurs as a result of the inflammation of the valve cusps/flaps leading to their distortion fibrosis and calcification. The valves therefore become ineffective in performing their normal functions.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Terminologies used in Connection to Chronic Valvular Disease</h4>
                        <p><strong>Stenosis:</strong> Narrowing of the valves.</p>
                        <p><strong>Incompetence:</strong> Inadequate closure of the valves.</p>
                        <p><strong>Regurgitation:</strong> Back flow of blood as a result of incompetence.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Types of Chronic Valvular Disease</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mitral valve disease.</li>
                            <li>Aortic valve disease.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary and tricuspid valve disease.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li><strong>Mitral Valve Disease:</strong> In half of the people suffering from this disease, more than 50% of them have a history of rheumatic fever. Mitral stenosis is more common than mitral incompetence although in some cases, they may occur simultaneously. The lungs become very congested causing shortness of breath and tiredness. Acute pulmonary oedema may occur. Arterial fibrillation is usually present and left heart failure gradually appears.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aortic Valvular Disease:</strong> In this condition, aortic valve stenosis or incompetence may occur. The main result is the enlargement of the heart called cardiac hypertrophy. The left ventricular failure eventually occurs followed by right heart failure. Main symptoms are; dysponea, tiredness and angina.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pulmonary and Tricuspid Valve Disease.</strong> Tricuspid valve disease is usually due to rheumatic heart disease and is associated with mitral and aortic valve disease. In both cases, right heart failure occurs and back pressure is transmitted via inferior vena cava into the systemic circulation.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Management of Chronic Valvular Disease</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Same as for congestive heart failure.</li>
                            <li>Cardiac surgery may be performed i.e. valvulotomy - dilatation of the valves.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Valve Replacement:</strong> There are two types i.e.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Homo Graft: Using human tissue.</li>
                            <li>Hetero Graft: Non-human tissues are used.</li>
                            <li>Mechanical values which are plastic values.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>NOTE: There is usually risk of infection associated with the type of surgery and therefore the need for antibiotics and analgesics.</p>
                        <p>Incase mechanical value is inserted their, anticoagulant therapy is indicated to prevent thrombosis around the value. Cardiac surgery is usually a very major operation and the patient needs to be nursed and treated in the ICU for a few days and on I.V. fluids and blood transfusion as indicated.</p>
