                        <ol>
                            <li>C.C.F is usually manifested by biventricular failure although one ventricle.</li>
                            <li>May precede the other in dysfunction. Normally the pumping actions of the left and right sides of the heart complement each other producing a;</li>
                            <li>Continuous flow of blood, however, as a result of pathological conditions, one side may fail while the other side continues to function normally;</li>
                            <li>For a period of time. Because of the prolonged strain, the functioning side of the heart will eventually fail resulting in biventricular;</li>
                            <li>Failure. The most common form of initial heart failure is;</li>
                            <li>Left sided failure. C.C.F occurs in a tetro grade version progressing from the left ventricle to the pulmonary system to the right ventricle.</li>
                            <li>This will usually lead to and is the main cause of right sided failure. However, right sided failure can occur as a result of right ventricular myocardial infarction or corpulmonare. C.C.F will eventually develop in the majority of persons with moderate to severe cardiac disease.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <img src="../assets/images/2025_06_28_82fb160e11127c6d1204g-66-1.jpg" alt="A detailed flowchart showing the pathophysiology of heart failure, including the cascade of compensatory mechanisms like sympathetic nervous system activation, RAAS activation, and ventricular remodeling, leading to both left-sided and right-sided heart failure symptoms." class="content-image">
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Left Sided Heart Failure</h4>
                        <p>This results from left ventricular dysfunction which causes blood to backup through left atrium and into the pulmonary veins. The increased pressure causes fluid extra versation from the pulmonary capillary bed into the interstitium and then the alveoli which is manifested as pulmonary congestion and oedema.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diseases of the coronary arteries.</li>
                            <li>Cardio myopathy.</li>
                            <li>Aortic valvular disease.</li>
                            <li>Hypertension.</li>
                            <li>Rheumatic heart disease resulting into mitral value incompetence or stenosis.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When a myocardial infarction occurs, myocardial tissue is damaged and replaced by scar tissue. The scar tissue is less elastic and has poorer contractility than the undamaged myocardium. The loss of myocardial mass increases the workload on the remaining functioning tissue. If the functioning myocardial can't compensate for this less, the volume of blood ejected from the ventricles decreases and left heart failure results. When hypertension is present, the heart must pump blood against a high arteriol pressure eventually this can lead to left ventricular hypertrophy. Hypertrophic muscle has poor contractility and overtime will result in failure.</p>
                        <p>In aortic valvular heart disease, the left ventricle must contract forcefully to pump blood through the stenotic aortic value, overtime this results in left ventricular failure. This requires an increased amount of pressure that must be generated by the left ventricle. In addition, the value often fails to close completely and blood is regurgitated into the left ventricle.</p>
                        <p>In mitral value disease, a similar process involving the left artrium occurs.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Right-Sided Heart Failure</h4>
                        <p>Right-sided heart failure from weakened right ventricle causes veneous congestion in the systemic circulation and results in peripheral oedema, hepatomegaly and spleenomegaly.</p>
                        <p>The primary cause of right-sided heart failure is left sided heart failure. In this situation, leftsided failure results in pulmonary congestion and increased pressure in blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). Eventually pulmonary hypertension results in right-sided heart failure cos-pulmonaxe (right ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy due to pulmonary pathology) can also cause right-sided heart failure.</p>
                        <p>Distended neck veins can be seen when a client with right-sided heart failure is in a semirecumbent position and this is due to increased pressure in the right atrium.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Other Causes of Right-Sided Heart Failure</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Myocardial infarction of the right atrium and ventricle.</li>
                            <li>Chronic pulmonary diseases i.e. pulmonary TB, bronchitis, chronic pneumoconiosis, pneumonia etc.</li>
                            <li>Tricuspid and pulmonary value stenosis.</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Factors Precipitating to Heart Failure</h3>
                        <p>There are certain factors that can precipitate heart failure in a person with heart disease i.e.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Dysrrythymias which lead to ineffective mechanical pumping.</li>
                            <li>Reduction or ceasation of cardiac therapy either pharmacological or dietry.</li>
                            <li>Infections either viral or bacterial.</li>
                            <li>Emotional or physical stress.</li>
                            <li>Second type of heart disease i.e. rheumatic heart disease.</li>
                            <li>Anaemia which causes an increased heart rate as a compensatory mechanism to maintain tissue oxygenation.</li>
                            <li>Thyrotoxicosis which causes an increased heart rate.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Compensatory Mechanisms</h3>
                        <p>C.C.F can have an abrupt onset as with acute myocardial infarction or can be a gradual/slow insidious process and thus the result of slow progressive changes. The overloaded heart results to certain compensatory mechanisms to try to maintain adequate cardiac output.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Sympathetic nervous system activation:</strong> Because there is inadequate stroke volume and cardiac output, the baro receptor reflexes cause sympathetic nervous system activation which increases the release of epinephrine and noreephrine. This results in an increased heart rate and myocardial contractility to raise cardiac output. This response also increases myocardial oxygen demand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dilatation:</strong> Is an enlargement of the chambers of the heart. It occurs when pressure in the left ventricle is elevated over time. The muscle fibres of the heart stretch and thereby increase their contractility force. However, this increased contractility produces greater wall tension and more myocardial oxygen is required for contraction. Therefore, dilatation is a mechanism developed to cope with increasing blood volume. After maximum hypertrophy dilatation becomes primary mechanism. Eventually it becomes inadequate because the elastic elements of the muscle fibres are overstrained. Dilatation can progress to mitral value incompetence and regurgitation which further increases the cardiac workload.</li>
                            <li><strong>Renal response to heart failure:</strong> As cardiac output falls, blood flow to the kidneys decreases causing decreased glomeruli filtration. A complex reaction begins, the kidneys release rennin which reacts with angiotensinogen to form angiotensin then this causes;
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>The adrenal cortex to release aldersterone which causes sodium retention.</li>
                                    <li>Increased vaso constriction which increases the arterial pressure.</li>
                                    <li>The posterior pituitary senses the increased osmotic pressure due to sodium retention and secrets anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).</li>
                                    <li>ADH increases water reabsorption in the renal tubules causing water retention.</li>
                                    <li>The decreased renal blood flow also stimulates the secretion of ADH. The cycle repeats itself creating a downward spiral of a client's condition, since vaso constriction increases after load and causes an increased workload on the heart.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Hypertrophy:</strong> In chronic congestive heart failure, hypertrophy is an increase in the muscle mass and the cardiac wall thickens due to overwork and strain. It occurs slowly because it takes time for muscle tissue to develop. As myocardial mass increases, the need for additional blood and oxygen grows. This cannot be met in the client with heart disease.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>The clinical manifestations of chronic C.C.F depend on:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Age</li>
                            <li>Underlying type</li>
                            <li>Extent of heart disease</li>
                            <li>Which ventricle is failing to pump blood effectful.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>These manifestations include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fatigue</li>
                            <li>Dysponea</li>
                            <li>Tachycardia</li>
                            <li>Oedema</li>
                            <li>Nocteuria</li>
                            <li>Skin changes</li>
                            <li>Behavioural changes</li>
                            <li>Chest pain</li>
                            <li>Cough</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Is one of the earliest symptoms of chronic C.C.F. The client notices fatigue after activities that normally aren't tiering. The fatigue is due to impaired circulation and oxygenation of tissues. It is sometimes described as 'sick fatigue' because of the decreased amount of blood reaching the musculo skeletal system.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dysponea:</strong> Is a common sign of chronic C.C.F. It is caused by increased pulmonary pressures secondary to interstitial and alveolar oedema. This results in fluid poor gaseous exchange because of fluid in the alveolar. The shortness of breath makes the client short of air hunger that prompts rapid shallow respirations. Dysponea can occur with mild exertion or at rest. Othopnoea is shortness of breath that occurs when a client is in a recumbent position.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tachycardia:</strong> Because cardiac output is diminished there is an increased sympathetic nervous system stimulation to compensate for low output (It is important to remember that cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate). If the stroke volume decreases, the heart rate increases to maintain the cardiac output.</p>
                        <p><strong>Oedema:</strong> Is a common sign of C.C.F. It may occur in the legs (peripheral oedema), liver (hepatomagaly), abdominal cavity (ascites), lungs (pulmonary oedema and pleural effusion). If the client is bedfast, sacral oedema is mostly likely to develop pressing the oedematous skin with a finger may leave a transient indelitation (pitting oedema). The development of dependent oedema and or a sudden weight gain 2 kg or more is often indicative of exacerbated congestive failure.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nocturia:</strong> A personwith chronic C.C.F will have decreased cardiac output, impaired renal perfusion and decreased urinary output during the day. However, when the person lies down at night, fluid movement from the interstitial spaces back into the circulatory system is enhanced. This causes increased renal blood flow and dieresis. The client may complain of having to avoid 6 or 7 times during the night.</p>
                        <p><strong>Skin Changes:</strong> Because tissue capillary oxygen extractions increased in a person with chronic C.C.F, the skin appears dusky, it is also called cold and diaphrotic to touch. The peripheral vaso constriction that occurs to sheent blood to the vital organs is a minor compensatory mechanism in chronic C.C.F.</p>
                        <p><strong>Behavioural Changes:</strong> Cerebral circulation may be impaired with chronic C.C.F especially in the presence of more widespread arteriosclerosis. The client or family may report unusual behavior including restlessness, confusion and decreased attention span or memory. These behavioural changes occur most often at night possibly because the client is experiencing more stimulation than during the day.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chest Pain:</strong> In the presence of arteriosclerosis, C.C.F can precipitate chest pain because of decreased coronary perfusion from decreased cardiac output and increased myocardial work. Angina type of pain may accompany C.C.F whether it is acute or chronic. Others will be as per the side the failure has occurred.</p>

                        <p>The primary goal in the diagnosis is to determine the underlying cause of heart failure. Diagnostic measures to assess the degree of heart failure include:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>History and physical examination.</li>
                            <li>Chest x-ray film.</li>
                            <li>ECG.</li>
                            <li>Exercise stress testing.</li>
                            <li>Echocardiograph: To measure the size of cardiac chambers and to assess ventricular function.</li>
                            <li>Cardiac catheterization and angiography are useful in detecting the underling heart disease.</li>
                            <li>Haemodynamic monitoring via a pulmonary artery catheter which provides for a mean of directly assessing cardiac function.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classifications of Persons with C.C.F Based on the Persons Tolerance to Physical Activity (By New York Heart Association)</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>There is class one:</strong> There is no limitation on physical activity and ordinary physical activity not resulting in symptoms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Class II:</strong> Slight limitation on physical activity, no symptoms at rest but symptoms possible with ordinary physical activity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Class III:</strong> There are more severe limitations. Client may be comfortable at rest but clinical manifestations will show with slight physical activities.</li>
                            <li><strong>Class IV:</strong> Inability to carry on any activity without producing symptoms and symptoms are also possible at rest.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Therapeutic Management</h3>
                        <p>Treatment of underlying cause is one of the most important goals of reaction for C.C.F. For example;</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Dysrrythymias have precipitated the failure they should be treated accordingly.</li>
                            <li>Hypertension is the cause antihypertensive drugs should help.</li>
                            <li>Valvular defects are the cause surgery is required.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oxygen therapy:</strong> Oxygen is given to the patient at 2 to 6 litres per minute. This is because in a person with C.C.F, oxygen circulation of the blood is reduced because the blood is not adequately oxygenated at the lungs. Therefore, administration of oxygen improves circulation and assists greatly in meeting tissue oxygen needs. Thus oxygen therapy helps to relieve dysponea and fatigue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Physical and emotional rest allows the client to conserve energy and decreases the need for additional oxygen. The degree of rest recommended depends on the severity of heart failure. For example, a patient with severe C.C.F needs to be on complete best rest while the one with mild C.C.F can be combulatory with restriction of strenuous activities.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pharmacological Therapy</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(i) Digitalis Preparations</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>This increase the;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Force/strength of cardiac contraction.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>They also; decrease the conduction speed within the myocardium and show the heart rate. This action provides more complete emptying of the ventricles thus diminishing the volume remaining in the ventricles during diastole cardiac output increases because of an increased stroke volume from improved contractility.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>Dosage</h5>
                        <p>Usually 0.25 mgs d or od. At times the patient may be given 0.5 to 1 mg I.V. or I.M. then followed by 0.25 mgs . For children and old patients, the dosage is reduced to 0.025 mgs daily.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(ii) Diuretics</h4>
                        <p>These are used in heart failure to mobilize oedematous fluid, reduce pulmonary venous pressure.</p>
                        <p>To reduce preload</p>
                        <p>If excess vascular volume is excreted, blood volume returning to the heart can be reduced and thus improved cardiac function. Thiazides are usually the first choice, because they are useful in treating oedema secondary to C.C.F as well as in controlling hypertension.</p>
                        <p>Example: Lasix (frusemide: Dose 40 to 80 mgs depending on the severity of oedema I.V., I.M. or orally.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(iii) Vaso Dilator Drugs</h4>
                        <p>These reduce systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary and peripheral venous pressure. This increases left ventricular preload thus myocardial function is enhanced and myocardial oxygen demand is lessened. These drugs include:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Angiotensin converting enzymes inhibitors.</li>
                            <li>Calcium channel brokers etc.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">(iv) For the Cough</h4>
                        <p>The patient is given cough mixture or mist or expectorant</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nutritional Considerations</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The oedema of chronic C.C.F is often treated by dietry restriction of sodium. A diet for a client with C.C.F should have 2 g of sodium.</li>
                            <li>The diet such as milk, cheese, breach, cereals, vegetables, canned foods must be eliminated from the patient's diet.</li>

                            <li><strong>Pulmonary Oedema:</strong> Which is a term used to refer to an acute life threatening situation in which the lung alveolar become filled with serosanguinous fluid.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pleural Effusion:</strong> Resulting from increasing pressure in the pleural capillaries. A transdation of fluid occurs from these capillaries into the pleural space.</li>
                            <li><strong>Left Ventricular Thrombus:</strong> With acute or chronic C.C.F, the enlarged ventricle left and poor cardiac output combines to increase the chance of thrombus formation in the left ventricle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hepatomegaly:</strong> C.C.F can lead to severe hepatomegaly. The liver lobules become congested with venous blood. The hepatic congestion leads to impaired liver function functionally live cells die, fibrosis occurs and liver cirrhosis can develop.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weight Changes:</strong> Initially there may be a progressive weight gain due to fluid retention. The client with C.C.F has an increased metabolic rate. Abdominal fullness from ascites and hepatomegaly frequently causes anorexia and nausea. Late the patient decreases in weight, the patient becomes too sick to eat and there is decreased oxygen and nutrients transported to the tissues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Decompensasted Heart Failure:</strong> When the compensatory mechanisms of dilatation, hypertrophy and tachycardia function to provide adequate output to maintain tissue oxygenation. The patient has compensated heart failure when these mechanisms can no longer assist the heart in maintaining cardiac output, the patient has decompensated heart failure and this state is very fatal.</li>

                            <li><strong>Sub-Acute:</strong> This form has a longer clinical of more insidious onset with less toxicity and the causative organism is usually of low virulence. Most often streptococcus viridian.</li>
                            <li><strong>Acute Form:</strong> Has a shorter clinical course with a more rapid onset increased toxicity and a more pathogenic/virulent causative micro organism that is staphylococcus aureous.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <p>Initially it was being caused by bacteria but of late micro organisms such as fungi, Chlamydia and rickettseal have been identified.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: These micro organisms get entry into the heart because of surgical interventions, intravenous injections and invasive diagnostic procedures.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <p>The vegetation form that is the primary lesions of infective endocarditis consist of fibrin, leucocytes, platelets and microbes that adhere to the value surface or endocardium. The loss of these fragile vegetations into the circulation results in embolisation. In left sided heart vegetations systemic embolisation occurs progressing to the organs particularly the kidney, spleen and brain and there may be limp infarction. Right sided heart lesions embolise to the lungs. The infarction may be spread locally to cause damage to the values or to their supporting structures. The resulting valvular incompetence and eventual invasion of the myocardium in the ongoing disease results in C.C.F, generalized myocardial dysfunction and continued sepsis.</p>

                        <p>Patient with infective endocartitis require hospitalization for 2 to 4 weeks. Physical assessment and history taking are done. In particular, there should be frequent monitoring of body temperature as fever is one of the common early signs. Measures to reduce fever are employed. Bed rest is necessary when there is fever or complications such as heart done are present. Otherwise, the patient may be ambulant and perform moderate activities. Heart sounds should be assessed with vital signs to detect a change in the character of the cardiac murmur and presence of extra diastolic sounds. Altalgia is a common problem and may involve multiple joints and be accompanied by myelgia. The patient should be assessed for joint tenderness, range of motions and muscle tenderness. The oral mucousa, conjunctiva, upper chest and lower extremities should be examined for petechial (bleeding spots of blood under skin). A general assessment of systems should be completed to facilitate recognition of haemolynamic and embolic complications.</p>
