                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Classification of Thrombophlebitis</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Superficial</li>
                            <li>Deep</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>In about 65% of all parts receiving I.V. therapy superficial thrombophlebitis develops because of immobility.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Of great significance is that embolisation of thrombi from deep veins to the lungs may be fatal and at the least result in prolonged hospitalized.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes of Thrombophlebitis</h3>
                        <p>Three important of aetiology causes are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Stasis low of veneous flow.</li>
                            <li>Damage of the endothelial/inner layer/lining of the vein.</li>
                            <li>Hyper coagulability of the blood.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Therefore, clients who are at high risk for development of thrombophlebitis are those who have conditions predisposing them to any of these three disorders.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">i) How Venous Stasis comes about.</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Normal blood flow in the veneous system depends on the action of muscles in;</li>
                            <li>The extremities and on the functional adequacy of veneous values allowing flow in one direction only. Veneous stasis occurs if the values are disfunctional or if the muscles of the extremities are inactive. It usually occurs in people who are obese; those with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF); those who are immobile for long periods; •also pregnant women and women in the post partum period and • Age.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Clients with arterial fibrillation are also at high risk because of stagnation of blood and the adding of blood flow caused by irregular ventricular contractions in response to fibrilations.</p>
                        <p>Drugs: Like steroids and quinine also predispose patients to stasis and clot formation.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ii) Endothelial Damage</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Damage in the lining of the vein is caused by trauma or external pressure and occurs any time a vein- puncture is performed.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Damaged endothelium has decreased fibrinolytic properties predisposing to development of thrombus.</p>
                        <ol type="b" start="2">
                            <li>Increased endothelial damage can also be sustained when clients receiving I.V. therapy are receiving high dose antibiotics; potassium; chemotherapeutic agents or hypertonic solutions such as contrast media.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Other Factors Predisposing to Endothelial Inflammation or Damage are:</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Presence of I.V. catheter in the same site for longer than 48 hours.</li>
                            <li>Use of contaminated I.V. equipment.</li>
                            <li>A fracture that also causes damage to the blood vessels.</li>
                            <li>Diabetes.</li>
                            <li>Burns.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">iii) Hyper Coagulation of Blood</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>This occurs in many haemolytic disorders particularly, polycythermia, severe anaemia and anti thrombin (III) deficiency.</li>
                            <li>Clients with systematic infection in which endotoxins are released also have hypercogulability.</li>
                            <li>Clients who take oral contraceptives especially those containing oestrogen are at great risk of thrombo-embolic disease.</li>
                            <li>Smoking may cause hyper congulability.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and fibrin adhere to form a thrombosis.</li>
                            <li>A frequent site of a thrombus formation is the value of cusps of veins where veneous stasis allows accumulation of blood products. As the thrombus;</li>
                            <li>Enlarges increased amounts of blood cells and fibrin collect around it producing a large tain with a 'tail' that eventually occludes the;</li>
                            <li>Lumen of the vein. If a thrombus only partially occludes the vein of the blood flow continuous, the thrombus becomes covered by;</li>
                            <li>Endothelial cells and the thrombotic process stops. If the thrombus does not become detached, it undergoes lysis or becomes firmly organized and adherent within 24 to 48 hours. The organized thrombi may detach giving rise to embolic. This embolic flow through the veneous circulation back to the heart and into the pulmonary circulation resulting to pulmonary embolism.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>They vary according to the size and location of the thrombus and the adequacy of collateral circulation around the obstructive process.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clients with superficial thrombophlebites may have a palpable firm sub-cutaneous cordlike vein. The area surrounding the vein may be tender to touch, reddened and warm. There may be raised systemic temperature and ceuco cytosis. There may be also oedema of the affected part.</li>
                            <li>Clients with deep thrombophlebites may have no symptoms or have unilateral (1) leg oedema, pain, warm skin and a temperature of greater than $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>If the cuff is involved, tenderness may be present on palpation with Homan's sign or dorse flexion of the foot.</li>
                            <li>If the inferior vena cava is involved both lower may extremities may be,</li>
                            <li>Oedematous and cyanotic. If the superior vena cava is involved both upper extremities as well as the neck and back become oedematous and cyanotic.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management</h3>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Diagnostic Studies</h4>
                        <p>Various diagnostic studies are used to determine the site and extent of the thrombus.</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Coagulation Studies: Platelet count, bleeding time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time is checked.</li>
                            <li>Venous Doppler Evaluation: Is determination of veneous flow in deep removal, popliteal and posterior tibial veins.</li>
                            <li>There is also Venogram: Is a radiographic definition of location and site of clot. It can also have felling defect in vein lumen and development of collateral circulation.</li>
                            <li>Lung Scan (Ventilation and Perfusion): Is a means of determining presence of pulmonary embolism and extent of resulting lung damage.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary Arteriogram: Used to define the location and size of pulmonary embolism.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Therapeutic mx (Conservative mx)</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient is usually kept in bed after diagnosis with elevation of the affected extremity until the tenderness has subsided usually 5-7 days.</li>
                            <li>Warm moist heat may be used to relieve the pain and treat the inflammation.</li>
                            <li>Mild oral analysis such as asprin and codein are used to relieve pain for more severe pain non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents i.e. Ibubrufen may be used to treat inflammatory causes and to relieve pain.</li>
                            <li>Anti-coagulant therapy is usually used for deep vein thrombophebites and not superficial. The patient gets heparin I.V. for 10 days followed Warfaxin which is anticoagulant for 3 days.</li>
                            <li>If oedema is present when the client becomes ambulant, elastic stockings are recommended. If oedema persists the use of elastic stockings should be continued after discharge.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical Intervention</h4>
                        <p>Most clients are treated conservatively but a small percentage requires surgieal intervention. The primary indication for surgical intervention is to prevent pulmonary emboli.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical Procedures Involved</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Veneous Thromboectomy: Removal of an occluding clot through an incision in the vein.</li>
                            <li>Interior nerve cava interruption: To prevent pulmonary emboli and the surgeon uses teflen clips.</li>
                            <li>Intracaval filter insertion: Done to patients who are very ill to undergo major surgery and it involves a caval filter device threaded into the right internal jugular vein and into the interior vena cava below the level of the renal veins through local anaesthesia.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pharmacological Management</h3>
                        <p>The goals of anticoagulant therapy in the reaction of thrombophletes are to prevent:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Progression of the clot.</li>
                            <li>Development of a new thrombus.</li>
                            <li>Embolisation</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>NOTE: Anticoagulant therapy does not dissolve the clot. Lysis of the clot begins simultaneously through the body's intrinsic fibrinolytic system.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Precautions when using Anticoagulants</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Intramuscular injection of any drug is contra-indicated for patients receiving anticoagulants because of the risk of haematoma complications.</li>
                            <li>Patients on I.V. hepaxin shouldn't be given antibiotics and hydrocortisone co-currently because drug interaction may occur. The patient receiving anticoagulant therapy should be advised to seek medical advice before starting to take other medications.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Other drugs used apart from anticoagulants include indocine; Aspirin, Buta zelodine etc. These drugs alter platelet function.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>It is the most common pulmonary complication in hospitalized patients. Most pulmonary emboli arise from the thrombi in the deep veins in the legs. Other sides of origin include the right side of the heart especially with arterial fibrillation, upper extremities and the pelvic veins especially after surgery or child birth. Fatal pulmonary emboli originate most commonly in the removal and iliac veins.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Pathophysiology</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Emboli: Are mobile clots that generally don't stop moving until they;</li>
                            <li>Lodge at a narrowed part of the circulating system. The lungs are an ideal location for the emboli to lodge due to its extensive antiriot and capillary network.</li>
                            <li>The lower lobes are most frequently affected because they have a higher blood flow than other lobes.</li>
                            <li>Thrombus in the deep veins can dislodge spontaneously but a common.............is jarring of the thrombus by mechanical forces such as a sudden standing and changes in the rate of blood flow. In addition to dislodged thrombi, other causes of primary thrombi include cur emboli from improperly administered I.V. therapy, pulmonary emboli from fractured bone, amniotic fluid and tumours.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
                        <p>The severity of the clinical manifestations depends on the size of the emboli and the number of blood vessels occluded.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sudden onset of unexplained dysponea, tachpnoeaor and tachycardia.</li>
                            <li>Cough, chest pain, haemophysis, rales,fever, a ceasation of the pulmonic heart sound.</li>
                            <li>Sudden change in mentally as a result of mental.</li>
                            <li>Massive emboli may cause sudden collapse of patient with shock pallor, severe dysponoea and crushing chest pain.</li>
                            <li>The pulse is rapid and weak.</li>
                            <li>Blood pressure is low and ECG indicates right ventricular strain.</li>
                            <li>When rapid obstruction of 50% or more of the pulmonary vascular bed occurs, acute pulmonare may result because the ventricles can no longer pump blood into the lungs.</li>
                            <li>Death occurs in more than 60% of people with massive emboli.</li>
                            <li>Medium sized emboli often cause chloratic chest pain accompanied by dysponea, slight fever and a productive cough with blood stained sputum.</li>
                            <li>Physical examination may indicate tachycardia and a pleural friction rub.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>History and physical examination.</li>
                            <li>Lung scan.</li>
                            <li>Chest x-ray film.</li>
                            <li>Continuous ECG monitoring.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary angiography.</li>

                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Treatment</h3>
                        <p>When the diagnosis of thrombo embolic disease has been made, treatment musts be instituted immediately as this is a medical emergency.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Emergency Therapy</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Patient be put in bed in a sitting up position.</li>
                            <li>Resuscitative measures carried out.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen is administered by mask or canula.</li>
                            <li>Establishments of I.V. root for drugs and I.V. infusions.</li>
                            <li>Patient is given continuous I.V. heparine 100 mgs , morphine 10-15 mg I.V., Stat and PRN.</li>
                            <li>Pulmonary embolectomy in life threatening situations may be done.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Objectives of Therapeutic Management (Treatment)</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To prevent further growth/multiplication of thrombi I the lower extremities.</li>
                            <li>To prevent embolization from the lower extremities to the pulmonary arteries.</li>
                            <li>To provide cardio pulmonary support in indicated.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Conservative Therapy</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient requires cardio pulmonary support where there is administration of oxygen by mask and canella and in some conditions endocardial intabation and mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain respiration.</li>
                            <li>Respiration measures such as turning, coughing and deep breathing are necessary to prevent/treat atelectasis (lung collapse).</li>
                            <li>If shock is present, vaso pressor agents may be necessary to support circulation.</li>
                            <li>If heart failure is present, digitalis and diuretics are used.</li>
                            <li>Pain resulting from pleural irritation or reduced coronary blood flow is treated with narcotics usually morphine.</li>
                            <li>Property managed anticoagulant therapy is very effective in patients/clients with pulmonary emboli.</li>
                            <li>Heparin and warfarin may be given. Start with heparin and continue with warfarin.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Surgical Intervention</h4>
                        <p>If the degree of pulmonary arterial obstruction is severe, usually greater than 50% and the patient does not respond to conservative therapy, immediate embolectomy may be indicated. This is possible with the use of temporally cardio pulmonary bypass.</p>
                        <p>NOTE: Thrombolytic agent i.e. Urokinese and streptokinase have been shown to dissolve pulmonary emboli within 24 to 48 hours. Both agents have been suggested for use in patients with massive emboli or in whom surgery is contra-indicated.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Management</h3>
                        <p>The prognosis/outcome of a client with pulmonary emboli is good if therapy is promptly precipitated/instituted.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The patient is kept in bed in a semi follows position to facilitate breathing.</li>
                            <li>Patent I.V. line maintained for medication and I.V. line therapy.</li>
                            <li>Oxygen therapy be administered as per arterial blood gases results.</li>
                            <li>Careful monitoring of vital signs; ECG, blood gases and lung sounds is critical to assess the patient's status.</li>
                            <li>The client is usually anxious because of pain, inability to breathe and fear of death. The nurse should carefully explain the situation and provide emotional support and reassurance and help thus to relieve the patient's anxiety.</li>
                            <li>During the acute time, someone must be with the patient as much as possible.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Subsequent Management</h4>
                        <p>Clients affected by thrombo embolic processes require much psychological and emotional support. Because in addition with thrombo embolic process, they may be underlying another (underlying illness requiring lung treatment). Discharge planning is aimed at limiting progress of the condition and preventing complication thus the nurse therefore must reinforce the patient need to return to the health care facilities and follow up.</p>
