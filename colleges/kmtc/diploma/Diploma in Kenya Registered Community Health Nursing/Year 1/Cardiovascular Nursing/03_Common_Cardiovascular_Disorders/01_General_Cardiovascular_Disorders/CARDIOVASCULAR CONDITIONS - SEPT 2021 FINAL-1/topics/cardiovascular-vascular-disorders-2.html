                        <ul>
                            <li>Varicose veins are caused by weakened valves and veins in your legs.</li>
                            <li>Normally, one-way valves in your veins keep blood flowing from your legs up toward your heart.</li>
                            <li>When these valves do not work as they should, blood collects in your legs, and pressure builds up. The veins become weak, large and twisted.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">TYPES:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Saphenous varicose veins:</strong> these involve the saphenous veins in the legs, which swell significantly larger than their intended size and bulge out from the skin. The veins appear very large and rope-like. This type of varicose veins can be colorless but are just as noticeable because they protrude out.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reticular varicose veins:</strong> these spread like a mesh and cover a wider area on the skin. They are typically thicker and appear in red, green or purple hues. They don't necessarily bulge out but they can be unsightly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spider Veins:</strong> these are smaller in size, red or blue in color and are common anywhere on the body. They typically spread in a web shape taker than a mesh shape and are also thinner and smaller than other varicose</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Types ct...</strong></p>
                        <p>Spider Veins: these are smaller in size, red or blue in color and are common anywhere on the body. They typically spread in a web shape rather than a mesh shape and are also thinner and smaller than other varicose veins.</p>
                        <p>They are grouped into two:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Primary: without involvement of deep veins</li>
                            <li>Secondary: resulting from obstruction of the deep veins</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: In both there is reflux of venous blood in the veins in which result in stasis of blood. If any superficial vein is affected the patient may nothave symptoms but may be troubled</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Risk factors:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Age</strong> - Aging causes wear and tear on the valves in your veins that help regulate blood flow, eventually, causing the valves to allow some blood to flow back into your veins where it collects instead of flowing up to your heart.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sex</strong> - Women are more affected due to hormonal changes before periods, during pregnancy or menopause as female hormones tend to relax vein walls. Hormone treatments, such as birth control pills, might increase your risk of varicose veins.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pregnancy.</strong> During pregnancy, the volume of blood in your body increases to support the growing fetus, but also predispose to varicose-vains as a side effect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Family history</strong> - If other family members had varicose veins, the greater chance.</li>
                            <li>Chronically increased intra-abdominal pressure due to obesity, pregnancy, chronic constipation, or a tumor</li>
                            <li>Standing or sitting for long periods of time and Constricting garments - poor venous return.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Signs and Symptoms:</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes Varicose veins may not cause any pain but signs may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Veins that are dark purple or blue in color</li>
                            <li>Veins that appear twisted and bulging; they are often like cords on your legs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When painful signs and symptoms occur, they may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An achy or heavy feeling in your legs</li>
                            <li>Burning, throbbing, muscle cramping and swelling in your lower legs</li>
                            <li>Worsened pain after sitting or standing for a long time</li>
                            <li>Itching around one or more of your veins</li>
                            <li>Skin discoloration around a varicose vein</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Diagnosis:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simple physical examination</li>
                            <li>Doppler (Duplex) ultrasound to determine the cause - The picture shows the blood flow and helps the vascular specialist locate any damaged valves that might be causing the varicose veins</li>
                            <li>AIR plethysmography - a non-invasive test that can quantify venous reflux and obstruction by measuring volume changes in the leg.</li>
                            <li>Venography - evaluating Valvular reflux</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The choice of treatment depends on symptoms and patient preferences, potential for complications, presence or absence of deep venous insufficiency and the characteristics of the affected veins can also help guide treatment.</li>
                            <li>Treatment options for varicose veins include: conservative management and interventional therapies such as thermal ablation endovenous sclerotherapy and surgery</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management ct...</h3>
                        <p>Conservative management is a type of medical treatment defined by the avoidance of invasive measures such as surgery or other invasive procedures, usually with the intent to preserve function or body parts. It includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lifestyle modifications - avoidance of prolonged standing/ sitting/ straining, exercise, wearing nonrestrictive clothing, modification of cardiovascular risk factors and interventions to reduce peripheral edema, elevation of the affected leg, weight loss and phlebotonics oral and topical therapies that may increase venous tone, improve capillary hyper permeability, and decrease blood viscosity with the goal of decreasing symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency. They include flavonoids or other compounds LIKE Diosmiplex</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Interventional management:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Thermal Ablation</strong> - this destroys damaged veins using an external laser or via endovenous catheter using a laser. Heat from the laser or radio waves coagulates the blood in the vein, resulting in closure of the vein and redirection of blood flow to functional veins</li>
                            <li><strong>Endovenous Sclerotherapy:</strong> Endovenous sclerotherapy involves using ultrasound guidance to inject superficial veins with an agent that causes inflammation of the endothelium, resulting in fibrosis and occlusion in the vein. Sclerotherapy is typically used for small ( 1 to 3 mm ) and medium ( 3 to 5 mm ) veins or to treat recurrent varicose veins after surgery; however, there is not a precise diameter used to make treatment decisions</li>
                            <li>Surgery to tie (ligation) and stripping off the great or small saphenous vein is done after the failure of conservative therapy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing Management:</h3>

                            <li>Elevate the foot of the bed and Exercising - to improve venous return</li>
                            <li>Teach prevention techniques - Advice patient on importance of avoiding very tight socks and pants, avoid knee-length stockings, standing or sitting for a long period of time, constrictive clothing and apply anti-embolic stockings as directed, avoid excess weight gain, avoid crossing of legs when sitting and avoid high heels</li>
                            <li>HEALTH EDUCATION; on diet - high fiber and low-salt diet to prevent constipation / straining on defecation which can cause compression and dilatation of both superficial and deep veins in the legs</li>
                            <li>HOME BASED CARE - encourage exercises</li>

                        <p>Inflammation may precede or follow formation of the clot. Because movement of the blood through veins depends upon contractions of the muscles, prolonged inactivity (such as bed rest after a surgical procedure or during convalescence from a serious illness) may lead to insufficient movement of the blood through the veins, with resultant formation of clots and inflammation. The condition most often affects the legs. There may be pain at the site of the blockage or throbbing pain throughout the leg</p>

                        <p>EMBOLISM is the obstruction of the blood vessel by a travelling blood clot or any travelling matter. It is the process by which unattached material (emboli) such as a blood clot, fat or cholesterol deposit, gas, tissue or foreign material travels within the bloodstream and occludes flow within a vessel</p>
                        <p>Emboli is the detached material that travels through the bloodstream, lodges in a blood vessel and blocks it.</p>
                        <p>A thrombus is a blood clot that forms in a vein.</p>
                        <p>An embolus is anything that moves through the blood vessels until it reaches a vessel that is too small to let it pass. When this happens, the blood flow is stopped by the embolus.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An embolus is often a small piece of a blood clot that breaks off (thrombo embolus). It may also be fat, air, amniotic fluid, a tumour or a foreign substance such as talc, iodine, cotton or a tiny piece of catheter tube.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Causes:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The primary cause of embolism is deep vein thrombosis, a condition in which blood clots form in the large veins of the lower extremities, such as in the thigh or lower leg. If the blood clot breaks free from the wall of the vein, it can travel through the bloodstream and cause an embolism by blocking an artery.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: Thrombi -a blood clot formed in situ within the vascular system of the body and impeding blood flow. An embolus is often a small piece of a blood clot that breaks off (thromboembolus).</p>
                        <p>Other causes:<br>Atherosclerosis (buildup of plaque on the walls of the coronary arteries; atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis<br>Endocarditis (inflammation of the lining and valves of the heart)</p>

                            <li>Cancer, previous surgery, a broken leg or hip, and genetic conditions affecting the blood cells that increase the chance of blood clot formation. Being overweight or obese, Smoking cigarettes.</li>
                            <li>Taking birth control pills (oral contraceptives) or hormone replacement therapy, having diseases such as stroke, paralysis, chronic heart disease or high blood pressure</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pulmonary embolism:</strong> A blockage of the blood vessel of the lung. The blood clots causing pulmonary embolism usually originates in deep veins of legs or sometimes in deep veins of other body parts (due to DVT). These clots migrate to the lung and block the artery. It can even cause death.</li>
                            <li><strong>Brain embolism:</strong> A blockage of the blood vessel of the brain. It can cause a brain stroke. It usually results from the blood clots formed in the heart.</li>
                            <li><strong>Retinal embolism:</strong> A blockage formed within the blood vessel of the retina (eye). It can cause sudden blindness of the eye.</li>

                            <li>A computerised tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to see the blood vessels in your lungs. This is when you are injected with a dye that helps to show your blood vessels. Then a scanner uses X-rays to build a detailed picture of the blood flow in your lungs.</li>
                            <li>A ventilation-perfusion scan, also called a V/Q scan or isotope lung scanning, to examine the flow of air and blood in your lungs. You will be asked to inhale a slightly radioactive gas and given an injection of slightly radioactive material. The radioactivity in this test is considered low risk to adults, however women who are, or might be, pregnant should tell the radiographer. If the scan shows parts of your lungs have air in them but no blood supply, this may be the result of a pulmonary embolism.</li>

                            <li>Thrombolytics - which quickly dissolve large blood clots in severe or life-threatening cases of embolism</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Procedures to treat embolism</h3>
                        <p>If blood flow is completely or almost completely blocked, these procedures may be opted for:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Angioplasty:</strong> in which the blocked blood vessel is widened by inflating a balloon-like catheter in the vessel. A small mesh tube called a stent may be placed inside the blood vessel to keep it open.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arterial bypass:</strong> in which the blocked artery is bypassed with a vessel harvested from another part of your body or with manufactured tubing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Management ct...</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Embolectomy:</strong> in which the blood clot is removed with a catheter or open surgery. A catheter is a flexible tube inserted into a vein in the upper thigh or arm and then guided though the veins to reach the blood clot.</li>
                            <li><strong>Intravenous filter placement:</strong> to stop future clots from traveling upstream.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preventive measures of embolism</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use of compression clothing such as compression stockings is helpful in preventing deep vein thrombosis which in turn can prevent pulmonary embolism. The compression stocking presses the legs allowing the blood to flow easily from the veins of legs.</li>
                            <li>Leg elevation or keeping the leg raised during travel and nighttime sleep and massaging the legs are efficient ways to lower the chances of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.</li>
                            <li>ENCOURAGE AMBULATION: Moving as soon as possible after surgery can help prevent pulmonary embolism</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Prevention ct...</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A surgery known as thrombectomy can be used to remove the clot which prevents the embolism.</li>
                            <li>Regular exercise such as walking and stretching along with proper diet and hydration are recommended to avoid risk of embolism.</li>
                            <li>administration of blood thinner medicines such as aspirin or heparin. These are given before and after surgery to prevent blood clots resulting from surgery and to a person suffering from heart disease, high blood pressure, and during stroke.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Nursing care:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Monitor vital signs</li>
                            <li>Prevent venous stasis. Encourage ambulation and active and passive leg exercises to prevent venous stasis.</li>
                            <li>Manage pain - administer analgesics as prescribed</li>
                            <li>Turn patient frequently and reposition to improve ventilationperfusion ratio.</li>
                            <li>Manage oxygen therapy. Assess for signs of hypoxemia and monitor the pulse oximetry values.</li>
                            <li>Relieve anxiety. Encourage the patient to talk about any fears or concerns related to this frightening episode</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>HOSPITALIZED immobile patients especially fracture patients are put on anti coagulants eg heparin</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Complications of embolus</h3>
                        <p>Pulmonary embolism can also lead to pulmonary hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure in your lungs and in the right side of the heart is too high. When you have obstructions in the arteries inside your lungs, your heart must work harder to push blood through those vessels, which increases blood pressure and eventually weakens your heart.</p>
