\section*{HYPERTENSION $7^{\text {TH }}$ JOINT NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON HYPERTNSION}

Need for JNC 7
(1) publication of many new hypertension observational studies and clinical trials
(2) need for a new, clear, and concise guideline that would be useful for clinicians
(3) need to simplify the classification of blood pressure
(4) clear recognition that the JNC reports were not being used to their maximum benefit

\section*{Classification of Hypertension}
-Classification of BP for adults ages 18 and older.
-The classification is based on the average of two or more properly measured seated BP readings on each of two or more office visits.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}

\end{tabular}

\section*{Cardiovascular disease risk}
-As the population ages, the prevalence of hypertension increases unless broad and effective preventive measures are implemented.
-Individuals who are normotensive at age 55 have a 90 percent lifetime risk for developing hypertension.
-The relationship between BP and risk of CVD events is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors.
The higher the BP, the greater is the chance
$\checkmark$ Heart attack
$\checkmark$ Heart failure
$\checkmark$ Stroke
$\checkmark$ Kidney disease.
-For individuals 40-70 years of age, across the entire BP range from $115 / 75$ to $185 / 115 \mathrm{mmHg}$ each increment of 20 mmHg SBP or 10 mmHg in DBP doubles the risk of CVD.
-The classification "prehypertension,", recognizes this relationship and signals the need for increased education of health care professionals and the public to reduce BP levels and prevent the development of hypertension in the general population.
Hypertension prevention strategies are available to achieve this eg Lifestyle Modifications

\section*{Benefits of lowering the Blood pressure}
-Antihypertensive therapy has been associated with reductions
- stroke incidence by 35-40\%
- myocardial infarction $20-25 \%$

\section*{Blood pressure control rates}
-Goal blood pressure treatment in hypertension is BP below $140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ or below $130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$ for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease.
-In the majority of patients, controlling systolic hypertension has been considerably more difficult than controlling diastolic hypertension.
-Systolic hypertension is a more important CVD risk factor than DBP except in patients younger than age 50 years. It also occurs much more commonly in older persons.
-Effective BP control can be achieved in most patients who are hypertensive, but the majority will require two or more antihypertensive drugs.
-Challenges in BP control
- Patient compliance to drug intake
- clinicians fail to prescribe lifestyle modifications
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug doses
- Inappropriate antihypertensive drug combinations
Accurate blood pressure measurement in the office
-The auscultatory method of BP measurement with a properly calibrated and validated instrument should be used.
-Persons should be seated quietly for at least 5 minutes in a chair (rather than on an exam table), with feet on the floor, and arm supported at heart level.
-Measurement of BP in the standing position is indicated periodically, especially in those at risk for postural hypotension.
-An appropriate-sized cuff (cuff bladder encircling at least 80 percent of the arm) should be used to ensure accuracy. -At least two measurements should be made. SBP is the point at which the first of two or more sounds is heard phase 1), and DBP is the point before the disappearance of sounds (phase 5).
-Clinicians should provide to patients, verbally and in writing, their specific BP numbers and BP goals.

MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION \\
Goals of Therapy \\
The ultimate public health goal of antihypertensive therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. \\
Since most persons with hypertension, especially those age >50 years, will reach the DBP goal once SBP is at goal, the primary focus should be on achieving the SBP goal. \\
Treating SBP and DBP to targets that are $<140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ is associated with a decrease in CVD complications. \\
In patients with hypertension and diabetes or renal disease the BP goal is $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$

\section*{SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS}

\section*{Ischemic Heart Disease}
-Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the most common form of target organ damage associated with hypertension.
-In patients with hypertension and stable angina pectoris, the first drug of choice is usually a BB; alternatively, long-acting CCBs can be used.
-In patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), hypertension should be treated initially with BBs and ACEIs, with addition of other drugs as needed for BP control.
-In patients with postmyocardial infarction, ACEIs, BBs, and aldosterone antagonists have proven to be most beneficial.
-Intensive lipid management and aspirin therapy are also indicated.

\section*{Heart Failure}
-Heart failure (HF), in the form of systolic or diastolic ventricular dysfunction, results primarily from systolic hypertension and IHD.
-Fastidious BP and cholesterol control are the primary preventive measures for those at high risk for HF. In asymptomatic individuals with demonstrable ventricular dysfunction, ACEIs and BBs are recommended.
-For those with symptomatic ventricular dysfunction or end-stage heart disease, ACEIs, BBs, ARBs and aldosterone blockers are recommended along with loop diuretics.

\section*{Diabetic Hypertension}
-Combinations of two or more drugs are usually needed to achieve the target goal of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
-Thiazide diuretics, BBs, ACEIs, ARBs, and CCBs are beneficial in reducing CVD and stroke incidence in patients with diabetes.
ACEI- or ARB-based treatments favorably affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy and reduce albuminuria and ARBs have been shown to reduce progression to macroalbuminuria.

\section*{Chronic Kidney Disease}

In people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by either
(1) reduced excretory function with an estimated GFR below $60 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ per 1.73 m 2 (corresponding approximately to a creatinine of $>1.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $>1.3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women)
(2) the presence of albuminuria ( $>300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day or 200 mg albumin/g creatinine), therapeutic goals are to slow deterioration of renal function and prevent CVD.
Hypertension appears in the majority of these patients, and they should receive aggressive BP management, often with three or more drugs to reach target BP values of $<130 / 80 \mathrm{mmHg}$.
ACEIs and ARBs have demonstrated favorable effects on the progression of diabetic and non diabetic renal disease. A limited rise in serum creatinine of as much as 35 percent above baseline with ACEIs or ARBs is acceptable and is not a reason to withhold treatment unless
-With advanced renal disease (estimated GFR $<30 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ 1.73 m 2 , corresponding to a serum creatinine of $2.5-3$ mg/dL), increasing doses of loop diuretics are usually needed in combination with other drug classes.

\section*{Cerebrovascular Disease}

The risks and benefits of acute lowering of BP during an acute stroke are still unclear; control of BP at intermediate levels (approximately $160 / 100 \mathrm{mmHg}$ ) is appropriate until the condition has stabilized or improved.
-Recurrent stroke rates are lowered by the combination of an ACEI and thiazide-type diuretic

\section*{Obesity and the metabolic syndrome}

Obesity (BMI $>30 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m} 2$ ) is an increasingly prevalent risk factor for the development of hypertension and CVD. Metabolic syndrome as the presence of three or more of the following conditions:
1) Abdominal obesity (waist circumference $>40$ inches in men or $>35$ inches in women)
2) Glucose intolerance (fasting glucose >110 $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )
3) $\mathrm{BP}>130 / 85 \mathrm{mmHg}$
4) High triglycerides ( $>150 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) or low HDL ( $<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in men or $<50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ in women).
Intensive lifestyle modification should be pursued in all individuals with the metabolic syndrome, and appropriate drug therapy should be instituted for each of its components as indicated.

\section*{Left ventricular hypertrophy}

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an independent risk factor that increases the risk of subsequent CVD. Regression of LVH occurs with aggressive BP management, including weight loss, sodium restriction, and treatment with all classes of antihypertensive agents except the direct vasodilators hydralazine, and minoxidil.

\section*{Peripheral arterial disease}

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is equivalent in risk to IHD. Any class of antihypertensive drugs can be used in most PAD patients. Other risk factors should be managed aggressively, and aspirin should be used.

\section*{Postural hypotension}

A decrease in standing SBP $>10 \mathrm{mmHg}$, when associated with dizziness or fainting, is more frequent in older patients with systolic hypertension, diabetes, and those taking diuretics, venodilators (e.g., nitrates, alphablockers, and sildenafil like drugs), and some psychotropic drugs.
BP in these individuals should also be monitored in the upright position. Caution should be used to avoid volume depletion and excessively rapid dose titration of antihypertensive drugs.
hyperkalemia develops.

\section*{Hypertension in women}

Oral contraceptives may increase BP, and the risk of hypertension increases with duration of use.
Women taking oral contraceptives should have their BP checked regularly. Development of hypertension is a reason to consider other forms of contraception. In contrast, menopausal hormone therapy does not raise BP .
Women with hypertension who become pregnant should be followed carefully because of increased risks to mother and fetus.
-Methyldopa, BBs, and vasodilators are preferred medications for the safety of the fetus.
-ACEI and ARBs should not be used during pregnancy because of the potential for fetal defects and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant. -Preeclampsia, which occurs after the 20th week of pregnancy, is characterized by new-onset or worsening hypertension, albuminuria, and hyperuricemia ,sometimes with coagulation abnormalities.
-In some patients, preeclampsia may develop into a hypertensive urgency or emergency and may require hospitalization, intensive monitoring, early fetal delivery, and parenteral antihypertensive and anticonvulsant therapy

\section*{Potential favorable effects of anti-hypertensives}
-Thiazide-type diuretics are useful in slowing demineralization in osteoporosis.
-BBs can be useful in the treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias/ fibrillation, migraine, thyrotoxicosis (short term), essential tremor, or perioperative hypertension.
-CCBs may be useful in Raynaud's syndrome and certain arrhythmias,
- Alpha-blockers may be useful in prostatism.

\section*{Potential unfavorable effects}
-Thiazide diuretics should be used cautiously in patients who have gout or who have a history of significant hyponatremia.
-BBs should generally be avoided in individuals who have asthma, reactive airways disease, or second or third degree heart block.
- ACEIs and ARBs should not be given to women likely to become pregnant and are contraindicated in those who are.
-ACEIs should not be used in individuals with a history of angioedema.
-Aldosterone antagonists and potassium-sparing diuretics can cause hyperkalemia and should generally be avoided in patients who have serum potassium values more than $5.0 \mathrm{mEq} / \mathrm{L}$ while not taking medications.

\section*{Resistant Hypertension}

Resistant hypertension is the failure to reach goal BP in patients who are adhering to full doses of an appropriate three-drug regimen that includes a diuretic.

\section*{Causes}
1.Improper BP Measurement
2. Identifiable Causes of Hypertension.
3.Volume Overload and Pseudo tolerance
- Excess sodium intake
- Volume retention from kidney disease
- Inadequate diuretic therapy
4.Drug-Induced or Other Causes
- Non adherence
- Inadequate doses
- Inappropriate combinations
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; cyclooxygenase

2 inhibitors
- Cocaine, amphetamines, other illicit drugs
- Sympathomimetics (decongestants, anorectics)
- Oral contraceptives
- Adrenal steroids
- Cyclosporine and tacrolimus
- Erythropoietin
- Licorice (including some chewing tobacco)
- Selected over-the-counter dietary supplements and medicines
(e.g., ephedra, ma haung, bitter orange)
5.Associated Conditions
- Obesity
- Excess alcohol intake

\section*{HYPERTENSION}
- Hypertension, commonly referred to as "high blood pressure", is a medical condition in which the blood pressure is chronically elevated
- Hypertension can be classified as either essential (primary) or secondary.
Essential hypertension indicates that no specific medical cause can be found to explain a patient's condition. Secondary hypertension indicates that the high blood pressure is a result of (i.e. secondary to) another condition, such as kidney disease or certain tumors (especially of the adrenal gland).

There are several categories of blood pressure, including:
- Prehypertension: 120-139/80-89
- Stage 1 hypertension: 140-159/90-99
- Stage 2 hypertension: 160-179 /100-109
- Stage 3 hypertension: 180 and above/ 110 and above.
- Persistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and arterial aneurysm, and is a leading cause of chronic renal failure
- Hypertension is considered to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is consistently 140 mmHg or greater, and/or their diastolic blood pressure is consistently 90 mmHg or greater

\section*{MEASURING BLOOD PRESSURE}
- Diagnosis of hypertension is generally on the basis of a persistently high blood pressure. Usually this requires three separate measurements at least one week apart. Exceptionally, if the elevation is extreme, or endorgan damage is present then the diagnosis may be applied and treatment commenced immediately.
- Obtaining reliable blood pressure measurements relies on following several rules and understanding the many factors that influence blood pressure reading

For instance, measurements in control of hypertension should be at least 1 hour after caffeine, 30 minutes after smoking and without any stress.
- Cuff size is also important. The bladder should encircle and cover two-thirds of the length of the upper arm.
- The patient should be sitting for a minimum of five minutes.
- The patient should not be on any adrenergic stimulants, such as those found in many cold medications.

\section*{ETIOLOGY OF SECONDARY HYPERTENSION}

\section*{Renal hypertension}
- Hypertension produced by diseases of the kidney. A simple explanation for renal vascular hypertension is that decreased perfusion of renal tissue due to stenosis of a main or branch renal artery activates the renin-angiotensin system.

Adrenal hypertension
- Hypertension is a feature of a variety of adrenal cortical abnormalities. In primary aldosteronism there is a clear relationship between the aldosterone-induced sodium retention and the hypertension.
- In patients with pheochromocytoma increased secretion of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine by a tumor (most often located in the adrenal medulla) causes excessive stimulation of [adrenergic receptors], which results in peripheral vasoconstriction and cardiac stimulation. This diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating increased urinary excretion of epinephrine and norepinephrine and/or their metabolites.
- Hypercalcemia
- Coarctation of the aorta
- Diet
- Certain medications, especially NSAIDS and steroids can cause hypertension. they inhibits the 11-hydroxysteroid hydrogenase enzyme which allows cortisol to stimulate the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) which will lead to effects similar to hyperaldosteronism, which itself is a cause of hypertension.

Advanced Age
- Over time, the number of collagen fibers in artery and arteriole walls increases, making blood vessels stiffer. With the reduced elasticity comes a smaller cross-sectional area in systole, and so a raised mean arterial blood pressure.

\section*{PATHOPHYSIOLOGY}
- Most of the secondary mechanisms associated with hypertension are generally fully understood, and are outlined at secondary hypertension. However, those associated with essential (primary) hypertension are far less understood. What is known is that cardiac output is raised early in the disease course, with total peripheral resistance (TPR) normal; over time cardiac output drops to normal levels but TPR is increased. Three theories have been proposed to explain this:
- Inability of the kidneys to excrete sodium, resulting in natriuretic factors such as Atrial Natriuretic Factor being secreted to promote salt excretion with the side-effect of raising total peripheral resistance.
- An overactive renin / angiotension system leads to vasoconstriction and retention of sodium and water. The increase in blood volume leads to hypertension.
- An overactive sympathetic nervous system, leading to increased stress responses.
- It is also known that hypertension is highly heritable and polygenic (caused by more than one gene) and a few candidate genes have been postulated in the etiology of this condition.

\section*{SIGNS \& SYMPTOMS}
- Hypertension is usually found incidentally - "case finding" - by healthcare professionals during a routine checkup. The only test for hypertension is a blood pressure measurement. Hypertension in isolation usually produces no symptoms although some people report headaches, fatigue, facial flushing or tinnitus
- Malignant hypertension (or accelerated hypertension) is distinct as a late phase in the condition, and may present with headaches, blurred vision and end-organ damage.
- It is recognized that stressful situations can increase the blood pressure;
- Hypertension is often confused with mental tension, stress and anxiety. While chronic anxiety is associated with poor outcomes in people with hypertension, it alone does not cause it. Accelerated hypertension is associated with somnolence, confusion, visual disturbances, and nausea and vomiting (hypertensive encephalopathy).

\section*{TESTS COMMONLY PERFORMED IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED HPTN}
- Tests are undertaken to identify possible causes of secondary hypertension, and seek evidence for end-organ damage to the heart itself or the eyes (retina) and kidneys. Diabetes and raised cholesterol levels being additional risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease are also tested for as they will also require management.

Blood tests commonly performed include:
- Creatinine (renal function) - to identify both underlying renal disease as a cause of hypertension and conversely hypertension causing onset of kidney damage. Also a baseline for later monitoring the possible side-effects of certain antihypertensive drugs.
- Electrolytes (sodium, potassium)
- Glucose - to identify diabetes mellitus
- Cholesterol

Additional tests often include:
- Testing of urine samples for proteinuria - again to pick up underlying kidney disease or evidence of hypertensive renal damage.
- Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) - for evidence of the heart being under strain from working against a high blood pressure. Also may show resulting thickening of the heart muscle (left ventricular hypertrophy) or of the occurrence of previous silent cardiac disease
- Chest X-ray - again for signs of cardiac enlargement or evidence of cardiac failure.

\section*{HYPERTENSION URGENCIES AND EMERGENCIES}
- Hypertension is rarely severe enough to cause symptoms. These typically only surface with a systolic blood pressure over 240 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure over 120 mmHg . These pressures without signs of endorgan damage (such as renal failure) are termed "accelerated" hypertension. When end-organ damage is possible or already ongoing, but in absence of raised intracranial pressure, it is called hypertensive emergency.
- Hypertension under this circumstance needs to be controlled, but prolonged hospitalization is not necessarily required. When hypertension causes increased intracranial pressure, it is called malignant hypertension. Increased intracranial pressure causes papilledema , which is visible on ophthalmoscopic examination of the retina.

\section*{TREATMENT}

LIFE STYLE MODIFICATION
- Doctors recommend weight loss and regular exercise as the first steps in treating mild to moderate hypertension. These steps are highly effective in reducing blood pressure, although most patients with moderate or severe hypertension end up requiring indefinite drug therapy to bring their blood pressure down to a safe level.
- Discontinuing smoking does not directly reduce blood pressure, but is very important for people with hypertension because it reduces the risk of many dangerous outcomes of hypertension, such as stroke and heart attack. An increase in daily calcium intake has also been shown to be highly effective in reducing blood pressure.
- Mild hypertension is usually treated by diet, exercise and improved physical fitness. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low fat or fat-free dairy foods and moderate or low in sodium lowers blood pressure in people with hypertension.
- Dietary sodium (salt) may worsen hypertension in some people and reducing salt intake decreases blood pressure in a third of people. Many people choose to use a salt substitute to reduce their salt intake.
- Regular mild exercise improves blood flow, and helps to lower blood pressure. In addition, fruits, vegetables, and nuts have the added benefit of increasing dietary potassium, which offsets the effect of sodium and acts on the kidney to decrease blood pressure.
- Reduction of environmental stressors such as high sound levels and over-illumination can be an additional method of ameliorating hypertension.

\section*{MEDICATONS}
- There are many classes of medications for treating hypertension, together called antihypertensives, which - by varying means - act by lowering blood pressure. Evidence suggests that reduction of the blood pressure by $5-6 \mathrm{mmHg}$ can decrease the risk of stroke by $40 \%$, of coronary heart disease by $15-20 \%$, and reduces the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from vascular disease.
- The aim of treatment should be blood pressure control to $<140 / 90 \mathrm{mmHg}$ for most patients, and lower in certain contexts such as diabetes or kidney disease (some medical professionals recommend keeping levels below 120/80 mmHg ). Each added drug may reduce the systolic blood pressure by $5-10 \mathrm{mmHg}$, so often multiple drugs are necessary to achieve blood pressure control.

Commonly used drugs include:
- ACE inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril, fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Zestril), quinapril, ramipril (Altace)
- Angiotensin II receptor antagonists: eg, telmisartan (Micardis, Pritor), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan), candesartan (Atacand)
- Alpha blockers such as doxazosin, prazosin, or terazosin
- Beta blockers such as atenolol, labetalol, metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL), propranolol.
- Calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem, verapamil
- Direct renin inhibitors such as aliskiren (Tekturna)
- Diuretics: eg, bendroflumethiazide, chlortalidone, hydrochlorothiazide (also called HCTZ)
- Combination products (which usually contain HCTZ and one other drug)

\section*{CHOICE OF INITIAL MEDICATION}
- Which type of many medications should be used initially for hypertension has been the subject of several large studies and various national guidelines.
- Whilst thiazides are cheap, effective, and recommended as the best first-line drug for hypertension by many experts, they are not prescribed as often as some newer drugs.
physicians may start with non-thiazide antihypertensive medications if there is a compelling reason to do so. An example is the use of ACE-inhibitors in diabetic patients who have evidence of kidney disease, as they have been shown to both reduce blood pressure and slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

In patients with coronary artery disease or a history of a heart attack, beta blockers and ACEinhibitors both lower blood pressure and protect heart muscle over a lifetime, leading to reduced mortality.

\section*{HPTN EMERGENCIES}
- A hypertensive emergency is severe hypertension with acute impairment of an organ system (especially the central nervous system,
cardiovascular system and/or the renal system) and the possibility of irreversible organ-damage. In case of a hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure should be lowered aggressively over minutes to hours with an antihypertensive agent.
- Several classes of antihypertensive agents are recommended and the choice for the antihypertensive agent depends on the cause for the hypertensive crisis, the severity of elevated blood pressure and the patients usual blood pressure before the hypertensive crisis.
- In most cases, the administration of an intravenous sodium nitroprusside injection which has an almost immediate antihypertensive effect is suitable but in many cases not readily available. In less urgent cases, oral agents like captopril, clonidine, labetalol, prazosin, which have all a delayed onset of action by several minutes compared to sodium nitroprusside, can also be used.
- It is also important that the blood pressure is lowered not too abruptly, but smoothly. The diagnosis of a hypertensive emergency is not only based on the absolute level of blood pressure, but also on the individual regular level of blood pressure before the hypertensive crisis. Individuals with a history of chronic hypertension may not tolerate a "normal" blood pressure.

\section*{COMPLICATIONS}

While elevated blood pressure alone is not an illness, it often requires treatment due to its short- and long-term effects on many organs. The risk is increased for:
- Cerebrovascular accident (CVAs or strokes)
- Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- Hypertensive cardiomyopathy (heart failure due to chronically high blood pressure)
- Hypertensive retinopathy - damage to the retina
- Hypertensive nephropathy - chronic renal failure due to chronically high blood pressure

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline COR & LOE & Recommendations for Nonpharmacological Interventions \\
\hline I & A & Weight loss is recommended to reduce BP in adults with elevated BP or hypertension who are overweight or obese. \\
\hline I & A & A heart-healthy diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, that facilitates achieving a desirable weight is recommended for adults with elevated BP or hypertension. \\
\hline I & A & Sodium reduction is recommended for adults with elevated BP or hypertension. \\
\hline I & A & Potassium supplementation, preferably in dietary modification, is recommended for adults with elevated BP or hypertension, unless contraindicated by the presence of CKD or use of drugs that reduce potassium excretion. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Nonpharmacological Interventions (cont.)}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline COR & LOE & Recommendations for Nonpharmacological Interventions \\
\hline I & A & Increased physical activity with a structured exercise program is recommended for adults with elevated BP or hypertension. \\
\hline I & A & Adult men and women with elevated BP or hypertension who currently consume alcohol should be advised to drink no more than 2 and 1 standard drinks* per day, respectively. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
*In the United States, 1 "standard" drink contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol, which is typically found in 12 oz of regular beer (usually about $5 \%$ alcohol), 5 oz of wine (usually about $12 \%$ alcohol), and 1.5 oz of distilled spirits (usually about $40 \%$ alcohol).

\section*{Drug Therapy}

In previous guidelines 5 major drug classes (ACEIs, ARBs, BBs, CCBs, Ds) were recommended based on
- Proven ability to reduce BP
- CV event reduction in placebo-controlled studies
- Broad equivalence in overall CV morbidity/mortality
- Conclusion that benefit predominantly derives from BP lowering

\section*{Approach of Antihypertensive treatment}
- Increasing dose of initial monotherapy.
- Monotherapy substitution.
- "Stepped - care" approach (monotherapy with subsequent addition of other drugs).
- Initial two drug combination treatment.
- Use of single pill combinations.

\section*{Monotherapy vs. Combination}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_28_ac6cd7de8d39a5495ea7g-21.jpg?height=1553&width=2381&top_left_y=365&top_left_x=309)

\section*{Rationale for initial two drug-combination therapy in most patients}
- Greater BP reduction even vs maximum dose monotherapy.
- Reduced heterogeneity of the BP response to initial therapy.
- Steeper dose-response relationship with treatment uptitration.
- No/small increase in risk of hypotensive episodes (even in grade I hypertension).
- More frequent BP control after 1 year
- Better adherence to treatment
- Reduced therapeutic inertia
- Reduce CV events (grade I hypertension, HOPE-3)
