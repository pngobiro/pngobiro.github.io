- Primary immunodeficiency
> Usually an immunodeficiency one is born with.
- secondary immunodeficiency
- Born with normal immune responses but some secondary factor or occurrence causes a decrease in immune response

\section*{Secondary immunodeficiency is induced by factors such as:}
> Malnutrition. Inhibits lymphocyte maturation and function.
> Some viruses, e.g., HIV. Depletes T4lymphocytes.
> Irradiation - exposure to X-rays and gamma rays. Causes a decreased production of lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow.
- Cytotoxic drugs such as many used in cancer chemotherapy. Causes a decreased production of lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow.

\section*{Secondary immunodeficiency is induced by factors such as: (cont)}
> Corticosteroids - anti-inflammatory steroids. Damages lymphocytes.
- Leukemias, cancers of the lymphoid system, metastases. Reduces areas for lymphocyte development.
> Aging. Adaptive immunity, especially cellmediated immunity, tends to diminish with aging.
- Removal of the spleen. Decreased ability to remove microbes that enter the blood.

\section*{ACQUIRED IMMUNO DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)}

A secondary immunodeficiency caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

A retrovirus from the lentivirus subfamily.
There are two types of HIV.
- HIV - 1 - worldwide, main cause of the worldwide pandemic
> HIV - 2 (west Africa, Mozambique and Angola).
- Similar illness to HIV - 1 , less efficiently transmissible, vertical transmission - rare, less aggressive with slower disease progression

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VIRUS}

Viral particle is spherical, diameter - 80-100 nm
$\square$ Icosahedral (20 sided), enveloped virus
[] Retroviruses - transcribe RNA to DNA.
[ Two viral strands of RNA found in core surrounded by protein outer coat.
- Outer envelope contains a lipid matrix within which specific viral glycoproteins are imbedded.
- These knob-like structures responsible for binding to target cell.

The outer shell - viral enevlope.
Embedded in the viral envelope is a
- Complex protein known as env
- Consists of an outer protruding cap glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem gp 41.

Within the viral envelope - HIV protein called p17(matrix)

Within matrix there is the viral core or capsid, which is made of another viral protein p24 (core antigen).

\section*{HITV LIFE CYCLE}
$\square$ Binding, Fusion and Entry
[] Integration \& Replication
[] Transcription
[] Budding
- Maturation

\section*{BINDING}

First step, HIV attaches to susceptible host cell - HIV envelope glycoprotein GP 120 binds to the host receptor CD4 molecule co-receptors are necessary (CCR5/CXCR4).

CD4 antigen is found on a variety of cells
- Helper T cells, macrophages, monocytes, B cells, microglial brain cells, intestinal cells
- T cells infected later on.

\section*{FUSION AND ENTRY}

Viral binding to host cell triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes (Mediated by gp 41)
Allows entry of virus core into host cell cytoplasm
Core protein dissolved by host enzymes releasing viral RNA and enzymes

\section*{INTEGRATION}

Reverse transcriptase converts the single stranded viral RNA into a double stranded DNA molecule

The DNA enters the host cell nucleus
Integrase catalyses the process of integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's DNA

\section*{TRANSCRIPTION}
- Integrated viral DNA turns the host cell into a "factory" for manufacturing more virus.
- Activation of host cell results in transcription of viral DNA into mRNA.
- mRNA translated into viral precursor proteins
- Viral proteins are produced as a single multi-protein molecule
- Viral proteins cleaved by protease enzyme

\section*{BUDDING AND MATURATION}

Viral proteins together with RNA gather at the membrane of the CD4+ cells

Viral particles are formed which bud off the cell and enter the blood stream

The CD4 cells are often destroyed by HIV virus infection and replication resulting in nrofolind immunar effienct

\section*{EARLY (ACUTE) HITV INFECTION}
$\square$ Median incubation period - around 10 years
[ Mucosal lymphoid tissues - virus primarily infects and destroys memory T4-lymphocytes \& dendritic cells.
[ Dendritic cells capture antigens through pinocytosis and phagocytosis and become activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines,
- The dendritic cells detach from the epithelium, enter lymph vessels, and are carried to regional lymph nodes.
$\square$ By the time they enter the lymph nodes, the dendritic cells have matured and are now able to present antigens of HIV to naive T-lymphocytes located in the the lymph nodes in order to induce adaptive immune responses.

\section*{CHRONIC PHASE}

Characterized by viral dissemination, viremia, and induction of adaptive immune responses.

The viremia allows the viruses to spread and infect T4-helper lymphocytes, macrophages \& dendritic cells found in peripheral lymphoid tissues.

During most of this phase - immune system remains active and competent (few clinical symptoms).

A steady state-infection generally persists where T4lymphocyte death and T4-lymphocyte replacement by the body are in equilibrium.

\section*{CHRONIC PHASE (CONT)}

It is estimated that 10 billion virions are produced and cleared in an infected individual each day. However,

The enormous turnover of T4lymphocytes eventually exhausts the lymphopoietic system and it becomes unable to replace the T4-cells being destroyed.

A variety of mecharisms then eventually lead to immunodeficiency.

\section*{MECHANISMS OF HIVINDUCED IMMUNODEFICIENCY}

Direct HIV-induced cytopathic effect on infected T4lymphocytes. This can occur through:
- Increased cell permeability as a result of gp41 expression in the host cell membrane and viral release by budding
[] Inhibition of host cell protein synthesis as a result of viral replication within the infected cell
$\square$ Fusion of infected T4-cells with numerous uninfected T4cells resulting in syncytia formation

Killing of HIV-infected T4-cells by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes or CTLs

\section*{MECHANISMS OF HIVINDUCED IMMUNODEFICIENCY (CONT)}

Killing of HIV-infected T4-cells by antibody-dependent cytotoxicity or ADCC
- Apoptosis of T4 cells as a result of chronic activation by HIV \& cytokines
[ Shedding of gp120 molecules by HIV - triggers a series of events that cause the adaptive immune system to become less and less effective, primarily by altering the normal balance of immunoregulatory $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{h}} 1$ and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{h}} 2$ cells in the body.

0 Impaired function of HIV infected macrophages and dendritic cells.

During the replication of HIV the reverse transcriptase of HIV exhibits a high error rate as it transcribes the RNA genome into DNA.

As a result, HIV readily mutates immunoresistant, more drug resistant, and able to change the preferred cell type it is able to infect, , e.g, M-tropic to T-tropic

\section*{PROGRESSION TO AIDS}

Viral load progressively increases in number while the immune system weakens (destruction of increasing numbers of t4-lymphocyte)

Inability of the body to continually replace these destroyed cells

The loss of T4-helper lymphocytes leads to a marked decline cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs);, the primary cells the body's immune responses use to destrov

\section*{AIDS}

Susceptible to a variety of opportunistic infections by
Bacteria - Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Salmonella, and Nocardia
[] Protozoa - Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma
$\square$ Viruses - cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV)

\section*{CORTICOSTEROIDS (CONT)}

Cytokine synthesis is inhibited (IL -1, IL - 2, IL - 4, IL - 6, IL - 10, TNF $\alpha$ \& IFN $\gamma$ ), this inhibits activation of T cells \& cells of monocyte/macrophage system

\section*{CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE}

Mainly affects lymphocyte function \& numbers, particularly after low dose oral therapy.
- Low dose oral therapy -greater impact on cell mediated response
- Bolus intermittent therapy - greater impact on Ab production

As it Interferes with both B \& T cell function, effective in controlling both Ab mediated \& cell mediated immune responses
[] Clinical significance - management of
- Auto-antibody mediated disease
- Allograft rejection

\section*{AZTHIOPRINE}

Active only on dividing cells (cytotostatic)
Action - competitive inhibition of purine metabolism \& by incorporation into DNA

T \& B cells are reduced after prolonged oral therapy

Decreased NK cell activity
