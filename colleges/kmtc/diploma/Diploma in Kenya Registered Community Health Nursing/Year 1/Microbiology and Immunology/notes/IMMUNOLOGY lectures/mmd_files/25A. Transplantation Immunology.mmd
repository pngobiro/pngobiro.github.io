\section*{Learning Objectives}
- Understand the basics of transplantation
- Describe the mechanisms of T cell recognition of antigen
- Understand the effector pathways of graft injury
- Describe the aetiology and pathophysiology of GVHD

\section*{Introduction}
- Transfer of cells, tissues or organs (graft) from one part of the body to another, or from one individual to another
- Used to replace organs or tissues that have failed e.g. in
- ESRD
- Heart failure
- Cirrhosis
- Leukaemia
- Can use cadaveric or living donors

\section*{Genetic Barriers to Transplantation}
- The main immunological problem with transplantation is rejection
- Grafted organ or tissue is seen as 'foreign' by the immune system
- It is then recognized and attacked
- The genetic relationship between the donor \& recipient determines whether or not rejection will occur
- Autografts and isografts usually accepted
- Allografts and xenografts usually rejected

\section*{Organ Donation}
- Shortage of donors is a limiting factor for organ transplantation
- One cadaveric donor can provide many organs for transplantation
- Potential solutions to increase the number of donors include :
- Advertising and donor recruitment campaigns
- Role of legislation*
- 'Presumed consent' - policy whereby everyone is assumed to have given consent for their organs to be used, unless they indicate otherwise
- 'Opt in' approach - individuals/relatives have to give permission for organs to be used

\section*{Organ Donation}
- Increasing facilities for organ harvesting, including transplant coordinators, surgical teams
- Relaxing donor selection criteria - allow use of organs that would not have been used previously
- E.g. use of non heart beating donors
- Marginal donors (older donors, those with diseases that would have previously excluded them)
- Use of living donors or animal donors

\section*{Ethical Issues in Living Donation}
- Used in situations where the donation of an organ poses little risk to the living donor
- E.g. kidney transplantation - it is possible to live with just one healthy kidney
- It is also possible to donate a lobe of a liver, as it can regrow
- Donation of a lung lobe is also possible, but much riskier
- Haematopoietic stem cell transplants also involve living donors

\section*{Ethical Issues in Living Donation}
- Potential donor should be healthy
-Donation should be compatible (appropriate blood group)
- Donor should be aware of the risks \& should not be coerced into giving an organ
- Majority of donations carried out between close relatives and friends
- Some cases - altruistic donors
- In most countries it is illegal to sell organs for transplantation
- Organ exchange programs to maximize the number of transplants formed - paired donations

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Immune response in which the recipient immune system responds to \& attacks the donor tissue due to immune recognition of antigenic differences between the donor organ \& the recipient
- MHC molecules are the major target for rejection
- Ability to accept a graft is dependent on the recipients sharing all the donor's histocompatibility genes
- Animal that differ at loci other than MHC reject graft from each other, but more slowly

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Adaptive immune response - shows memory
- Once an animal has rejected an organ graft the first time, if a second graft is performed from the same species or donor, it is rejected more rapidly (second set rejection)

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- In a primary alloresponse, most of the alloreactive CD4 or CD8 T cells directly recognise the donor MHC molecules displayed by donor APCs in the graft (direct response/presentation/pathway)
- However, there are other forms of alloresponse:
- Against minor MHC antigens

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Indirect response - recipient CD4 T cells recognise donor MHC molecules that have been processed by recipient APCs, presented in context of recipients MHC II molecules
- (similar to conventional T cell recognition of antigens e.g. pathogens). CD8 cells only see alloantigen by the direct pathway
- The indirect pathway of recognition occurs in lower frequency but is important during chronic rejection (very few donor-derived professional APCs to stimulate a direct immune response)

Immunology by David Male et al,

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Minor histocompatibility antigens can be the targets of rejection even when the MHC is identical between donor and recipient
- Their nature assumed to be normal polymorphic molecules, peptides from which bind to host MHC and induce an immune response
- Can be tissue-specific
- E.g. H-Y system - antigens encoded by the Y chromosome; expressed only on male cells

H-Y minor histocompatibility antigens

\section*{Immune Effector Mechanisms in Graft Rejection}
- Rejection can occur at various times, each associated with different immune effector mechanisms
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline type of rejection & tlme taken & mechanisms of rejection \\
\hline hyperacute rejection & minutes to hours & preformed anti-donor antibodies \\
\hline acute rejection & days to weeks & activation of alloreactive T cells \\
\hline chronlc rejection & months to years & slow cellular response, response of organ to injury, unknown causes \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Immunology by David Male et al, $8^{\text {th }}$

\section*{Hyperacute Rejection}
- Immediate
- Mediated by pre-existing antibody
- Individual sensitized to donor MHC e.g. previous transplants, multiple blood transfusions or pregnancy
- Natural pre-existing antibodies e.g. ABO blood group incompatibility
- Rejection seen within minutes of connecting the circulation into the transplanted organ

\section*{Hyperacute Rejection}
- Pre-existing antibodies bind to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and initiate immune effector functions
- Complement activation by the classical pathway
- Complement activation leads to death of the endothelium, or, when damage is sub-lethal, activation of the endothelial cells
- Causes an inflammatory response increasing vascular leakage and coagulation
- Results in rapid destruction of the graft

\section*{Hyperacute Rejection}
- Prevention:
- ABO matching
- Cross-matching donor and recipient
- Donor leucocytes incubated with recipient serum in the presence of serum complement
- Cell death indicates presence of anti-donor antibody. Is a contraindication to proceeding with transplantation
- Performed immediately before the surgery

\section*{Acute Rejection}
- Seen in days to weeks after transplantation
- Caused by activation of allospecific T cells capable of damaging the graft
- Following transplantation, donor dendritic cells present in the organ (passenger leucocytes) migrate to the lymph nodes draining the organ and stimulate a primary alloimmune response

\section*{Acute Rejection}
- Activated T cells migrate to the organ and cause tissue damage by
- Generation of $T_{C}$ cells
- Induction of DTH reactions
- If the patient has already been exposed to the alloantigens expressed by the graft, there will be alloreactive memory cells, leading to accelerated rejection of the graft

\section*{Chronic Rejection}
- Seen months to years after transplantation
- In vascularized organs, presents as occlusion of blood vessels - narrowed lumen due to thickening of the intima by smooth muscle proliferation and mononuclear cell infiltrate
- Eventually leads to blockage of the blood vessels and subsequent ischaemia of the organ
- The parenchyma is slowly replaced by nonfunctioning fibrous tissue

\section*{Mechanisms of Chronic Rejection}
- Low-grade T cell response (indirect allospecific pathway due to loss of passenger leucocytes that activate T cells with direct pathway specificity)
- Antibody (indicated by deposition of complement component C4d - in tissues)
- Non immunological processes:
- Response of the graft to injury caused at the time of transplantation or by acute rejection episodes
- Recurrence of the original underlying disease
- Drug-related toxicities
- Chronic rejection responds poorly to current immunosuppressive therapy

\section*{Graft versus Host Disease}
- Occurs when competent immune cells (donor T cells) are transplanted into a recipient e.g. in BMT when normal donor T cells may be infused into the recipient
- The T cells can recognise the MHC molecules \&/or minor histocompatibility antigens of the recipient as foreign, and produce an immune response against the recipient
- Occurs when the recipient is immunocompromised
- BMT
- Neonatal blood transfusion

\section*{GvHD}
- Can be lethal
- Acute GvHD - epithelial cell death in the skin, liver and GIT
- Rash, jaundice, diarrhoea, GI haemorrhage
- Chronic GvHD - fibrosis and atrophy of one or more organs without evidence of acute cell death
- Complete dysfunction of affected organ

\section*{GvHD - Prevention and Treatment}
- Elimination of mature T cells from the graft and APCs from the host
- BMT
- Treat bone marrow to deplete T cells
- Use autologous bone marrow
- Use umbilical cord blood
- GvHD is treated by immunosuppression

\section*{HLA Matching}
- The major antigenic differences recognized by the alloimmune response are found on MHC molecules (HLA)
- Matching the donor \& recipient to minimize antigenic differences (so that they share as many alleles as possible)
- The better the HLA matching of donor \& recipient, the less the strength of rejection
- Performed using PCR

\section*{HLA Matching}
- Matching is rarely perfect between unrelated donors because of the difficulty in matching all MHC I \& II gene loci \& the high level of polymorphism at each locus
- Potentially 12 different loci of maternal \& paternal HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) \& class II loci (HLA-DR, -DP, DQ)
- Hundreds of variants of each antigen

\section*{HLA Matching}
- Very important in BMT
- Also has a significant influence on the outcome of kidney transplantation
- No benefit in corneal transplantation
- For those organs where transplantation is essential to maintain life (heart \& liver), there is no possibility of waiting for a well-matched organ to become available

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Control the alloimmune response
- Rejection episodes still occur but are kept in check, to minimize lasting damage
- Cause blanket suppression of the immune system
- Recipients more prone to opportunistic infections \& have a higher incidence of malignancies
- Strategies to promote specific immunological tolerance a subject of interest
- Present challenge is to use the currently available agents well to minimize side effects while preserving graft function

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Antiproliferative drugs
- Inhibit synthesis of purines required for cell division
- 6-MP
- Azathioprine - purine antagonist that competes with inosine monophosphate
- Mycophenolic acid - inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase which is essential in the de-novo synthesis of purines

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Inhibitors of T cell activation
- Ciclosporin - binds to cyclophilin, inhibiting calcineurin (a calcium-dependent phosphatase) which would otherwise activate the NFAT complex \& lead to IL-2 gene transcription; thereby inhibiting IL-2 production
- Tacrolimus - binds to FK-binding protein 12, an intracellular protein; the resulting complex inhibits calcineurin
- Sirolimus/Rapamycin - inhibits signals transmitted by IL-2 binding to IL-2R (sirolimus)

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Anti-inflammatories
- Corticosteroids
- Inhibit proinflammatory cytokine secretion - IL-1, -3, 4, -5, -8, TNF $\alpha$
- Inhibit nitric oxide synthase
- Inhibit expression of adhesion molecules, leading to reduced inflammatory cell migration
- Induction of endonucleases leading to apoptosis in lymphocytes \& eosinophils

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Antibody therapy
- Anti-lymphocyte globulin/anti-thymocyte globulin
- Polyclonal antibodies raised by immunizing rabbits or horses with lymphocytes or thymocytes
- Deplete circulating $T$ cells

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Antibody therapy
- Monoclonal antibodies
- Muromonab-CD3 - binds to CD3 on T cells, suppressing T cell responses
- Daclizumab \& Basiliximab - anti-IL-2 receptors
- Alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1 H) - depletes CD52 expressing leucocytes
- Rituximab - anti-CD20; depletes B cells
- Abatacept \& Belatacept - fusion proteins of CTLA4 with Fc portion of antibody

\section*{Induction of Donor-Specific}
- Immune system specifically becomes nonresponsive to the donor antigens, but is capable of responding normally to other antigens
- Demonstrated in animal models but difficult to translate into the clinical setting
- Alloreactive T cells can be anergized by blockade of co-stimulatory signals such as CD80 \& CD86 with CTLA-4-Ig, as a way of inducing tolerance
- Alternative is to induce a regulatory response to the alloantigen

Co-stimulation blockade
