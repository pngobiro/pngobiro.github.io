Antibodies: generation, interactions with antigen and their functions

\section*{Learning objectives}
- By the end of this lecture you should be able to:
- Outline the structure of antibodies
- Outline the classes and biological activities of antibodies
- Discuss the interactions of antibodies with antigens
- Describe the functions of antibodies
- Describe monoclonal antibodies
- Outline the functions of monoclonal antibodies

\section*{Definition}
- Also known as immunoglobulins
- Glycoproteins produced by plasma cells in response to an immunogen

\section*{Definition}
- Expressed as:
- Membrane-bound receptors on surface of B cells; or
- Soluble molecules (secreted from plasma cells); present in serum and tissue fluids

\section*{Structure of antibodies}
- Antibodies are made up of:
-2 light polypeptide chains
-2 heavy polypeptide chains
- Each light chain bound to heavy chain by disulfide bonds (H-L)
- Heavy chain bound to heavy chain (H-H)

\section*{Structure of antibodies}
- First 100 amino acids of amino terminal of both H and L chains are variable
- Referred to as $V_{L}, V_{H}, C_{H}$ and $C_{L}$

\section*{Structure of antibodies}
- Fab and Fc portions
- Within the variable regions of both heavy and light chains, some polypeptide segments show exceptional variability - hypervariable regions
- Hinge region - allows for mobility (Y and Tshaped structures visualized on electron microscopy)

\section*{Sequencing of heavy chains}
- The light and heavy chains are folded into discrete domains, and the type of heavy chain determines the class and subclass of the antibody

\section*{Fc receptors: functions}
- Transport Ab across membranes
- Secretion of immunoglobulin A across epithelium into lumen
- Transport of maternal antibody across placenta (immunoglobulin G)
- Many cell types use FcR
- Mast Cells, macrophages, neutrophils, B, T, NK cells

\section*{Fc receptors: Functions}
- Opsonization, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity

\section*{Antibody classes and subclasses}
- Based on amino acid sequence in the constant region of the heavy chain
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Class & Heavy chain & Subclass \\
\hline IgG & $\gamma$ & lgG1, lgG2, lgG3, lgG4 \\

\section*{Antibody interaction with antigens}
- Hypervariable regions are clustered at the end of Fab arms to form a unique surface topography that is complementary to structures on the antigen

\section*{Antibody interaction with antigens}
- This complementary surface is called a paratope
- Corresponds to antigenic determinant (epitope)

\section*{Interaction}
- Antigen-antibody interaction results from formation of multiple non-covalent bonds
- These attractive forces consist of
- Hydrogen bonds
- Electrostatic bonds
- Van der Waals forces
- Hydrophobic forces

\section*{Interaction}
- Each bond is relatively weak in comparison with covalent bonds, but together they generate a high-affinity interaction

\section*{Interaction}
- For a paratope to combine with its epitope, the interacting sites must be complementary in shape, charge distribution and hydrophobicity, and in terms of donor and acceptor groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds

\section*{Interaction}
- The strength on interaction between an antigen and an antibody is referred to as affinity
- Is the sum of the attractive and repulsive forces resulting from binding between the binding site of a monovalent Fab fragment and its epitope

\section*{Interaction}
- Each antibody unit of 4 polypeptide chains has 2 antigen-binding sites
- Therefore, antibodies are potentially multivalent in their reaction with antigen
- Antigen can be monovalent (e.g. small chemical groups, haptens), or multivalent (microorganisms)

\section*{Interaction}
- The strength with which a multivalent antibody binds a multivalent antigen is termed avidity
- (affinity is determined for a univalent antibody fragment binding to a single antigenic determinant)

\section*{Interaction}
- Avidity of an antibody for its antigen is dependent on the affinities of the individual antigen-combining sites for the epitopes on the antigen

\section*{Functions of antibodies}
- Functions mediated by antibody alone
- Functions mediated by antibody and additional molecules or cells
- Functional properties of engineered antibody molecules
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_e6cd949dc1b8b545e010g-36.jpg?height=1669&width=2389&top_left_y=58&top_left_x=62)

\section*{Functions}
- Each immunoglobulin is bifunctional (except serum immunoglobulin D):
- Recognize and bind antigen; then
- Promote the killing and/or removal of the immune complex formed through activation of effector mechanisms (complement activation, phagocytosis)

\section*{Functions mediated by antibody alone}
- Antibodies inactivate pathogens, parasites, toxins and enzymes.
1. Pathogen neutralization
- Blocking attachment to host cell surface
- Prevent fusion between virion and cell membranes e.g. influenza virus

\section*{Functions}
2. Neutralization of toxins and enzymes
- Results from direct competition between Ab and the target molecule or substrate of toxin/enzyme
- Induction of conformation incompatible with normal function of toxin/enzyme.
3. Immunity against helminth parasites (immunoglobulin E)

Functions mediated by antibody and additional molecules or cells
1. Complement activation
- Classical pathway activators - IgM, IgG1,IgG3
- Alternative pathway activators - lgA, lgG2
- Functions of complement:
- Opsonization, chemotaxis, lysis, vascular permeability etc

\section*{Functions}
2. Receptors for Fc regions
- Fc receptors are the specific molecules with which cells recognize antibodies

\section*{Functions}
2. Receptors for Fc regions
- Results that follow ligation of FcR by Ab-Ag complexes include:
- Phagocytosis
- Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
- Release of inflammatory mediators
- IgA- Ab facilitated antigen secretion

\section*{Functional properties of engineered antibody molecules}
- Monoclonal antibodies

Derived from a clonal population of B cells thus all the molecules express identical V domains and antigen specificities.
- Hybridomas are created by fusing normal lymphocytes from animals immunized with an antigen of choice, and transformed cells of B cell lineage.

\section*{Functional properties of engineered antibody molecules}
- Multiple clones are generated
- Produces an antibody recognizing one epitope
