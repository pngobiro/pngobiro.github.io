\section*{Overview of adaptive immune mechanisms.}

Learning objectives:
-Types of adaptive immunity
-Humoral immunity
-Cell mediated immunity
-Properties of Acquired immunity
- Limitations of adaptive immunity

\section*{Adaptive (acquired) immunity.}
- Refers to antigen-specific defense mechanisms that take several days to become protective and are designed to remove a specific antigen.
- This is the immunity one develops throughout life.

\section*{Some terminologies encountered in adaptive immunity.}
- An antigen is defined as a substance that reacts with antibody molecules and antigen receptors on lymphocytes.
- An immunogen is an antigen that is recognized by the body as non self and stimulates an adaptive immune response.
- For simplicity, we will use the term antigen when referring to both antigens and immunogens.
- The actual portions or fragments of an antigen that react with antibodies and lymphocyte receptors are called epitopes
- The body recognizes an antigen as foreign when epitopes of that antigen bind to Blymphocytes by means of epitopespecific receptor molecules having a shape complementary to that of the epitope.
- The epitope receptor on the surface of a Blymphocyte is called a B-cell receptor (BCR) and is actually an antibody molecule called surface immunoglobulin (slg)
- The receptor on a T lymphocyte is called a T-cell receptor (TCR).
- It is thought that the human body has the genetic ability to recognize $10^{7}-10^{9}$ different epitopes.
- In other words, the body has $10^{7}-10^{9}$ distinct clones of both B-lymphocytes and Tlymphocytes, each with a unique B-cell receptor or T-cell receptor.

\section*{Note.}
- The downside to the specificity of adaptive immunity is that only a few B-cells and Tcells in the body recognize any one epitope.
- These few cells then must rapidly proliferate in order to produce enough cells to mount an effective immune response against that particular epitope, and that typically takes several days.
- During this time the pathogen could be causing considerable harm, and that is why innate immunity is also essential.

\section*{The main features of the adaptive immune system are:}
- Clonal selection and expression of cells expressing clonally distributed Ag-specific receptors.
- Challenge memory: responses to previously encountered Ags are more fast and vigorous on subsequent exposures.
- Adaptive immunity usually improves upon repeated exposure to a given infection and involves:
a) antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells;
b) the activation and proliferation of antigenspecific B-lymphocytes;
c) the activation and proliferation of antigenspecific T-lymphocytes; and
d) the production of antibody molecules, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), activated macrophages and NK cells

\section*{Types of Adaptive Immunity.}
- There are two major branches of the adaptive immune responses: humoral and cell-mediated immunity.
- 1. Humoral immunity: humoral immunity involves the production of antibody molecules in response to an antigen and is mediated by B-lymphocytes
- 2. Cell-mediated immunity: Cell-mediated immunity involves the production of cytotoxic Tlymphocytes, activated macrophages, activated NK cells, and cytokines in response to an antigen and is mediated by T-lymphocytes.

\section*{Humoral Immunity: an Overview}
- Humoral Immunity refers to the production of antibody molecules in response to an antigen.
- The antibody molecules circulate in the blood and enter the tissue via inflammation.
- Humoral immunity is most effective against bacteria, bacterial toxins, and viruses prior to these agents entering cells.

\section*{Humoral system}
- B cells are specialized white cells produced in the bone marrow.
- Each B cell contains multiple copies of one kind of antibody as a surface receptor for antigen.
- The entire population of B cells has the ability to specifically bind to millions of different antigens.

Humoral immunity: An overview
- When the ab on the surface of a B cell binds to an ag, the cell can be stimulated to undergo proliferation and differentiation: This process is called clonal selection.
- The cells produced make the same ab, but become memory cells and plasma cells.
- Memory cells ensure that subsequent infections by the pathogen receive a more rapid response.
- Plasma cells secrete large amounts of the antigen-specific antibody.
- Thelper cells, part of the cellular system, are usually required for the clonal selection of B cells.

\section*{Cell Mediated Immunity: An Overview.}
- Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is an immune response that does not involve antibodies but rather involves the activation of macrophages and NK-cells, the production of ag-specific CTLs, and the release of various cytokines in response to an ag.

\section*{Cellular immunity protects the body by:}
-1. Activating ag-specific cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs) that are able to lyse body cell displaying epitopes of foreign ag on their surface, such as virus-infected cells, cells with intracellular bacteria, and cancer cells displaying tumor ags
- 2. Activating macrophages and NK cells, enabling them to destroy intracellular pathogens ; and
- 3. Stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses.
- Cell mediated immunity is directed primarily on microbes that survive in phagocytes and microbes that infect non-phagocytic cells.
- It is most effective in removing virus-infected cells, but also participates in defending against fungi, protozoans, cancers, and intracellular bacteria.
- It also plays a major role in transplant rejection

\section*{Cellular System.}
- Some pathogens can escape ab detection by infecting cells.
- Cells containing pathogen display ag fragments on their cell surfaces.
- Receptors on the surface of CTL ( called CD8 cells) can detect the presence of pathogen specific ag fragments and activate a killing response (apoptosis) that leads to the death of the infected cell.

Cell mediated immunity: an overview

\section*{Properties of Acquired Immunity.}
- This type of immunity occurs in response to infection and is called ADAPTIVE as the immune system must adapt itself to previously encountered molecules
- This form of protection due to previous infection is called IMMUNITY and an individual is said to be IMMUNISED against that organism.
- The induction of immunity by infection or with a vaccine is called ACTIVE IMMUNITY.
- Historically, it has been shown that a nonimmune individual can be made immune by transferring serum or lymphocytes from an immune individual- PASSIVE IMMUNITYserum constituents (Abs) and lymphocytes are involved in immunity
- The immune system responds to microorganisms but not to its own cells and the system knows that the body has been infected previously with a particular organism.

This implies:
- 1. Immunological recognition
- 2. Self/Non-self discrimination
- 3. Immunological specificity.
- 4. Immunogical memory.

\section*{An immune response must:}
- 1. Recognize a micro-organism as foreign (non-self) as distinct from self (AFFERENT LIMB).
- 2. Respond to a micro-organism by production of specific abs and specific lymphocytes.
- 3. Mediate the elimination of microorganisms (EFFERENT LIMB).

\section*{Limitations of Adaptive Immunity.}
- Randomly generated ag receptors are unable to determine the source and the biological context of the ag for which they are specific.
- A clonal distribution of ag receptors requires that specific clones expand and differentiate into effector cells before they can contribute to host defense.
- As a result, primary adaptive immune responses are delayed, typically for 4-7 days.

\section*{Quizes.}
-1. State three different ways by which cell-mediated immunity protects the body.
- 2. In terms of infectious disease, state what humoral immunity is most effective against.
