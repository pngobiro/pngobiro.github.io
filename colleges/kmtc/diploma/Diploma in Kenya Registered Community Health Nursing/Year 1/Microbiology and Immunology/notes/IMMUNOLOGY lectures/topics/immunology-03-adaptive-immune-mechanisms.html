                            <li>An <dfn>immunogen</dfn> is an antigen that is recognized by the body as non self and stimulates an adaptive immune response.</li>
                            <li>For simplicity, we will use the term antigen when referring to both antigens and immunogens.</li>
                            <li>The actual portions or fragments of an antigen that react with antibodies and lymphocyte receptors are called <dfn>epitopes</dfn>.</li>
                            <li>The body recognizes an antigen as foreign when epitopes of that antigen bind to Blymphocytes by means of epitopespecific receptor molecules having a shape complementary to that of the epitope.</li>
                            <li>The epitope receptor on the surface of a Blymphocyte is called a <dfn>B-cell receptor (BCR)</dfn> and is actually an antibody molecule called surface immunoglobulin (slg).</li>
                            <li>The receptor on a T lymphocyte is called a <dfn>T-cell receptor (TCR)</dfn>.</li>
                            <li>It is thought that the human body has the genetic ability to recognize $10^{7}-10^{9}$ different epitopes.</li>

                            <li>This type of immunity occurs in response to infection and is called ADAPTIVE as the immune system must adapt itself to previously encountered molecules.</li>
                            <li>This form of protection due to previous infection is called IMMUNITY and an individual is said to be IMMUNISED against that organism.</li>
                            <li>The induction of immunity by infection or with a vaccine is called ACTIVE IMMUNITY.</li>
                            <li>Historically, it has been shown that a nonimmune individual can be made immune by transferring serum or lymphocytes from an immune individual- PASSIVE IMMUNITY- serum constituents (Abs) and lymphocytes are involved in immunity.</li>
                            <li>The immune system responds to microorganisms but not to its own cells and the system knows that the body has been infected previously with a particular organism.</li>
