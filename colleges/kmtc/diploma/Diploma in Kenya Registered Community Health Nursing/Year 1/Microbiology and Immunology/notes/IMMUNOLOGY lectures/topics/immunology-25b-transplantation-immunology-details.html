                            <li>Transplantation is the introduction of biological material organs, tissue, cells, fluids - into an organism.</li>
                            <li>We can distinguish 3 critical relationships between the transplanted material and the recipient.
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>syngeneic transplants</strong> - from genetically identical individuals, usually the same individual (these are similar to grafts between identical twins or isogenic strains of experimental animals). Referred to as autologous in the ABO blood groups, skin grafts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>allogeneic transplants</strong> - from one individual to another of the same species</li>
                                    <li><strong>xenogeneic transplants</strong> - between individuals of different species.</li>

                            <li>Unsurprisingly syngeneic transplants (same individuals) do not usually generate any immunological problems, but allogeneic and xenogeneic transplants are almost always destroyed by immunological processes unless some action is taken to impair the immunological process.</li>
                            <li>Basically therefore transplantation presents 2 key problems.

                            <li>Almost ubiquitous in allogeneic transplants is immunological rejection.</li>
                            <li>Early experimental work on allotransplantation in mice identified a very clear distinction between one chromosomal region and the remainder of the genome.</li>
                            <li>Non-identity at this special region always led to very rapid rejection of the transplanted tissue, even if this was the only genetic difference between the donor and recipient.</li>
                            <li>This region was therefore termed the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).</li>
                            <li>MHC, which exists in all vertebrates is highly polymorphic, so that in out-bred populations 2 individuals will almost certainly differ at this region unless they are monozygotic.</li>
                            <li>However the parallel is NOT true, that is, even if identical at the MHC, transplants between individuals are likely to be rejected due to minor histocompatibility loci.</li>
                            <li>The key distinction is that individually these minor H loci are less 'strong' and in particular the strength varies between allelic differences.</li>

                            <li>Why do the products of the MHC cause such reproducible and rapid graft rejection?<br>
                            The basic answer to this question is that naive individuals have high-frequency of T cells reactive with alloMHC products. More complex is to explain why this high frequency exists.</li>
                            <li>It is undoubtedly the result of T cell receptors being MHC binding.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Minor transplantation antigens are proteins which vary in sequence and where one (at least) of the allomorphs is found in a peptide which binds to the MHC of the recipient.</li>
                            <li>In the case of indirect recognition, MHC sharing between donor and recipient increases the reactivity as donor dendritic cells can prime recipient T cells for minor H peptides bound to shared MHC</li>
                            <li>activated T cells can be triggered by donor tissue cells (usually class I expressing)</li>

                            <li>rejection is slower than for MHC</li>
                            <li>it is additive, however; thus many minor differences combine to give rapid rejection</li>
                            <li>rejection times (in experimental grafts) are more variable and strength is allele specific.</li>
