\section*{Jutsoch serios}

The immune system is:
Defense body mechanism and involves: an interacting set of specialized cells and

Proteins, designed to identify and destroy
foreign invader.

\section*{Jaţochocrioss}
- The immune system must be able to: differentiate between material that is a normal component of the body ("self") and material that is not native to the body "non-self"
* Highly specialized receptors present for discriminating between "self" and "nonself" body components

\section*{Jaţochuchjoss}
*The discrimination between "self" and "non-self" and the subsequent destruction and removal of foreign material is accomplished by two arms of the immune system.
1) The innate (natural or nonspecific) immune system
2) The adaptive (acquired or specific) immune system
*These two systems perform many of their functions by cooperative interactions

\section*{Jssosoususity}

Innate immunity

Components
Macrophages
Granulocytes
Natural killer cells
Complement
Other chemicals: HCL, lysozyme

Characteristics
* Action is immediate
* Response is non-specific
* Response is not enhanced on repeated exposure to pathogen

Adaptive immunity

Cell-mediated
Components antigen presenting cells
$\rightarrow$ T-cells
B-cells
$\rightarrow$ Antibodies
$\rightarrow$ Complement

\section*{Characteristics}
* Action requires days to develop
* Response is specific
* Response is enhanced on repeated exposure to pathogen

\section*{![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_8f44ee4668bb033f7bd3g-05.jpg?height=159&width=2330&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=217)}
* It is the first line of defense
* It is active at the time of infection
- It consists of:
a- protective cellular component (WBCs and derivatives)
b- chemical components.

\section*{![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_8f44ee4668bb033f7bd3g-06.jpg?height=137&width=2303&top_left_y=177&top_left_x=227)}

It is divided into two stages:

1- non-inflammatory reaction (body's static defenses): skin, gastric pH, lysozyme in tears, saliva, mucous

2- local inflammation promotes migration of phagocytes and plasma protein into infected tissues.

The phagocytes respond to surface structures present in large groups of microorganisms (peptidoglycan, mannose moieties).

\section*{roole of exterral body surfaces}
* The skin consists of sheets of dry, cornified epithelial cells.
Intact skin act as barrier to bacteria and viruses
* Hair follicles and sebaceous glands produce: Antibacterial substances (fatty acids and enzymes)
* Normal microbial flora compete with potential pathogens

\section*{r.ole of interral body siluraces}

\section*{The normal movement of fluids and mucous act as mechanical factors for cleaning internal surfaces of:}

\section*{Respiratory tract}

\section*{Gastrointestinal tract}

Genitourinary tract

\section*{![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_8f44ee4668bb033f7bd3g-09.jpg?height=145&width=2404&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=201)}

Inflammation is a nonspecific response of living tissue to localize and eliminate the injurious agent.

The injury may be: physical, chemical or biological

\section*{Involves specialized cells and serum proteins}

\author{
These move from plasma to interstitial spaces to provide an immediate defense
}

\section*{The Inflansuatory Response}

The inflammatory cells include:
- Phagocytes which destroy the invading organisms by phagcytosis followed by intracellular digestion.
- Natural killer cells which limit infection by releasing compounds toxic to organisms.

\section*{The Inflansmatory Response}
* Serum components:

Acute phase proteins (e.g. C-reactive protein)
- C-reactive protein is produced by liver in response to tissue damage
- C-reactive protein binds to the cell walls of bacteria and activates the complement system resulting in the opsonization and lyses of pathogenic organisms.

\section*{role of Praygocytosis}

1- Chemotaxis \& attachment
a- Attraction by chemotactic substances
b- Attachment by receptors on surfaces of phagocytes

2- Ingestion
* Phagocytes have pseudopodia which surround organism forming phagosome * Opsonins and co factors enhance phagocytosis
* Fusion with phagocytic granules and release digestive ,toxic contents

3- Killing (two microbicidal routes)
a- Oxygen dependent system (powerful microbicidal agents)

Oxygen converted to superoxide, anion, hydrogen peroxide, activated oxygen and hydroxyl radicals.

\section*{b- Oxygen-independent system (anaerobic conditions) \\ Digestion and killing by lysozyme, Lactoferrin, low pH, cationic proteins and hydrolytic and proteolytic enzymes}

\section*{IMMUNOLOGY}

\section*{Cells and Organs of the Immune System}

\section*{Organs}

\section*{Thymus}
- It develops in utero and for the $1^{\text {st }} 8$ years of childhood
- It undergoes involution at around puberty
- Its primary function is to 'educate' naïve T-lymphocytes to recognize self from non-self. This is a critical phase of immune system development. Absence of the thymus results in De George Syndrome and you succumb within two years

\section*{Bone Marrow}
- This is the location of hematopoiesis and therefore all immune cells are dependent directly on a viable bone marrow including T-lymphocytes
- If you don't have a bone marrow you will lack an immune system and is common with those who have undergone bone transplants

\section*{Lymph Nodes}
- Have a cortex, medulla in which are scattered T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells which perform the function of antigen presentation

\section*{Spleen}
- Its functions are known but in the immune response it functions rather like a large lymph node where it performs the function of destruction of aged or old immune cells.
- It can affect the quantity of immune cells.

\section*{Cells}

\section*{Neutophils}
- Form $40-70 \%$ of circulating white cells
- Are involved primarily in phagocytosis
- Their cell structure and organization are geared to short life span 5.4 days

\section*{Macrophages}
- Are larger cells
- Cytosolic organization permits them to survive for longer periods in tissues where they perform the function of phagocytosis
- They can produce cytokines (these are fast acting hormones that affect the cell to cell wall communication) which are usefully referred to as chemical mediators of immune responses

\section*{Eosinophils}
- Resemble neutrophils in structure but have a prominent place or function in allergic diseases (asthma, hypersensitivity reactions) and parasitic infestations

\section*{Basophils}
- Involved to a lesser degree to allergic reactions

\section*{Lymphocytes}
- Lifespan averaging 30 days
- We have three types of lymphocytes;
- T-Lymphocytes
- B-Lymphocytes
- Non T and Non B Lymphocytes (Natural Killer Cells)
- There are 6 subsets of T-lymphyctes
- t-helper cells (Th1 and Th2)
- Th3-T regulatory Cells
- Tc-Cytotoxic
- Tm (memory) Cells
- Tdth - Delayed hypersensitivy T-Lymphocytes

\section*{Th1}
- Is pro inflammatory

\section*{Th2}
- Is pro allergic

\section*{Th3}
- Regulate the immune response

\section*{Tc}

Destroy cells that are infected by viruses or intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacteria tuberculosis

Tm
- Are crucial in remembering past ( prior) exposures with microbes

\section*{Tdth}
- Involved in type iv hypersensitivity

One special T-lymphocyte subset is Tc. It has a similar function like natural killer cells but they must recognize the cells they destroy unlike the natural killer cells which are cell mediated

\section*{B-Lymphocytes}
- Are responsible for antibody production
- Antibodies used by B-Cells are specific for the antigen that resulted in their production

\section*{Definitions}

Immunogen: Can provoke an immune response (e.g. like slapping someone to provoke anger) while an
Antigen: Can provoke or initiate a response and react with products of that response in this case, an antibody

\section*{Natural Killer Cells}
- Are large granular lymphocytes
- Constitute $16 \%$ of the lymphocytes
- Functions include;

Destroy virally infected cells and tumor cells. They do not require recognition to kill such cells. This function is thus referred to as cell mediated cytotoxicity

\section*{Innate and Adaptive Systems}
- The immune system is divided into two; Innate and Adaptive System

\section*{Innate}
- One is born with it

\section*{Constituents}
- It involves;
- Physical barriers like skin, hair and mucosa
- Protective chemicals like sebum having triglycerides and other chemical components
- Various mucosa are lined by cilia e.g. respiratory tract
- It also involves chemical barriers having;
- Saliva
- Tears containing lysozymes and lactoferrin
- Nasal fluids
- Stomach acid with its low pH and enzymes
- The small intestines which have enzymes as well
- Genitor-urinary tract where mechanical action of flushing out of urine that sweeps aside or sweeps away bacteria and microbes
- Vaginal secretions having lactobacillus that prevents the over growth of opportunistic infections
- Phagocytes are also present i.e. neutrophils and macrophages
- Cytokines

\section*{Adaptive}
- This is basically an arm of the immune system that develops after birth normally around 9 months to 12 years wherein the body is exposed to various microbes and develops specific immune responses (B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes)

Question: Compare and Contrast between the Innate and Adaptive Immune Systems
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline & INNATE & ADAPTIVE \\
\hline Recognition & Has toll receptors that help recognition via neutrophils and macrophages and destroy microbes & T and B Lymphocytes have efficient recognition system - MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) and CDs \\
\hline Specificity & Is non specific & Is very specific \\
\hline Memory & Has no memory & Has memory \\
\hline Response & Is rapid & Is slow on the $1^{\text {st }}$ exposure but rapid thereafter \\
\hline Diversity of Response & Poor in innate, reads general info & Refined in adaptive; reads detailed \\
\hline Specialization & No specialization & Highly specialized \\
\hline & & \\

\section*{Overview of adaptive immune mechanisms.}

Learning objectives:
-Types of adaptive immunity
-Humoral immunity
-Cell mediated immunity
-Properties of Acquired immunity
- Limitations of adaptive immunity

\section*{Adaptive (acquired) immunity.}
- Refers to antigen-specific defense mechanisms that take several days to become protective and are designed to remove a specific antigen.
- This is the immunity one develops throughout life.

\section*{Some terminologies encountered in adaptive immunity.}
- An antigen is defined as a substance that reacts with antibody molecules and antigen receptors on lymphocytes.
- An immunogen is an antigen that is recognized by the body as non self and stimulates an adaptive immune response.
- For simplicity, we will use the term antigen when referring to both antigens and immunogens.
- The actual portions or fragments of an antigen that react with antibodies and lymphocyte receptors are called epitopes
- The body recognizes an antigen as foreign when epitopes of that antigen bind to Blymphocytes by means of epitopespecific receptor molecules having a shape complementary to that of the epitope.
- The epitope receptor on the surface of a Blymphocyte is called a B-cell receptor (BCR) and is actually an antibody molecule called surface immunoglobulin (slg)
- The receptor on a T lymphocyte is called a T-cell receptor (TCR).
- It is thought that the human body has the genetic ability to recognize $10^{7}-10^{9}$ different epitopes.
- In other words, the body has $10^{7}-10^{9}$ distinct clones of both B-lymphocytes and Tlymphocytes, each with a unique B-cell receptor or T-cell receptor.

\section*{Note.}
- The downside to the specificity of adaptive immunity is that only a few B-cells and Tcells in the body recognize any one epitope.
- These few cells then must rapidly proliferate in order to produce enough cells to mount an effective immune response against that particular epitope, and that typically takes several days.
- During this time the pathogen could be causing considerable harm, and that is why innate immunity is also essential.

\section*{The main features of the adaptive immune system are:}
- Clonal selection and expression of cells expressing clonally distributed Ag-specific receptors.
- Challenge memory: responses to previously encountered Ags are more fast and vigorous on subsequent exposures.
- Adaptive immunity usually improves upon repeated exposure to a given infection and involves:
a) antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells;
b) the activation and proliferation of antigenspecific B-lymphocytes;
c) the activation and proliferation of antigenspecific T-lymphocytes; and
d) the production of antibody molecules, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), activated macrophages and NK cells

\section*{Types of Adaptive Immunity.}
- There are two major branches of the adaptive immune responses: humoral and cell-mediated immunity.
- 1. Humoral immunity: humoral immunity involves the production of antibody molecules in response to an antigen and is mediated by B-lymphocytes
- 2. Cell-mediated immunity: Cell-mediated immunity involves the production of cytotoxic Tlymphocytes, activated macrophages, activated NK cells, and cytokines in response to an antigen and is mediated by T-lymphocytes.

\section*{Humoral Immunity: an Overview}
- Humoral Immunity refers to the production of antibody molecules in response to an antigen.
- The antibody molecules circulate in the blood and enter the tissue via inflammation.
- Humoral immunity is most effective against bacteria, bacterial toxins, and viruses prior to these agents entering cells.

\section*{Humoral system}
- B cells are specialized white cells produced in the bone marrow.
- Each B cell contains multiple copies of one kind of antibody as a surface receptor for antigen.
- The entire population of B cells has the ability to specifically bind to millions of different antigens.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_c48778b96285eed8bde6g-12.jpg?height=1348&width=2390&top_left_y=147&top_left_x=180)

Humoral immunity: An overview
- When the ab on the surface of a B cell binds to an ag, the cell can be stimulated to undergo proliferation and differentiation: This process is called clonal selection.
- The cells produced make the same ab, but become memory cells and plasma cells.
- Memory cells ensure that subsequent infections by the pathogen receive a more rapid response.
- Plasma cells secrete large amounts of the antigen-specific antibody.
- Thelper cells, part of the cellular system, are usually required for the clonal selection of B cells.

\section*{Cell Mediated Immunity: An Overview.}
- Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is an immune response that does not involve antibodies but rather involves the activation of macrophages and NK-cells, the production of ag-specific CTLs, and the release of various cytokines in response to an ag.

\section*{Cellular immunity protects the body by:}
-1. Activating ag-specific cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs) that are able to lyse body cell displaying epitopes of foreign ag on their surface, such as virus-infected cells, cells with intracellular bacteria, and cancer cells displaying tumor ags
- 2. Activating macrophages and NK cells, enabling them to destroy intracellular pathogens ; and
- 3. Stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses.
- Cell mediated immunity is directed primarily on microbes that survive in phagocytes and microbes that infect non-phagocytic cells.
- It is most effective in removing virus-infected cells, but also participates in defending against fungi, protozoans, cancers, and intracellular bacteria.
- It also plays a major role in transplant rejection

\section*{Cellular System.}
- Some pathogens can escape ab detection by infecting cells.
- Cells containing pathogen display ag fragments on their cell surfaces.
- Receptors on the surface of CTL ( called CD8 cells) can detect the presence of pathogen specific ag fragments and activate a killing response (apoptosis) that leads to the death of the infected cell.

Cell mediated immunity: an overview

\section*{Properties of Acquired Immunity.}
- This type of immunity occurs in response to infection and is called ADAPTIVE as the immune system must adapt itself to previously encountered molecules
- This form of protection due to previous infection is called IMMUNITY and an individual is said to be IMMUNISED against that organism.
- The induction of immunity by infection or with a vaccine is called ACTIVE IMMUNITY.
- Historically, it has been shown that a nonimmune individual can be made immune by transferring serum or lymphocytes from an immune individual- PASSIVE IMMUNITYserum constituents (Abs) and lymphocytes are involved in immunity
- The immune system responds to microorganisms but not to its own cells and the system knows that the body has been infected previously with a particular organism.

This implies:
- 1. Immunological recognition
- 2. Self/Non-self discrimination
- 3. Immunological specificity.
- 4. Immunogical memory.

\section*{An immune response must:}
- 1. Recognize a micro-organism as foreign (non-self) as distinct from self (AFFERENT LIMB).
- 2. Respond to a micro-organism by production of specific abs and specific lymphocytes.
- 3. Mediate the elimination of microorganisms (EFFERENT LIMB).

\section*{Limitations of Adaptive Immunity.}
- Randomly generated ag receptors are unable to determine the source and the biological context of the ag for which they are specific.
- A clonal distribution of ag receptors requires that specific clones expand and differentiate into effector cells before they can contribute to host defense.
- As a result, primary adaptive immune responses are delayed, typically for 4-7 days.

\section*{Quizes.}
-1. State three different ways by which cell-mediated immunity protects the body.
- 2. In terms of infectious disease, state what humoral immunity is most effective against.

ANTIGENS: IMMUNOGENICITY AND ANTIGENICITY

ANTIGENS

\section*{ANTIGEN: DEFINITION AND ESSENTIAL FEATURES}

\section*{Antigen}
- A substance that can induce an immune response.
- Essential features of antigens
- It is essential that molecules first be recognized as foreign if they are to stimulate the immune system.
- Processing that antigens must undergo places physical and chemical restrictions on the types of foreign molecules that can stimulate the immune system.
- Most effective antigens are:
- Large
- Rigid.
- Chemically complex. "Molecules that are not totally chemically inert".

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}

Antigenicity: The ability of a molecule to be recognized by antibodies or lymphocytes.
- Molecular size: Large molecules are better antigens then small molecules.
- Very small molecules may, however, bind to large proteins, and the resulting complexes may provoke an immune response
- Complexity: The more complex an antigen, the better.
- Starch and other simple repetitive polysaccharides are poor antigens.
- Complex bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are good antigens.
- Complex proteins are better antigens than large repeating polymers such as lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids.

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}

Structural stability:
- In order to recognize a molecule as a foreign the immune system must recognize its shape.
- Highly flexible molecules that have no fixed shape are poor antigens, e.g. gelatine (protein with structural instability). It is poor antigen unless it is stabilized by incorporation of tyrosine or tryptophan molecules.
- Flagellin, major protein of bacterial flagella, is structurally unstable weak antigen

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}
- Degradability:
- Not all foreign molecules are capable of stimulating an immune response. Stainless steel pins and plastic joints are implanted in the body without triggering an immune response.
- The lack of antigenicity of the large, inert organic polymers is due to their molecular uniformity and their inertness.
- Foreign molecules that are unstable and destroyed very rapidly may not provide sufficient antigen to stimulate an immune response.

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}
- Foreignness:
- The suppression of cells that react with normal body components (self antigens) occur because these cells are exposed to self-antigen when immature (usually early in foetal life) and consequently eliminated (selectively killed or otherwise suppressed).
- Trauma testes (or vasectomy) Anti-sperm antibodies.
- Extensive cell destruction (heart attack) $\qquad$ anti-mitochondrial antibodies.

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_72c444a3ce222b90096eg-08.jpg?height=1197&width=2661&top_left_y=482&top_left_x=379)

\section*{AUTOANTIGENS:}
- Antigens that induce autoimmunity are called autoantigens.
- Autoantigens $\longrightarrow$ Autoimmune responses $\longrightarrow$ Autoantibodies.
- Hormones (thyroglobulin).
- Structural components (basement membranes).
- Complex lipids (myelin).
- Intracellular components (mitochondrial proteins).
- Nucleic acids.
- Nucleoproteins.
- Cell surface proteins.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF ANTIGENS}
- Any molecule that is immunogenic must also be antigenic, but the reverse need to be true.
- Proteins are the best antigens because of:
- Molecular size.
- Structural complexity.
- Polysaccharides (starch and glycogen) are not good antigens:
- Readily degraded within cells.
- Lipids are poor antigens:
- Relative simplicity.
- Structural instability.
- Rapid metabolism

\section*{ANTIGENS TYPES}

\section*{- Non microbial antigens :}
- Snake venoms.
- Mosquito bite.
- Pollen grains.
- Serum proteins.
- Milk and food proteins (Macromolecules of diet).
- Antibody molecules.
- Histocompatibility antigens (Organ grafts).

\section*{- Bacterial antigens}
- Capsule (K-antigen) capsular antigen.
- Cell wall (O-antigen) somatic antigen.
- Flagellum (H-antigen) flagellar antigen.
- Pili (F-antigen)

\section*{- Viral antigens}
- The capsid proteins are good antigens, highly capable of provoking antibodies.

\section*{CELL SURFACE ANTIGENS}
- Histocompatibility antigens: on WBCs $\longrightarrow$ graft rejection.
- Clusters of Differentiation (CD):
- Lymphocytes possess large number of different surface proteins each of which possesses many distinct epitopes.
- CD: denotes a protein of specific function.
- CD4 is associated with cells that help immune response.
- CD8 is found on cells that suppress immune response

Ontogenesis of T lymphocytes
}

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development}
- Lymphoid precursors migrate into thymus from bone marrow
- Directed to thymus via chemokine receptors
- T-cell precursors first travel to outer cortex, proliferate, pass through thymic medulla, then exit at cortico-medullary junction
- In thymus, they proliferate, differentiate \& undergo selection processes that result in development of mature $T$ cells
- Thymic microenvironment provides membrane-bound \& soluble signals that regulate T-cell maturation
- Stages of maturation defined by changes in their cell surface phenotype
- Double-negative (DN) cells lack detectable CD4 \&CD8
- 4 subsets, based on presence or absence of other cell surface molecules
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline & Genotype & Location & Description \\
\hline DN1 & c-kit (CD117) ${ }^{++}$, CD44 ${ }^{+}$, CD25- & BM to thymus & Migration to thymus \\
\hline DN2 & c-kit ${ }^{++}$, CD44 ${ }^{+}$, CD25 ${ }^{+}$ & Subcapsular cortex & TCR $\gamma, \delta \& \beta$ chain rearrangement T-cell lineage commitment \\
\hline DN3 & c-kit ${ }^{+}$, CD44-, CD25- & Subscapular cortex & Expression of pre-TCR; $\beta$-selection \\

\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
c-kit - receptor for stem cell growth factor
CD44 - adhesion molecule
CD25 - a-chain of IL-2 receptor

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development}
- 2 broad categories of T-cells
- Those that express TCR $\alpha$ \& $\beta$ receptor chains - TCRa $\beta$ cells
- Dominant cells in adaptive immune response in secondary lymphoid organs
- Those that express TCR ү \& $\delta$ receptor chains - TCRyठ cells
- Important role in protecting mucosal tissues from outside infection
- Choice to become a $\gamma \delta$ or $\alpha \beta$ cell is dictated by when and how fast the genes that code for each of the receptor chains successfully rearrange

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development - $\beta$-Selection}
- Expression of pre-Ta chain - surrogate for the real TCRa chain that has not yet rearranged
- Pre-Ta chain complexes with the rearranged \& translated $\beta$ chain \& CD3 complex proteins to form the pre-TCR

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development - $\beta$-Selection}
- The pre-TCR initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to:
- Maturation to the DN4 stage
- Rapid proliferation in subcapsular cortex
- Suppression of further rearrangement of TCR $\beta$-chain genes, resulting in allelic exclusion of the $\beta$-chain locus
- Development to the CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) stage
- Cessation of proliferation
- Initiation of TCRa-chain rearrangement

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development - $\beta$-Selection}
- Clones of cells with the same TCR $\beta$-chain rearrangement can rearrange a different $\alpha$-chain gene
- Resulting in a diverse population of cells (TCR diversity)
- Most T-cells fully rearrange \& express a TCR $\beta$-chain from only one of their two TCR alleles (allelic exclusion) - inhibition of further rearrangement of the other TCR $\beta$ allele
- Once a young DP thymocytes successfully rearranges \& expresses a TCRa-chain, this will associate with the already produced TCR $\beta$-chain, taking the place of the surrogate $\alpha$-chain

\section*{Positive and Negative Selection}
- DP thymocytes expressing a fully mature surface TCRaß/CD3 complex undergo thymic selection
- Based on affinity of TCR for the MHC/peptides they encounter in the thymic cortex
- Positive selection - selects for thymocytes whose receptors can bind self-MHC from thymic epithelial cells, resulting in MHC restriction
- Negative selection - selects against thymocytes bearing highaffinity receptors for self-MHC/peptide complexes; results in self-tolerance

\section*{Positive and Negative Selection}
- T-cells that do not meet the selection criteria (~98\%) die by apoptosis
- Thymocytes that do not bind MHC undergo death by neglect
- Autoreactive thymocytes with high-affinity receptors for self-MHC/self-peptide complexes undergo clonal deletion
- Negative selection ensures self-tolerance

\section*{Positive and Negative Selection}

\section*{Lineage Commitment}
- Changes in gene expression that result in
- Silencing of one co-receptor gene (CD4 or CD8)
- Expression of genes associated with a specific lineage function
- Affinity for MHC class I vs MHC II preference dictates the $\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$vs $\mathrm{CD}^{+}$fate of developing thymocytes
- Several proposed models of lineage commitment
(a) Instructive model
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_697b35d554b08e8ae5d1g-12.jpg?height=847&width=2587&top_left_y=308&top_left_x=314)

Interaction of a co-receptor with the MHC molecule for which it is specific results in down-regulation of the other co-receptor
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_697b35d554b08e8ae5d1g-13.jpg?height=1145&width=2532&top_left_y=201&top_left_x=384)

Down-regulation of CD4 or CD8 is a random process
(c) Kinetic signaling model
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_697b35d554b08e8ae5d1g-14.jpg?height=430&width=558&top_left_y=440&top_left_x=316)
- The decision to commit to the CD4 or CD8 lineage is based on the continuity of the TCR signal that a
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_697b35d554b08e8ae5d1g-14.jpg?height=975&width=1489&top_left_y=142&top_left_x=1348)
$\mathrm{CD}_{4}{ }^{+} 8^{-} \mathrm{T}$ cell thymocyte receives.
- Positive selection results in down-regulation of CD8 on all thymocytes. This does not alter the intensity of a TCR/CD4/MHC II signal; cells receiving this signal continue to the CD4 SP lineage.
- However, the TCR/CD8/MHC I signal is interrupted, sending that cell towards CD8 lineage

\section*{Lineage Commitment}
- Small populations of DP thymocytes can also commit to other T-cell types
- NK T-cells
- Regulatory T-cells ( $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{REG}}$ )
- Intraepithelial lymphocyte lineages (IEL)

\section*{Exit from Thymus and Final Maturation}
- After successful selection \& lineage commitment, the thymocytes enter a quiescent stage \& leave the thymus

1. Pre-B-cell receptor: initiates cell division resulting in 30-70 small pre-B cell clones (all have same heavy chain, but with potential to have different light chains)
2. Signal from pre-B-receptors halts HC gene rearrangement \& sLC synthesis; cell proliferation to yield lots of small pre-B-cells; cell division stops and light chain gene rearrangement begins
3. Immature B cells selected for tolerance (prevents autoimmunity)
4. Tolerant immature and mature B cells enter periphery (immature cells mature in the spleen)
5. Naïve B cells (never seen antigen) circulate looking for foreign microbes
$\operatorname{Ig} \alpha$ and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$ are Signaling Subunits of the B Cell Receptor (BCR; surface Ig molecule)

The Ig molecule (either pre-BCR or BCR) can not travel to the surface of the B cell without Ig $\alpha$ and Ig $\beta$
The pre-BCR and BCR consist of an Ig molecule plus Ig $\alpha$ and Ig $\beta$
Ig $\alpha$ and IgB genes turned on at the pro-B-cells stage and remain on until cell becomes an antibody secreting plasma cell
$\lg \alpha$ and $\lg \beta$ send signals when receptors are engaged or ligated (bound antigen)

Two copies of each heavy chain and each light chain loci
Most DJ rearrangements are successful (D can translate three reading frames)
VDJ rearrangement is consecutive; 50\% success rate (remember: $\mu$ chain)
$\kappa$ and $\lambda$ chain rearrangement is $85 \%$ successful
Unproductive gene rearrangement results in apoptosis (programmed cell death)

\section*{Light Chain has Several Chances to Rearrange}

Repeated rearrangements are possible at the light-chain loci

Large pre-B-cells undergo cell division before becoming resting small B cells; LC rearrangement

Starts with $\kappa$ and goes until all possibilities have been tried

LC rearrangement, 85\% successful

Overall success of Ig gene rearrangement is less than 50\%

\section*{Ending Gene Rearrangement}

Mechanism of ending gene rearrangment

Need to shut down rearrangement twice
1. Pre-BCR interacts with an unknown ligand to shut off heavy chain rearrangement
2. BCR initiate the shut off signal for light chain rearrangement

Figure 4-9 The Immune System, 2/e (© Garland Science 2005)

\section*{Regulating B Cell Development}
1. Genes essential for gene recombination are turned on at selective stages of B cell development
2. Genes encoding RAG;
-turned on in Early pro-B cell and late pro-B cell (HC rearrangement)
-turned off in Large pre-B cell (to allow proliferation)
-turned back on in Small-pre-B cell (LC rearrangement)
3. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)
-responsible for diversity (N nucleotides)
-turned on in pro-B cells, silent in small pre-B cells
4. Genes encoding Ig $\alpha$ and Ig $\beta$
-turned on in pro-B cells and remain on
5. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)
-signaling molecule whose deficiency prevent B cell development

\section*{X-linked Agammaglobulinemia}

Ig $\alpha$ and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$ signal to a signaling molecule: BTK
Btk needed to signal B cell to develop
Reduced number of pre-B cells in bone marrow, lack of mature B cells, Normal thymus and normal number of T cells

Recessive, X-linked
Patients lacking Btk (mostly boys) have B cell development blocked at the pre-B-cell stage and therefore have no circulating antibodies

Suffer from X-linked Agammaglobulinemia
Recurring infections: Haemophilus influenzae; Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyrogenes; Staphylococcus aureus

Treatment: antibiotics and infusion of antibodies (i.e passive immunity)

\section*{Formation of B Cell Tumors (Leukemias \& Lymphomas)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-13.jpg?height=591&width=1517&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=542)

High transcriptional and splicing activity during B cell gene rearrangement
Mistakes made that can result in deregulated cell growth leading to leukemia
Ig gene segment is mistakenly joined to a gene regulating cell growth
-translocation: gene on one chromosome joined to a gene on a different chromosome
-B cell tumors: Burkitt's lymphoma; Ig gene segment mistakenly fused to a gene called MYC that regulates the cell cycle; along with additional mutation(s) leads to Burkitt's lymphoma

\section*{CD5 ${ }^{+}$B Cells (B-1 Cells)}
1. Arise early in embryonic development
2. Express CD5 on surface
3. No surface IgD; restricted BCRs; Abs to bacterial polysaccharides
4. Predominate in pleural and peritoneal cavities
5. Capacity for self-renewal
6. Most B cell tumors causing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are transformed B-1 cells (express CD5 on surface)
7. Treatment: bone marrow transplant

\section*{Alteration, Elimination, or Inactivation (Anergy) of Self-reactive Bcells}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-15.jpg?height=1114&width=1337&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=1)

Who: immature B cells (slgM) Where: bone marrow (mostly) How: signals sent by self Ags -multivalent self-antigen change BCR (new LC) or DIE
-mechanism: signal sent by crosslinked BCRs
-soluble self-antigen (BM or periphery)
mature, migrate, but inactive (anergic)
-mechanism: no crosslinking of BCRs; lgM (mostly in cytoplasm), IgD on surface, but can't signal

\section*{Self-reactive B Cells Get Another Chance}

Receptor Editing (new LC, new BCR specificity) -BCR "ligation" by multivalent Ags (MHC, crosslinks BCRs) -stops development: RAG genes active; LC rearrangement -new LC generated, synthesis of old LC stops -if not self-reactive, cell migrates to periphery -if self-reactive can continue until J segments are exhausted -if still fails; apoptosis, which results in clonal deletion -apoptotic B-cells phagocytosed by macrophages
-clonal deletion occurs in bone marrow OR right after the immature $\mathbf{B}$ cells enters the circulation
-55 billion B cells die each day: rearrangement fails (not productive; or autoreactive

Travel Throughout Secondary Lymphoid Tissue (SLT)
-spleen, lymph nodes, MALT, GALT
-SLT: hang out in primary lymphoid follicles
-spleen: enter via blood
-lymph nodes: enter via lymphatic system
-primary lymphoid follicles contain follicular dendritic cells
- follicular dendritic cells: not APCs, not hematopoietic
-GALT (Peyer's Patches), tonsils, appendix; committed to IgA synthesis

\section*{Mature, Naïve B Cells in Lymph Nodes}

Figure 4-16 The Immune System, 2/e (© Garland Science 2005)

\section*{Passage Through SLT (eg. Lymph Nodes)}
-enter T cell area from blood through HEV (high endothelial venules) -no antigen, migrate to primary follicle -receive signal to survive (FDCs) -exit through efferent lymphatic vessel -antigen, stay in T cell area and present antigenic peptides to T cells
-GALT (Peyers Patches), tonsils, appendix: specialized for IgA

Competition for Survival Signals -too many B cells, not enough FDCs to provide survival signals -naïve $B$ cells die within weeks in absence of antigen

\section*{Anergic B cells}
-stuck in T cells area and prevented from entering the primary lymphoid follicle, fail to receive survival signals and DIE

\section*{Big Moment: mature B Cells encounter antigen}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-19.jpg?height=872&width=1219&top_left_y=33&top_left_x=1183)

Activation of B cells in Secondary Lymphoid Tissue (SLT)
- engulf bacteria in SLT
- detained in T cell area of SLT by binding to T cells and receiving "HELP"; $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H} 2} / \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{HC}}$ (CD4 ${ }^{+}$)
- Help results in B cell proliferation and differentiation
-some activated B cells differentiate immediately into plasma cells secreting antibody (live only 4 weeks, no slgM)
-others migrate to primary lymphoid follicles to undergo isotype switching and hypersomatic mutation (affinity maturation)

\section*{Big Moment: mature B Cells encounter antigen}

Activation of B cells in Secondary Lymphoid Tissue (SLT) -migration to primary lymphoid follicles results in generation of secondary lymphoid follicles containing germinal centers (GCs)
-centroblasts (large, proliferating)
-centrocytes (small, nondividing)
-undergone isotype switching
-undergone somatic hypermutation (high accumulation of mutations at $\checkmark$ region of the centroblast stage of B-cell differentiation)
-centrocytes selected for high affinity BCRs (affinity maturation)
-lymphoblasts leave lymph nodes and migrate (other SLT) and bone marrow; differentiate into plasma cells
-memory B cells (high affinity, slgG, slgA, slgE)

Tumor Represents the Uncontrolled Growth of a Single Cell
-illustrated by B cell tumors; all have identical rearranged Ig genes (originated from single cell) -individual patient tumors are different
-follicular center cell lymphoma (naïve B cells; grow in lymphoid follicles)
-myelomas (plasma cells; grow in bone marrow)
-Hodgkin's disease (germinal center B cells) -somatic mutations of tumor cells; no BCR -stimulate non malignant T cell growth -dendritic morphology
All have same rearranged Ig DNA

\section*{Functions of B cells}
-What are they?
1. Interaction with antigens through BCRs
2.Present antigenic peptides to T cells
3.Humoral immunity against external Ags
4.Opsonization (Ab bound to cognate Ag)

\section*{Summary}
1. B cell originate from lymphoid progenitor stem cells and develop in the bone marrow thoughout life
2. Consecutive gene rearrangements of Ig genes results in the expression of a unique BCR (Ig molecule with H and L chains)
3. Several loci ( 2 HC ; 4LC) to counter unproductive rearrangements
4. $\mu \mathrm{HC}$ rearranges first and this must be productive to continue -forms pre-BCR (rearranged $\mu \mathrm{HC}$ and surrogate LC); ligation on cell surface halts HC gene rearrangement
5. LC rearrangement following proliferation of large pre-B cells
-4 loci; several attempts at each loci (85\% success rate)
-productive light chain rearrangement halts further rearrangement
6. B cell repertoire is diverse ( $10^{11}$ )
7. Mistakes cause B-cell leukemias and lymphomas

\section*{Antibody interaction with antigens}
- Hypervariable regions are clustered at the end of Fab arms to form a unique surface topography that is complementary to structures on the antigen

\section*{Antibody interaction with antigens}
- This complementary surface is called a paratope
- Corresponds to antigenic determinant (epitope)

\section*{Interaction}
- Antigen-antibody interaction results from formation of multiple non-covalent bonds
- These attractive forces consist of
- Hydrogen bonds
- Electrostatic bonds
- Van der Waals forces
- Hydrophobic forces

\section*{Interaction}
- Each bond is relatively weak in comparison with covalent bonds, but together they generate a high-affinity interaction

\section*{Interaction}
- For a paratope to combine with its epitope, the interacting sites must be complementary in shape, charge distribution and hydrophobicity, and in terms of donor and acceptor groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds

\section*{Interaction}
- The strength on interaction between an antigen and an antibody is referred to as affinity
- Is the sum of the attractive and repulsive forces resulting from binding between the binding site of a monovalent Fab fragment and its epitope

\section*{Interaction}
- Each antibody unit of 4 polypeptide chains has 2 antigen-binding sites
- Therefore, antibodies are potentially multivalent in their reaction with antigen
- Antigen can be monovalent (e.g. small chemical groups, haptens), or multivalent (microorganisms)

\section*{Interaction}
- The strength with which a multivalent antibody binds a multivalent antigen is termed avidity
- (affinity is determined for a univalent antibody fragment binding to a single antigenic determinant)

\section*{Interaction}
- Avidity of an antibody for its antigen is dependent on the affinities of the individual antigen-combining sites for the epitopes on the antigen

\section*{Functions of antibodies}
- Functions mediated by antibody alone
- Functions mediated by antibody and additional molecules or cells
- Functional properties of engineered antibody molecules
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_e6cd949dc1b8b545e010g-36.jpg?height=1669&width=2389&top_left_y=58&top_left_x=62)

\section*{Functions}
- Each immunoglobulin is bifunctional (except serum immunoglobulin D):
- Recognize and bind antigen; then
- Promote the killing and/or removal of the immune complex formed through activation of effector mechanisms (complement activation, phagocytosis)

\section*{Functions mediated by antibody alone}
- Antibodies inactivate pathogens, parasites, toxins and enzymes.
1. Pathogen neutralization
- Blocking attachment to host cell surface
- Prevent fusion between virion and cell membranes e.g. influenza virus

\section*{Functions}
2. Neutralization of toxins and enzymes
- Results from direct competition between Ab and the target molecule or substrate of toxin/enzyme
- Induction of conformation incompatible with normal function of toxin/enzyme.
3. Immunity against helminth parasites (immunoglobulin E)

\section*{THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM}
- The complement system is a defensive system consisting of over 30 proteins produced by the liver and found circulating in blood serum and within tissues throughout the body.
- Antibodies are not directly toxic or destructive to pathogens, but facilitate host defense through
- Neutralizing pathogens - preventing them or toxins they produce from binding to host cells
- Opsonization - phagocytosis
- Complement activation.
- Together, proteins of the complement system destroy microbes by :
1.Cytolysis
2.Inflammation
3.Phagocytosis

\section*{Therefore, complement system:}
- Is one of two major humoral arms of innate immunity
- Acts in concert with adaptive humoral immunity (antibodies) and innate cellular immunity
- Is a cascade of serine protease pro-enzymes and their substrates.
- Functions
- Inflammation
- Opsonization (enhance phagocytosis)
- Lytic activity
- Antigen-antibody (immune) complex clearance
- Enhance/modulate antibody production by B cells.

\section*{Naming of complement proteins:}
- Complement proteins are usually designated by an uppercase letter C and are inactive until they are split into fragments (products).
- The proteins are numbered C1 through C9, named for the order in which they were discovered.
- The fragments are activated proteins and are indicated by the lowercase letters a and b.
- For example, inactive complement protein C3 is split into two activated fragments, C3a and C3b.
- The activated fragments carry out the destructive actions of the C1 through C9 complement proteins.
- Complement proteins act in a cascade, that is, one reaction triggers another, which in turn triggers another, and so on.
- Also, as part of the cascade, more product is formed with each succeeding reaction so that the effect is amplified many times as the reactions continue.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_c51b29e57720ff8bc096g-06.jpg?height=1744&width=2408&top_left_y=131&top_left_x=157)

\section*{THE OUTCOMES OF COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION}
- When C3 is activated, it splits into C3a and C3b. C3b binds to the surface of a microbe and receptors on phagocytes attach to the C3b.
- Thus C3b enhances phagocytosis by coating a microbe, a process called opsonization, or immune adherence.
- Opsonization promotes attachment of a phagocyte to a microbe.
- C3b also initiates a series of reactions that result in cytolysis.
- First, C3b splits C5. Fragment C5b then binds to C6 and C7, which attach to the invading cell plasma membrane.
- Next, C8 and several C9 molecules join the other complement proteins and together form a cylinder-shaped Membrane Attacking Complex (MAC), which inserts into the membrane.
- The MAC creates transmembrane channels (holes) in the membrane that result in cytolysis, the bursting of the microbial cell due to the inflow of extracellular fluid through the channels.

\section*{On the other hand:}
- C3a and C5a bind to mast cells and cause them to release histamine and other chemicals that increase blood vessel permeability during inflammation.
- C5a also functions as a very powerful chemotactic factor that attracts phagocytes to the site of an infection.

\section*{INFLAMMATION STIMULATED BY COMPLEMENT SYSTEM}

\section*{PATHWAYS FOR COMPLEMENT ACTIVATION:}
1. The Classical pathway
2. The Alternative pathway
3. The Lectin pathway

\section*{A) THE CLASSICAL PATHWAY.}
- The classical pathway, so named because it was the first to be discovered, is initiated when antibodies bind to antigens (microbes) and occurs as follows:
-Antibodies attach to antigens, forming antigenantibody complexes.
- Example of antigens: proteins or large polysaccharides on the surface of a bacterium or other cell.
-The antigen-antibody complexes bind and activate C1.
-Next, activated C1 activates C2 and C4 by splitting them.
-C2 is split into fragments called C2a and C2b. and C4 is split into fragment, called C4a and C4b.
- C2a and C4b combine and together they activate C3 by splitting it into C3a and C3b.
-The C3 fragments then initiate cytolysis, inflammation, and opsonization.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_c51b29e57720ff8bc096g-14.jpg?height=1758&width=2326&top_left_y=145&top_left_x=184)

\section*{B) THE ALTERNATIVE PATHWAY.}
- The alternative pathway is so named because it was discovered after the classical pathway.
- Unlike the classical pathway, the alternative pathway does not involve antibodies.
- The alternative pathway is activated by contact between certain complement proteins and a pathogen.
- C3 is constantly present in the blood.
- It combines with complement proteins called factor B, factor D, and factor P (properdin) on the surface of a pathogen.
- The complement proteins are attracted to microbial cell surface material (mostly lipid-carbohydrate complexes of certain bacteria and fungi).
- Once the complement proteins combine and interact, C3 is split into fragments C3a and C3b.
- As in the classical pathway, C3a participates in inflammation, and C3b functions in cytolysis and opsonization.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_c51b29e57720ff8bc096g-17.jpg?height=1474&width=2410&top_left_y=291&top_left_x=163)

\section*{C) THE LECTIN PATHWAY.}
- The lectin pathway is the most recently discovered mechanism for complement activation.
- When macrophages ingest bacteria, viruses, and other foreign matter by phagocytosis, they release chemicals that stimulate the liver to produce lectins, proteins that bind to carbohydrates.
- One such lectin, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), binds to the carbohydrate mannose.
- MBL binds to many pathogens because the MBL molecules recognize a distinctive pattern of carbohydrates that includes mannose, which is found in bacterial cell walls and on some viruses.
- As a result of binding, MBL functions as an opsonin to enhance phagocytosis and activates C2 and C4.
- C2a and C4b activate C3.

\section*{Arcane Nomenclature}
- Classical pathway components and components shared by all pathways - C followed by number; fragments denoted by lower case letter
- Examples
- C4 - C4 protein
- C4a - smaller soluble fragment
- C4b - larger fragment binds to surface (of microbe)
- There is one exception - for C2, C2b = smaller soluble fragment, C2a = larger fragment that binds to surface of microbe
- Alternative Pathway Proteins - Upper case letter, fragments denoted by lower case letter
- Example
$-\mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{Bb}$

\section*{Two Types of C3 Convertase}

C3b bound to the microbial surface can also bind factor $\mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{C} 3 \mathrm{bBb}$; in other words, the alternative pathway can amplify complement activation by the classical pathway.

\section*{Complement Lysis}

\section*{Complement Ward}
- There are inhibitors of complement that prevent it from leading to self-destruction.
- These include the C1-inhibitor, the ability to destroy C3 and C5 convertases, and the inhibition of MAC.

\section*{C1-Inhibition}
- C1-inhibitor binds to C1 and holds it inactive; if it does become active, C1inhibitor serves as a suicide substrate

\section*{Convertase destruction}
- Many things can inactivate the C3 convertase, including decay accelerating factor (DAF) on endothelial and blood cells, and CR1 on immune cells. Also, Factor / can proteolyze C4b when C4b is complexed with the membrane cofactor protein (MCP). Similarly, Factor H, DAF, and CR1 can inhibit C3bBbP, ultimately recruiting Factor I.
- All of the fragments released by dissociation or cleavage still encourage immunologically competent cells to proliferate or invade the area.
- Thus, soluble fragments are chemotactic while bound fragments are opsonic (and/or biochemically active).

\section*{MAC inhibition}
- Protectin (CD59), in the membrane, binds to C8 and C9, blocking the growth of the MAC. Vitronectin, in the serum, acts similarly.

\section*{Evolution}
- Many of the complement proteins are structurally related, consisting of varying numbers of short consensus repeats (SCRs). Unfortunately, bacteria and parasites can take advantage of the complement inhibitors or even complement receptors.
Innate-Adaptive Interplay
- B-cells have complement receptors (CR2 in association with CD19) in addition to surface Ig's.
- Cross-linking of CD19 and slgM in B-cells leads to a 100x-increase in the activation sensitivity of the cells.

\section*{Complement Deficiency States}
- Increased risk for infection with capsulated bacterial pathogens
- early classical pathway components (C1, C4 and C2) and C3 - Streptococcus pneumoniae - Gram-positive bacterium
- early classical pathway components, C3, and alternative pathway and terminal components - Neiserria meningitidis -Gram-negative bacterium

\section*{Summary: COMPLEMENT SYSTEM}
-Complement bridges the innate and the adaptive immune systems.
-It leads to chemotaxis.
-It opsonizes pathogens.
-It is a proteolytic cascade, much like blood clotting.

\section*{MHC}

Learning Objectives:
-Definition of MHC
-Classification of MHC families (classes)
-Structures of MHC classes I and II
-Functions of MHC molecules (classes I, II \& III)
-Clinical relevance of HLA

\section*{Immunity $=$ State of protection from infectious disease}

\title{
IMMUNITY \\ INNATE IMMUNITY ACQUIRED IMMUNITY
}

Innate Immunity $=$ Non-specific Immunity
Acquired Immunity $=$ Specific Immunity
= Adaptive Immunity

\section*{ACQUIRED IMMUNITY}

\section*{Characteristic Features}
1. Specificity - Ability to distinguish pathogens
2. Diversity - Recognize millions of molecules
3. Memory - Increased \& faster second response
4. Self/Non-self Discrimination - Respond to non-self

Immune system responds to bacteria, viruses, toxins.

But not to the whole bacterium, virus or toxin!
Immune system responds to "ANTIGENS"
Antigens $=$ Molecules that bind to an antibody or to a T cell receptor

Immunogens $=$ Molecules that induce immune responses

But the immune system does not respond to the whole antigen......just to small segments or regions of Ag

Epitope $\boldsymbol{=}$ Small immunogenic segment or region in an $\mathbf{A g}$

So, the immune system responds to epitopes on antigens of bacteria, viruses, toxins etc

Exogenous Ag = extracellular bacteria, proteins etc

Endogenous Ag = intracellular bacteria, viruses etc

\section*{Antigens are PROCESSED within cells}

\section*{Epitopes are PRESENTED on cells by MHC molecules}

\section*{What are MHC molecules?}

MHC = Major Histocompatibility Complex
HLA = Human Leukocyte Antigens

\section*{Defination of MHC}
- A collection of genes arrayed within a stretch of DNA on chromosome number 6 in human and chromosome 17 in mice.
- Determines whether transplanted tissue is accepted as self (histocompatible) or rejected as foreign (histoincompatible)

Referred to:
- HLA in human
- H -2 complex in mice

Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC - HLA)
Histocompatibility $=$ Ability to accept grafts between individuals

MHC = Region of multiple loci that are
(1) responsible for rejection of grafts and
(2) function in signalling between lymphocytes and cells that present antigens.

MHC (HLA) molecules recognize antigens, so MHC molecules are antigen-recognition molecules (like antibody molecules).

HLA molecules PRESENT antigens to T cells.

\section*{MHC.}
- The MHC contains a set of genes located together on one chromosome as a 'complex'.
- MHC genes code for several series or families of polymorphic glycoproteins, including two families of molecules that are expressed at the cell surface, the class I and class II molecules.
- These specialized membrane proteins act as guidance systems that allow T cells to recognize antigen.

\section*{Historical perspective.}
- The term MHC derives from studies designed to investigate the fate of tissues (grafts) transplanted between individuals.
- As a result of these experiments, the MHC was recognized as an important ('major') set of genes ('complex') responsible for controlling whether grafts are accepted between individuals whose tissues are genetically similar ('histocompatible') or rejected by individuals who are not ('incompatible').

\section*{Note.}
- MHC is not the only influence on tissue compatibility.
- A large number of genetic loci have been identified on different chromosomes that also play a role in graft rejection.
- These are called 'minor histocompatibility genes'.

\section*{General features of the MHC.}
- The MHC codes for 3 families of glycoproteins known as class I, class II, and class III MHC molecules.
- The members of two of these families, class I and class II molecules, are also sometimes referred to as MHC antigens or alloantigens because they can be recognized by the immune system during the rejection of tissue transplanted between MHC incompatible individuals.
- The class I and class II MHC molecules are expressed mainly as membrane glycoproteins at the cell surface, whereas the products of class III genes are usually soluble molecules.
- Class III molecules include some of the components of the complement system, one of the major effector mechanisms of the humoral immune response; soluble effector molecules such as TNF $\beta$; the enzyme 21hydroxylase; and the HSP70

\section*{Structure of Class II MHC}
- Two polypeptide chains, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, of roughly equal length.
- Four regions:
- Peptide-binding region - a groove formed from the $\alpha 1$ and $\beta 1$ domains of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains - site of polymorphism
- Immunoglobulin-like region - conserved $\alpha 2$ and $\beta 2$ domains - $\beta 2$ is site to which CD4 on T cell binds
- Transmembrane region - stretch of hydrophobic amino acids spanning membrane
- Cytoplasmic region - contains sites for phosphorylation and binding to cytoskeletal elements

MHC molecules are highly polymorphic i.e., exist as many alleles in the population i.e., are different in different individuals

\section*{Diversity of MHC molecules in the individual}

\section*{Other genes in the MHC}

\section*{MHC Class 1b genes}

Encoding MHC class I-like proteins that associate with $\beta-2$ microglobulin: HLA-G interacts CD94 (NK-cell receptor). Inhibits NK cell attack of foetus/ tumours HLA-E binds conserved leader peptides from HLA-A, B, C. Interacts with CD94

HLA-F function unknown

\section*{MHC Class II genes}

Encoding several antigen processing genes:

(TAP-1 \& 2), HLA-DO $\alpha$ and DO $\beta$
Many pseudogenes

\section*{MHC Class III genes}

Encoding complement proteins C4A and C4B, C2 and FACTOR B
TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTORS $\alpha$ AND $\beta$

\section*{Immunologically irrelevant genes}

Genes encoding 21-hydroxylase, RNA Helicase, Caesin kinase Heat shock protein 70, Sialidase

How many types of HLA molecules do you have?

Three Class I molecules - HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C

Three Class II molecules - HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR
But, we get one set of HLA genes from our mothers and another set from our fathers

These two sets are frequently different
So, we may have as many as 12 types of HLA molecules

\section*{MHC molecules are highly polymorphic}
i.e., many HLA alleles in the population more than 100 types of $-\mathrm{A},-\mathrm{B},-\mathrm{C}$ as many as 400 types of HLA-B !
i.e., HLA are different in different individuals
.....and that is why tissue grafts are rejected!
But, what is the FUNCTION of the MHC?

\section*{FUNCTIONS of MHC (HLA) MOLECULES}

MHC molecules PRESENT antigens to cells
Class I HLA molecules present epitopes to cytotoxic T cells
Class II HLA molecules present epitopes to helper T cells

MHC $=$ Cell-surface molecules that PRESENT antigen to T cells

MHC molecules are essential for immune recognition

\section*{Differential distribution of MHC molecules}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Tissue & MHC class I & MHC class II \\
\hline T cells & +++ & +/- \\
\hline B cells & +++ & +++ \\
\hline Macrophages & +++ & ++ \\

Cell activation affects the level of MHC expression
The pattern of expression reflects the function of MHC molecules:
Class I is involved in anti-viral immune responses
Class II involved in activation of other cells of the immune system

\section*{Polymorphism in the MHC}

Variation $>1 \%$ at a single genetic locus in a population of individuals Each polymorphic variant is called an allele

In the human population, over $1,200 \mathrm{MHC}$ alleles have been identified
381

Data from http://www.anthonynolan.org.uk/HIG/index.html July 200043

\section*{How diverse are MHC molecules in the population?}

IF - each individual had 6 types of MHC
- the alleles of each MHC type were randomly distributed in the population
- any of the 1,200 alleles could be present with any other allele
$$\sim 6 \times 10^{15} \text { unique combinations }$$

In reality MHC alleles are NOT randomly distributed in the population
Alleles segregate with lineage and race
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\cline { 2 - 4 } \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{ Frequency (\%) } \\
\hline Group of alleles & CAU & AFR & ASI \\
\hline HLA-A1 & 15.18 & 5.72 & 4.48 \\
HLA- A2 & 28.65 & 18.88 & 24.63 \\
HLA- A3 & 13.38 & 8.44 & 2.64 \\
HLA- A28 & 4.46 & 9.92 & 1.76 \\
HLA- A36 & 0.02 & 1.88 & 0.01 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{How can 6 invariant molecules have the capacity to bind to 1,000,000,000,000,000 different peptides with high affinity?}

MHC molecules
- Adopt a flexible "floppy" conformation until a peptide binds
- Fold around the peptide to increase stability of the complex
- Use a small number of anchor residues to tether the peptide this allows different sequences between anchors and different lengths of peptide

\section*{Replacement substitutions occur at a higher frequency than silent substitution}

Suggests that selective pressures may operate on MHC polymorphism

\section*{Evolution of pathogens to evade MHC-mediated antigen presentation}

In south east China \& Papua New Guinea up to 60\% of individuals express HLA-A11
HLA-A11 binds an important peptide of Epstein Barr Virus
Many EBV isolates from these areas have mutated this peptide
so that it can not bind to HLA-A11 MHC molecules

Evolution of the MHC to eliminate pathogens
In west Africa where malaria is endemic HLA-B53 is commonly associated with recovery from a potentially lethal form of malaria

\section*{MHC molecules are targets for immune evasion by pathogens.}
- T cells can only be activated by interaction between the antigen receptor and peptide antigen in an MHC molecule
- There is strong selective pressure on pathogens to evade the immune response
- The MHC has evolved two strategies to prevent evasion by pathogens
-More than one type of MHC molecule in each individual

\section*{Example: If MHC X was the only type of MHC molecule}

\section*{Introduction}
- In acquired immune response, specific antigens are recognized by
- Antibodies - soluble or transmembrane (BCR)
- TCR
- Antibodies recognize antigens on the outside of pathogens or as soluble materials e.g. toxins
- TCR recognize peptides in the context of MHC molecules on the surface of host cells

\section*{Antigen recognition by antibodies/B cells}
- Recognize molecular shapes (epitopes) on antigens
- Complementary to paratope on Ab
- Abs recognize the topographic surface of a protein Ag
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_e09d867be7b8ab550defg-03.jpg?height=1447&width=1128&top_left_y=42&top_left_x=2030)

\section*{Antigen recognition by $T$ cells}
- TCR sees peptide antigen associated with an MHC class I or II molecules on the surface of cells
- These T cells usually only respond when the APCs express the same MHC haplotype as the host from which the T cells were derived (haplotype restriction)
- Cytotoxic T cells recognize Ag in the context of class I MHC
- Helper T cells recognize Ag when it is associated with class II MHC
- T cells recognize a linear peptide sequence from the antigen
- T cells recognize peptide lying within the MHC peptide-binding groove
- These peptides are produced through antigen processing
- Proteolytic cleavage of proteins into small fragments (antigen peptides) that can bind to MHC molecules on antigen presenting cells

\section*{Two compartments of the cell}

\hline Peptides bind to Presented to & Class I CD8 T cells & Class II CD4 T cells \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Processing of extracellular antigen by class II MHC}
- Exogenous protein Ag is taken into the cells (endocytosis) by
- Phagocytosis (macrophages)
- Large particles such as microorganisms are ingested by macrophages into large endocytic vesicles called phagosomes
- The phagosome subsequently fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome
- This compartment possesses a low pH coupled with lysosomal proteases which attack the phagocytosed particle
- Pinocytosis (dendritic cells), or
- Specific receptor-mediated uptake (B cells)

\section*{Processing of extracellular antigen by class II MHC}
- Exogenous protein Ag is taken into the cells (endocytosis) by
- Pinocytosis (dendritic cells)
- Antigen uptake occurs by formation of small clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane
- By internalization and formation of pinosomes, this mechanism mediates uptake of soluble proteins
- Dendritic cells exhibit a specialized form of constitutive macropinocytosis, which make them particularly efficient at filtering the extracellular fluid
- Specific receptor-mediated uptake (B cells)

\section*{Processing of extracellular antigen by class II MHC}
- Exogenous protein Ag is taken into the cells (endocytosis) by
- Specific receptor-mediated uptake (B cells)
- Membrane-bound immunoglobulins ( mlg ) on the cell surface of B lymphocytes form the B-cell receptor (BCR)
- An antigen that binds to the BCR is endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits
- After leaving the plasma membrane, clathrin-coated vesicles lose their membrane coats and fuse with endocytic compartments
- Antigen-derived epitopes are processed in B lymphocytes and presented in the context of the class II MHC to helper T lymphocytes
- In turn, activated helper Tlymphocytes activate the antigen specific B lymphocyte to produce antibodies

\section*{Processing of extracellular antigen by class II MHC}
- A late endosome containing the antigen meets up with a trans-Golgi vesicle containing MHC II
- The MHC II are assembled in the ER in association with the transmembrane invariant chain li
- Li acts as a chaperone to ensure correct folding of the nascent MHC I molecule
- An internal sequence of the luminal portion of li sits in the MHC groove to inhibit precocious binding of peptides in the ER before the class II molecule reaches the endocytic compartment containing the antigen
- Proteins within the endosome are processed into peptides as the early endosome matures into a late endosome
- Late endosome fuses with the vacuole containing the class II-li complex
- Li is degraded, except for the part sitting in the MHC groove, which remains there as a peptide referred to as CLIP (class II-associated invariant chain peptide)
- An MHC-related heterodimeric molecule, DM, then catalyzes the removal of CLIP and keeps the groove open so that peptides generated in the endosome can be inserted
- The class II-peptide complexes are then transported to the membrane for presentation to $T_{H}$ cells

\section*{MHC class II pathway}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_e09d867be7b8ab550defg-13.jpg?height=1642&width=2578&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=374)

\section*{Processing of intracellular antigen by class I}

\section*{MHC}
- Peptides generated by a cytosolic multisubunit proteolytic complex called the proteasome
- The peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the adenosine triphosphate-dependent transporters associated with antigen processing (TAPs), where they associate with MHC I
- When stably assembled, the complexes are transported to the cell surface via the ER and Golgi network

\section*{MHC class I pathway}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_e09d867be7b8ab550defg-15.jpg?height=1651&width=2544&top_left_y=212&top_left_x=395)

\section*{Cross-presentation of antigens}
- MHC I presents endogenous Ag
- MHC II presents exogenous Ag
- However, $10-30 \%$ of class I molecules present exogenous Ag , and a similar proportion of class II molecules present peptides derived from cytoplasmic or nuclear Ag
- Phagocytosed or endocytosed Ag can sneak out through channels in the vacuole into which they have been engulfed and gain entry onto the cytosol
- Once in the cytosol, they are subsequently degraded by the proteasome, followed by TAP-mediated transfer into the ER, and presentation by MHC I
- Autophagy - portions of the cytoplasm, which can contain peptides generated from the proteasome as well as intact proteins, are engulfed internally by structures known as autophagosomes
- Occurs in professional APCs
- The peptide-containing autophagosome can fuse with the MHC II containing MIIC, where proteolytic cleavage of any intact proteins could also take place
- Peptide Ag is then presented through the exogenous pathway, with the peptides exchanging with CLIP, and transfer of the peptide-MHC to the cell surface

\section*{ANTIGEN PRESENTATION.}

\section*{Learning Objectives.}

To be able to learn about:
- T cell recognition of processed antigens.
- Presentation of exogenous antigens by macrophages.
- Presentation of exogenous antigens by B lymphocytes
- Presentation of endogenous antigens by fibroblasts and other cells
- Peptide-MHC interaction.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-03.jpg?height=1492&width=2070&top_left_y=173&top_left_x=263)

\section*{Scheme of antigen presenting cells.}

\section*{ANTIGEN PRESENTATION.}

Macrophages take up and destroy an immense variety of particles and molecules.

They phagocytose antigens, digest them and then present immunogenic molecules to the lymphocytes.

Hence called antigen presenting cells
- Macrophages express MHC class II molecules that are required for antigen recognition by helper T cells.
- Macrophages also produce cytokine (called lymphocyte activating factor)- also known as IL-1.
- IL-1 can trigger lymphocyte proliferation, by stimulating the secretion of IL-2 from the activated T cells (fig. 2).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-06.jpg?height=1492&width=1797&top_left_y=131&top_left_x=357)

Fig. 2. A "two signal" hypothesis for T cell activation
- Ags are taken up by ag-presenting cells, processed from their native form and presented in association with MHC class II molecules to specific helper T cells.
- This provides the first signal for T cell activation.
- The ag-presenting cells then elaborate one or more soluble molecules (IL-1) that provide the second signal also required for T cell activation.
- Once helper T cells are activated, they can help B cells make antibodies and cytotoxic $T$ cells to develop from their precursors, thus triggering the effector stage of immune response.

\section*{NOTE}
- The discovery of dendritic cells (steinman and Cohn 1973) challenged the above scheme of МФ as the accessory cells for ag presentation.
- Dendritic cells contained within many adherent MФ populations from lymphoid tissues (fig.3.) are actually the cells stimulating lymphocyte response to presented antigens.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-10.jpg?height=1242&width=1737&top_left_y=284&top_left_x=475)

Fig. 3. A population of adherent accessory cells.
- Dendritic cells are required to deliver a particular activation signal(s) to resting T cells that cannot be supplied by most other cell types, as well as being able to present the relevant antigens.
- Once the T cells have been activated, they can respond to any other cell type expressing the same antigen-MHC complex.
- This stimulation of T cells is termed immunostimulation, and dendritic cells are therefore called immunostimulatory cell.
- However, most cells in the body (including dendritic cells) may be able to present antigens to activated T cells and thus act as antigen-presenting cells (fig. 4).
- The term accessory cell can be used for any cell that is required together with antigen to stimulate a lymphocyte response, and it thus encompasses both antigen-presenting cells in general as well as specialized immunostimulatory cells.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-13.jpg?height=1541&width=1776&top_left_y=184&top_left_x=420)

Fig.4. Accessory cells.

\section*{Ag-presenting cells.}
- Any cell that expresses peptide-MHC complexes that can be recognized by specific $T$ cells.

\section*{Ag processing and presentation.}

\section*{T cell recognition of processed antigens.}
- Before it was realized that lymphocytes could be subdivided into T cells and B cells, immune responses had been categorised as 'cellular' and 'humoral' responses.
- Evidence later emerged that different forms of antigen stimulated these two types of response (fig. 5).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-16.jpg?height=1526&width=1790&top_left_y=121&top_left_x=410)

Fig. 5. B and T lymphocytes respond to different forms of antigen.

\section*{Therefore:}
- Antibody response = humoral immunitynative antigens.
- T cell responses (cellular immunity) = processed antigens.
- Abs., the receptors of B cells, frequently recognize antigenic determinants or epitopes that are directly accessible in the native three-dimensional structure of antigen.
- TCRs recognize epitopes that may be exposed when the molecule is unfolded or degraded (fig.6).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-19.jpg?height=1646&width=1902&top_left_y=142&top_left_x=277)

Fig.6. Epitopes for T cells and B cells.

\section*{Note.}
- $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$ cells recognize peptide bound to MHC Il molecule on an accessory cell.
- $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{c}}$ cells also recognize peptide-MHC I complexes, but the cell they recognize is more commonly referred to as a target cell.
- It now seems probable that any cell in the body can process foreign ags into peptides, some of which become bound to MHC molecules, which can then be recognized at the cell surface by T cells (fig. 7).
- Most MHC molecules at the cell surface are normally occupied by self peptides.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-22.jpg?height=1460&width=1520&top_left_y=147&top_left_x=461)

Fig.7. MHC molecules may bind a representative sample of self peptides as well as non-self (foreign) peptides, when present, for perusal by T cells.

\section*{Characterization of ags.}
- Foreign ags are categorized as exogenous or endogenous, depending on whether they are derived from outside or synthesized within the cell (fig. 8).
- An example of an exogenous antigen would be a protein from a bacterium that is internalized by a cell such as a phagocyte.
- An example of an endogenous antigen is a viral protein that is synthesized within a cell after it has been virally infected.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-24.jpg?height=1432&width=1618&top_left_y=171&top_left_x=517)

Fig. 8. Exogenous and endogenous antigens.

\section*{Ag processing.}
- Is the mechanism by which the native (intact) form of an antigen is degraded to a set of peptides, some of which can bind to an MHC molecule.
- These peptide-MHC molecules may then be presented to T cells (fig 9).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-26.jpg?height=1440&width=1520&top_left_y=185&top_left_x=615)

Fig. 9. An outline of antigen processing.

\section*{Presentation of exogenous antigens by macrophages.}
- Endocytosis in macrophages is one example of how exogenous antigens can be taken up by cells.

\section*{Exocytosis and endocytosis:}
- During exocytosis, cytoplasmic vescicles transport their contents to the plasma membrane, fuse with it, and discharge their contents to the exterior of the cell (fig.10).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-28.jpg?height=1505&width=1664&top_left_y=142&top_left_x=417)

Fig. 10. Exocytosis and endocytosis.
- During endocytosis, particles and macromolecules become surrounded by portions of the plasma membrane which invaginate and pinch off to form vesicles containing the ingested material.
- Endocytosis can be divided into phagocytosis ('cell eating') and pinocytosis ('cell drinking')
- Phagocytosis occurs in specialized cell types such as macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which are therefore called phagocytes.
- During phagocytosis, large particles like microorganisms and cellular debris are taken into the cell within membrane-bounded phagocytic vacuoles or phagosomes.
- This uptake may be membrane mediated by specific receptors on the plasma membrane of the cell (fig.11).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-31.jpg?height=1464&width=1498&top_left_y=187&top_left_x=598)

Fig.11. Evidence of a membrane-zippering mechanism of phagocytosis.
- Receptor-mediated endocytosis often occurs at specialized regions of the membrane.
- These are called coated pits because they consist of indentations in the plasma membrane that are coated with a thick material on their cytoplasmic face (fig. 12).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-33.jpg?height=1498&width=1790&top_left_y=191&top_left_x=480)

Fig. 12. Endocytosis at coated pits.
- The receptor-ligand complexes are then endocytosed in coated vesicles that are formed as the membrane in the region of the coated pits becomes invaginated.
- Once inside the cytoplasm, the coat is lost from coated vesicles and they fuse with others to form larger vesicles called endosomes (fig. 13).
- Endocytosed contents are transferred sequentially from coated vesicles to early endosomes, late endosomes, and endolysosomes and/or terminal lysosomes.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-36.jpg?height=1618&width=1734&top_left_y=145&top_left_x=459)

Fig. 13. Endocytosis at coated pits and delivery to lysosomes.

\section*{Endocytosis in macrophages.}
- MФs have surface receptors that enable them to internalize particles by receptormediated endocytosis (fig. 13).

\section*{The receptors involved in this process include:}
- Fc receptors- bind particles and ags complexed to certain classes of ab.
> Complement receptors which bind complementcoated particles; and
>Sugar-specific carbohydrate recognition systems, such as the manosyl-fucosyl receptor through which glycoproteins and particles like yeasts can be endocytosed.

\section*{Membrane receptors recycled.}

Fig. 14 . Recycling of membrane and of some receptors?

\section*{Ag presentation by MФs}
- An antigen-dependent and temperature dependent lag phase is required for processing the bacterial ags to a form that could be recognized by the T cells (fig. 15).
- However, denatured antigens or fragments may not need cellular processing (fig. 16).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-41.jpg?height=1618&width=1520&top_left_y=124&top_left_x=478)

Fig. 15. A 'lag phase' in antigen processing.

Fig. 16. Fixed accessory cells can present modified (e.g. degraded) forms of antigen, but not the native antigen.

\section*{Ag processing by macrophages.}
- Exogenous ags are endocytosed and processed intracellularly within an acidic compartment which is lysosomal or perhaps prelysosomal in nature.
- Ag processing results in some degree of unfolding or cleavage of the native molecule, and in most cases almost certainly the production of peptides (fig. 17).
- Some of these peptides become bound to MHC molecules and are transported to the cell surface where they can be recognized by specific T cells.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-44.jpg?height=1442&width=1737&top_left_y=149&top_left_x=401)

Fig. 17. Presumed conformational changes during antigen processing.

\section*{Processing and presentation of exogenous ags by B lymphocytes.}
- Although B cells are non-phagocytic, there are two or more routes by which they can endocytose ags. (fig.18).
- Via non-specific pinocytosis and,
- Via their specific antigen receptors (membrane-bound abs; lgs)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-46.jpg?height=1271&width=1411&top_left_y=143&top_left_x=550)

Fig.18. Two pathways for endocytosis of antigens in B lymphocytes.

\section*{NB:}
- The function of membrane-bound abs on B cells is to bind antigen, which then is internalized and processed within the B cell (fig. 19).
- The expression of abs on the membrane of a B cell may thus be viewed as a means of capturing and concentrating antigen within the cell.
- The processed ag is subsequently re-expressed on the surface of the B cell as peptides, bound to MHC molecules, in a form that can be recognized by the $T$ cells.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-48.jpg?height=1442&width=1681&top_left_y=163&top_left_x=454)

Fig. 19. Antigen processing and presentation by B cells.

\section*{Presentation of endogenous ags by fibroblasts and other cells.}
- Helper T cells proliferate or secrete IL-2 when they recognize processed antigens in the form of peptide-MHC complexes.
- $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{c}}$ cells recognize peptide-MHC complexes and can kill fibroblasts infected with virus, as well as uninfected fibroblasts that have been incubated with pre-formed viral peptides (fig. 20).
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_98008800f4d148de0c95g-50.jpg?height=1453&width=1425&top_left_y=126&top_left_x=575)

Fig. 20. Tc cells can recognize virus-infected cells as well as uninfected cells that have been cultured with preformed viral peptides.

\section*{Note.}
- The precise pathway(s) for processing of endogenous ags within the cytoplasm has not been fully defined.
- One route may involve ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis within the cytoplasm (fig.21); which is also normally involved in the regulation of turnover of cellular proteins, including those that may be incorrectly folded after biosynthesis or which have been routed to an incorrect cellular compartment.

\section*{CYTOKINES AND INTERFERONS.}

\section*{Learning objectives:}
- Classification and naming of cytokines.
- Properties and function of cytokines.
- Mode of action in immune response and regulation.
- Clinical applications of cytokines

\section*{What are Cytokines?}
- Low-molecular-weight regulatory proteins secreted by white blood cells and various other cells in response to a number of stimuli.
- Soluble proteins secreted by one cell that can alter the behaviour or properties of the same cell or of another cell.

\section*{What are Cytokines ?}
- Secreted molecules that regulate the intensity and duration of the immune response by exerting a variety of effects on lymphocytes and other immune cells
- Cytokines = messengers of the immune system, just as hormones = messengers of the endocrine system

\section*{Classification of cytokines.}
- classified into four groups based on structure:
- Haematopoietin family ( e.g. IL-2, IL-4)
- Inteferon family (e.g. interferon-beta)
- Tumor necrosis factor family (e.g. TNF-alpha) and
- Chemokine family (e.g., IL-8, MCP-1)

\section*{Cytokines by any other name....}

Lymphokines - cytokines secreted by lymphocytes

Monokines - cytokines secreted by monocytes/macrophages

Interleukins - secreted by leukocytes, act on leukocytes

Chemokines - cytokines that are chemotactic and play important roles in inflammation

Interferons, CSFs, tumor necrosis factors.

\section*{Properties of Cytokines}
- autocrine (binds receptors on the same cell that secreted the cytokine),
- paracrine (binds to receptors on a nearby cell, a variation on paracrine is "juxtacrine" meaning binds a neighboring cell) or in some cases,
- endocrine fashion (binds to receptors on distant target cell).
- Pleiotropy: a cytokine may have different biological effects on different target cell.
- Redundancy: two or more cytokines may have the same effect on a target cell (e.g. IL2 and IL-15).
- Synergy: additive effect of cytokines used
- Antagonism: negate effect of another cytokine.
- cascade effect: stimulate other cytokines, forming cytokine networks.

\section*{Cytokines as intercellular messenger molecules}
1. Development of cellular \& humoral responses
1. Induction of inflammatory responses
2. Regulation of hematopoiesis
3. Cellular proliferation and differentiation
4. Growth inhibition, apoptosis
5. Wound healing
- Cytokines, despite being antigen nonspecific:
regulate the intensity and duration of the inflammatory/immune response;

\section*{by stimulating/inhibiting:}
- activation,
- proliferation and/or differentiation and
- migration of multiple cell types and
-by regulating the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulins.

\section*{How do nonspecific cytokines maintain the specificity of the immune response?}
- Limited production of the cytokine: often cytokines are only made following some stimulus, for example
- a macrophage phagocytosing bacteria,
-a T cell engaging the T cell antigen receptor, or
- some other cell-cell or pathogen-cell contacts.
- Limited radius of effectiveness, i.e., only those cells in physical contact with or in the immediate vicinity of the cytokine-secreting cell will be exposed to an effective concentration of the cytokine.
- Short half lives mean that cytokines can only act for a limited period of time.
- Regulation of cytokine receptor expression. For example, only lymphocytes which have interacted with antigen may express particular cytokine receptors.
- Antagonism, includes shedding receptors which may occupy a cytokine in solution preventing it from binding another receptor. Examples of shed receptors becoming antagonists are IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, -6, and -7, IFN- $\alpha$, - $\gamma$, TNF- $\beta$, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).

\section*{Cytokine secretion by Th1 and Th2 cells}
- $\mathrm{T}_{\text {н }}$ cells (CD4+ lymphocytes) can be divided into Th1 and Th2 subsets, each with distinct cytokine secretion profiles.
- The Th1 subset is involved in response to intracellular pathogens including the production of opsonizing antibodies.
- Th1 cytokines promote the differentiation of CD8+ cells to become cytotoxic
- The Th2 subset mediates the responses to extra cellular pathogens, including
- eosinophil activation and promoting production of $\operatorname{lgM}$ and $\lg \mathrm{E}$ and
- non-complement-activating IgG isotypes, much of which contributes to allergic reactions.
- Cytokines produced by Th1 and Th2 cells exhibit cross-regulation.
-IFN-y inhibits Th2 proliferation while IL-10 indirectly (by acting on antigen presenting cells) downregulates IFN-Y and IL-2 production by Th1 cells (required for Th1 proliferation).
-IL-4 directly antagonizes IFN-ү activity.

\section*{T cells}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f340ff2ce14e165c952cg-25.jpg?height=988&width=1827&top_left_y=436&top_left_x=146)

\section*{Th1 and Th2 cells}

Th1: IFN $\gamma$, TNF $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, TNF $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$, IL-2
$\mathrm{M} \phi$ activation, CTL activation, DTH $\rightarrow \mathrm{CMI}$

Th2: IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13
Most IgG subclasses
$$\begin{aligned}
& \text { IgE } \\
& \text { IgA (mucosal immunity) } \\
& \text { Eosinophil stimulation }
\end{aligned}$$

Humoral immunity

\section*{Cytokine receptors.}
- Based on conserved structural features:
i. Class I, or hematopoietin receptor family
ii. Class II (IFN/IL-10) cytokine receptor family
iii. Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), the IL-1 receptor family.
iv. The TGF- $\beta$ receptor family
v. The chemokine receptor family.

\section*{Therapeutic Uses of Cytokines}
1) Interferon used in treatment of viral diseases, cancer
2) Several cytokines are used to enhance T-cell activation in immunofideficincy diseases, e.g. IL-2, IFN- $\gamma$, TNF- $\alpha$
3) IL-2 and lymphokine activating killer cells (LAK) in treatment of cancer
4) GM-CSF induces increase in white cell count, it is used:
a- To restore leukocytic count after cytotoxic chemotherapy induced neutropenia
b- After bone marrow transplantation
C- To correct AIDS-associated leukopenia

\section*{Therapeutic Uses of Cytokines}
5) Anti-cytokines antibodies in management of autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection:
a- Anti-TNF in treatment rheumatoid arthritis
b- Anti-IL2R to reduce graft rejection
6) Anti-TNF antibodies in treating septic shock
7) Anti-IL-2R $\alpha$ in treating adult T-cell leukemia
8) Anti-IL-4 is under trial for treatment of allergies

PHAGOCYTOSIS DR DEEPA PATEL
- Phagocytosis is a specific form of endocytosis by which cells internalise solid matter, including microbial pathogens
- Phago in Greek - Eat
- Professional phagocytes of the immune system
- Macrophages,
- Neutrophils
- Immature dendritic cells
- Phagocytosis is a mechanism by which microorganisms can be
- Contained \& killed
- Processed for antigen presentation

\section*{STEPS IN PHAGOCYTOSIS}
1. Contact between phagocyte and microbial cell
2. Engulfment
3. Phagosome formation
4. Phagosome-lysosome fusion
5. Killing and digestion
1. Chemotaxis: Phagocytes are chemically attracted to site of infection.
2. Adherence: Phagocyte plasma membrane attaches to surface of pathogen or foreign material.
- Adherence can be inhibited by capsules (S. pneumoniae) or M protein (S. pyogenes).
- Opsonization: Coating process with opsonins that facilitates attachment.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_c41040d2a6231f98aea6g-06.jpg?height=1142&width=2429&top_left_y=306&top_left_x=36)

\section*{0 Tissue injury; release of chemical signals}
(2) Dilation and increased permeability of capillary
(3) Phagocytosis of pathogens
3. Ingestion: Plasma membrane of phagocytes extends projections (pseudopods) which engulf the microbe. Microbe is enclosed in a sac called phagosome.
4. Digestion: Inside the cell, phagosome fuses with lysosome to form a phagolysosome.
- Microorganisms are killed by
- Oxygen dependent mechanism
- Oxygen independent mechanism
5. After digestion, residual body with undigestable material is discharged.

\section*{OXYGEN-DEPENDENT}
- When a phagocyte ingests its oxygen consumption increases (respiratory burst)
- This produces reactive oxygen containing molecules
- Superoxide, which is converted to hydrogen peroxide \& singlet oxygen by superoxide dismutase
- Superoxide also react with the hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radicals
- The other type involves the use of the enzyme myeloperoxidase which is released into the phagolysozome. This uses hydrogen peroxide \& chlorine to create Hypochlorite

\section*{OXYGEN-INDEPENDENT}
- Lysosomal enzymes kill most bacteria within 30 minutes and include:
- Lysozyme: Destroys cell wall peptidoglycan
- Lactoferrins
- Lipases and Proteases
- RNAses and DNAses

\section*{Regulatory mechanisms in Specific Immune Responses.}

\section*{Regulatory mechanisms in Specific Immune Responses: Based on:}
- i). Prior exposure to ag Nature and concentration of ag (see lecture on antigens: Immunogenicity and antigenicity)
- ii). Sequestration of antigens in immune privileged sites
- iii). Circulating ab
- iv). Cytokines
- v). Anti-idiotypic ab: Network theory
- vi). T suppressor cells?
- i). Prior exposure to ag
Q. What is the overall result of primary exposure to antigen?
A. Primary exposure to ag can lead to
1) responsiveness (where primary and secondary responses differ) and production of memory T and B cells (with class switching)
2) induction of tolerance
Q. Tolerance is often mentioned in light of transplantation. But mechanisms for inducing tolerance couldn't have evolved in anticipation of medical technology. So, what is the evolutionary advantage to tolerance?
- A. Tolerance (induction of anergy) may simply be a reflection of the mechanisms for negative selection against self-reacting B and T cells. Tolerance may be necessary so the immune system doesn't respond to "self"antigens to which it is not exposed during maturation.
- Q. When does the body naturally contain tissues which are genetically dissimilar (besides the rearranged B and T cells leading to idiotopes on ab and TCR - see later).
- A. During sperm and egg cell production and pregnancy.
- ii). Ag sequestration - hiding self antigen from the immune system - e.g. lens of the eye, developing sperm cells, to some extent a developing fetus in the uterus.
- These are considered immune "privileged sites". (Note that this is not really "tolerance" since it is a passive process rather than an active one of inducing anergy or apoptosis in potential responding cells.)
- Q What is the basis for antigen competition that may occur when recent exposure to one antigen limits response to another.
- e.g. A mouse will develop a given response when infected with horse red blood cells (HRBC). However, if it is first primed a few days before by an injection of sheep RBC, the later response to HRBC is less than if the SRBC had not been injected.
- Thus, prior exposure to an unrelated antigen and priming of an ab response reduced the subsequent ab response.
- A This may result from interference by the first ag utilizing much of the APC capacity so the second ag is not as effectively presented and/or by the presence of down-regulating cytokines in the process of reducing the response to the first ag.
- Circulating ab
- Circulating ab may invoke a sort of negative feedback mechanism. For example, circulating maternal ab interferes with childhood vaccinations in kids under a year -- the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is not given until 1 year since it is not likely to elicit an immune response prior to that.
- Q Why?
- A One way this might occur is by the circulating ab binding to the ag and promoting clearance before any naive B cells can bind and become activated.
- Consider the following:
- A primary immune response to a carrier + hapten A generates circulating ab to hapten A.
- Next, a carrier with hapten A and a second hapten $B$ is introduced to elicit a secondary response to hapten A. If the earlier statement is true, you would expect the circulating ab to bind to the hapten A epitopes and assist clearance of the whole carrier + hapten A + hapten B complex before an immune response to the hapten B could be elicited.
- However, it turns out that this doesn't happen and a response to the second hapten does develop.
- Therefore, it is likely that circulating ab inhibits immune response in an epitope-specific fashion by competing for ag with the ab on naive B cells. If the circ. ab. binds all the epitopes, then the naive B cells, which are in low concentration, may never see the ag.
- However, other exposed epitopes such as those of hapten B in the example could be responded to.
- Cytokine-mediated regulation.
- Two classes of T helper cells have been identified that secrete different sets of lymphokines and lead to different responses.
- TH1 cells secrete interferon gamma and IL-2, thus stimulating cytotoxic cells. These cells are also involved in delayed type (Type IV) hypersensitivity
- TH 2 cells secrete IL-4 and IL-5 which activate B cells, and IL-10 which suppresses TH1 cells.

\section*{Other mechanisms.}
- Anti-idiotype mechanism
- Neuroendocrine control: There is increasing evidence that endocrine, nervous and immune systems interact via chemical mediators.

\section*{IMMUNOLOGY OF INFLAMMATION.}
- Learning objectives.
- Types of inflammation
- Causes of inflammation
- Stimuli for inflammatory processes
- Cellular events- Leukocyte extravasation and phagocytosis.
- Chemical mediators of inflammation.
- Termination of inflammatory response.

\section*{Introduction.}
- In vascularized tissues, exogenous and endogenous stimuli provoke a host of response called inflammation.
- The unique feature of the inflammatory process is the reaction of blood vessels, leading to the accumulation of fluid and leukocytes in extravascular tissues.
- Inflammatory response is closely intertwined with the process of repair.

\section*{Thus:}
- Inflammation serves to destroy, dilute, or wall off the injurious agent, and it sets into motion a series of events that try to heal and reconstitute the damaged tissue.
- Inflammation is fundamentally a protective response, the ultimate goal of which is to rid the organism of both the initial causes of cell injury (e.g., microbes, toxins) and the consequences, of such injury (e.g., necrotic cells).

NB: Inflammation and repair may be potentially harmful, however:
Inflammatory reactions, for example, underlie common chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and lung fibrosis, as well as life threatening hypersensitivity reactions.

\section*{Phases of inflammatory response:}
- Inflammatory response consists of two components: a vascular reaction and a cellular reaction.
- The circulating cells include neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes, basophils and platelets.

\section*{Inflammation is divided into:}
- Acute inflammation - rapid in onset (seconds or minutes) and is of relatively short duration.
- Its main characteristics are the exudation of fluid and plasma proteins, and the emigration of leukocytes, predominantly neutrophils.
- Chronic inflammation - is of longer duration and is associated with the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages, proliferation of blood vessels, fibrosis, and tissue necrosis.
- The vascular and cellular reactions of both acute and chronic inflammation are mediated by chemical factors that are derived from plasma proteins or cells, and are produced in response to or activated by the inflammatory stimulus.

\section*{Acute inflammation.}
- Is a rapid response to an injurious agent that serves to deliver mediators of host defense- leukocytes and plasma proteinsto the site of injury.
- Major components:
- Alterations in vascular caliber that lead to an increase in blood flow
- Structural changes in the microvasculature that permit plasma proteins and leukocytes to leave the circulation
- Emigration of the leukocytes from the microcirculation, their accumulation in the focus of injury, and their activation to eliminate the offending agent.

\section*{Stimuli for acute inflammation.}
- Varied and include, among others:
- Infections (bacterial, viral, parasitic) and microbial toxins
- Trauma (blunt and penetrating)
- Physical and chemical agents (thermal injury, e.g. , burns or frostbite; irradiation, e.t.c).
- Immune reactions (also called hypersensitivity)

\section*{Homing and movement of cells from peripheral blood into tissue during inflammatory response.}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_582ebd8aeeb06b78f560g-11.jpg?height=1345&width=2194&top_left_y=569&top_left_x=215)

\section*{Vascular changes:}
- Increased vascular permeability (vascular leakage):
-Leading to the escape of a protein-rich fluid (exudate) into the extravascular tissue.

Elicited by :
- histamine,
- bradykinin,
-leukotrienes (naturally produced eicosanoid lipid mediators, which may be responsible for the effects of an inflammatory response)
- Cytokines (IL-1, TNF, IFN-gamma);
-Many other chemical mediators.

Cellular events: leukocyte extravasation and phagocytosis.
- Useful to deliver leukocytes to the site of injury and to activate the leukocytes to perform their normal functions in host defense.
- Leukocytes ingest offending agents, kill bacteria and other microbes, and get rid of necrotic tissue and foreign substances.

\section*{However:}
- A price paid for the defensive potency of leukocytes is that they may induce tissue damage and prolong inflammation, since the leukocyte products that destroy microbes and necrotic tissues can also injure normal host tissue.

\section*{Leukocyte adhesion and transmigration.}
- Are regulated largely by the binding of complementary adhesion molecules on the leukocyte and endothelial surfaces, and
- chemical mediators- chemo attractants and certain cytokines- affect these processes by modulating the surface expression or avidity of such adhesion molecules.
- The adhesion receptors involved belong to 4 molecular families:
- The selectins (e.g. E-selectin, mucin-like glycoproteins- GlyCAM-1, CD34)
- The immunoglobulin superfamily (e.g. ICAM, VCAM)
- The integrins
- Mucin-like glycoproteins (e.g. heparan sulfate)

\section*{Acute Inflammatory Response.}

Cytokines produced by Macrophages cause dilation of small blood vessels

Leukocytes move to periphery of blood vessels as a result of increased expression of adhesion molecules

Leukocyte extra vasate at the site of infection

Blood clotting occurs in the micro vessels.

- Wheal Response
- Pain
- Redness
- Heat
-Swelling

\section*{Chronic inflammation.}

- Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)
- Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)

\section*{Anti-inflammatory agents.}
- Reduce Extravasation
- Anti-LFA antibodies
- Corticosteroids
- Immune-suppressive, induce apoptosis.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)-
- Aspirin, ibuprofen, phenylbutazone, acetameniophen.

\section*{Immune Regulation}

\section*{Immune regulation}

How the Immune System Maintains the Delicate Balance Between Effective Defense and Auto-immunity.
-To accelerate or to brake?
-Where to kill?
-Which cell to kill?
-How to maintain the diversity in the arsenal while avoiding self-destruction?

\section*{Concept of Immune Regulation}
- Immune responses are tightly regulated complex interaction of cells \& mediators through mechanisms that prevent anti-self reactivity
- Failure of regulatory control can occur leading to:
- Enhancement of immune responses or infection generating autoimmune reactions (loss of selftolerance)
- Decrease of immune responses leading to immunodeficiency state
- Shift in immune responses leading to allergy

\section*{Immunity to Infections}

\section*{Why we have an immune system...}
- Host-Parasitic relationship: a form of symbiosis in which one organism benefits (the parasite) while the other is harmed (the host)
- some form of host defense is present in all multicellular organisms
- some inverts have phagocytes
- all vertebrates have phagocytes, NK cells, and T and B cells
- antibodies become more complex (mammals)
- Toll receptors in drosophila => Toll-like receptors in mammals (an important innate receptor)

\section*{Infectious threats}
- viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, etc.
- most are friendly or neutral
- tolerated or controlled
- the minority of microbes cause disease
- these are termed virulent or pathogenic
- microbe entry => invasion and colonization of host tissues => evasion of host immunity => tissue injury/ impairment
- protection against microbial infection is the main physiological function of the immune system
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_04377855ee2e878fe8cdg-05.jpg?height=1621&width=2355&top_left_y=284&top_left_x=215)

\section*{Immunological memory}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_04377855ee2e878fe8cdg-06.jpg?height=1222&width=2152&top_left_y=680&top_left_x=327)

\section*{Innate immunity.}
- adaptive response typically takes 1-2 weeks to develop
- in the meantime, innate immunity:
- contains the infection transiently
- induces adaptive T and B cell responses
- in many cases innate immunity is also involved in pathogen clearance during the peak of the adaptive response

\section*{Basic principles of immunity}
- defense is mediated by effector mechanisms aimed at containment and clearance
- pathogens receive specialized responses
- pathogen survival hinges around evasion of effector responses.

\section*{Cellular versus Humoral immunity}

T helper type 2 (Th2)

\section*{Where the microbe lives plays a role in determining what type of immune response will be effective...}
- extracellular bacteria => antibody response
- intracellular bacteria => cell-mediated response
- viruses => both
- parasites => varies depending on the life cycle, structure, etc (often both)

\section*{Mechanisms of clearance: Phagocytosis}

Extracellular bacteria \\ Intracellular bacteria \\ Viruses \\ Parasites
}

\section*{Extracellular bacteria}
- Innate response involves activation of:
- complement (alternate) => LPS, PG, mannose
- TLR pathways, later activating adaptive response
- inflammatory response and influx of WBC
- can also cause fever, injury
- phagocytes => enhanced activity, opsonization, pathogen receptors
- neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs)

\section*{Extracellular bacteria (2)}
- Adaptive response, which relies mostly on antibody (humoral) responses
- block infection, eliminate microbes, neutralize toxins
- usually directed towards cell wall and secreted products
- opsonization, activation of classical complement
- CD4 response => cytokines and co-stimulation that help the mAb response
- Th1 cells => critical for neutrophil recruitment
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_04377855ee2e878fe8cdg-16.jpg?height=1622&width=2007&top_left_y=273&top_left_x=512)
© Elsevier. Abbas et al: Cellular and Molecular Immunology 6e - www.studentconsult.com

\section*{Intracellular bacteria}
- adapted to replicate inside cells, often phagocytes
- no antibody accessibility => CMI is critical
- activation of NK cells => kill infected cells, secrete Th1 cytokines
- IL-12 => key to inducing a Th1 response
- macrophage activation via CD40L and IFN- $\gamma=>$ increases killing of ingested microbes
- induction of ROS, NO, lysosomal enzymes (anti-microbial)
- if bacteria escapes phagosomes -> cytosol, they can be recognized by CD8+ T cells

\section*{Examples of Microbial Evasion of Immune Defenses.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Pathogen & Mechanism & Result \\
\hline Streptococcus pneumoniae & Capsule & Avoids phagocytosis \\
\hline Gram positive bacteria, some gram negative bacteria & Resist insertion of complement MAC & Avoid complement-mediated lysis \\
\hline Mycobacterium tuberculosis & Blocks lysosome fusion with phagosome & Avoids antibody and complement opsonization, macrophage killing \\
\hline Listeria monocytogenes & Escapes phagosome into cytoplasm & Avoids macrophage killing, presentation on Class II MHC \\
\hline Toxoplasma gondii & Escapes phagosome into own cytoplasmic vesicle & Avoids macrophage killing, presentation on both Class I and Class II MHC \\
\hline Treponema pallidum & Covers membrane with host proteins & Avoids immune system recognition \\
\hline Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Haemophilus influenzae & Expresses IgA protease & Avoids IgA neutralization \\
\hline Pseudomonas aeruginosa & Secretes elastase that inactivates C3a and C5a & Blocks inflammation \\
\hline Staphylococcus aureus & Secretes superantigens & Suppresses immune response \\
\hline Mycobacterium leprae & Stimulates Th2 response & Suppresses Th1 response \\
\hline & & 20 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Viruses}
- take over cellular machinery => injury + death
- use cell-surface receptors to enter various cell types
- immunity => blocking infection and clearing infected cells
- Innate response involves:
- NK killing, cytokine secretion
- infected cells, plasmacytoid DCs => secrete Type 1 interferons

\section*{Adaptive immunity to viruses}
- antibody response:
- early in infection, or when virus is between cells
- neutralization => prevents attachment, entry to cell
- opsonization, complement activation
- IgA important mucosally
- CD8+ T cell response:
- detects virus inside cytoplasm (infected cells, ingested)
- usually require CD4 help (same as abs)
- secrete cytokines, kill infected cells (Perforin-granzyme pathway)
- can target more conserved regions of viral genomes
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_04377855ee2e878fe8cdg-23.jpg?height=1317&width=2344&top_left_y=257&top_left_x=217)

Anti-viral immunity

\section*{Viral evasion}
- evolution (antigen variation)
- HLA down-regulation
- homologs to human proteins (EBV -> IL-10)
- CTL exhaustion

\section*{Parasites}
- infect $30 \%$ of the world's population
- protozoa, helminths, ectoparasites
- complex life cycles with intermediate hosts
- most cause chronic infections => weak innate immunity and evade adaptive responses

\section*{Parasites (2)}
- Innate:
- many parasites can resist phagocytosis
- some bind TLRs and activate APCs
- Adaptive:
- differs widely depending on life cycle, structure of the pathogen
- if intracellular => similar to intracellular bacteria
- extracellular => special types of antibody responses (lgE)

\section*{Depending on the parasite...}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Parasite/Disease & Immunity \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Protozoa} \\
\hline Plasmodium spp. (malaria) & antibody and CD8+ CTL \\
\hline Leishmania & CD4+ Th1, macrophage act. \\
\hline Trypanosoma & antibodies \\
\hline Entamoeba (Amebiasis) & antibodies, phagocytosis \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Metazoa} \\
\hline Schistosoma spp. & ADCC via eosinophils, macrophages, Th2 \\
\hline Filaria & cell-mediated immunity, ?antibodies \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Evasion}
- change antigenicity
- stage specific, programmed (Trypanosomes), shedding
- resist effector mechanisms aimed at clearance
- ie. tegument is difficult to phagocytose
- sequester away from immune responses
- insides cells, in cysts, intestinal lumen
- induce T cell tolerance
- Tregs

Dr. Oyaro
}

\section*{Outline}
*Introduction \&definitions
*Immune response to parasites/fungi
* Mechanisms of Immune evasion by parasites/fungi
*Immunopathology
* Prevention/Diagnosis

\section*{Introduction}
- The term parasite encompasses a vast number of protozoan and helminthic organisms (worms).
- Protozoans are unicellular eukaryotes that usually live and multiply within host cells for at least part of their life cycle,
- Helminths are multicellular organisms that can be quite large and have the ability to live and reproduce outside their human host.
Parasite-Is an organism (unicellular/multicellular) that depends on one or more organisms (host/hosts) to completes part or whole of its life cycle

\title{
Mechanisms of defense against parasites
}

\section*{Mehanisms of innate immunity}

Protozoa and helmints - mostly resistant
- complement and phagocytosis (protozoa)
- eosinophils and macrophages (helmints)

\section*{Immune responses to Protozoan parasites.}
1. Innate immune responses.
1. Extracellular protozoa eliminated -phagocytosis \& complement activation
2. Acquired immune responses
1. T cell responses.

ㅁ. Extracellular protozoa - $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 2$ cytokines - ab production.
ㅁ Intracellular protozoa - $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$ (cytotoxic lymphocytes) kill infected cells.
${ }^{0} \quad \mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{H}} 1$ cytokines activate macrophages \& $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$.
2. Antibody + Complement, e.g. lysis of blood dwelling trypanosomes.

\section*{Mechanisms of defense against parasites}

\section*{Mehanisms of adaptive immunity}

Protozoa
$\mathcal{B}$-cells, $C D 4^{+} \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 1$ and $C D 8^{+} \mathcal{T}$ cells
- antibodies (B-cells) - Entamoeba sp., Plasmodium sp.
-IFN-y production and macrophage stimulation (CD4+ $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 1$ cells) - Leishmania sp.
- cytotoxicity (CD8+ $\mathcal{T}$ cells)-Plasmodium sp.

Helmints
$\mathcal{B}$-cells and $C D 4^{+} \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}_{1}} 2$ cells
- stimulation of B-cells to produce IgE (IL-4)
- stimulation of eosinophils (IL-5 and IgE)
- degranulation of mast cells (IgE)
2. Note
- Activated macrophages effective against intracellular protozoa, e.g. Leishmania, Toxoplasma, Trypanosoma cruzi.
- CD8+ cytotoxic T cells kill parasite infected host cells, e.g. Plasmodium infected liver cell.

\section*{Acquired immune responses.}
1. Antibody responses.

Extracellular protozoa
1. opsonization,
2. complement activation
3. Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Intracellular protozoa
4. Neutralisation: e.g. neutralising ab prevents malaria sporozoites entering liver cells.

\section*{Immune responses to helminth infections.}
- Most extracellular
- Size: too large for phagocytosis.
- Some gastrointestinal nematodes - host develops inflammation \& hypersensitivity.
- Eosinophils \& IgE initiate inflammatory response in intestine / lungs.
- Histamine elicited - similar to allergic reactions.

\section*{Immune responses to helminth infections.}
1. Acute response
1. IgE \& eosinophil mediated systemic inflammation = worm expulsion.
2. Chronic exposure = chronic inflammation:
1. DTH, Th1 / activated macrophages granulomas.
2. Th2 / B cell responses increase lgE, mast cells \& eosinophils = inflammation.

\section*{Immune responses to helminth infections.}
- Helminths induce Th2 responses - IL-4, IL5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13 \& eosinophils \& ab (IgE).
- Characteristic ADCC reactions, i.e. killer cells directed against parasite by specific ab.
- E.g. Eosinophil killing of parasite larvae by IgE.

\title{
Mechanisms of defense against parasites
}

\section*{Injurious effect of immune response}
- granuloma formation and fibrosis (Schistosoma sp.)
- immune complex formation (Plasmodium sp.)

\section*{Mechanisms of immune evasion}
- existence of different forms/stages (Plasmodium sp...)
- alteration of surface antigens (Irypanosoma sp....)
- complement resistance (many parasites)
- "concealing" - cysts (Toxoplasma sp.), residence in gut (intestinal parasites)

\section*{Mechanisms of Immune evasion by Parasites}

1- Sequestration of Parasite
2-Parasite movement
4- Antigenic modification: variation, mimicry , shedding
5-Inhibition of Immune Factors (cytokines)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1f48b5e95db49283fef6g-15.jpg?height=609&width=758&top_left_y=652&top_left_x=2466)

6- Immunosuppression
7- Size (large)

\section*{Immunopathology}
- Pathological effect of the immune response
- Result of inappropriate and excessive host response
- May be an inevitable outcome of persistent parasitic infection
- Variability in clinical outcome - from asymptomatic disease to fatal outcome

\section*{Examples:}

1- Allergic reactions (type 1 hypersensitivity)
2- Eosinophilic pneumonia
3- Autoimmune reactions
4-Deposition of immune complex (type 3 hypersensitivity reaction)
5- Granuloma formation (delayed type hypersensitivity)
6-Immunosuppression:

\section*{Parasite vaccine strategies}
- There is as yet no safe uniformly effective vaccine against any human parasitic infection
* Complexity of the life cycle of the parasite makes the stage to be chosen for vaccine preparation difficult.
* Difficulty of identification and isolation of protective antigen to be used as vaccine.
* Possibility of inducing immunopathological lesions in response to the vaccine.
* Parasites may evade the immunity produced by the vaccine.
* Vaccine preparation may not be equally effective.

\section*{Fungi}
- extracellular agents
(some survive phagocytosis)
- yeast (unicelfular)
- molds (multicelfular)
- local and systemic mycoses
- most systemic infection - opportunistic
some endemic (dimorphic fungi)
- risk factor - immunodeficiency (neutropenia)

\section*{Fungi as Infectious Agents}
- Molds and yeasts are widely distributed in air, dust, fomites and normal flora.
- Humans are relatively resistant.
- Fungi are relatively nonpathogenic.
- Of the 100,000 fungal species, only 300 have been linked to disease in animals.
- Fungi are the most common plant pathogens.
- Human mycoses are caused by true fungal pathogens and opportunistic pathogens.
- True or primary fungal pathogen can invade and grow in a healthy, noncompromised host.
- Most striking adaptation to survival and growth in the human host is the ability to switch from hyphal cells to yeast cells.
- Thermal dimorphism - grow as molds at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and as yeasts at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{Emerging Fungal Pathogens}
- Opportunistic fungal pathogen has little or no virulence; host defenses must be impaired.
- Vary from superficial and colonization to potentially fatal systemic disease
- An emerging medical concern; account for 10\% of all nosocomial infections
- Dermatophytes may be undergoing transformation into true pathogens.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{TABLE 22.3} \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Common Opportunistic Fungi and Conditions That Predispose Patients to Them} \\
\hline Pathogen & Associated with \\
\hline Candida & Antibiotic therapy, catheters, diabetes, corticosteroids, ${ }^{\star}$ immunosuppression** \\
\hline Aspergillus & Leukemia, corticosteroids, tuberculosis, immunosuppression, IV drug abuse \\
\hline Cryptococcus & Diabetes, tuberculosis, cancer, corticosteroids, immunosuppression \\
\hline Zygomycota Species & Diabetes, cancer, corticosteroids, IV therapy, third-degree burns \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\begin{tabular}{l}
* Antiinflammatory drugs are often given for chronic lung diseases and to transplant patients to prevent rejection. \\
$\star \star$ Includes AIDS, and genetic conditions that compromise host defenses.
\end{tabular}} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Epidemiology of the Mycoses}
- Most fungal pathogens do not require a host to complete their life cycles and infections are not communicable.
- Dermaphytes and Candida sp naturally inhabit human body and are transmissible.
- True fungal pathogens are distributed in a predictable geographical pattern - climate, soil.
- Dermaphytoses most prevalent
- Cases go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
- Systemic, subcutaneous, cutaneous or superficial infections
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1f48b5e95db49283fef6g-26.jpg?height=1685&width=2233&top_left_y=42&top_left_x=508)

\section*{Pathogenesis of the Fungi}
- Portal of entry
- primary mycoses - respiratory portal; inhaled spores
- subcutaneous - inoculated skin; trauma
- cutaneous and superficial - contamination of skin surface
- Virulence factors - thermal dimorphism, toxin production, capsules and adhesion factors, hydrolytic enzymes, inflammatory stimulants

\section*{Antifungal Immunity}
- Antifungal defenses are the integrity of the barriers and respiratory cilia.
- Most important defenses are cell-mediated immunity, phagocytosis, and inflammation.
- Long-term immunity can only develop for some.

\section*{Mechanisms of defanse against fungi}

Mechanisms of innate immunity
Fungi - mostly susceptible
- phagocytosis (neutrophils)
- complement

Mechanisms of adaptive immunity
Cell-mediated immunity
- macrophage and neutrophil activation (CD4 ${ }^{+} \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 1$ and $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 17$ cells)

Injurious effect of immune response
- granuloma formation and fibrosis (Histoplasma capsulatum)

Mechanisms of immune evasion
- infibition of phagocytosis (C. neoformans...)

\section*{Infections}
- Diagnosis and identification require microscopic examination of stained specimens, culturing in selective and enriched media and specific biochemical and serological tests.

\section*{CONCEPTS OF VACCINOLOGY}

\author{
By Oyaro
}

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this session you should be able to
- To define vaccines and their importance
- To understand the development of a vaccine and its components
- To know the types/classification of vaccines, and the advantages/disadvantages

\section*{Introduction}
- Vaccines- all biological preparations, produced from living organisms, that induce immunity against disease and either prevent (prophylactic vaccines) or, in some cases, treat disease (therapeutic vaccines). Vaccines are administered in liquid form, either by injection, by oral, or by intranasal routes
- Composed of diseases causing microorganism or some of its components
- Agent stimulates the immune system to recognize it as foreign, destroy it and remember it.
- Targets the adaptive immune system
- Vaccines can be:
$\square$ Monovalent /univalent
- Multivalent /polyvalent
$\square$ Prophylactic or therapeutic

\section*{Immune system}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_bce3d98f1a9354690206g-05.jpg?height=1031&width=1933&top_left_y=514&top_left_x=178)

\section*{Vaccination}
- Administration of vaccine to induce immune response
- Passive-transfer of antibody
- Active-host induces the immune response
- Immunization- stimulation of the immune system via use of infectious agents

\section*{Aim of vaccination}
- Mimic natural infection and induce protective immunity by introducing pathogen components without causing disease
- Induce immunologic memory which leads to a better and faster response upon pathogen exposure
- Herd immunity- proportion of population that needs to be immunized to break transmission chain and provide protection to unvaccinated individuals

\section*{Immune response to vaccine}

\section*{antigens}
- Antigens are divided into T cell dependent and T cell independent
- The T cell independent are poor immunogens
- Induction of a T cell dependent antibody response initially requires activation of the $T$ helper CD4 lymphocytes by presentation of an antigen to the mononuclear phagocytes . (facilitated by adjuvants)
- The presentation triggers secretion of a cascade of cytokine which stimulate maturation of Thelper cells
- This is followed by secretion of antibodies after a latent period.

\section*{Immune response cont}
- IgM is detected first
- Within 2-6 wks the igM titers drop and the IgG titers rise
- In oral live vaccines, there is replication at the mucosal surfaces before host invasion and secretion of secretory IgA which neutralizes viruses efficiently, fix complement, prevent absorption of organisms to the intestinal wall and lyses gram negative bacteria.

\section*{Immune response cont}
- The antibodies produced in response to vaccine constituents therefore may be
$\checkmark$ antitoxins
$\checkmark$ opsonins
$\checkmark$ lysins
$\checkmark$ neutralizing antibodies
$\checkmark$ antiadhesins
Immunologic memory created by the $T$ and $B$ lymphocytes leads to heightened immune response on second exposure characterized by marked proliferation of antibody producing B and effector Tlymphocytes

\section*{Immune response to antigen}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_bce3d98f1a9354690206g-11.jpg?height=1327&width=1653&top_left_y=548&top_left_x=369)

\section*{Vaccinology}
- Science or methodology of vaccine development
- Scientific research regarding the organism pathogenesis and immune response it confers
- Identification of specific epitopes (antigenic determinants) to use as antigen
- Antigen generation and isolated from cells used to generate it
- Vaccine formulation
- Pre clinical trials in animals
- Clinical trial in human
- Phase 1-<100-safety, immunogenicity, dose response
- Phase 2-safety immunogenicity in several hundreds
- Phase 3-efficacy in thousands
- Phase 4-post marketing surveillance for safety and effectiveness

\section*{Vaccine additives}
- Adjuvant-non antigenic and enhance the immune response
$\square$ Enhance $T$ cell activation by promoting the accumulation of APC at site of exposure
$\square$ Increases expression of co stimulant molecules cytokines, HLA peptide complexes on the APC
$\square$ Slowed release of the Ag for sustained immune stimulation(depot effect)
[ Examples:liposomes,immune
stimulating complexes, aluminium salts etc

\section*{Other vaccine components.}
- Stabilizer- increases the storage life
- Preservatives-prevent contamination by bacteria of fungi
- Allow use of multidose vials
- Others include-suspending fluid, antimicrobial agents

\section*{Ideal vaccine}
- Long life immunity
- Protective against all variants of the organism
- Prevent disease transmission
- Induce effective immunity rapidly
- Transmit maternal protection to fetus
- Few immunization to induce protection
- Not administered by injection
- Cheap, stable, safe

\section*{Types of vaccines}
- Live attenuated
- killed
- Toxoid
- Subunit
- Conjugate
- Recombinant DNA based
- Anti-idiotype

\section*{Live attenuated vaccine}
- Live but virulent properties are disabled
- Use closely related organism less virulent
- Preferred in healthy persons
- More durable immune response
- Examples: Yellow fever, MMR, OPV, Typhoid, Rota

\section*{Killed vaccine}
- Outer coat is intact but the replicative function is destroyed
- Heat, chemicals, radioactivity, antibiotics
- More antigen needed
- Examples: IPV, Hepatitis A, Cholera, Rabies

\section*{LIVE vs KILLED VACCINES}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Properties & Live vaccine & Killed vaccine \\
\hline Dose & Low & High \\
\hline No. of doses & Single & Multiple \\
\hline Need for Adjuvant & No & Yes \\
\hline Duration of immunity & Many years & Less years \\
\hline Antibody response & Ig G & $\lg \mathrm{A}, \lg \mathrm{G}$ \\
\hline CMI & Good & poor \\
\hline Reverse to virulence & Possible & Not possible \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Toxoid vaccine}
- Inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism
- Examples: Tetanus, Diptheria

\section*{Subunit vaccine}
- Purified subunit-fragment of the microorganism is used to create immune response

Example-hepatitis B surface protein
- Recombinant-production of the unit via gene therapy
${ }^{\circ}$ Others-HPV vaccine caspid protein

\section*{Conjugated vaccine}
- Linking of the outer polysaccharide coat to a carrier protein
- Polysaccharide has poor antigenicity
- Important in infants
- Examples: hemophilus influenza B vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine

\section*{Factors influencing timing of vaccines}
* Nature of vaccine
- Age specific risk of disease
- Age specific risk of complications
- Ability of a person at a certain age to respond to a vaccine
- Potential of interferance with the immune response by passively transfered maternal antibody

Vaccination 1

\section*{Objectives}
- define vaccines and their importance
- discuss current vaccines, their mechanism(s) of protection, and the proof
- review of B cell biology
- discuss issues of timing and location of protection, herd immunity, vaccine delivery, and vaccines for babies and elderly
- review the types of vaccines (whole vs. subunit), and their pros and cons

\section*{Vaccination}
- "world's most cost-effective medical procedure for preventing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious disease.."
- represents one of the most important advances in the history of public health
- currently about 20 vaccines licensed for use.

\section*{Successful vaccines}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Disease & Max. cases (year) & Cases in 2004 \\
\hline Small pox & over 300m & eradicated 1979 \\
\hline Diptheria & 206,939 (1921) & 0 \\
\hline Measles & 894,134 (1941) & 37 \\
\hline Mumps & 152,209 (1968) & 236 \\
\hline Pertussis & 265,269 (1934) & 18,957 \\

\hline H. influenza B & ~20,000 (1984) & 16 \\
\hline Hepatitis B & 26,611 (1985) & 6,632 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{A vaccine..}
- "....is a preparation of microbial antigen, often in combination with adjuvants, that is administered to individuals to induce protective immunity against infection"
- Passive vs. Active vaccination
- passive: antibodies are given directly
- active: immune response is induced by the host

\section*{An adjuvant..}
- "...is a non-antigenic substance that enhances T cell activation by promoting the accumulation of antigen presenting cells at the site of antigen exposure..."
- increases expression of co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines, and HLA-peptide complexes on APCs
- whole vaccines contain "natural" adjuvants

\section*{Goal of vaccination}
- ...is to mimick infection and induce protective immunity by introducing pathogen components without causing disease
- induces memory, which leads to better and faster responses after exposure to pathogen
- Vaccine design can be either empirical or rationale
- Rationale: based on an understanding of protective immunity
- Empirical: trial and error

\section*{Current vaccines}
- most current vaccines:
- have been designed empirically
- are against extracellular pathogens and viruses that cause acute infection
- lead to "sterlizing" immunity
- elicit neutralising antibody responses
- BCG is the only exception => Th1 responses
- best correlate of protection in most -> certain attributes of the ab response
- less is known about the contribution of T cell responses
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_3120951a626b01f91f5cg-09.jpg?height=1716&width=2298&top_left_y=201&top_left_x=212)

\section*{Important points}
- antigen-presenting cells capture the vaccine antigen(s)
- whole vaccines and/or adjuvants
- analogous to natural infection
- induction of both T and B cell responses
- naïve B cells are optimally induced in germinal centers of lymph nodes by follicular dendritic and CD4+ helper T cells
- undergo clonal expansion
- differentiate into plasma cells and memory B cells
- isotype switch -> IgG
- produce higher affinity antibodies

\section*{Affinity maturation $=>$ boosting}
- affinity: strength of antibody-antigen binding
- antibody genes can undergo random genetic rearrangements leading to selection of the antibodies that can bind with higher affinity to antigen and provide better immunity
- first vaccine dose tends to generate weaker antibodies, while boosting or antigen persistence increases the strength of antibody binding

\section*{Important points (2)}
- memory B cells survive for many years through polyclonal activation
- regenerate plasma cells
- duration of protection is linked to B cell memory
- need an appropriate time between first dose and boost
- allows affinity maturation
- can potentially be sped up by adjuvants
- dose of antigen is critical
- higher dose gives better short term responses,
- lower dose better long term memory

\section*{Proof that antibodies protect}
- difficult to prove what is protective
- evidence from human and animal studies
- passive transfer of measles antibodies was found to be protective (1945)
- similar findings for other pathogens
- often the titer and/or affinity of antibodies predicts protection
- Titer: concentration of antibodies in serum
- H. influenza $\mathrm{B}=>0.15 \mathrm{ug} / \mathrm{ml}$ of high affinity ab protects

\section*{Proof that antibodies protect (2)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_3120951a626b01f91f5cg-14.jpg?height=643&width=997&top_left_y=703&top_left_x=284)

Outcome after vaccination and challenge
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_3120951a626b01f91f5cg-14.jpg?height=748&width=1029&top_left_y=692&top_left_x=1443)

Yellow Fever Vaccine
Measles Vaccine

\section*{Evidence for protective T cells}
- BCG
- very little antibody response, mostly CD4+ T cell dependent
- Pertussis
- vaccine can still protect after ab levels decline
- Measles
- disease severity is reducted in absence of abs
- Influenza
- T cells are important for cross-reactive protection
- recognition of less variable viral regions

\section*{Herd immunity}
- proportion of the population that needs to be immunized to break transmission chains and provide protection to unvaccinated individuals

\section*{Vaccine delivery}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_3120951a626b01f91f5cg-17.jpg?height=1250&width=941&top_left_y=620&top_left_x=252)

The Gene Gun
- most are injected intramuscularly
- can be mucosal (oral, nasal)
- some new ideas
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_3120951a626b01f91f5cg-17.jpg?height=794&width=1176&top_left_y=1094&top_left_x=1338)

OPV vaccine

\section*{Timing and location of protection}
- responses need to be made rapidly and where the infection challenge occurs
- mucosal pathogens ideally need mucosal responses
- ie, influenza, respiratory pathogens
- tetanus
- need pre-existing antibodies as toxins enter cells rapidly
- hepatitis B
- antibody response needs to occur before virus becomes established in the liver -> goes intracellular

\section*{Babies}
- most susceptible to many diseases, but have an immature immune system
- especially in the first year of life
- vaccine responses increase in a step-wise manner with age
- make poor IgG responses, don't form germinal centers, etc.
- poor duration of immunity
- but still enough so that boosting works
- maternal antibodies can inhibit or assist vaccine responses in babies
- competition with baby's B cells, neutralize the vaccine
- can still get T cell responses, sometimes better

\section*{The elderly}
- ageing is associated with waning antibodies and a reduced T cell repetoire
- can affect vaccine responses for some vaccines
- may need to alter vaccine regimens for the elderly
- more or higher doses

\section*{Types of vaccines}
- attenuated/inactivated
- BCG, cholera, polio, rabies
- purified antigen
- tetanus, diptheria
- synthetic antigen
- hepatitis B
- conjugate vaccines
"subunit" vaccines
- H. influenza B, S. pneumo
- viral vector*
- DNA vaccine*

\section*{Attenuated vs Inactivated}
- render the organism unable to cause disease while retaining immunogenecity
- repeated passage in cell culture, deletion mutants, etc.
- has all components of the original pathogen
- can get both CMI and antibody reponses, plus innate
- Louis Pasteur $=>$ attenuation in bacteria
- attenuated viral vaccines most effective
- often induce life-long immunity
- can be associated with disease, esp. if host is immunocompromised

\section*{Attenuated vs Inactivated (2)}
- polio
- oral (live) vs injected (inactive) elicit similar ab responses
- the oral vaccine is mucosal (same as route of infection), decreases intestinal secretion and therefore transmission
- inactive vaccine is safer (oral can cause paralysis)
- measles
- live is very effective but causes fever in $20-40 \%$
- inactive protection not as good, shorter, poorer T cell responses
- influenza
- traditional vaccine is inactivated
- new attenuated mucosal vaccine: single dose $=$ protection, good T cell responses, broader recognition, IgA production

\section*{Safety vs Efficacy}
"Very properly, the greatest emphasis is always placed on administering the vaccine in such a way that no unpleasant reaction ensues, but because vaccination must be safe for all, it is probably ineffective for many..."
- Rene Dubos, The White Plague: Tuberculosis, Man, and Society (1952)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_3120951a626b01f91f5cg-24.jpg?height=243&width=1811&top_left_y=1506&top_left_x=420)

\section*{Sub-unit vaccines}
- use only a portion of the pathogen, usually the part that has been shown to elicit protective responses
- adjuvants are critical for these vaccines
- can be safer -> less of an inflammatory response
- successful examples include purified and synthetic proteins, virus-like particles (HPV)
- under development include viral vectors and DNA (next week)

\section*{Conjugate vaccines}
- antibody responses to polysacchrides are T-independent
- typically lower avidity/ shorter duration
- poor memory
- can increase vaccine efficacy by linking polyS to protein carriers
- this leads to T and B cell responses and better memory/affinity
- high affinity, complement binding abs are the key correlate of protection

\section*{Note that:}
- most successful vaccines:
- elicit neutralising antibody responses and B cell memory
- antibody quality/quantity critical for protection
- T cells often induced simultaneously, imp. for long term memory
- are for acute, extracellular infections
- have been made empirically
- are for childhood infections
- For many pathogens => vaccines are under development

\section*{Vaccinology II}

MBChB II 4/7/11

\section*{Definitions and Immunological principles}
- Manipulation of the immune system to the benefit of the patient
- The adaptive immune response is manipulated in an antigen-specific manner to stimulate lymphocyte-mediated protective immunity
- Passive immunization: administration of preformed antibody ("antiserum") derived form human or animal donors to the recipient

\section*{Definitions and Immunological principles}
- The effect is immediate but shortlived as the transferred immunoglobulin is metabolized.
- Immunological memory does not develop
- Vaccination (active immunization): attenuated organisms, killed organisms or pathogen subunits are administered to an individual

\section*{Definitions and Immunological principles}
- The immune response develops slowly but immunological memory is evoked
- Re-exposure of the subject to the pathogenic organism produces a rapid, effective secondary response, which prevents symptomatic infection

\section*{Type of vaccines}
- Killed vaccines - preparations of normal infectious, pathogenic virus or bacteria that has been rendered non-pathogenic, usually by chemical treatment such as with formalin - cross-links viral proteins
- Attenuated vaccines - live virus or bacteria particles that grow in the vaccine recipient but do not cause disease as they have been altered (mutated) to a nonpathogenic form

\section*{Type of vaccines}
- Subunit vaccines - purified components of the virus, such as a surface antigen
- Toxoid - inactivated toxic compound
- Conjugate - polysaccharide capsule linked to a protein to increase the antigenicity
- Recombinant vector - physiology of one micro-organism combined to DNA of another

\section*{Aims of disease control to be achieved by immunization}
- Containment - accepts that disease will remain endemic but seeks to reduce morbidity to an acceptable level.
- Elimination - no endemic transmission in a population. Sporadic cases will occur because of imported cases, but transmission in immunized population fails to reestablish endemic transmission.

\section*{Aims of disease control to be achieved by immunization}
- Eradication- global destruction of pathogen allowing for cessation of all control measures achieving huge cost benefits for future generations.
- Requires the absence of an animal host \& a vaccine effective in preventing disease transmission.
- Smallpox only human disease eradicated thus far.

\section*{Passive immunization - clinical uses}
- Treatment of serious infections
- Secondary prevention post-exposure in individuals at high risk of mortality - botulism, rabies, tetanus, hepatitis B
- Neutralization of toxins (e.g. postsnake bite) and digitalis overdose (neutralizing antibody to inactivate the drug)

\section*{Active immunization (vaccination)}
- Produces an immune response capable of providing effective protective immunity in the absence of symptomatic infection
- In any population, some individuals will have contra-indications to particular vaccines or will fail to respond
- However, if 95\% of the population are vaccinated, those non-vaccinated subjects are unlikely to come in contact with an infected subject (herd immunity)

\section*{Active immunization (vaccination)}
- Live attenuated vaccines - provide strong immunization of the appropriate type \& site for natural infection
- Risk of reversion to pathogenic strains causing disease. Pose a particular risk especially immunocompromised subjects
- Killed vaccines - do not pose a risk of infection.
- Elicit weaker responses than live attenuated vaccines. Booster doses are usually required

\section*{Active immunization (vaccination)}
- Subunit vaccines - contain proteins, carbohydrates, or inactivated toxins from organisms.
- Less immunogenic than intact organisms, and may require adjuvants to elicit effective immune responses
- Schedules usually involve multiple doses
- Side effects are less prominent than with whole organisms
- No risk of vaccine-associated infection

\section*{Vaccination - clinical uses}
- Some vaccines are offered to everyone, while others are reserved for people at particular risk because of an underlying medical condition, occupational risk or travel
- Schedules of routine vaccination vary in different parts of the world
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline VACCINE & TYPE & INDICATIONS, SCHEDULE \\
\hline BCG & Live attenuated & Birth \\
\hline Tetanus & Toxoid & Childhood, 3 doses \\
\hline Diphtheri a & Toxoid & " \\
\hline Pertussis & Subunit or cellular & " \\
\hline HiB & Conjugated polysaccharide & " \\
\hline Hepatitis B & Subunit & Childhood; occupational risk, 3 doses \\
\hline Measles & Live attenuated & Single dose at 9 months \\
\hline Polio & Live attenuated or killed & Childhood; 3 doses \\
\hline Influenza & Subunit; new preparation on annual basis & Medical risk - chest dz, elderly, diabetes, immunocompromised) Environmental risk - nursing homes Occupational risk - healthcare workers \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Contra-indications to vaccination}
- Moderate or severe illness, with or without fever
- Anaphylactic reaction to vaccine or its constitute
- Live attenuated vaccines:
- Pregnant women
- Immunocompromised children
- Within 3 months of intravenous immunoglobulin

\section*{Properties of an ideal vaccine WHO}
- Safe
- Affordable worldwide
- Heat stable
- Effective after a single dose
- Applicable to a number of diseases
- Administered by a mucosal route
- Suitable for administration early in life

\section*{Modern approaches to vaccine development}
- Development of more effective \& safer vaccines, as well as vaccines for other diseases is a major area of research
- Molecular techniques have facilitated the production of large quantities of proteins for use as subunit vaccines safely \& relatively cheaply
- Vaccination has been particularly successful in diseases where natural infection leads to sterilizing immunity and long-term immunity. Many other diseases remain major public health problems

\section*{TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY.}

Teaching Objectives:
- Know the antigens expressed by cancer cells.
- Understand the nature of immune response to tumors.
-Study how cancers evade immune system.
-Describe the approaches used in Immunotherapy.

\section*{Tumor immunology}
* Pathological cell masses derived by abnormal and uncontrollable clonal expansion of single cell.
* Transformation of normal cells to malignant cells by:
a- Spontaneous mutation during daily cell division
chemical carcinogens
b- It may be induced by
physical carcinogens
viruses
* Cells become antigenically different from normal cells
* They are recognized and destroyed by immune system

\section*{Immune Surveillance System}
* During neoplastic transformation, new antigen develops
* The host recognize them as non-self antigens
* Cell mediated immune reactions attack these non-self tumor cells
* Immune response act as surveillance system to detect and eliminate newly arising neoplastic cells

\section*{Immune Surveillance System}

This system include :
1) Natural killer (NK) cells

They kill directly tumor cells, helped by interferon, IL-2
2) Cytotoxic T-cells

They also kill directly tumor cells
3) Cell mediated T-cells (effector T-cells)

They produce and release a variety of lymphokines :
a-Macrophage activation factor that activate macrophage b-Gamma interferon and interleukin-2 that activate NK
c-Tumor necrosis factor (cachectine)

\section*{Immune Surveillance System}
4) B-cells :
- Tumor associated antigens stimulate production of specific antibodies by host B-cells
- These specific antibodies bind together on tumor cell surface leading to destruction of tumor through:
a- Antibody mediated-cytotoxicity :
kill
Cytotoxic T-cells
Trorsoated tumor cells
b- Activation of macrophages
release
Sensitized T-cells macrophage activating factor IgG-coated tumor cells macrophages
acti
c- Activation of classical pathway of complement Lysis of tumor cells
leading to

\section*{Tumor Escape}

Mechanisms by which tumor escape immune defenses:
1) Reduced levels or absence of MHCl molecule on tumor so that they can not be recognized by CTLs
2) Some tumors stop expressing the antigens

These tumors are called "antigen loss variants"
3) Production of immunosuppressive factors by tumor e.g. transforming growth factor (TGF- $\beta$ )
4) Tumor antigens may induce specific immunologic tolerance

\section*{Tumor Escape (ctd)}
5) Tumor cells have an inherent defect in antigen processing and presentation
6) Blocking of receptors on T-cells by specific antigen -antibodies complex (after shedding of tumor Ag) prevents them from recognizing and attacking tumor cells
7) Antigens on the surface of tumors may be masked by sialic acidcontaining mucopolysaccharides
8) Immune suppression of the host as in transplant patients who show a higher incidence of malignancy

\section*{Tumor Markers}
* Tumor markers :
* They are either
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_9acd2d1f0743a960ba14g-08.jpg?height=460&width=1186&top_left_y=752&top_left_x=926)
* Tumor products are released in the serum of patients
* They are used to confirm diagnosis and follow up the response to therapy

\section*{Tumor Antigens as tumor markers}
1) Alpha fetoprotein antigen (AFP) in cases of hepatoma
2) Carcinoembryoinic antigen (CEA) in gastrointestinal tumors, tumors of biliary system and cancer breast
3) Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) in ovarian carcinoma
4) Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) in breast cancer
5) Cancer antigen 19-9 in colon and pancreatic tumor
6) Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) in prostatic tumors

\section*{Tumor Products}
a) Hormones :
- Human chorionic gonadotrophins (HCG) are secreted in cases of choriocarcinoma
- Thyroxin (T3 \& T4) is secreted in cases of cancer of thyroid gland
b) Enzymes :
- Acid phosphatase enzymes in cases of cancer of prostate
- Alkaline phosphatese, lipase and amylase enzymes in cases of cancer pancreas

\section*{Immunotherapy.}
$\AA$ Immunotherapy has been used as a novel mode to treat cancer.
$\AA$ Both active and passive means of stimulating the non-specific immune systems have been employed, in some cases with significant success.
1) Active Immunotherapy: Wherein the host actively participates in mounting an immune response
Å a). Nonspecific:
i. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
ii. Corynebacterium parvum
$\AA$-These activate macrophages to be tumoricidal.
b. Specific:
i. Hepatitis B vaccine
ii. Human Papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine
2. Passive Immunotherapy: This involves transfer of preformed Abs, immune cells and other factors into the hosts.
a. Specific:
i. Antibodies against tumor Ags (e.g. Her2/Neu for treatment of breast cancer)
ii. Abs against IL-2R for Human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1)induced adult $T$ cell leukemia.
iii. Abs against CD20 expressed on non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma.
iv. Abs conjugated to toxins, radioisotopes and anti-cancer drugs have also been used. These enter the cells and inhibit protein synthesis. E.g. anti-CD20 conjugated to Pseudomonas toxin or ricin toxin.
b. Nonspecific:
i. Adoptive Transfer of lymphocytes:
1) Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells which are IL2 activated T and NK cells.
2) Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
ii. Dendritic cells pulsed with tumor Ags may induce tumor-specific T cell responses. As tumor Ags are usually not known, tumor lysates are used.
iii. Cytokines
1) IL-2: Activates T cells/NK cells used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma
2) Interferon alpha (IFN- $\alpha$ ): Induces MHC expression on tumors and used in the treatment of hairy B cell leukemias
3) Interferon gamma: Increases MHC expression; for treatment of ovarian cancers.
4) TNF- $\alpha$ : Kills tumor cells.
iv. Cytokine gene transfected tumor cells may also be used.

\section*{TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY.}

Teaching Objectives:
- Introduction to Cancer Immunology.
- Know the antigens expressed by cancer cells.
- Understand the nature of immune response to tumors.
-Study how cancers evade immune system.
-Describe the approaches used in Immunotherapy.

\section*{Malignant Transformation:}
- The proliferation of normal cells is carefully regulated.
- However, such cells when exposed to chemical carcinogens, irradiation and certain viruses may undergo mutations leading to their transformation into cells that are capable of uncontrolled growth, producing a tumor or neoplasm.

\section*{Tumor immunology}
* Pathological cell masses derived by abnormal and uncontrollable clonal expansion of single cell.
* Transformation of normal cells to malignant cells by:
a- Spontaneous mutation during daily cell division
b- It may be induced by
chemical carcinogens physical carcinogens viruses
* Cells become antigenically different from normal cells
* They are recognized and destroyed by immune system

\section*{Etiology Of Tumor.}
1) Inherited :

Expression of inherited oncogene
e.g. viral gene incorporated into host gene
2) Viral:
- Human papilloma, herpes type 2, HBV, EBV (DNA)
- Human T-cell leukemia virus (RNA)
3) Chemical
- Poly cyclic hydrocarbons cause sarcomas
- Aromatic amines cause mammary carcinoma
- Alkyl nitroso amines cause hepatoma
4) Radiological: Ultraviolet \& ionizing irradiation
5) Spontaneous: failure in the cellular growth control
- Cancer cells are the progeny of a single transformed cell that undergo unregulated cell proliferation
- A tumor may be:
-Benign: If it is not capable of indefinite growth and the host survives.
-Malignant: If the tumor continues to grow indefinitely and metastasize, eventually killing the host.
- This uncontrolled growth may be due to upregulation of oncogenes (cancer inducing genes) and/or down-regulation of tumor suppressor genes (that normally inhibit tumor growth often by inducing cell death).
- Solid tumors are collections of attached cancer cells which can metastasize (spread) from their original site.
- "Liquid" tumors are leukocyte tumors that circulate in the blood and may also form masses elsewhere in the body.

\section*{Evidence for existence of an immune response against tumors.}

The following criteria serve as evidence that tumors can elicit an immune response.
i. Tumors that have severe mononuclear cell infiltration have a better prognosis than those that lack it.
ii. Certain tumours regress spontaneously (e.g. melanomas, neuroblastomas).
iii. Some tumor metastases regress after removal of primary tumor.
iv. Although chemotherapy leads to death of a large number of tumor cells, the few that evade the action of the drugs can outgrow and kill the host. However, the immune system may be able to mount an attack against the few tumor cells that are spared by the chemotherapeutic agent.
v. There is an increased incidence of malignancies in immunodeficient patients such as AIDS patients who are susceptible to Kaposi sarcoma and transplant patients who are susceptible to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-induced lymphoma.

\section*{Evidence for existence of an immune response against tumors (ctd).}
vi. Tumor-specific antibodies and lymphocytes (detected in cytotoxicity and proliferative response assays) have been observed in patients with tumors.
vii. The young and the old population have an increased incidence of tumors. These members of the population often have an immune system that is compromised.
viii.Hosts can be specifically immunized against various types of tumors.

\section*{Tumor antigens.}
- Tumorigenesis may lead to expression of new antigens or alteration in existing antigens that are found on normal cells.
- These antigens may include membrane receptors, regulators of cell cycle and apoptosis, or molecules involved in signal transduction pathways.

\section*{Tumor Associated Antigens.}
1). Viral Antigen:
a- Viral proteins and glycoproteins
b- New antigens produced by virally infected host cells under control of viral nucleic acid
2). Tumor specific antigens:
- Tumor cells develop new antigen specific to their carcinogens
3). Tumor specific transplantation antigens:
- Tumor cells express new MHC antigens due to alteration of normally present MHC antigens.

\section*{Tumor Associated Antigens (ctd).}
4). Oncofetal antigens:
a- Carcino-embryonic antigens (CEA)
- Normally expressed during fetal life on fetal gut
- Reappearance in adult life:

GIT, pancreas, biliary system and cancer breast
b- Alpha fetoprotein:
- Normally expressed in fetal life
- Reappearance in adult life; hepatoma
- Although chemical-, UV- or virus-induced tumors express neo-antigens, majority of the tumors are often weakly immunogenic or non-immunogenic.
- In most cases, tumor-specific transplantation Ags cannot be identified easily.

\section*{Virus-induced tumors:}

Viruses that cause tumors include.
- DNA viruses:
1. Papova (papilloma, polyoma) viruses. Ex. Papilloma virus causes cervical cancer
2. Hepatitis virus: Hepatitis B virus causes hepatocellular cancer.
3. Adenoviruses
- RNA viruses:

Retroviruses: Human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) causes adult T cell leukemia.

Virus-induced tumors express tumor-associated viral Ags these are cell surface antigens that are distinct from antigens on the virion itself.

However, transplantation-associated viral Ags are shared by all tumors induced by the same virus, regardless of tissue origin of the tumor or normal animal in which the tumor exists.

\section*{Chemically-induced tumors}
- Chemically-induced tumors are different from virally-induced tumors in that they are extremely heterogeneous in their antigenic characteristics.
- Thus, any two tumors induced by the same chemical, even in the same animal, rarely share common tumor specific antigens. These unique antigens on chemicallyinduced tumors are referred to as tumorspecific transplantation antigens (TSTA).

\section*{Immune Surveillance System}
* During neoplastic transformation, new antigen develops
* The host recognize them as non-self antigens
* Cell mediated immune reactions attack these non-self tumor cells
* Immune response act as surveillance system to detect and eliminate newly arising neoplastic cells

\section*{Immune Surveillance System}

This system include :
1) Natural killer (NK) cells

They kill directly tumor cells, helped by interferon, IL-2
2) Cytotoxic T-cells

They also kill directly tumor cells
3) Cell mediated T-cells (effector T-cells)

They produce and release a variety of lymphokines :
a-Macrophage activation factor that activate macrophage b-Gamma interferon and interleukin-2 that activate NK
c-Tumor necrosis factor (cachectine)

\section*{Immune Surveillance System}
4) B-cells :
- Tumor associated antigens stimulate production of specific antibodies by host B-cells
- These specific antibodies bind together on tumor cell surface leading to destruction of tumor through:
a- Antibody mediated-cytotoxicity :
kill
Cytotoxic T-cells $\longrightarrow$ IgG-coated tumor cells
b- Activation of macrophages
Sensitized T-cells $\xrightarrow{\text { release }}$ macrophage activating factor IgG-coated tumor cells $\qquad$ macrophages

c- Activation of classical pathway of complement leading to Lysis of tumor cells

\section*{Tumor Escape}

Mechanisms by which tumor escape immune defenses:
1) Reduced levels or absence of MHCI molecule on tumor so that they can not be recognized by CTLs
2) Some tumors stop expressing the antigens These tumors are called "antigen loss variants"
3) Production of immunosuppressive factors by tumor e.g. transforming growth factor (TGF- $\beta$ )
4) Tumor antigens may induce specific immunologic tolerance

\section*{Tumor Escape (ctd)}
5) Tumor cells have an inherent defect in antigen processing and presentation
6) Blocking of receptors on T-cells by specific antigen antibodies complex (after shedding of tumor Ag) prevents them from recognizing and attacking tumor cells
7) Antigens on the surface of tumors may be masked by sialic acid-containing mucopolysaccharides
8) Immune suppression of the host as in transplant patients who show a higher incidence of malignancy

\section*{Tumor Markers}
* Tumor markers :
* They are either
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_b4357691a12744ea22d8g-21.jpg?height=306&width=453&top_left_y=759&top_left_x=924)

> Tumor antigens
> Tumor products (enzymes and hormones)
* Tumor products are released in the serum of patients
* They are used to confirm diagnosis and follow up the response to therapy

\section*{Tumor Antigens as tumor markers}
1) Alpha fetoprotein antigen (AFP) in cases of hepatoma
2) Carcinoembryoinic antigen (CEA) in gastrointestinal tumors, tumors of biliary system and cancer breast
3) Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) in ovarian carcinoma
4) Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3) in breast cancer
5) Cancer antigen 19-9 in colon and pancreatic tumor
6) Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) in prostatic tumors

\section*{Tumor Products}
a) Hormones :
- Human chorionic gonadotrophins (HCG) are secreted in cases of choriocarcinoma
- Thyroxin (T3 \& T4) is secreted in cases of cancer of thyroid gland
b) Enzymes :
- Acid phosphatase enzymes in cases of cancer of prostate
- Alkaline phosphatese, lipase and amylase enzymes in cases of cancer pancreas

\section*{Immunotherapy.}
- Immunotherapy has been used as a novel mode to treat cancer.
- Both active and passive means of stimulating the non-specific immune systems have been employed, in some cases with significant success.
1) Active Immunotherapy: Wherein the host actively participates in mounting an immune response
- a). Nonspecific:
i. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
ii. Corynebacterium parvum
- -These activate macrophages to be tumoricidal.
b. Specific:
i. Hepatitis B vaccine
ii. Human Papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine
2. Passive Immunotherapy: This involves transfer of preformed Abs, immune cells and other factors into the hosts.
a. Specific:
i. Antibodies against tumor Ags (e.g. Her2/Neu for treatment of breast cancer)
ii. Abs against IL-2R for Human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1)-induced adult $T$ cell leukemia.
iii. Abs against CD20 expressed on non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma.
iv. Abs conjugated to toxins, radioisotopes and anti-cancer drugs have also been used. These enter the cells and inhibit protein synthesis. E.g. anti-CD20 conjugated to Pseudomonas toxin or ricin toxin.
b. Nonspecific:
i. Adoptive Transfer of lymphocytes:
1) Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells which are IL-2 activated T and NK cells.
2) Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
ii. Dendritic cells pulsed with tumor Ags may induce tumor-specific T cell responses. As tumor Ags are usually not known, tumor lysates are used.
iii. Cytokines
1) IL-2: Activates T cells/NK cells used in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma
2) Interferon alpha (IFN- $\alpha$ ): Induces MHC expression on tumors and used in the treatment of hairy B cell leukemias
3) Interferon gamma: Increases MHC expression; for treatment of ovarian cancers.
4) TNF-a: Kills tumor cells.
iv. Cytokine gene transfected tumor cells may also be used.

- defects in adenosine deaminase (ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) genes
a accumulation of dATP or dGTP causing toxicity to lymphoid stem cells
- Defects in RAG1 and RAG2 genes
$\square$ their absence results in the absence of antigen receptor and hence lack of T and B cell differentiation.

\section*{PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCY.}

\section*{Learning Objectives:}
- Define immune deficiency and note its frequency and inheritance pattern
- Understand the genetic basis for immune deficiency.
- Enumerate and define the more common forms of B lymphocyte deficiency
- Enumerate and define the more common forms of T cell deficiency.

\section*{Primary verses secondary immune deficiency.}
- Immune deficiency syndromes exist which affect many cells of the immune system.
- Immune deficiencies can be primary (genetic) or secondary (caused by an exogenous agent).
- Secondary immune deficiencies can result from a variety of agents.
- The single most common cause of acquired immune deficiency a part from AIDS is iatrogenic.
- NB: Most importantly, the underlying immune deficiency, regardless of its cause, predicts the clinical and laboratory features of the disease.
- E.g. AIDS is primarily a malfunction/depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes and hence the unique role of CD4+ lymphocytes in immune function.

\section*{Primary immune deficiency Syndromes.}
- The primary immune deficiencies are genetic and as such are usually apparent within the first several years of life.
- Often, they appear after the newborn is six months of age.
- The diagnosis is always suspected in children who suffer from recurrent, protracted infections.

\section*{Types of Primary Immune deficiency Syndromes.}
1. Congenital, X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (Bruton Disease)
- The disease is related to an inherent inability of the B cells to properly rearrange immunoglobulin heavy chain genes.
- Without proper gene rearrangement, it is impossible for the pre-B cell to differentiate into a mature B cell.
- The molecular basis is a defect in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK).
- Symptoms appear 5-6 months after birth
- Histologically, these patients have underdeveloped germinal centers in lymphoid organs;
- They have decreased levels of circulating B cells but have normal levels of pre-B cells in the bone marrow.
- Total serum immune globulins are reduced.
- Clinically, the patients have a plethora of infections most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and encapsulated organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptocococcus pneumoniae.
- These can result in lethal pneumonias.
- Increased susceptibility to enteroviruses is also seen.
- The incidence of autoimmune disorders is increased.
2. Common Variable Immune Deficiency.
- This disease may be congenital or acquired.
- All patients have hypogammaglobulinemia. This may be all isotypes or only IgG.
- About one third of patients have a decreased circulating number of $B$ lymphocytes.
- The B lymphocyte-rich areas of lymphoid organs are hyperplastic.
- The underlying mechanisms are different in various patients.
- Some have B-cell defects while others are affected by antibodies directed against B cells.
- A few have T-cell regulatory abnormalities.
- Clinically, patients are susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections similar to Bruton's Disease; however, onset is frequently in late (> 2yrs).
3. Isolated IgA deficiency.
- IgA deficiency is characterized by frequent respiratory infections, diarrhea, and hypersensitivity reactions.
- This disease is relatively frequent, affecting 1:700 individuals
- Most remain entirely asymptomatic.
- The underlying disorder is not well characterized but it appears that the maturation and terminal differentiation of IgAsecreting $B$ cells is blocked.
- Rare patients also lack lgG2 and lgG4 as well as $\lg A$ and are more susceptible to infections.
- About one half of patients have IgE directed to $\lg A$; these patients can have anaphylactic reactions to exogenous $\lg A$ if given experimentally or therapeutically.

\section*{4. Thymic Hypoplasia (DiGeorge Syndromes)}
- This is a rare, severe immune deficiency and is a classic example of T-cell deficiency.
- It occurs when the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches fail to develop properly, leading either to absent or severely hypoplastic thymus.
- Additionally, these patients frequently lack parathyroid glands and have malformation of the great vessels of the heart.
- Presentation of this defect may be calcium abnormalities early in life, secondary to the lack of parathyroid glands.
- Abnormal facies are common.
- This disease is developmental but has a genetic basis in that 22 q 11 is deleted.
- If there is some thymic tissue, the patients frequently will develop normal thymic responses by the age of five years.
- The types of opportunistic infections mimic children with AIDS.
- They include fungal, viral, protozoan infections and recurrent infections with intracellular bacteria.

\section*{5. Severe Combined Immune Deficiency}
- The term "combined" suggests that a portion of both the humoral (B cells) and cellmediated ( $T$ cells) immune system is affected.
- Errors may occur primarily within one system or the other.
- Several variants exist. All are rare.
- In all cases, the thymus is hypoplastic.
- The most common form is X-linked and results from a mutation in the gamma ( Y ) chain of a cytokine receptor family, resulting in aberrant responses to a variety of cytokines.
- The second common variant, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA), affects T cells more than B cells. In this disease, there is an accumulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine triphosphate which is toxic to lymphocytes and especially to $T$
lymphocytes.
- The most common opportunistic pathogens seen in SCID are Candida sp. Pneumocystis carinii, and cytomegalovirus although any number of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections can occur.
- Therapy is bone marrow transplantation.
6. Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.
- This X-linked disease is an X-linked recessive disorder with complex clinical features including eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infection by encapsulated bacteria.
- The immune deficiency is not known but appears to involve both B and T lymphocytes.
- IgM is usually quite deficient.
- The defect appears to be in a cytoskeletal protein called Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)

- No evidence of genetic transmission, unlike CVID

\section*{Agent-Induced Immunodeficiency}
- Exposure to any of a number of environmental agents that induce an immunosuppressed state
- Corticosteroids - inhibition of T cell activation, B cell maturation \& cytokine synthesis; lymphopaenia
- Immunosuppressive \& cytotoxic drugs (AZA, MTX, 6-MP, cyclophosphamide), Radiotherapy - bone marrow suppression
- Cyclosporine - inhibits T cell signalling
- Biologics e.g. rituximab

\section*{Extremes of age}
- The very young and the very old
- Neonates, especially premature babies can be very susceptible to infection,
- Degree of prematurity linked to the degree of immune dysfunction
- All the basic immune components are in place in a full-term healthy newborn, but the complete range of innate and adaptive immune functions take some time to mature

\section*{Malnutrition}
- Affects both innate and adaptive immunity
- Low protein-calorie diets (hypoproteinemia) associated with depressed T-cell number \& function; deleterious B cell effects may take longer to appear
- Micronutrient insufficiency (zinc, ascorbic acid) also contributes to immunodeficiency
- Vitamin D deficiency linked to an inhibition in the ability of macrophages to act against intracellular pathogens e.g. M.tuberculosis

\section*{Medical states}
- Splenectomy
- Antibody deficiency \& susceptibility to infections with encapsulated bacteria, malaria, salmonellosis
- Poor nutrition; surgery/trauma/ICU
- Protein-loosing states
- Renal disease

Immunology of HIV Infection

\section*{HIV/AIDS}
- HIV causes AIDS
- AIDS first recognized as opportunistic infections in a cluster of individuals on both coasts of the US in June 1981
- Displayed unusual infections e.g. PJP, previously limited to individuals taking immunosuppressive drugs; KS, a rare skin tumour, etc.
- Evaluation revealed a deficiency in cell-mediated immune responses and a significant decrease in the CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cell subpopulation ( $T_{H}$ cells)

\section*{HIV/AIDS}
- Majority of the patients were homosexual males
- Others thought to be at risk at that time:
- Promiscuous heterosexual individuals of either sex and their partners
- Recipients of blood \& blood products prior to 1985
- Infants born to HIV-infected mothers

\section*{Adult HIV Prevalence, 2015}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-12.jpg?height=1307&width=2382&top_left_y=333&top_left_x=497)

\section*{HIV/AIDS Epidemic}
- Approximately 36.7 million people living with HIV at the end of 2016; 2.1 million were children ( $<15 \mathrm{yr}$ old)
- 1.8 million new infections
- 1 million AIDS-related deaths
- 35 million deaths since the start of the epidemic

\section*{HIV/AIDS Epidemic}
- Kenya - $4{ }^{\text {th }}$ largest epidemic (2016)
- 1.6 million people living with HIV
- 5.4\% adult HIV prevalence
- 62,000 new infections
- 36,000 people died from AIDS-related deaths (64,000 in 2010)
- 64\% adults with HIV on ART, 65\% children

\section*{Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1)}
- Retrovirus of the lentivirus genus (displays long incubation periods)
- Characterized by Luc Montagnier in Paris \& Robert Gallo in Bethesda, Maryland, USA (1983)
- RNA virus; reverse-transcribed to DNA when the virus enters a cells, by the virally coded reverse transcriptase enzyme
- This copy of DNA is called a provirus; it's integrated into the cell genome and replicated along with the cell DNA
- When the provirus is expressed to form new virions (viral particles), the cell lyses

\section*{HIV-1}
- Alternatively, the provirus may remain latent in the cell until some regulatory signal starts the expression process
- HIV-2 isolated from AIDS sufferers in Africa about 5 years after the discovery of HIV-1
- HIV-2 prevalence limited mostly to West Africa; disease progresses much more slowly

\section*{Structure of HIV}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-17.jpg?height=1234&width=1464&top_left_y=391&top_left_x=289)
- Lipid envelope derives from the host cell; contains some host cell membrane proteins e.g. MHC I \& II
- Env studded by 2 viral glycoproteins, gp120 \& gp41 which are important for the infection process
- Within the env is the viral matrix p17 and the core/nucleocapsid (p24)
- Genome consists of 2 copies of ssRNA, associated with 2 molecules of RT (p64), a protease (p10) and and integrase (p32) - viral enzymes

\section*{Transmission}
- Intimate contact with body fluids
- Sexual contact (75\%)
- Unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse
- Receipt of infected blood or blood products
- Transfusions, contaminated needles \& syringes
- Perinatal transmission HIV-infected mothers to their infants
- During labour and delivery (in utero)
- Breast milk

\section*{Spread}
- Direct infection of activated but resting memory CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells present within vaginal mucosa is the likely primary initial source in the FGT (the most studied location)
- Dendritic cells take up the virus (may not become infected) \& transport intact infectious virus to T cells
- Free virus can also squeeze between epithelial cells or gain access through microabrasions
- Whether free of cell-associated, the virus migrates through the submucosa to the draining lymph node, where the adaptive immune response can be initiated (\& further spread)

\section*{HIV-1 Life Cycle}
- Infects cells that carry the CD4 antigen - $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$ cells, monocytes, macrophages
- High-affinity interaction between gp120 \& CD4
- Expression of a co-receptor required for viral entry - CCR5 or CXCR4 (chemokine receptors)
- Infection of a T cell assisted by CXCR4, while CCR5 is the preferred coreceptor for viral entry into monocytes and macrophages
- RNA genome of the virus reverse transcribed \& a complementary DNA (cDNA) copy integrates into the host genome

\section*{HIV-1 Life Cycle}
- The integrated provirus is transcribed
- The various viral RNA messages are spliced \& translated into proteins
- These initial viral proteins are cleaved by the virally encoded protease into forms that make up the nuclear capsid in a mature infectious viral particle
- Viral expression leads to newly formed virions that bud from the surface of the infected cell, often causing cell lysis
- HIV-1 can also become latent or remain unexpressed for long periods of time in an infected cell

(1) HIV gp120 binds to CD4 on target cell.
(2) HIV gp41 binds to a chemokine receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) and fuses with the target cell membrane.
(3) Nucleocapsid containing viral genome and enzymes enters cells.
4) Viral genome and enzymes are released following removal of core proteins.
(5) Viral reverse transcriptase catalyzes reverse transcription of ssRNA, forming RNA-DNA hybrids.
(6) Original RNA template is partially degraded by ribonuclease H, followed by synthesis of second DNA strand to yield HIV dsDNA.
(7) The viral dsDNA is then translocated to the nucleus and integrated into the host chromosomal DNA by the viral integrase enzyme.

(1) Transcription factors stimulate transcription of proviral DNA into genomic ssRNA and, after processing, several mRNAs.
(2) Viral RNA is exported to cytoplasm.

3a. Host-cell ribosomes catalyze synthesis of viral precursor proteins.
(3b) Viral protease cleaves precursors into viral proteins.
4) HIV ssRNA and proteins assemble beneath the host-cell membrane, into which gp41 and gp120 are inserted.

5a The membrane buds out, forming the viral envelope.
(5b) Released viral particles complete maturation; incorporated precursor proteins are cleaved by viral protease present in viral particles.

\section*{Pathophysiology and Clinical Course}
- Gradual impairment of immune function \& progression to AIDS
- Isolation of HIV-1 \& its growth in culture allowed purification of viral proteins \& development of tests for detection infection
- ELISA - detection of Abs against HIV-1 proteins e.g. gag p24, one of the most immunogenic HIV proteins
- Antibodies appear in serum of infected individuals within 6 12 weeks after exposure, but can take up to 6 months to appear - seroconversion

\section*{Phases of HIV infection}
- 3 phases which occur over 8 to 12 years
- Acute/primary infection phase
- No detectable anti-HIV-1 antibodies
- Flu-like symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, malaise, headache) approximately 2 to 4 weeks after exposure
- High rate of viral replication; viral load (number of virions) can be quite high in blood and other body fluids
- Decreasing amount of CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells
- After a few weeks the immune system catches up controlling viral replication where it remains for several years

\section*{Phases of HIV infection}
- Chronic asymptomatic phase/Latency
- No signs or symptoms of illness
- This phase lasts 10 years on average
- Gradual decline in CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells
- Driven by an immune response involving antibodies \& cytotoxic CD8 ${ }^{+}$T cells that keep viral replication in check \& drive down the viral load
- Viral load can be measured by PCR assays for viral RNA

\section*{Phases of HIV infection}
- AIDS
- Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome - profound deficiency in T cell immunity
- Greatly diminished numbers of CD4+ T cells ( $<200 \mathrm{cells} / \mu \mathrm{l}$ of blood)
- Opportunistic infections - C.albicans, PJP, TB etc
- Without ART this phase can lead to death within 2 to 3 years

\section*{HIV, CD4 Decline, Complications}

\section*{Mechanism of Progression to AIDS}
- Understanding how the immune system holds HIV-1 in check during the asymptomatic phase could aid in the design of effective therapeutic \& preventive strategies
- Long-term nonprogressors (infected individuals who remain asymptomatic for very long periods without treatment) are the subject of intense study
- Also high-risk populations who remain seronegative despite known \& repeated exposure e.g. CSWs
- Discovery of CCR5 deletion
- Presence of strong CD8+ T cell responses
- HLA-associated influences on disease susceptibility

\section*{Mechanism of progression to AIDS}
- Plasma viral loads remain fairly stable throughout the period of chronic HIV infection
- LN biopsies show high levels of infected cells at all stages of infection, with effacement, long before plasma viral load increases above the steady-state level
- Lymphoid tissue in the GI tract also depleted - thought to be the main site of HIV-1 replication and CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cell depletion
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-39.jpg?height=1349&width=2931&top_left_y=108&top_left_x=184)

\section*{Immunological Abnormalities in HIV/AIDS}
- Progressive depletion of CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells
- Impaired T-cell immunity (even when CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells are present in normal numbers)
- Impaired mononuclear macrophage function
- Impaired production of specific antibody despite a polyclonal increase in serum immunoglobulins that lack antibody functions

\section*{$\mathrm{CD}^{+}{ }^{+}$T Cell Depletion}
- Direct viral infection \& destruction
- Half-life of an actively infected $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$T cell is less than 1.5 days
- Smaller numbers of CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells become infected but do not actively replicate virus; these latently infected cells persist for long periods
- $\mathrm{CD}^{+}$T cell count (and viral load) are the primary focus of follow-up testing in HIV-infected individuals

\section*{Other Immunologic Consequences}
- Decrease or absence of delayed type hypersensitivity
- Decreased serum immunoglobulins (especially IgG \& IgA)
- Impaired cellular responses to antigens
- The HIV-infected individual loses the ability to mount T-cell responses in a predictable sequence
- Responses to specific recall antigens (e.g. influenza virus) are lost first
- Then response to alloantigens declines
- Finally mitogenic responses to stimuli disappear
- Innate responses also impacted, including NK \& dendritic cell functions

\section*{Antiretroviral Therapy}
- HAART/cART - use of 3 or more anti-HIV drugs from different classes, to overcome the ability of the virus to rapidly produce drug resistant mutants
- In many cases, cART has lowered plasma viral loads to undetectable levels
- Virus may persist in sites that are not readily penetrated by ART, e.g. brain, thereby making it difficult to eradicate all virus from an infected individual and cure AIDS

\section*{A vaccine may be the only way to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic}
- Prevent infection and/or progression to disease
- Challenges to vaccine development
- Rapid mutation of HIV-1 (many variants)
- Neutralizing antibodies do not necessarily inhibit viral spread
- Limited animal models

Secondary Immune Deficiencies.
Learning Objectives:
-The causes of acquired immune deficiency.
-A relative immune compromise occurring with normal aging.
- Molecular Biology of HIV and AIDS
-Cellular immune dysfunction due to AIDS.
-Immune response to HIV infection.
-Therapeutic and vaccine targets in HIV infection, and the draw backs.

\section*{Introduction.}
- Acquired immune deficiencies may be caused by infection with a virus.
- Also, a relative immune compromise occurs with normal aging.
- Cancer, chronic disease, severe protein loss, liver disease- all cause a general diminution of the immune response.
- Some are due to decreases in systemic immune globulins (protein wasting diseases, malnutrition);
- Others are probably due to systemic effects of cytokines (some viral diseases, cancer);
- Still others are due to unknown cause (liver disease).
- Perhaps the most frequently overlooked is the role of the physician in producing immune compromise.
- Immunological suppressants such as corticosteroids, chemotherapy, some potent antimicrobials, and transplant medications can produce profound immune deficiencies that may lead to the death of the individual.
- The lecture will concentrate on a disease that produces profound immune deficiency through a relatively selective depletion of CD4+ lymphocytes.
- AIDS, first described in 1981 and, has been the subject of countless research publications and articles.

\section*{Human Immunodeficiency Virus.}
- The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
- Need to be conversant with molecular biology of HIV as a virus.

\title{
SECONDARY IMMUNODEFFICIENC Y
}

\author{
DR DEEPA PATEL
}
- Primary immunodeficiency
> Usually an immunodeficiency one is born with.
- secondary immunodeficiency
- Born with normal immune responses but some secondary factor or occurrence causes a decrease in immune response

\section*{Secondary immunodeficiency is induced by factors such as:}
> Malnutrition. Inhibits lymphocyte maturation and function.
> Some viruses, e.g., HIV. Depletes T4lymphocytes.
> Irradiation - exposure to X-rays and gamma rays. Causes a decreased production of lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow.
- Cytotoxic drugs such as many used in cancer chemotherapy. Causes a decreased production of lymphocyte precursors in the bone marrow.

\section*{Secondary immunodeficiency is induced by factors such as: (cont)}
> Corticosteroids - anti-inflammatory steroids. Damages lymphocytes.
- Leukemias, cancers of the lymphoid system, metastases. Reduces areas for lymphocyte development.
> Aging. Adaptive immunity, especially cellmediated immunity, tends to diminish with aging.
- Removal of the spleen. Decreased ability to remove microbes that enter the blood.

\section*{ACQUIRED IMMUNO DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)}

A secondary immunodeficiency caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

A retrovirus from the lentivirus subfamily.
There are two types of HIV.
- HIV - 1 - worldwide, main cause of the worldwide pandemic
> HIV - 2 (west Africa, Mozambique and Angola).
- Similar illness to HIV - 1 , less efficiently transmissible, vertical transmission - rare, less aggressive with slower disease progression

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VIRUS}

Viral particle is spherical, diameter - 80-100 nm
$\square$ Icosahedral (20 sided), enveloped virus
[] Retroviruses - transcribe RNA to DNA.
[ Two viral strands of RNA found in core surrounded by protein outer coat.
- Outer envelope contains a lipid matrix within which specific viral glycoproteins are imbedded.
- These knob-like structures responsible for binding to target cell.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_bd9bb8fc4f4e7f759164g-07.jpg?height=1592&width=2153&top_left_y=135&top_left_x=167)

The outer shell - viral enevlope.
Embedded in the viral envelope is a
- Complex protein known as env
- Consists of an outer protruding cap glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem gp 41.

Within the viral envelope - HIV protein called p17(matrix)

Within matrix there is the viral core or capsid, which is made of another viral protein p24 (core antigen).

\section*{HITV LIFE CYCLE}
$\square$ Binding, Fusion and Entry
[] Integration \& Replication
[] Transcription
[] Budding
- Maturation

\section*{BINDING}

First step, HIV attaches to susceptible host cell - HIV envelope glycoprotein GP 120 binds to the host receptor CD4 molecule co-receptors are necessary (CCR5/CXCR4).

CD4 antigen is found on a variety of cells
- Helper T cells, macrophages, monocytes, B cells, microglial brain cells, intestinal cells
- T cells infected later on.

\section*{FUSION AND ENTRY}

Viral binding to host cell triggers fusion of the viral and host cell membranes (Mediated by gp 41)
Allows entry of virus core into host cell cytoplasm
Core protein dissolved by host enzymes releasing viral RNA and enzymes

\section*{INTEGRATION}

Reverse transcriptase converts the single stranded viral RNA into a double stranded DNA molecule

The DNA enters the host cell nucleus
Integrase catalyses the process of integration of the viral DNA into the host cell's DNA

\section*{TRANSCRIPTION}
- Integrated viral DNA turns the host cell into a "factory" for manufacturing more virus.
- Activation of host cell results in transcription of viral DNA into mRNA.
- mRNA translated into viral precursor proteins
- Viral proteins are produced as a single multi-protein molecule
- Viral proteins cleaved by protease enzyme

\section*{BUDDING AND MATURATION}

Viral proteins together with RNA gather at the membrane of the CD4+ cells

Viral particles are formed which bud off the cell and enter the blood stream

The CD4 cells are often destroyed by HIV virus infection and replication resulting in nrofolind immunar effienct
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_bd9bb8fc4f4e7f759164g-15.jpg?height=1675&width=2322&top_left_y=100&top_left_x=89)

\section*{EARLY (ACUTE) HITV INFECTION}
$\square$ Median incubation period - around 10 years
[ Mucosal lymphoid tissues - virus primarily infects and destroys memory T4-lymphocytes \& dendritic cells.
[ Dendritic cells capture antigens through pinocytosis and phagocytosis and become activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines,
- The dendritic cells detach from the epithelium, enter lymph vessels, and are carried to regional lymph nodes.
$\square$ By the time they enter the lymph nodes, the dendritic cells have matured and are now able to present antigens of HIV to naive T-lymphocytes located in the the lymph nodes in order to induce adaptive immune responses.

\section*{CHRONIC PHASE}

Characterized by viral dissemination, viremia, and induction of adaptive immune responses.

The viremia allows the viruses to spread and infect T4-helper lymphocytes, macrophages \& dendritic cells found in peripheral lymphoid tissues.

During most of this phase - immune system remains active and competent (few clinical symptoms).

A steady state-infection generally persists where T4lymphocyte death and T4-lymphocyte replacement by the body are in equilibrium.

\section*{CHRONIC PHASE (CONT)}

It is estimated that 10 billion virions are produced and cleared in an infected individual each day. However,

The enormous turnover of T4lymphocytes eventually exhausts the lymphopoietic system and it becomes unable to replace the T4-cells being destroyed.

A variety of mecharisms then eventually lead to immunodeficiency.

\section*{MECHANISMS OF HIVINDUCED IMMUNODEFICIENCY}

Direct HIV-induced cytopathic effect on infected T4lymphocytes. This can occur through:
- Increased cell permeability as a result of gp41 expression in the host cell membrane and viral release by budding
[] Inhibition of host cell protein synthesis as a result of viral replication within the infected cell
$\square$ Fusion of infected T4-cells with numerous uninfected T4cells resulting in syncytia formation

Killing of HIV-infected T4-cells by cytotoxic Tlymphocytes or CTLs

\section*{MECHANISMS OF HIVINDUCED IMMUNODEFICIENCY (CONT)}

Killing of HIV-infected T4-cells by antibody-dependent cytotoxicity or ADCC
- Apoptosis of T4 cells as a result of chronic activation by HIV \& cytokines
[ Shedding of gp120 molecules by HIV - triggers a series of events that cause the adaptive immune system to become less and less effective, primarily by altering the normal balance of immunoregulatory $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{h}} 1$ and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{h}} 2$ cells in the body.

0 Impaired function of HIV infected macrophages and dendritic cells.

During the replication of HIV the reverse transcriptase of HIV exhibits a high error rate as it transcribes the RNA genome into DNA.

As a result, HIV readily mutates immunoresistant, more drug resistant, and able to change the preferred cell type it is able to infect, , e.g, M-tropic to T-tropic

\section*{PROGRESSION TO AIDS}

Viral load progressively increases in number while the immune system weakens (destruction of increasing numbers of t4-lymphocyte)

Inability of the body to continually replace these destroyed cells

The loss of T4-helper lymphocytes leads to a marked decline cytotoxic Tlymphocytes (CTLs);, the primary cells the body's immune responses use to destrov

\section*{AIDS}

Susceptible to a variety of opportunistic infections by
Bacteria - Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Salmonella, and Nocardia
[] Protozoa - Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma
$\square$ Viruses - cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2), and varicella zoster virus (VZV)

Candida, Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis.

\section*{Increased incidence of tumors}
- Epstein-barr virus-associated b-cell lymphomas,
- Other lymphomas,
- Cervical cancer, and
- Kaposi's sarcoma.

Wasting syndrome and encephalopathy are also common.

\section*{CORTICOSTEROI}

\section*{DS}

Changes in cell traffic
- Circulating lymphocytopenia
$\checkmark$ Peaks 4-6hrs, returns to normal - 24 hrs
$\checkmark$ CD4 cells are more depleted
- Monocytopenia (depletion do not occur with repeated dosage)
- Neutrophilia - release of mature stored cells from bone marrow
- T cell activation \& B cęll maturation inhibited

\section*{CORTICOSTEROIDS (CONT)}

Cytokine synthesis is inhibited (IL -1, IL - 2, IL - 4, IL - 6, IL - 10, TNF $\alpha$ \& IFN $\gamma$ ), this inhibits activation of T cells \& cells of monocyte/macrophage system

\section*{CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE}

Mainly affects lymphocyte function \& numbers, particularly after low dose oral therapy.
- Low dose oral therapy -greater impact on cell mediated response
- Bolus intermittent therapy - greater impact on Ab production

As it Interferes with both B \& T cell function, effective in controlling both Ab mediated \& cell mediated immune responses
[] Clinical significance - management of
- Auto-antibody mediated disease
- Allograft rejection

\section*{AZTHIOPRINE}

Active only on dividing cells (cytotostatic)
Action - competitive inhibition of purine metabolism \& by incorporation into DNA

T \& B cells are reduced after prolonged oral therapy

Decreased NK cell activity
Mycophenolate - lymhocyte (both T \& B cells) proliferation iş blocked.

\section*{METHOTREXATE}

Structural analogue of folic acid \& blocks folic acid dependent pathways needed for DNA synthesis

Prolonged treatment - reduction in immunoglobulin's

Anti inflammatory effects
- Adenosine (produced during inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase in purine synthesis) - inhibitor of activated PMN's
- Methotrexate Inhibits of arachidonic acid
- $\square$ in CRP \& ESR

\section*{CICLOSPORIN, TACROLIMUS \& RAPAMYCIN}

Affect T cell signaling, hence T cell functioning
Ciclosprin \& tacrolimus
- Binds to immunophilins (cytoplasmic $\longrightarrow$ proteins) - intracellular calcium inhibiting cytokines \& genes essential for T cell proliferation \& function.

Rapamycin
- Arrests cells in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ phase death by apoptosis

\section*{NUTRIENT DEFECIENCIES}

\section*{Most common cause of immunodeficiency worldwide}

There are 5 aspects of immunity which are consistently affected
1. CMI
2. Phagocyte function
3. Complement system
4. Secretory antibody
5. Cytokine production

\section*{NUTRIENT DEFECIENCIES (CONT)}

Can result from
- Economic constraints
- Cancer, chronic renal failure, burns, multiple trauma, chronic infection (particularly measles, pneumonia, TB, diarrhea)

Infection and malnutrition can aggravate each other
[ Affects lymhoid tissue, lymphoid atrophy (morphological feature of malnutrition)

\section*{NUTRIENT DEFECIENCIES (CONT)}

The extent of damage of lymphoid tissue depend on
- Rate of cell proliferation
- Amount and rate of protein synthesis
- Role of individual nutrients in metabolic pathways (Zn, Fe, Vit B ${ }_{6}$ etc. have key roles in immune process

Nutritional thymectomy - malnourished children, $\square$ in weight and size

\section*{NUTRIENT DEFECIENCIES - PEM}

Affects CMI \& phagocytosis
Reduction in CMI indicated by $\square \mathrm{CD} 4$ cells \& [] CD4/CD8 ratio

\section*{Type I Hỵpersensitivity}

\section*{Preformed Mediators:}
1. stored in granules in mast cells
1. Histamine - most important mediator in humans, although a similar function is performed by serotonin in other species, e.g., rodents
- most of the characteristics of anaphylaxis can be mimicked in humans by injection of histamine alone
- present in granules at very high concentrations as an electrostatic complex with heparin. After fusion of the granules histamine is released from the heparin complex by ion-exchange effects
- stimulates contraction in most smooth muscle, vasodilation and permeability in post-capillary venules, drop in blood pressure

\section*{Type I Hỵpersensitivity}

\section*{2. Preformed Mediators:}
1. Eosinophil chemotactic factor - attracts and prevents further migration of eosinophils and neutrophils
2. Neutrophil chemotactic factor - attracts and prevents further migration of neutrophils
3. Degradative enzymes including: Arylsulfatase - inactivates leukotrienes chymase - degrades proteins N acetylglucosaminidase - degrades heparin

Type I Hỵpersensitivity

\section*{2. Causes and Results}
-for humans can result from, bee or wasp sting, seafood, nuts.
-can also result from CrOSS linking of drug to self protein (i.e., penicillin, insulin)
-can result in asthma, hay fever, systemic or localized anaphylaxis

\section*{Type I Hỵpersensitivity}

\section*{Lipid Mediators:}
- formed and secreted after mast cells are activated
1) Leukotrienes B4, C4, D4:
- formerly known as SRS-A, slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis
- arachidonic acid metabolites structurally related to prostaglandins
- contracts bronchioles and increases capillary permeability
2) Platelet-activating Factor (PAF):
- synthesized from phospholipids in the cell membranes
- active at $10^{10} \mathrm{M}$
- potent hypotensive agent
- most potent bronchorestricting agent in asthma and allergic rhinitis (hay fever)
- aggregates and lyses platelets releasing serotonin and other mediators
- promotes eosinophil infiltration
- PAF antagonists represent an active area of research, particularly for drugs to prevent abnormalities in reproduction
3) Prostaglandin D2 and other prostaglandins

\section*{Type I Hỵpersensitivity}

\section*{Cytokines:}
- stimulates production of lymphokines (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CS~), which stimulate production of leukocytes, more mast cells - stimulates production of bradykiniin, which causes vasodilation, hypotension

\section*{Type I Hypersensitivity}
Self

\section*{Type I Hypersensitivity}

\section*{Systemic Anaphylaxis:}
- most severe and life-threatening type of allergic response
- characteristics:
- generalized flush, palpitations, dizziness, apprehension, urticaria, angioedema and abdominal cramps
- may proceed to dyspnea, seizures, cyanosis, shock, and/or death
- begins 3 to 4 min after administration
- causes:
-xenogenic sera, allergenic extracts, dextrans, therapeutic enzymes, polypeptide hormones, penicillins and cephalosporins.
- localized anaphylaxis affects only certain vasodilation smooth muscles most common is hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and asthma (localized bronchial constriction)
- Skin grids are useful for detecting if a person will respond to an allergen; Risk of sensitizing the individual as well as leading to shock.

\section*{Type I Hỵpersensitivity}

\section*{Type I Hỵpersensitivity}

\section*{Histamine Causes a Wide Array of Effects}
- smooth muscle cells - Constriction
- small blood vessels - Vasodilation
- mucous glands - Mucous secretion
- blood platelets
- sensory nerve endings

Histamine Receptors
(H1 and H2
receptors

\section*{Type I Hypersensitivity}

\section*{4. Therapeutic Immediate-Hypersensitivity Antigens}
- Therapy for allergies based on hyposensitivity
- Typical therapy depends on the injection of known quantities of an allergen in the hope of increasing the amount of IgG over IgE capable of reacting with the allergen

Type II Hỵpersensitivity

\section*{Rho(D) Immune Globulin (RhIG)}

Antigen Source Human erthrocytes with Rho(D) surface antigen.

\section*{Production Process}

RhoD- men or sterile women are immunized with Rho(D) cells in order to produce anti-Rho(D) antibodies.

The antibodies are harvested from plasma collected from these donors.

\section*{Type III Hypersensitivity a.k.a immune complex hypersensitivity}
$\square$ mediated by soluble immune complexes
- mostly of IgG class, sometimes IgM
- The antigen may be exogenous (chronic bacterial, viral or parasitic infections), or endogenous (nonorgan specific autoimmunity:
$\square$ The antigen is soluble and not attached to the organ involved.
$\square$ Primary components are soluble immune complexes and complement (C3a, 4a and 5a).
$\square$ Damage is caused by platelets and neutrophils.
$\square$ Reaction may take 3-10 hours after exposure to the antigen

\section*{Type III Hypersensitivity}

\section*{1. Mechanism}
- Large immune complexes are formed from complement
- Complexes are deposited on blood vessel walls or tissues
- Mast-cells bind the complement at specific receptors and are activated
- Neutrophils are attracted to the site leading to tissue damage

\section*{E. Therapeutics Based on Type IV Hypersensitivity}
- Type IV hypersensitivity is associated with several diseases and conditions, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, deep fungal infections, etc.
- Type IV is also associated with allergic reactions to contact antigens like poison ivy and poison oak

\section*{Hypersensitivity Reactions: \\ Take Home Message}
1. Allergic or Hypersensitivity reactions result from an non-desirable immune response.
2. Both CMI and AMI are involved in allergic reactions.
3. Complement is an important part of the immune responses ability to combat bacterial infections.
4. Hypersentivity reactions are a major reason for drug induced pathologies.

\section*{TYPE 1 HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION}

\section*{INTRO}
- in various conditions as a result of injection; IM or IV.
- Reactions to certain drugs
- drug history important
- post injection pt monitoring- 15-30 min

\section*{definition}
- type 1 hypersensitivity is a rapidly developing immunologic reaction occurring within minutes after the combination of an antigen with antibody bound to mast cells in an individual previously sensitized to that antigen.
- Divided into 2 phases
1. immediate responses that occurs within $5-30$ minutes
2. late phase that can extend from hours to days
- Pathogenesis is the same while signs and symptoms are dependent on the systems involved.

\section*{Immunopathogenesis of type 1 reactions}
1. when an antigen gains access to a mucosa either via inhalation, ingestion, or by contact it will be recognized by an antigen presenting cell.
2. The antigen presenting cell will take up the offending antigen, process it and exhibit it together with MCH II to a TH2 helper cell.
3. The TH2 helper cell will secrete various cytokines (proallergic cytokines); IL2, IL4, 5 \& 13.
- IL2 is responsible for recruiting, differentiation and proliferation of other lymphocytes esp. B lymphocytes.
- IL4 is responsible for undertaking the switch over of IgG to IgE in the B cell.
- Il5 activates and maintains eosinophils in the area of the allergic reaction.
- IL13 promotes IgE production and acts on epithelium to produce secretions.
4. in addition th2 cell and epithelial cells produce chemokines that attract more th2 cells as well as eosinophils and basophils.
5. The IgE molecules produced bind to Fc receptors on mast cells and basophils
- secondary exposure is vital for type 1 reaction to occur
- contact with mast cells or basophils with IgG on its surface, on the epithelium will elicit reaction
- the antigen will bind adjacent arms (FAB portion) of IgE molecules. In this way cross link adjacent IgE molecules. This cross linking phenomenon will result in transduction of signals
into the cytoplasm that will cause the release of primary and secondary mediators of inflammation.
- The release of primary mediators is immediate; they comprise of
- biogenic amines e.g Histamine (causes intense smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability and increased gland secretions in the epithelium)
- Enzymes e.g neutroproteases and acid hydrolases
- proteoglycans e.g heparin (anticoagulant) and condroitin sulphate.
- after about $30 \mathrm{~min}-2 \mathrm{hrs}$, release of secondary mediators. Divided into lipid mediators and cytokines
- lipid mediators - derived from the break down of phospholipids to yield arachidonic acid which is broken down into leukotrienes and prostaglandins
- Leukotrienes - C4 \& D4 - Potent basoactive and spasmogenic agents
- B4 - Highly chemotactic for neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes.
- PGD2 - Causes intense smooth muscle contraction as well as mucus secretion.
- Platelet activating factor (PAF) - Causes platelet aggregation, release of histamine, smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation.
- Also chemotactic for neutrophils and eosinophils.
- cytokines
- alpha TNF
- GM-CSF - more white cell production
- Macrophage inflammatory proteins.
- the role of eosinophils is important because it produces major basic protein, eosinophil cataioning protein - these are toxic to epithelial cells. They also produce Leukotriene C4 and PAF.
- when it involves a viscera, damage is chronic

\section*{TYPE II \& III HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS.}

\section*{Teaching Objectives:}
-Understand the classification of hypersensitivity reactions
-Know the diseases associated with hypersensitivity reactions (in this case types II \& III)
- Understand the mechanisms of damage in hypersensitivity reactions
-Know the methods for diagnosing conditions due to hypersensitivity
- Know the modes of treating disease due to hypersensitivity and their rationale.

\section*{TYPE II HYPERSENSITIVITY (ANTIBODYMEDIATED CYTOTOXIC) RXN.}
- Type II hypersensistivity reactions involve antibodymediated destruction of cells.
- Antibody can activate the complement system; Creating pores in the membrane of a foreign cell (see fig), or
- It can mediate cell destruction by antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
- In this process, cytotoxic cells with Fc receptors bind to the Fc region of antibodies on target cells and promote killing of the cells
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-03.jpg?height=1221&width=1117&top_left_y=298&top_left_x=150)
A. Complement mediated.

Classical pathway of complement activation.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-03.jpg?height=1215&width=1341&top_left_y=301&top_left_x=1280)
B. Ab-dependent

\section*{Mechanism of Ab-mediated injury in type II hypersensitivity Rxn}
A. Complement-dependent rxns that leads to lysis of cells or render them susceptible to phagocytosis.
B. In ADCC, IgG-coated cells are killed by cells that bear Fc receptors for IgG (e.g. natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages)
C. Anti-receptor antibodies disturb the normal functions of receptors. In the following example, acetylcholine receptor antibodies impair neuromuscular transmission in myasthenia gravis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-05.jpg?height=1878&width=2479&top_left_y=143&top_left_x=142)

\section*{Cytotoxicity in type II hypersensitivity Reactions.}
- Cytotoxic reactions occur when IgG or IgM Abs bind to Ag on the surface of cells and activate complement cascade, culminating in destruction of the cells. e.g. druginduced auto-Abs, Ab-mediated autoimmunity, cross reactive Abs elicited following infection or modified self-Ags.
- The targeted cell is either damaged or destroyed.

\section*{1- Complement-mediated reactions:}
- Ab reacts with cell membrane component, leading to complement fixation. Complement cascade classical pathway is activated.
- Cell may be lysed or opsonization mediated by receptors for Fc or C3b that expressed on MØ and PMNLs.
- Blood cells are most commonly affected by this mechanism.

\section*{2- Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity "ADCC".}
- It uses Fc receptors on many cells "e.g. NK cells, M $\varnothing$, PMNLs, eosinophils as a means of bringing these cells into contact with Ab-coated target cells.
- Lysis requires contact but does not include phagocytosis or complement activation.
- ADCC lysis of target cells is similar to that of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$ cells, perforin and granzymes are released, perforins form pores, granzymes "serine proteases" activate events leading to apoptosis.
- ADCC reactions involve IgG and IgG Fc receptors.
- IgE can also be involved "the mechanism is similar to type l".

\section*{3- Ab-mediated cellular dysfunction.}

Cell surface serve as target Ags when auto-Abs bind to such receptors, they impair function without causing cell injury or inflammation.

\section*{Type II hypersensitivity Reactions.}

1- Transfusion Reactions.
- Transfusion of ABO-incompatible blood results in complement-mediated cytotoxic reactions.
- Kidney may be damaged because of the large quantities of RBCs membranes and the toxic effects of heme complex.
- Because of cross-matching transfusion reactions are now rare, nevertheless sometimes IgG can exist for minor blood group antigens at a level sufficient to cause destruction of the transfused cells but too low to detect in vitro.
- 2-Drug-induced Reactions.
- Certain antibiotics (e.g. penicillin, cephalosporin, and streptomycin) can adsorb nonspecifically to proteins on RBC membranes, forming a complex similar to a hapten-carrier complex.
- In some patients, such drug-protein complexes induce formation of antibodies, which then bind to the adsorbed drug on red blood cells, inducing complement-mediated lysis and thus progressive anemia.
- Some drugs bind to platelets, causing them to become immunogenic, Ab responses cause lysis of platelets resulting in thrombocytopenia.

3- Rh incompatibility (hemolytic disease of the new born).
- Rhesus disease (or haemolytic disease of the newborn) is a special example since the IgG antibodies which cause destruction of foetal red blood cells by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) are passively acquired by the host via the placenta.

4- Autoimmune Reactions involving cell Membrane Receptors.
- Myasthenia gravis , Grave's disease, autoAbs serve as agonists, causing stimulation of target cells, resulting in hyperthyroidism.
- "autoimmune hemolytic, Some people produce Abs reactive against their own blood cells", destroys them by mechanisms that involve hemolysis or phagocytosis via receptors for FC and C3b.

\section*{TYPE III HYPERSENSITIVITY (Immune Complex) REACTIONS.}
- Usually, immune complex reactions occur when complexes of Ag and $\lg \mathrm{M}$ or $\operatorname{lgG}$ accumulate in the circulation or in tissue and activate the complement cascade.
- Normally small amounts of complexes are removed by phagocytic cells.
- Complexes bind IgG Fc receptors on phagocytic cells.
- RBCs with C3b receptors may bind complexes which are removed in the liver by kupffer cells.
- When large amounts of complexes are deposited in tissues, they trigger a variety of systemic symptoms known as type III hypersensitivity reactions (Generalized).
- Complexes may be deposited in kidneys, skin, joints, choroids plexus and ciliary artery of the eye causing tissue damage.
- C3a, C5a generated by complement activation induce mast cell degranulation.
- MØ are stimulated to release TNF- $\propto$ and IL1, platelets form microthrombi and release platelet derived growth factor-PDGF.

\section*{Type III Hypersensitivity}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-17.jpg?height=1503&width=1860&top_left_y=336&top_left_x=512)

\section*{Phases of Systemic Immune Complex Disease.}
- Ag -Ab immune complexes form in the circulation.
- Deposition of immune complexes in various tissues.
- Occurrence of inflammatory reactions in various tissues.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-19.jpg?height=1723&width=2126&top_left_y=170&top_left_x=284)

\section*{Type-III Hypersensitivity: Immune Complex}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-20.jpg?height=920&width=2160&top_left_y=487&top_left_x=301)

Large quantities of soluble antigen-antibody complexes form in the blood and are not completely removed by macrophages. These antigen-antibody complexes lodge in the capillaries between the endothelial cells and the basement membrane. The antigenantibody complexes activate the classical complement pathway and complement proteins and antigen-antibody complexes attract leukocytes to the area. The leukocytes then discharge their killing agents and promote massive inflammation. This leads to tissue death and hemorrhage

\section*{Hypersensitivity type III}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-21.jpg?height=1552&width=2534&top_left_y=392&top_left_x=122)

\section*{Release of proteolytic enzymes}
- Deposition of immune complexes is influenced by the size e.g. small or intermediate immune complexes which circulate for longer time tend to be deposited, while larger complexes are rapidly removed by phagocytic cells.

\section*{while}
- The integrity of the mononuclear phagocytic system influence the development of systemic immune complexes.

\section*{Factors that determine the tissue damage.}
- Size of immune complexes
- Quantity of immune complexes
- Site of deposition (local or systemic)

\section*{Type III Hypersensitivity Rxns.}
- Systemic reactions
- Circulating immune complexes deposit in blood vessels, synovial membrane of joints, glomerular basement membrane of kidney, brain and cause tissue damage

\section*{Examples of systemic rxns.}
- Serum Sickness:
- The prototype of systemic immune complex disease.
- Treatment with horse serum containing Abs to some bacterial toxins.
- 2nd injection of horse serum "foreign for human body" may develop serum sickness "allergic manifestations".
- Rheumatic fever as sequale of group A streptococcal infection:
- It involves inflammation and damage to heart, joints and kidneys.
- Ags in the cell wall and membrane of streptococci cross react with human Ags found in heart muscle, cartilage, glomerular basement membrane.
- Abs to streptococcal Ags bind to these components and induce inflammatory reactions.

\section*{Other Examples}
1. Infections : persistent infections (e.g. streptococcal \& staphylococcal infections, malaria, viral hepatitis) lead to chronic Ab production
2. Auto-immune diseases:

Continuous auto-Ab production to soluble self-Ag, MØ \& Complement responsible for removal of I.C. become overloaded \& deposition takes place e.g.
SLE (anti- DNA, anti- nuclear Ab), Rheumatoid arthritis (Rheumatoid Factor).
3. Tumors: continuously shed Ag

\section*{Local Reactions.}
- Arthus reactions:
- It is the prototype of localized (type III) immune complex reactions.
- Local inflammatory response generated after reactivity of Ag with already formed Ag-specific IgG. Ag-Ab reactions near vessel walls, complexes form and accumulate ending with the rupture of the vessel wall and hemorrhage, accompanied by necrosis of local tissue.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1bb42d32a40ad442b6bag-31.jpg?height=1758&width=2018&top_left_y=145&top_left_x=264)

\section*{Examples in man}

\section*{Local reactions}

Intra-pulmonary reaction (pneumonitis, alveolitis) induced by bacterial spores, fungi
1. Farmer's lung disease due to inhalation of fungi \& bacterial spores
2. 'Pigeon fancier's lung' disease due to repeated exposure to dried pigeon droppings containing pigeon proteins

\section*{Tests for type III hypersensitivity.}
1. Immunofluorescence tests for the detection of antigens, antibodies, Complement and immune complexes in tissues.
2. Detection of antibodies to suspected antigens such as horse serum proteins, spores, pigeon dropping antigens etc.
3. Tests for immune complexes in the serum

\section*{Summary.}
- Hypersensitivity reaction is an undesirable excessive immune reaction to antigens that ends up destroying host tissue.
- Can be managed by eliminating the trigger (pathogen or stimuli)
- Type II= antibody-mediated cytotoxic reaction.
- Type III= immune complex mediated reaction.

- Encounter from time to time
- Not very agent
- Def
- Is a reaction characterized by a cell mediated immune response that tends to be occasionally exaggerated
- Examples of reactions
- Administration of mantoux - this is the admin of purified protein derivatives of the tubercle bacilli subcutaneously to evaluate previous contacts with mycoTb bovis or hominis.
- Foreign bodies on the skin
- Fungal infections
- Using mantoux tests premodule, we discuss type IV hypersensitivity
- Upon admin of 1 ml of purified protein derivative on the fore-arm subcutaneously, a cell mediated immune response will occur
- The ppd will be taken up by an Antigen presenting cell, processed in the proteosomes, combined with MHC II and together expressed on the surface of the cell.
- T-lymphocytes CD4+ responds; the biological activity in the CD4+ ( th1 class) translates into a secretion of cytokines
- The cytokines produced are IL-2 (Mobilize other lymphocytes), gamma interferon (mobilize macrophages), IL 12 ----Formation of a granuloma
- Once the macrophages bind the cytokines, they are activated by gamma interferon.
- Properties of activated macrophages:
- They elaborate their metabolic infrastructure making their phagocytic properties more aggressive and allow them to persist in tissues for longer periods of time
- They activate more antigen presenting cells and CD4+ th1 cells
- They produce IL 12 and gamma interferon
- Enhance MHC expression on the cell surfaces and that of Ag presenting cells
- Effects
- Granuloma formation- extensive phagocytosis
- Activation of immune cells (Forward feeding Immune response)

\section*{Learning Objectives}
- Understand the basics of transplantation
- Describe the mechanisms of T cell recognition of antigen
- Understand the effector pathways of graft injury
- Describe the aetiology and pathophysiology of GVHD

\section*{Introduction}
- Transfer of cells, tissues or organs (graft) from one part of the body to another, or from one individual to another
- Used to replace organs or tissues that have failed e.g. in
- ESRD
- Heart failure
- Cirrhosis
- Leukaemia
- Can use cadaveric or living donors

\section*{Genetic Barriers to Transplantation}
- The main immunological problem with transplantation is rejection
- Grafted organ or tissue is seen as 'foreign' by the immune system
- It is then recognized and attacked
- The genetic relationship between the donor \& recipient determines whether or not rejection will occur
- Autografts and isografts usually accepted
- Allografts and xenografts usually rejected
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_b759ac58ebcb239352ffg-05.jpg?height=1698&width=2289&top_left_y=27&top_left_x=463)

Immunology by David Male et al, $8^{\text {th }}$

\section*{Organ Donation}
- Shortage of donors is a limiting factor for organ transplantation
- One cadaveric donor can provide many organs for transplantation
- Potential solutions to increase the number of donors include :
- Advertising and donor recruitment campaigns
- Role of legislation*
- 'Presumed consent' - policy whereby everyone is assumed to have given consent for their organs to be used, unless they indicate otherwise
- 'Opt in' approach - individuals/relatives have to give permission for organs to be used

\section*{Organ Donation}
- Increasing facilities for organ harvesting, including transplant coordinators, surgical teams
- Relaxing donor selection criteria - allow use of organs that would not have been used previously
- E.g. use of non heart beating donors
- Marginal donors (older donors, those with diseases that would have previously excluded them)
- Use of living donors or animal donors

\section*{Ethical Issues in Living Donation}
- Used in situations where the donation of an organ poses little risk to the living donor
- E.g. kidney transplantation - it is possible to live with just one healthy kidney
- It is also possible to donate a lobe of a liver, as it can regrow
- Donation of a lung lobe is also possible, but much riskier
- Haematopoietic stem cell transplants also involve living donors

\section*{Ethical Issues in Living Donation}
- Potential donor should be healthy
-Donation should be compatible (appropriate blood group)
- Donor should be aware of the risks \& should not be coerced into giving an organ
- Majority of donations carried out between close relatives and friends
- Some cases - altruistic donors
- In most countries it is illegal to sell organs for transplantation
- Organ exchange programs to maximize the number of transplants formed - paired donations

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Immune response in which the recipient immune system responds to \& attacks the donor tissue due to immune recognition of antigenic differences between the donor organ \& the recipient
- MHC molecules are the major target for rejection
- Ability to accept a graft is dependent on the recipients sharing all the donor's histocompatibility genes
- Animal that differ at loci other than MHC reject graft from each other, but more slowly

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Adaptive immune response - shows memory
- Once an animal has rejected an organ graft the first time, if a second graft is performed from the same species or donor, it is rejected more rapidly (second set rejection)

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- In a primary alloresponse, most of the alloreactive CD4 or CD8 T cells directly recognise the donor MHC molecules displayed by donor APCs in the graft (direct response/presentation/pathway)
- However, there are other forms of alloresponse:
- Against minor MHC antigens

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Indirect response - recipient CD4 T cells recognise donor MHC molecules that have been processed by recipient APCs, presented in context of recipients MHC II molecules
- (similar to conventional T cell recognition of antigens e.g. pathogens). CD8 cells only see alloantigen by the direct pathway
- The indirect pathway of recognition occurs in lower frequency but is important during chronic rejection (very few donor-derived professional APCs to stimulate a direct immune response)

\section*{Graft Rejection}
- Minor histocompatibility antigens can be the targets of rejection even when the MHC is identical between donor and recipient
- Their nature assumed to be normal polymorphic molecules, peptides from which bind to host MHC and induce an immune response
- Can be tissue-specific
- E.g. H-Y system - antigens encoded by the Y chromosome; expressed only on male cells

\section*{Immune Effector Mechanisms in Graft Rejection}
- Rejection can occur at various times, each associated with different immune effector mechanisms
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline type of rejection & tlme taken & mechanisms of rejection \\
\hline hyperacute rejection & minutes to hours & preformed anti-donor antibodies \\
\hline acute rejection & days to weeks & activation of alloreactive T cells \\
\hline chronlc rejection & months to years & slow cellular response, response of organ to injury, unknown causes \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Immunology by David Male et al, $8^{\text {th }}$

\section*{Hyperacute Rejection}
- Immediate
- Mediated by pre-existing antibody
- Individual sensitized to donor MHC e.g. previous transplants, multiple blood transfusions or pregnancy
- Natural pre-existing antibodies e.g. ABO blood group incompatibility
- Rejection seen within minutes of connecting the circulation into the transplanted organ

\section*{Hyperacute Rejection}
- Pre-existing antibodies bind to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels and initiate immune effector functions
- Complement activation by the classical pathway
- Complement activation leads to death of the endothelium, or, when damage is sub-lethal, activation of the endothelial cells
- Causes an inflammatory response increasing vascular leakage and coagulation
- Results in rapid destruction of the graft
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_b759ac58ebcb239352ffg-21.jpg?height=1588&width=2784&top_left_y=65&top_left_x=258)

\section*{Hyperacute Rejection}
- Prevention:
- ABO matching
- Cross-matching donor and recipient
- Donor leucocytes incubated with recipient serum in the presence of serum complement
- Cell death indicates presence of anti-donor antibody. Is a contraindication to proceeding with transplantation
- Performed immediately before the surgery

\section*{Acute Rejection}
- Seen in days to weeks after transplantation
- Caused by activation of allospecific T cells capable of damaging the graft
- Following transplantation, donor dendritic cells present in the organ (passenger leucocytes) migrate to the lymph nodes draining the organ and stimulate a primary alloimmune response

\section*{Acute Rejection}
- Activated T cells migrate to the organ and cause tissue damage by
- Generation of $T_{C}$ cells
- Induction of DTH reactions
- If the patient has already been exposed to the alloantigens expressed by the graft, there will be alloreactive memory cells, leading to accelerated rejection of the graft

\section*{Chronic Rejection}
- Seen months to years after transplantation
- In vascularized organs, presents as occlusion of blood vessels - narrowed lumen due to thickening of the intima by smooth muscle proliferation and mononuclear cell infiltrate
- Eventually leads to blockage of the blood vessels and subsequent ischaemia of the organ
- The parenchyma is slowly replaced by nonfunctioning fibrous tissue

\section*{Mechanisms of Chronic Rejection}
- Low-grade T cell response (indirect allospecific pathway due to loss of passenger leucocytes that activate T cells with direct pathway specificity)
- Antibody (indicated by deposition of complement component C4d - in tissues)
- Non immunological processes:
- Response of the graft to injury caused at the time of transplantation or by acute rejection episodes
- Recurrence of the original underlying disease
- Drug-related toxicities
- Chronic rejection responds poorly to current immunosuppressive therapy

\section*{Graft versus Host Disease}
- Occurs when competent immune cells (donor T cells) are transplanted into a recipient e.g. in BMT when normal donor T cells may be infused into the recipient
- The T cells can recognise the MHC molecules \&/or minor histocompatibility antigens of the recipient as foreign, and produce an immune response against the recipient
- Occurs when the recipient is immunocompromised
- BMT
- Neonatal blood transfusion

\section*{GvHD}
- Can be lethal
- Acute GvHD - epithelial cell death in the skin, liver and GIT
- Rash, jaundice, diarrhoea, GI haemorrhage
- Chronic GvHD - fibrosis and atrophy of one or more organs without evidence of acute cell death
- Complete dysfunction of affected organ

\section*{GvHD - Prevention and Treatment}
- Elimination of mature T cells from the graft and APCs from the host
- BMT
- Treat bone marrow to deplete T cells
- Use autologous bone marrow
- Use umbilical cord blood
- GvHD is treated by immunosuppression

\section*{HLA Matching}
- The major antigenic differences recognized by the alloimmune response are found on MHC molecules (HLA)
- Matching the donor \& recipient to minimize antigenic differences (so that they share as many alleles as possible)
- The better the HLA matching of donor \& recipient, the less the strength of rejection
- Performed using PCR

\section*{HLA Matching}
- Matching is rarely perfect between unrelated donors because of the difficulty in matching all MHC I \& II gene loci \& the high level of polymorphism at each locus
- Potentially 12 different loci of maternal \& paternal HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) \& class II loci (HLA-DR, -DP, DQ)
- Hundreds of variants of each antigen

\section*{HLA Matching}
- Very important in BMT
- Also has a significant influence on the outcome of kidney transplantation
- No benefit in corneal transplantation
- For those organs where transplantation is essential to maintain life (heart \& liver), there is no possibility of waiting for a well-matched organ to become available

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Control the alloimmune response
- Rejection episodes still occur but are kept in check, to minimize lasting damage
- Cause blanket suppression of the immune system
- Recipients more prone to opportunistic infections \& have a higher incidence of malignancies
- Strategies to promote specific immunological tolerance a subject of interest
- Present challenge is to use the currently available agents well to minimize side effects while preserving graft function

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Antiproliferative drugs
- Inhibit synthesis of purines required for cell division
- 6-MP
- Azathioprine - purine antagonist that competes with inosine monophosphate
- Mycophenolic acid - inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase which is essential in the de-novo synthesis of purines

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Inhibitors of T cell activation
- Ciclosporin - binds to cyclophilin, inhibiting calcineurin (a calcium-dependent phosphatase) which would otherwise activate the NFAT complex \& lead to IL-2 gene transcription; thereby inhibiting IL-2 production
- Tacrolimus - binds to FK-binding protein 12, an intracellular protein; the resulting complex inhibits calcineurin
- Sirolimus/Rapamycin - inhibits signals transmitted by IL-2 binding to IL-2R (sirolimus)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_b759ac58ebcb239352ffg-36.jpg?height=1651&width=2727&top_left_y=127&top_left_x=316)

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Anti-inflammatories
- Corticosteroids
- Inhibit proinflammatory cytokine secretion - IL-1, -3, 4, -5, -8, TNF $\alpha$
- Inhibit nitric oxide synthase
- Inhibit expression of adhesion molecules, leading to reduced inflammatory cell migration
- Induction of endonucleases leading to apoptosis in lymphocytes \& eosinophils

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Antibody therapy
- Anti-lymphocyte globulin/anti-thymocyte globulin
- Polyclonal antibodies raised by immunizing rabbits or horses with lymphocytes or thymocytes
- Deplete circulating $T$ cells

\section*{Immunosuppressive Drugs}
- Antibody therapy
- Monoclonal antibodies
- Muromonab-CD3 - binds to CD3 on T cells, suppressing T cell responses
- Daclizumab \& Basiliximab - anti-IL-2 receptors
- Alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1 H) - depletes CD52 expressing leucocytes
- Rituximab - anti-CD20; depletes B cells
- Abatacept \& Belatacept - fusion proteins of CTLA4 with Fc portion of antibody

\section*{Induction of Donor-Specific}
- Immune system specifically becomes nonresponsive to the donor antigens, but is capable of responding normally to other antigens
- Demonstrated in animal models but difficult to translate into the clinical setting
- Alloreactive T cells can be anergized by blockade of co-stimulatory signals such as CD80 \& CD86 with CTLA-4-Ig, as a way of inducing tolerance
- Alternative is to induce a regulatory response to the alloantigen

Co-stimulation blockade

\section*{TRANSPLANTATION IMMUNOLOGY.}

Learning Objectives.
- Describe the genetic variation in transplantation
- Understand the immunological barriers that must be considered in transplantation.
- Understand the basis of rejection of transplants
- Describe donor tissues and privileged organs in transplantation.

\section*{Introduction.}
- Transplantation is the introduction of biological material organs, tissue, cells, fluids - into an organism.
- We can distinguish 3 critical relationships between the transplanted material and the recipient.
- syngeneic transplants - from genetically identical individuals, usually the same individual (these are similar to grafts between identical twins or isogenic strains of experimental animals). Referred to as autologous in the ABO blood groups, skin grafts.
- allogeneic transplants - from one individual to another of the same species
- xenogeneic transplants - between individuals of different species.
- Unsurprisingly syngeneic transplants (same individuals) do not usually generate any immunological problems, but allogeneic and xenogeneic transplants are almost always destroyed by immunological processes unless some action is taken to impair the immunological process.
- Basically therefore transplantation presents 2 key problems.
- Genetic variation between donor and recipient.
-Immunological recognition of the variation.

\section*{1. Genetic variation between donor and recipient.}
- Genetic variation between individuals that results in protein sequence differences is at the heart of the transplant problem.
- In an essentially out-bred species like Homo sapiens the extent of this allelic polymorphism is considerable.
- Obviously the variation is even greater between individuals from different species.

\section*{2. Immunological recognition of the variation.}
- Genetic differences between donor and recipient are only of significance in transplantation if they cause incompatibility.
- Almost ubiquitous in allogeneic transplants is immunological rejection.
- Early experimental work on allotransplantation in mice identified a very clear distinction between one chromosomal region and the remainder of the genome.
- Non-identity at this special region always led to very rapid rejection of the transplanted tissue, even if this was the only genetic difference between the donor and recipient.
- This region was therefore termed the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC).
- MHC, which exists in all vertebrates is highly polymorphic, so that in out-bred populations 2 individuals will almost certainly differ at this region unless they are monozygotic.
- However the parallel is NOT true, that is, even if identical at the MHC, transplants between individuals are likely to be rejected due to minor histocompatibility loci.
- The key distinction is that individually these minor H loci are less 'strong' and in particular the strength varies between allelic differences.

\section*{Recognition and rejection mechanisms.}
- There are 3 basic types of 'recognition' which allows the host to know that the transplanted tissue is foreign.
- recognition by Antibody
- recognition of foreign MHC by T cells (direct recognition)
- recognition of minor H loci by T cells (Indirect recognition).
- As implied above these 3 recognitions may lead to very different time scales of destruction of the transplanted cells/tissue and trigger distinct effector mechanisms. We distinguish 3 types of rejection.

\section*{Types of rejection.}
- Hyper-acute rejection
- Acute rejection
- Chronic rejection

\section*{1. Hyperacute rejection.}
- Occurs very rapidly, resulting in necrosis of the transplanted tissue within minutes or a few hours of contact.
- It always results from the reactivity of the donor cells with pre-existing antibody.
- The most common situation in which this occurs is in ABO blood group incompatible transplants, therefore let us briefly review the ABO system.

\section*{Blood Groups.}
- Blood groups arise from genetic variations within a species. Blood transfusion is the oldest form of transplantation and today we should be careful to distinguish what component of blood we are transplanting; what we call blood groups are genetically variable (polymorphic) structures present on red blood cells.
- It is important to note that some of these structures are only present on red blood cells and thus incompatibility at these loci only affects the transplantation of RBC (blood transfusion), whereas others are present on many tissue cells and therefore affect other types of transplantation.

\section*{Non-ABO antibodies can also cause hyperacute rejection.}
- These could be from previous transplants (transfusions)
- Particular problems in xenotransplants
- humans lack Gal alpha 13 Gal structures and make natural antibody to this (both IgG and IgM).
- many species express this structure in abundance on their cell surfaces (e.g Pigs).
- Transplants from one species to another where there is natural antibody are termed discordant.

\section*{2. Acute Graft Rejection}
- This is the main immunological barrier to allotransplantation (same species, BUT different individuals).
- It is caused by T cell recognition of the transplanted tissue.
- It is not a significant problem in red cell transfusion
a. because the cells survive only short periods
b. human rbc do not express MHC antigens.
- There are 2 quite distinct modes of recognition

\section*{A. Direct recognition of allo MHC.}

As referred to earlier, experimental transplantation showed that a single major gene cluster, the MHC, had a dominant role in histocompatibility.
In the context of transplantation the key attributes of the MHC are
- rapid rejection of MHC non-identical transplants
- reproducible, consistent rejection rates.

\section*{modes of recognition: Direct recognition of allo MHC}

\section*{Direct recognition of donor MHC molecules}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_da3ebffda3af19a7d312g-18.jpg?height=909&width=1885&top_left_y=766&top_left_x=566)
- Why do the products of the MHC cause such reproducible and rapid graft rejection?
The basic answer to this question is that naive individuals have high-frequency of T cells reactive with alloMHC products. More complex is to explain why this high frequency exists.
- It is undoubtedly the result of T cell receptors being MHC binding.

\section*{B. Indirect recognition of minor transplantation antigens.}

Indirect recognition of minor H antigens
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_da3ebffda3af19a7d312g-20.jpg?height=1058&width=1648&top_left_y=647&top_left_x=478)

MHC identical grafts are still rejected acutely by T cell dependent mechanisms.
- Minor transplantation antigens are proteins which vary in sequence and where one (at least) of the allomorphs is found in a peptide which binds to the MHC of the recipient.
- In the case of indirect recognition, MHC sharing between donor and recipient increases the reactivity as donor dendritic cells can prime recipient T cells for minor H peptides bound to shared MHC
- activated T cells can be triggered by donor tissue cells (usually class I expressing)

\section*{Properties of minor antigens}
- rejection is slower than for MHC
- it is additive, however; thus many minor differences combine to give rapid rejection
- rejection times (in experimental grafts) are more variable and strength is allele specific.

\section*{3. Chronic rejection.}
- In stark contrast to the considerable progress in the management of acute rejection (see Immunosuppression, below) essentially no improvement in treatment in past 25 years has made a significant impact on the longterm loss of transplanted organs through chronic rejection.
- Possibly in part this is because the mechanism(s) of chronic rejection are still obscure.

\section*{Particular transplant situations.}
1. Privileged sites.
- Transplants at certain anatomical sites are generally accepted without any immune rejection. The most important of these is the cornea.
- The absence of lymphatic drainage is probably the critical common factor.
- (some sites also lack vascularisation).

\section*{2. Vascularised solid organs.}
- kidney
-lung
- liver
- heart
-pancreas
3. Haemopoietic stem cell transplants
- Often previously called bone marrow transplants, now renamed as source is frequently blood.
- 3 sources of stem cells are used, listed in order of decreasing mature T cell contamination
- peripheral blood (enriched by cytokine administration)
- bone marrow
- cord blood

\section*{GRAFT vs. HOST DISEASE.}

\section*{Learning Objectives:}
- Be able to define the GVHD.
- Be able to classify the organs most affected.
- Be able to describe manifestations of GVHD in the affected organs.
- Describe the mechanism of GVHD leading to tissue damage.

\section*{Introduction to Graft vs. Host Disease.}
- Graft vs. Host disease is a syndrome that occurs when immune cells from a donor attack the host's normal cells.
- GVHD is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality associated with an allogenic stem cell transplant.
- GVHD occurs in 30 to $50 \%$ of HLA-matched sibling transplants and 60 to $90 \%$ of mismatched.

\section*{Introduction to Graft vs. Host Disease.}
- Unfortunately at this time, we can not separate GVHD from the beneficial graft vs. leukemia effect.
- GVHD is divided into acute and chronic depending on whether the initial symptoms developed before 100 days following Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)
- The organ systems primarily affected by acute GVHD are the skin, liver, and GI tract.

\section*{Manifestations of Graft vs. Host Disease.}
- The liver manifestations are primarily increases in the bilirubin but can also involve transaminitis
- The GI manifestations are diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
- The severity of acute GVHD is staged on a I to IV system.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Stage of Graft-Hersus-Host-Disease by Organ System} \\
\hline Organ & Grade & Description \\
\hline \multirow[t]{4}{*}{Skin} & +1 & Maculopapular rash over 25 percent of body area \\
\hline & +2 & Maculopapular rash over 25 to 50 percent of body area \\
\hline & +3 & Generalized erythroderma \\
\hline & +4 & Generalized erythroderma with bullous formation and often with desquamation \\
\hline \multirow[t]{4}{*}{Liver} & +1 & Bilirubin 2.0 to $3.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$; SGOT 150 to 750 ll \\
\hline & +2 & Bilirubin 3.1 to $6.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ \\
\hline & +3 & Bilirubin 6.1 to $15.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ \\
\hline & +4 & Bilirubin $15.0 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ \\
\hline \multirow[t]{4}{*}{Gut} & +1 & Diarrhea $\times 30 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ or $\times 500 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day \\
\hline & +2 & Disrrhea $360 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ or $1000 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day \\
\hline & +3 & Diarrhea $990 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ or $1500 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day \\
\hline & +4 & Diarrhes $990 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ or $92000 \mathrm{~mL} /$ dsy; or severe abdominal pain with or without ileus \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Proposed mechanism for acute GVHD.}
- There appear to be 3 phases to the development of acute GVHD.
- Damage to host tissues.
- Activation and proliferation of donor lymphocytes.
- Attack on the host cells.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_2bf39b8f0cf607742d85g-09.jpg?height=1702&width=2421&top_left_y=198&top_left_x=175)

\section*{I. Damage to the Host.}
- The damage primarily comes from the conditioning regimen.
- The damage to the host leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1.
- In the gut, microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide can enter the circulation.

\section*{II. Donor T-cell activation.}
- The inflammatory cytokines stimulate antigen presenting cells (APC); followed by activation and proliferation of the donor lymphocytes.
- The APC present host antigens not recognized by the donor lymphocytes.
- The lymphocytes then multiply and differentiate under the influence of IL-2.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_2bf39b8f0cf607742d85g-12.jpg?height=1709&width=2333&top_left_y=135&top_left_x=198)

ACTIVATION AND PROLIFERATION OF DONOR LYMPHOCYTES

\section*{III. Attack of Target Tissues.}
- GVHD is primarily mediated by cytoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) but helper T lymphocytes (CD4+) and NK cells are also involved.
- The host cells are destroyed by either direct cytotoxic activity or inflammatory cytokines.

\section*{Decreasing the damage to the host.}
- This can be divided into giving less rigorous conditioning regimens or blocking the cytokines or other products that lead to the activation of APC's.
- Antibiotics have been shown to decrease the frequency of acute GVHD.

\section*{Decreasing the damage to the host.}
- TNF-alpha inhibitors have been tried to decrease GVHD
- Other investigations have shown delay in the development of acute GVHD but not reduction rate with the use of prophylactic TNF-alpha inhibitors.

\section*{Stopping activation and proliferation of donor lymphocytes.}
- Cyclosporine
- Methotrexate
- Tacrolimus
- Sirolimus
- Mycophenolate mofetil
- Steroids
- Alemtuzamab (Campath)
- Anti-IL2 antibodies

\section*{Methotrexate.}
- Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite
- As a single agent significant GVHD develops in 70\%
- It has found a significant role in prevention when used in combination with other immune suppressant medications.

\section*{Cyclosporine.}
- Cyclosporine is a calcineurine inhibitor
- Inhibition of calcineurine prevents the transcription of TNF-alpha and many cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4) which decreases the proliferation of lymphocytes.
- Notwithstanding, a 40\% development rate for acute GVHD (Grade II-IV) in HLA-matched transplants has been reported.

\section*{Summary.}
- Graft vs. Host disease is a syndrome that occurs when immune cells from a donor attack the host's normal cells.
- GVHD is divided into acute and chronic depending on whether the initial symptoms developed before 100 days following Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT).
- 3 phases to the development of acute GVHD: Damage to host tissues; activation and proliferation of donor lymphocytes; attack on the host cells.

\section*{Definitions}
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Fab }= & \text { Fragment, antigen binding } \\
& \text { Fc }=\text { Fragment, crystalline }
\end{aligned}$$

The Fc fragment specifies other biological • activities of the molecule. For example, the

Fc fragment may determine whether the antibody simply prevents signaling through a receptor, or alternatively, causes the cell's destruction through complement .fixation or targeting immune effector cells

\section*{Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb)}

\section*{Monoclonal antibodies are:}
monospecific antibodies that are identical because they are produced by one type of immune cell (a single parent cell).
* Antibodies produced from a single clone of B cells.
* Produced by fusing a B cell secreting the desired antibody with a myeloma cell capable of growing indefinitely in tissue culture.

Monoclonal antibodies all have identical antigen-binding sites. i.e. they all bind to the same epitope with the same affinity.
* They are all of the same antibody class (isotype).

\section*{Polyclonal antibodies}
- are a mixture of antibodies with different antigen binding sites that may bind to different epitopes or antigens with varying affinities.
- They may be of different antibody classes.
- The serum obtained from an immunized animal is referred to as a polyclonal antiserum.

\section*{Hybridoma}
are cells that have been engineered to produce a desired antibody in large amounts.
\$ To produce monoclonal antibodies, B-cells are removed from the spleen of an animal that has been challenged with the relevant antigen
\$ These B-cells are then fused with myeloma tumor cells that can grow indefinitely in culture
\$ This fusion is performed by making the cell membranes more permeable.
* The fused hybrid cells (hybridomas), being cancer cells, will multiply rapidly and indefinitely and will produce large amounts of the desired antibodies

\section*{Practical steps in monoclonal antibody production:}
1) Immunize animal
2) Isolate spleen cells (containing antibody-producing B cells)
3) Fuse spleen cells with myeloma cells (e.g. using PEG - polyethylene glycol)
4) Allow unfused B cells to die
5) Add aminopterin to culture to kill unfused myeloma cells
6) Clone remaining cells (place 1 cell/well and allow each cell to grow into a clone of cells)
7) Screen supernatant of each clone for presence of the desired antibody.
8) Grow the chosen clone of cells in tissue culture indefinitely.
9) Harvest antibody from the culture supernatant.

\section*{Monoclonal Antibody Production}

\section*{Hybridoma Selection "The "HAT Trick}

Myeloma cells lack certain enzymes so that they can not use hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine(HAT medium) as a source for nucleic acid biosynthesis and will die in culture.
$\square$ Only B cells that have fused with the engineered myeloma cells will survive in culture when grown in HAT medium.

\section*{Purification of monoclonal Antibodies}

Cotaminants:
\$ Media components: hormones, growth factors, transferrins......etc
* Viral, bacterial,endotoxins...etc

Methods of purification:
1. Filteration for larger particles
2. Ultrafilteration esp. for low concentration samples
3. Chromatography:
- Ion exchange chromatography (either cation or anion) can be used (Most impurities are usually anions)
- Size exclusion chromatography

\section*{Recombinant monoclonal antibodies}
- The term recombinant and especially recombinant DNA refers to an artificial method of producing DNA (synthetic DNA and proteins).
- Recombinant DNA is produced through the addition of relevant DNA into an existing organismal genome, such as the plasmid of bacteria
- Recombinant antibody engineering involves the use of viruses or yeast to create antibodies, rather than mice.
- A segment of DNA is recombined (recombinant) with the original DNA of the bacteria, these genetically modified bacteria rapidly reproduce and by that reproduce the DNA segment that was recombined with the original genome.

\section*{Uses of monoclonal Abs}

Measuring protein and drug levels in serum
Typing tissue and blood
Identifying infectious agents
Identifying clusters of differentiation (CDs) for classification and follow-up therapy of leukemias and lymphomas
Identifying tumor metastasis
Identifying and quantifying hormones
Immunoaffinity Purification

\section*{Applications of Monoclonal Antibodies}

Infectious Diseases
Inflammatory disease
- Clinical Applications

Purification of drugs, Imaging the target
- Future Applications

Fight against Bioterrorism

\section*{Diagnostic Applications (Immuno-ctochemistry)}
1. Tissues and tumors can be classified based on their expression of certain defined markers: e.g. Prostate specific antigen(PSA)
2. Classification of tissues and tumors
3. Distinguishing morphologically similar lesions, like mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma
4. Detecting small quantities of metastatic cancer and MDR

\section*{Therapeutic Applications}

One possible treatment for cancer involves monoclonal antibodies that bind only to cancer cell-specific antigens and induce an immunological response against cancer cells.
Three mechanisms responsible for the cancer treatment:
1.mAbs act directely when binding to a cancer specific antigens and induce immunological response to cancer cells(apoptosis, inhibiting growth)
2.mAbs can be modified for delivery of a toxin, radioisotope, cytokine or other active conjugates.
3.it is also possible to design bispecific antibodies that can bind with their Fab regions both to target antigen and to an effector cell

\section*{Naked' Monoclonal' Antibodies}

Naked' means these antibodies are not‘ • .fused to a toxin
Naked Monoclonal antibodies can kill cells • via a variety of mechanisms, including:
Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), Complement-Dependent
Cytotoxicity (CDC), and direct induction of .apoptosis
However, the precise clinical mechanisms often remain uncertain

\title{
Nomenclature of Therapeutic Antibodies
}

\section*{Terminate the name in -ximab for chimeric antibodies and -umab for .humanized antibodies}

\section*{Rituximab (Rituxan)}

Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that .targets the CD20 B-cell antigen
This antigen is expressed on $90 \%$ of B-cell neoplasms The precise biological functions of CD20 are uncertain, but the antibody is believed to function by flagging the B-cells for destruction by the body's own immune .system, including ADCC, CDC, and apoptosis
This antibody thus leads to the elimination of all Bcells from the body (including cancerous ones), allowing new, healthy B-cells to be produced from .lymphoid stem cells
