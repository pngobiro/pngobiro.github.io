Vaccination 1

\section*{Objectives}
- define vaccines and their importance
- discuss current vaccines, their mechanism(s) of protection, and the proof
- review of B cell biology
- discuss issues of timing and location of protection, herd immunity, vaccine delivery, and vaccines for babies and elderly

\section*{A vaccine..}
- "....is a preparation of microbial antigen, often in combination with adjuvants, that is administered to individuals to induce protective immunity against infection"
- Passive vs. Active vaccination
- passive: antibodies are given directly
- active: immune response is induced by the host

\section*{An adjuvant..}
- "...is a non-antigenic substance that enhances T cell activation by promoting the accumulation of antigen presenting cells at the site of antigen exposure..."
- increases expression of co-stimulatory molecules, cytokines, and HLA-peptide complexes on APCs
- whole vaccines contain "natural" adjuvants

\section*{Goal of vaccination}
- ...is to mimick infection and induce protective immunity by introducing pathogen components without causing disease
- induces memory, which leads to better and faster responses after exposure to pathogen
- Vaccine design can be either empirical or rationale
- Rationale: based on an understanding of protective immunity
- Empirical: trial and error

\section*{Current vaccines}
- most current vaccines:
- have been designed empirically
- are against extracellular pathogens and viruses that cause acute infection
- lead to "sterlizing" immunity
- elicit neutralising antibody responses
- BCG is the only exception => Th1 responses
- best correlate of protection in most -> certain attributes of the ab response
- less is known about the contribution of T cell responses

\section*{Important points}
- antigen-presenting cells capture the vaccine antigen(s)
- whole vaccines and/or adjuvants
- analogous to natural infection
- induction of both T and B cell responses
- naÃ¯ve B cells are optimally induced in germinal centers of lymph nodes by follicular dendritic and CD4+ helper T cells
- undergo clonal expansion
- differentiate into plasma cells and memory B cells
- isotype switch -> IgG
- produce higher affinity antibodies

\section*{Affinity maturation $=>$ boosting}
- affinity: strength of antibody-antigen binding
- antibody genes can undergo random genetic rearrangements leading to selection of the antibodies that can bind with higher affinity to antigen and provide better immunity
- first vaccine dose tends to generate weaker antibodies, while boosting or antigen persistence increases the strength of antibody binding

\section*{Important points (2)}
- memory B cells survive for many years through polyclonal activation
- regenerate plasma cells
- duration of protection is linked to B cell memory
- need an appropriate time between first dose and boost
- allows affinity maturation
- can potentially be sped up by adjuvants
- dose of antigen is critical
- higher dose gives better short term responses,
- lower dose better long term memory

\section*{Proof that antibodies protect}
- difficult to prove what is protective
- evidence from human and animal studies
- passive transfer of measles antibodies was found to be protective (1945)
- similar findings for other pathogens
- often the titer and/or affinity of antibodies predicts protection
- Titer: concentration of antibodies in serum
- H. influenza $\mathrm{B}=>0.15 \mathrm{ug} / \mathrm{ml}$ of high affinity ab protects

\section*{Proof that antibodies protect (2)}

Outcome after vaccination and challenge

Yellow Fever Vaccine
Measles Vaccine

\section*{Evidence for protective T cells}
- BCG
- very little antibody response, mostly CD4+ T cell dependent
- Pertussis
- vaccine can still protect after ab levels decline
- Measles
- disease severity is reducted in absence of abs
- Influenza
- T cells are important for cross-reactive protection
- recognition of less variable viral regions

\section*{Herd immunity}
- proportion of the population that needs to be immunized to break transmission chains and provide protection to unvaccinated individuals

\section*{Vaccine delivery}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_3120951a626b01f91f5cg-17.jpg?height=1250&width=941&top_left_y=620&top_left_x=252)

The Gene Gun
- most are injected intramuscularly
- can be mucosal (oral, nasal)
- some new ideas

OPV vaccine

\section*{Timing and location of protection}
- responses need to be made rapidly and where the infection challenge occurs
- mucosal pathogens ideally need mucosal responses
- ie, influenza, respiratory pathogens
- tetanus
- need pre-existing antibodies as toxins enter cells rapidly
- hepatitis B
- antibody response needs to occur before virus becomes established in the liver -> goes intracellular

\section*{Babies}
- most susceptible to many diseases, but have an immature immune system
- especially in the first year of life
- vaccine responses increase in a step-wise manner with age
- make poor IgG responses, don't form germinal centers, etc.
- poor duration of immunity
- but still enough so that boosting works
- maternal antibodies can inhibit or assist vaccine responses in babies
- competition with baby's B cells, neutralize the vaccine
- can still get T cell responses, sometimes better

\section*{The elderly}
- ageing is associated with waning antibodies and a reduced T cell repetoire
- can affect vaccine responses for some vaccines
- may need to alter vaccine regimens for the elderly
- more or higher doses

\section*{Types of vaccines}
- attenuated/inactivated
- BCG, cholera, polio, rabies
- purified antigen
- tetanus, diptheria
- synthetic antigen
- hepatitis B
- conjugate vaccines
"subunit" vaccines
- H. influenza B, S. pneumo
- viral vector*
- DNA vaccine*

\section*{Attenuated vs Inactivated}
- render the organism unable to cause disease while retaining immunogenecity
- repeated passage in cell culture, deletion mutants, etc.
- has all components of the original pathogen
- can get both CMI and antibody reponses, plus innate
- Louis Pasteur $=>$ attenuation in bacteria
- attenuated viral vaccines most effective
- often induce life-long immunity
- can be associated with disease, esp. if host is immunocompromised

\section*{Attenuated vs Inactivated (2)}
- polio
- oral (live) vs injected (inactive) elicit similar ab responses
- the oral vaccine is mucosal (same as route of infection), decreases intestinal secretion and therefore transmission
- inactive vaccine is safer (oral can cause paralysis)
- measles
- live is very effective but causes fever in $20-40 \%$
- inactive protection not as good, shorter, poorer T cell responses
- influenza
- traditional vaccine is inactivated
- new attenuated mucosal vaccine: single dose $=$ protection, good T cell responses, broader recognition, IgA production

\section*{Safety vs Efficacy}
"Very properly, the greatest emphasis is always placed on administering the vaccine in such a way that no unpleasant reaction ensues, but because vaccination must be safe for all, it is probably ineffective for many..."
- Rene Dubos, The White Plague: Tuberculosis, Man, and Society (1952)

\section*{Sub-unit vaccines}
- use only a portion of the pathogen, usually the part that has been shown to elicit protective responses
- adjuvants are critical for these vaccines
- can be safer -> less of an inflammatory response
- successful examples include purified and synthetic proteins, virus-like particles (HPV)
- under development include viral vectors and DNA (next week)

\section*{Conjugate vaccines}
- antibody responses to polysacchrides are T-independent
- typically lower avidity/ shorter duration
- poor memory
- can increase vaccine efficacy by linking polyS to protein carriers
- this leads to T and B cell responses and better memory/affinity
- high affinity, complement binding abs are the key correlate of protection

\section*{Note that:}
- most successful vaccines:
- elicit neutralising antibody responses and B cell memory
- antibody quality/quantity critical for protection
- T cells often induced simultaneously, imp. for long term memory
- are for acute, extracellular infections
- have been made empirically
- are for childhood infections
- For many pathogens => vaccines are under development
