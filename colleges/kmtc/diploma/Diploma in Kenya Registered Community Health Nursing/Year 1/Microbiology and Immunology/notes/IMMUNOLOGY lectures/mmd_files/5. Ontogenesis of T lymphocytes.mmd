\section*{Early Thymocyte Development}
- Lymphoid precursors migrate into thymus from bone marrow
- Directed to thymus via chemokine receptors
- T-cell precursors first travel to outer cortex, proliferate, pass through thymic medulla, then exit at cortico-medullary junction
- In thymus, they proliferate, differentiate \& undergo selection processes that result in development of mature $T$ cells
- Thymic microenvironment provides membrane-bound \& soluble signals that regulate T-cell maturation
- Stages of maturation defined by changes in their cell surface phenotype
- Double-negative (DN) cells lack detectable CD4 \&CD8
- 4 subsets, based on presence or absence of other cell surface molecules

c-kit - receptor for stem cell growth factor
CD44 - adhesion molecule
CD25 - a-chain of IL-2 receptor

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development}
- 2 broad categories of T-cells
- Those that express TCR $\alpha$ \& $\beta$ receptor chains - TCRa $\beta$ cells
- Dominant cells in adaptive immune response in secondary lymphoid organs
- Those that express TCR ү \& $\delta$ receptor chains - TCRyठ cells
- Important role in protecting mucosal tissues from outside infection
- Choice to become a $\gamma \delta$ or $\alpha \beta$ cell is dictated by when and how fast the genes that code for each of the receptor chains successfully rearrange

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development - $\beta$-Selection}
- Expression of pre-Ta chain - surrogate for the real TCRa chain that has not yet rearranged
- Pre-Ta chain complexes with the rearranged \& translated $\beta$ chain \& CD3 complex proteins to form the pre-TCR

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development - $\beta$-Selection}
- The pre-TCR initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to:
- Maturation to the DN4 stage
- Rapid proliferation in subcapsular cortex
- Suppression of further rearrangement of TCR $\beta$-chain genes, resulting in allelic exclusion of the $\beta$-chain locus
- Development to the CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP) stage
- Cessation of proliferation
- Initiation of TCRa-chain rearrangement

\section*{Early Thymocyte Development - $\beta$-Selection}
- Clones of cells with the same TCR $\beta$-chain rearrangement can rearrange a different $\alpha$-chain gene
- Resulting in a diverse population of cells (TCR diversity)
- Most T-cells fully rearrange \& express a TCR $\beta$-chain from only one of their two TCR alleles (allelic exclusion) - inhibition of further rearrangement of the other TCR $\beta$ allele
- Once a young DP thymocytes successfully rearranges \& expresses a TCRa-chain, this will associate with the already produced TCR $\beta$-chain, taking the place of the surrogate $\alpha$-chain

\section*{Positive and Negative Selection}
- DP thymocytes expressing a fully mature surface TCRaß/CD3 complex undergo thymic selection
- Based on affinity of TCR for the MHC/peptides they encounter in the thymic cortex
- Positive selection - selects for thymocytes whose receptors can bind self-MHC from thymic epithelial cells, resulting in MHC restriction
- Negative selection - selects against thymocytes bearing highaffinity receptors for self-MHC/peptide complexes; results in self-tolerance

\section*{Positive and Negative Selection}
- T-cells that do not meet the selection criteria (~98\%) die by apoptosis
- Thymocytes that do not bind MHC undergo death by neglect
- Autoreactive thymocytes with high-affinity receptors for self-MHC/self-peptide complexes undergo clonal deletion
- Negative selection ensures self-tolerance

\section*{Lineage Commitment}
- Changes in gene expression that result in
- Silencing of one co-receptor gene (CD4 or CD8)
- Expression of genes associated with a specific lineage function
- Affinity for MHC class I vs MHC II preference dictates the $\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$vs $\mathrm{CD}^{+}$fate of developing thymocytes
- Several proposed models of lineage commitment
(a) Instructive model

Interaction of a co-receptor with the MHC molecule for which it is specific results in down-regulation of the other co-receptor

Down-regulation of CD4 or CD8 is a random process
(c) Kinetic signaling model

- The decision to commit to the CD4 or CD8 lineage is based on the continuity of the TCR signal that a

$\mathrm{CD}_{4}{ }^{+} 8^{-} \mathrm{T}$ cell thymocyte receives.
- Positive selection results in down-regulation of CD8 on all thymocytes. This does not alter the intensity of a TCR/CD4/MHC II signal; cells receiving this signal continue to the CD4 SP lineage.
- However, the TCR/CD8/MHC I signal is interrupted, sending that cell towards CD8 lineage

\section*{Lineage Commitment}
- Small populations of DP thymocytes can also commit to other T-cell types
- NK T-cells
- Regulatory T-cells ( $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{REG}}$ )
- Intraepithelial lymphocyte lineages (IEL)

\section*{Exit from Thymus and Final Maturation}
- After successful selection \& lineage commitment, the thymocytes enter a quiescent stage \& leave the thymus
