1. Tens of billions of B cells generated each day in the bone marrow; only 50\% survive
2. Bone marrow: primary lymphoid tissue
3. Development means the cell surface expression of a unique B Cell Receptor (BCR), which is an Ig molecule (monomeric IgM and IgD)

1. Pre-B-cell receptor: initiates cell division resulting in 30-70 small pre-B cell clones (all have same heavy chain, but with potential to have different light chains)
2. Signal from pre-B-receptors halts HC gene rearrangement \& sLC synthesis; cell proliferation to yield lots of small pre-B-cells; cell division stops and light chain gene rearrangement begins
3. Immature B cells selected for tolerance (prevents autoimmunity)
4. Tolerant immature and mature B cells enter periphery (immature cells mature in the spleen)
5. Naïve B cells (never seen antigen) circulate looking for foreign microbes
$\operatorname{Ig} \alpha$ and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$ are Signaling Subunits of the B Cell Receptor (BCR; surface Ig molecule)

Figure 4-4 The Immune System, 2/e (© Garland Science 2005)
The Ig molecule (either pre-BCR or BCR) can not travel to the surface of the B cell without Ig $\alpha$ and Ig $\beta$
The pre-BCR and BCR consist of an Ig molecule plus Ig $\alpha$ and Ig $\beta$
Ig $\alpha$ and IgB genes turned on at the pro-B-cells stage and remain on until cell becomes an antibody secreting plasma cell
$\lg \alpha$ and $\lg \beta$ send signals when receptors are engaged or ligated (bound antigen)

\section*{Productive Gene Rearrangement ----> Survival}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-08.jpg?height=1114&width=2160&top_left_y=183&top_left_x=221)

Two copies of each heavy chain and each light chain loci
Most DJ rearrangements are successful (D can translate three reading frames)
VDJ rearrangement is consecutive; 50\% success rate (remember: $\mu$ chain)
$\kappa$ and $\lambda$ chain rearrangement is $85 \%$ successful
Unproductive gene rearrangement results in apoptosis (programmed cell death)

\section*{Light Chain has Several Chances to Rearrange}

Repeated rearrangements are possible at the light-chain loci
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-09.jpg?height=243&width=1200&top_left_y=424&top_left_x=184)

Large pre-B-cells undergo cell division before becoming resting small B cells; LC rearrangement

Starts with $\kappa$ and goes until all possibilities have been tried

LC rearrangement, 85\% successful

Overall success of Ig gene rearrangement is less than 50\%

\section*{Ending Gene Rearrangement}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-10.jpg?height=1647&width=1305&top_left_y=184&top_left_x=266)

Mechanism of ending gene rearrangment

Need to shut down rearrangement twice
1. Pre-BCR interacts with an unknown ligand to shut off heavy chain rearrangement
2. BCR initiate the shut off signal for light chain rearrangement

Figure 4-9 The Immune System, 2/e (© Garland Science 2005)

\section*{Regulating B Cell Development}
1. Genes essential for gene recombination are turned on at selective stages of B cell development
2. Genes encoding RAG;
-turned on in Early pro-B cell and late pro-B cell (HC rearrangement)
-turned off in Large pre-B cell (to allow proliferation)
-turned back on in Small-pre-B cell (LC rearrangement)
3. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)
-responsible for diversity (N nucleotides)
-turned on in pro-B cells, silent in small pre-B cells
4. Genes encoding Ig $\alpha$ and Ig $\beta$
-turned on in pro-B cells and remain on
5. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)
-signaling molecule whose deficiency prevent B cell development

\section*{X-linked Agammaglobulinemia}

Ig $\alpha$ and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$ signal to a signaling molecule: BTK
Btk needed to signal B cell to develop
Reduced number of pre-B cells in bone marrow, lack of mature B cells, Normal thymus and normal number of T cells

Recessive, X-linked
Patients lacking Btk (mostly boys) have B cell development blocked at the pre-B-cell stage and therefore have no circulating antibodies

Suffer from X-linked Agammaglobulinemia
Recurring infections: Haemophilus influenzae; Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyrogenes; Staphylococcus aureus

Treatment: antibiotics and infusion of antibodies (i.e passive immunity)

\section*{Formation of B Cell Tumors (Leukemias \& Lymphomas)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-13.jpg?height=591&width=1517&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=542)

High transcriptional and splicing activity during B cell gene rearrangement
Mistakes made that can result in deregulated cell growth leading to leukemia
Ig gene segment is mistakenly joined to a gene regulating cell growth
-translocation: gene on one chromosome joined to a gene on a different chromosome
-B cell tumors: Burkitt's lymphoma; Ig gene segment mistakenly fused to a gene called MYC that regulates the cell cycle; along with additional mutation(s) leads to Burkitt's lymphoma

\section*{CD5 ${ }^{+}$B Cells (B-1 Cells)}
1. Arise early in embryonic development
2. Express CD5 on surface
3. No surface IgD; restricted BCRs; Abs to bacterial polysaccharides
4. Predominate in pleural and peritoneal cavities
5. Capacity for self-renewal
6. Most B cell tumors causing chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are transformed B-1 cells (express CD5 on surface)
7. Treatment: bone marrow transplant

\section*{Alteration, Elimination, or Inactivation (Anergy) of Self-reactive Bcells}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-15.jpg?height=1114&width=1337&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=1)

Who: immature B cells (slgM) Where: bone marrow (mostly) How: signals sent by self Ags -multivalent self-antigen change BCR (new LC) or DIE
-mechanism: signal sent by crosslinked BCRs
-soluble self-antigen (BM or periphery)
mature, migrate, but inactive (anergic)
-mechanism: no crosslinking of BCRs; lgM (mostly in cytoplasm), IgD on surface, but can't signal
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-16.jpg?height=1826&width=600&top_left_y=0&top_left_x=41)

\section*{Self-reactive B Cells Get Another Chance}

Receptor Editing (new LC, new BCR specificity) -BCR "ligation" by multivalent Ags (MHC, crosslinks BCRs) -stops development: RAG genes active; LC rearrangement -new LC generated, synthesis of old LC stops -if not self-reactive, cell migrates to periphery -if self-reactive can continue until J segments are exhausted -if still fails; apoptosis, which results in clonal deletion -apoptotic B-cells phagocytosed by macrophages
-clonal deletion occurs in bone marrow OR right after the immature $\mathbf{B}$ cells enters the circulation
-55 billion B cells die each day: rearrangement fails (not productive; or autoreactive

\section*{Naïve B Cells: Life in the Circulation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-17.jpg?height=1006&width=729&top_left_y=307&top_left_x=0)

Travel Throughout Secondary Lymphoid Tissue (SLT)
-spleen, lymph nodes, MALT, GALT
-SLT: hang out in primary lymphoid follicles
-spleen: enter via blood
-lymph nodes: enter via lymphatic system
-primary lymphoid follicles contain follicular dendritic cells
- follicular dendritic cells: not APCs, not hematopoietic
-GALT (Peyer's Patches), tonsils, appendix; committed to IgA synthesis

\section*{Mature, Naïve B Cells in Lymph Nodes}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-18.jpg?height=839&width=1139&top_left_y=365&top_left_x=11)

Figure 4-16 The Immune System, 2/e (© Garland Science 2005)

\section*{Passage Through SLT (eg. Lymph Nodes)}
-enter T cell area from blood through HEV (high endothelial venules) -no antigen, migrate to primary follicle -receive signal to survive (FDCs) -exit through efferent lymphatic vessel -antigen, stay in T cell area and present antigenic peptides to T cells
-GALT (Peyers Patches), tonsils, appendix: specialized for IgA

Competition for Survival Signals -too many B cells, not enough FDCs to provide survival signals -naïve $B$ cells die within weeks in absence of antigen

\section*{Anergic B cells}
-stuck in T cells area and prevented from entering the primary lymphoid follicle, fail to receive survival signals and DIE

\section*{Big Moment: mature B Cells encounter antigen}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_494ed332256ad3e50da6g-19.jpg?height=872&width=1219&top_left_y=33&top_left_x=1183)

Activation of B cells in Secondary Lymphoid Tissue (SLT)
- engulf bacteria in SLT
- detained in T cell area of SLT by binding to T cells and receiving "HELP"; $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H} 2} / \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{HC}}$ (CD4 ${ }^{+}$)
- Help results in B cell proliferation and differentiation
-some activated B cells differentiate immediately into plasma cells secreting antibody (live only 4 weeks, no slgM)
-others migrate to primary lymphoid follicles to undergo isotype switching and hypersomatic mutation (affinity maturation)

\section*{Big Moment: mature B Cells encounter antigen}

Activation of B cells in Secondary Lymphoid Tissue (SLT) -migration to primary lymphoid follicles results in generation of secondary lymphoid follicles containing germinal centers (GCs)
-centroblasts (large, proliferating)
-centrocytes (small, nondividing)
-undergone isotype switching
-undergone somatic hypermutation (high accumulation of mutations at $\checkmark$ region of the centroblast stage of B-cell differentiation)
-centrocytes selected for high affinity BCRs (affinity maturation)
-lymphoblasts leave lymph nodes and migrate (other SLT) and bone marrow; differentiate into plasma cells
-memory B cells (high affinity, slgG, slgA, slgE)

Figure 4-18 The Immune System, 2/e (© Garland Science 2005)

Tumor Represents the Uncontrolled Growth of a Single Cell
-illustrated by B cell tumors; all have identical rearranged Ig genes (originated from single cell) -individual patient tumors are different
-follicular center cell lymphoma (naïve B cells; grow in lymphoid follicles)
-myelomas (plasma cells; grow in bone marrow)
-Hodgkin's disease (germinal center B cells) -somatic mutations of tumor cells; no BCR -stimulate non malignant T cell growth -dendritic morphology
All have same rearranged Ig DNA

\section*{Functions of B cells}
-What are they?
1. Interaction with antigens through BCRs
2.Present antigenic peptides to T cells
3.Humoral immunity against external Ags
4.Opsonization (Ab bound to cognate Ag)

\section*{Summary}
1. B cell originate from lymphoid progenitor stem cells and develop in the bone marrow thoughout life
2. Consecutive gene rearrangements of Ig genes results in the expression of a unique BCR (Ig molecule with H and L chains)
3. Several loci ( 2 HC ; 4LC) to counter unproductive rearrangements
4. $\mu \mathrm{HC}$ rearranges first and this must be productive to continue -forms pre-BCR (rearranged $\mu \mathrm{HC}$ and surrogate LC); ligation on cell surface halts HC gene rearrangement
5. LC rearrangement following proliferation of large pre-B cells
-4 loci; several attempts at each loci (85\% success rate)
-productive light chain rearrangement halts further rearrangement
6. B cell repertoire is diverse ( $10^{11}$ )
7. Mistakes cause B-cell leukemias and lymphomas
