\section*{MHC}

Learning Objectives:
-Definition of MHC
-Classification of MHC families (classes)
-Structures of MHC classes I and II
-Functions of MHC molecules (classes I, II \& III)
-Clinical relevance of HLA

\section*{Immunity $=$ State of protection from infectious disease}

\title{
IMMUNITY \\ INNATE IMMUNITY ACQUIRED IMMUNITY
}

Innate Immunity $=$ Non-specific Immunity
Acquired Immunity $=$ Specific Immunity
= Adaptive Immunity

\section*{ACQUIRED IMMUNITY}

\section*{Characteristic Features}
1. Specificity - Ability to distinguish pathogens
2. Diversity - Recognize millions of molecules
3. Memory - Increased \& faster second response
4. Self/Non-self Discrimination - Respond to non-self

Immune system responds to bacteria, viruses, toxins.

But not to the whole bacterium, virus or toxin!
Immune system responds to "ANTIGENS"
Antigens $=$ Molecules that bind to an antibody or to a T cell receptor

Immunogens $=$ Molecules that induce immune responses

But the immune system does not respond to the whole antigen......just to small segments or regions of Ag

Epitope $\boldsymbol{=}$ Small immunogenic segment or region in an $\mathbf{A g}$

So, the immune system responds to epitopes on antigens of bacteria, viruses, toxins etc

Exogenous Ag = extracellular bacteria, proteins etc

Endogenous Ag = intracellular bacteria, viruses etc

\section*{Antigens are PROCESSED within cells}

\section*{Epitopes are PRESENTED on cells by MHC molecules}

\section*{What are MHC molecules?}

MHC = Major Histocompatibility Complex
HLA = Human Leukocyte Antigens

\section*{Defination of MHC}
- A collection of genes arrayed within a stretch of DNA on chromosome number 6 in human and chromosome 17 in mice.
- Determines whether transplanted tissue is accepted as self (histocompatible) or rejected as foreign (histoincompatible)

Referred to:
- HLA in human
- H -2 complex in mice

Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC - HLA)
Histocompatibility $=$ Ability to accept grafts between individuals

MHC = Region of multiple loci that are
(1) responsible for rejection of grafts and
(2) function in signalling between lymphocytes and cells that present antigens.

MHC (HLA) molecules recognize antigens, so MHC molecules are antigen-recognition molecules (like antibody molecules).

HLA molecules PRESENT antigens to T cells.

\section*{MHC.}
- The MHC contains a set of genes located together on one chromosome as a 'complex'.
- MHC genes code for several series or families of polymorphic glycoproteins, including two families of molecules that are expressed at the cell surface, the class I and class II molecules.
- These specialized membrane proteins act as guidance systems that allow T cells to recognize antigen.

\section*{Historical perspective.}
- The term MHC derives from studies designed to investigate the fate of tissues (grafts) transplanted between individuals.
- As a result of these experiments, the MHC was recognized as an important ('major') set of genes ('complex') responsible for controlling whether grafts are accepted between individuals whose tissues are genetically similar ('histocompatible') or rejected by individuals who are not ('incompatible').

\section*{Note.}
- MHC is not the only influence on tissue compatibility.
- A large number of genetic loci have been identified on different chromosomes that also play a role in graft rejection.
- These are called 'minor histocompatibility genes'.

\section*{General features of the MHC.}
- The MHC codes for 3 families of glycoproteins known as class I, class II, and class III MHC molecules.
- The members of two of these families, class I and class II molecules, are also sometimes referred to as MHC antigens or alloantigens because they can be recognized by the immune system during the rejection of tissue transplanted between MHC incompatible individuals.
- The class I and class II MHC molecules are expressed mainly as membrane glycoproteins at the cell surface, whereas the products of class III genes are usually soluble molecules.
- Class III molecules include some of the components of the complement system, one of the major effector mechanisms of the humoral immune response; soluble effector molecules such as TNF $\beta$; the enzyme 21hydroxylase; and the HSP70

\section*{Structure of Class I MHC Molecules}

HLA-A, B, C molecules have a heavy chain ( $\alpha$ ) linked to a smaller $\beta 2$-microglobulin molecule

\section*{Structure of Class I MHC}
- Two polypeptide chains, a long $\alpha$ chain and a short $\beta$ chain, called $\beta 2$ microglobulin
- Four regions:
- Peptide-binding region - a groove formed from $\alpha 1$ and $\alpha 2$ domains of the $\alpha$ chain
- Immunoglobulin-like region - highly conserved $\alpha 3$ domain - site to which CD8 on T cell binds
- Transmembrane region - stretch of hydrophobic amino acids spanning membrane
- Cytoplasmic region - contains sites for phosphorylation and binding to cytoskeletal elements

\section*{Structure of Class I MHC Peptidebinding Region}
- a "groove" composed of an $\alpha$-helix on two opposite walls and eight $\beta$-pleated sheets forming the floor
- residues lining groove most polymorphic
- peptide in groove 8-10 amino acids long
- specific amino acid on peptide required for "anchor site" in groove

\section*{Structure of Class II MHC}
- Two polypeptide chains, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, of roughly equal length.
- Four regions:
- Peptide-binding region - a groove formed from the $\alpha 1$ and $\beta 1$ domains of the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains - site of polymorphism
- Immunoglobulin-like region - conserved $\alpha 2$ and $\beta 2$ domains - $\beta 2$ is site to which CD4 on T cell binds
- Transmembrane region - stretch of hydrophobic amino acids spanning membrane
- Cytoplasmic region - contains sites for phosphorylation and binding to cytoskeletal elements

MHC molecules are highly polymorphic i.e., exist as many alleles in the population i.e., are different in different individuals

\section*{Diversity of MHC molecules in the individual}

MHC molecules are CODOMINANTLY expressed Two of each of the six types of MHC molecule are expressed

Genes in the MHC are tightly LINKED and usually inherited in a group
The combination of alleles on a chromosome is an MHC HAPLOTYPE

\section*{Other genes in the MHC}

\section*{MHC Class 1b genes}

Encoding MHC class I-like proteins that associate with $\beta-2$ microglobulin: HLA-G interacts CD94 (NK-cell receptor). Inhibits NK cell attack of foetus/ tumours HLA-E binds conserved leader peptides from HLA-A, B, C. Interacts with CD94

HLA-F function unknown

\section*{MHC Class II genes}

Encoding several antigen processing genes:
HLA-DM $\alpha$ and $\beta$, proteasome components (LMP-2 \& 7), peptide transporters
(TAP-1 \& 2), HLA-DO $\alpha$ and DO $\beta$
Many pseudogenes

\section*{MHC Class III genes}

Encoding complement proteins C4A and C4B, C2 and FACTOR B
TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTORS $\alpha$ AND $\beta$

\section*{Immunologically irrelevant genes}

Genes encoding 21-hydroxylase, RNA Helicase, Caesin kinase Heat shock protein 70, Sialidase

How many types of HLA molecules do you have?

Three Class I molecules - HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C

Three Class II molecules - HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR
But, we get one set of HLA genes from our mothers and another set from our fathers

These two sets are frequently different
So, we may have as many as 12 types of HLA molecules

\section*{MHC molecules are highly polymorphic}
i.e., many HLA alleles in the population more than 100 types of $-\mathrm{A},-\mathrm{B},-\mathrm{C}$ as many as 400 types of HLA-B !
i.e., HLA are different in different individuals
.....and that is why tissue grafts are rejected!
But, what is the FUNCTION of the MHC?

\section*{FUNCTIONS of MHC (HLA) MOLECULES}

MHC molecules PRESENT antigens to cells
Class I HLA molecules present epitopes to cytotoxic T cells
Class II HLA molecules present epitopes to helper T cells

MHC $=$ Cell-surface molecules that PRESENT antigen to T cells

MHC molecules are essential for immune recognition

\section*{Differential distribution of MHC molecules}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Tissue & MHC class I & MHC class II \\
\hline T cells & +++ & +/- \\
\hline B cells & +++ & +++ \\
\hline Macrophages & +++ & ++ \\
\hline Other APC & +++ & +++ \\
\hline Epithelial cells of thymus & + & +++ \\
\hline Neutrophils & +++ & - \\
\hline Hepatocytes & $+$ & - \\
\hline Kidney & $+$ & - \\
\hline Brain & + & - \\
\hline Erythrocytes & - & - \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Cell activation affects the level of MHC expression
The pattern of expression reflects the function of MHC molecules:
Class I is involved in anti-viral immune responses
Class II involved in activation of other cells of the immune system

\section*{Role of MHC in diseases.}

\section*{Polymorphism in the MHC affects peptide antigen binding}

MHC allele B

Changes in the pockets, walls and floor of the peptide binding cleft alter peptide MHC interactions and determine which peptides bind.
$\mathbf{S}$ (Y) $\mathbf{I}$ P
$\mathbf{R}$
$\mathbf{R}$ $\mathbf{S} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A} \mathbf{K}$ (I) MHC allele A

Products of different MHC alleles bind a different repertoire of peptides

\section*{Polymorphism in the MHC}

Variation $>1 \%$ at a single genetic locus in a population of individuals Each polymorphic variant is called an allele

In the human population, over $1,200 \mathrm{MHC}$ alleles have been identified
381

Data from http://www.anthonynolan.org.uk/HIG/index.html July 200043

\section*{How diverse are MHC molecules in the population?}

IF - each individual had 6 types of MHC
- the alleles of each MHC type were randomly distributed in the population
- any of the 1,200 alleles could be present with any other allele
$$\sim 6 \times 10^{15} \text { unique combinations }$$

In reality MHC alleles are NOT randomly distributed in the population
Alleles segregate with lineage and race
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\cline { 2 - 4 } \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{ Frequency (\%) } \\
\hline Group of alleles & CAU & AFR & ASI \\
\hline HLA-A1 & 15.18 & 5.72 & 4.48 \\
HLA- A2 & 28.65 & 18.88 & 24.63 \\
HLA- A3 & 13.38 & 8.44 & 2.64 \\
HLA- A28 & 4.46 & 9.92 & 1.76 \\
HLA- A36 & 0.02 & 1.88 & 0.01 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{How can 6 invariant molecules have the capacity to bind to 1,000,000,000,000,000 different peptides with high affinity?}

MHC molecules
- Adopt a flexible "floppy" conformation until a peptide binds
- Fold around the peptide to increase stability of the complex
- Use a small number of anchor residues to tether the peptide this allows different sequences between anchors and different lengths of peptide

\section*{Replacement substitutions occur at a higher frequency than silent substitution}

Suggests that selective pressures may operate on MHC polymorphism

\section*{Evolution of pathogens to evade MHC-mediated antigen presentation}

In south east China \& Papua New Guinea up to 60\% of individuals express HLA-A11
HLA-A11 binds an important peptide of Epstein Barr Virus
Many EBV isolates from these areas have mutated this peptide
so that it can not bind to HLA-A11 MHC molecules

Evolution of the MHC to eliminate pathogens
In west Africa where malaria is endemic HLA-B53 is commonly associated with recovery from a potentially lethal form of malaria

\section*{MHC molecules are targets for immune evasion by pathogens.}
- T cells can only be activated by interaction between the antigen receptor and peptide antigen in an MHC molecule
- There is strong selective pressure on pathogens to evade the immune response
- The MHC has evolved two strategies to prevent evasion by pathogens
-More than one type of MHC molecule in each individual

\section*{Example: If MHC X was the only type of MHC molecule}

Population threatened with extinction

The number of types of MHC molecule can not be increased ad infinituran

\section*{Molecular basis of MHC types and variants}

\section*{POLYGENISM}

Several MHC class I and class II genes encoding different types of MHC molecule with a range of peptide-binding specificities.

\section*{POLYMORPHISM}

Variation >1\% at a single genetic locus in a population of individuals MHC genes are the most polymorphic known

The type and variant MHC molecules do not vary in the lifetime of the individual

The diversity in MHC molecules exists at the population level This sharply contrast diversity in T and B cell antigen receptors which exists within the individual

\section*{Summary of Aspects of MHC}
- MHC molecules are membrane-bound.
- Recognition by T cells requires cell-cell contact.
- Peptide from cytosol associates with class I MHC and is recognized by Tc cells.
- Peptide from vesicles associates with class II MHC and is recognized by Th cells.
