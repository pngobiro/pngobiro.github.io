\section*{IMMUNOLOGICAL TOLERANCE}

A state of specific immunological unresponsiveness to self Ag

\section*{Types of Tolerance}

\section*{1. Central Tolerance carried out during fetal development in the PRIMARY LYMPHOID ORGANS}
I. Thymus for T cells
ii. Bone marrow \& fetal liver for B cells
2. Peripheral Tolerance, operates in the SECONDARY LYMPHOID ORGNAS, in the periphery after birth

\section*{ROUTES TO T CELL TOLERANCE}

\section*{I. CENTRAL TOLERANCE}

\section*{CLONAL DELETION}

Takes place following LYMPHOPOIESIS in a specialized organ, the thymus.
- The thymus is composed of several lobes, each of which has cortical and medullary regions:
- The cortex contains immature thymocytes in close contact with thymic epithelial cells.
- Medullary areas contain more mature thymocytes, epithelial cells, and dendritic cells and macrophages

- Thymic development of T cells results in:
1) Production of $T$ cell receptors for antigen (TCR)
2) Lymphocytes begin to express CD3, CD4, and CD8
3) Selection of $T$ cells that can interact effectively with self-MHC- Positive selection
4) Elimination of self-reactive cells that are stimulated by MHC + self Ag- Negative selection
5) Mature T cells ready to go to the periphery are TCR/CD3+, and either CD4 or CD8 positive

\section*{CLONAL DELETION}

Physical deletion/elimination of T cells that have receptors specific for self antigens from the peripheral repertoire

\section*{HOW IS SELF-TOLERANCE MAINTAINED?}
- Clonal Deletion or Anergy - Autoreactive lymphocytes are deleted or are non-functional
- Sequestration of Autoantigens - Self-Ag are isolated/hidden from immune system
- Lack of Processing or Presentation - Self-Ag are not processed or presented
- Suppression - Ts cells suppress autoimmune responses.
