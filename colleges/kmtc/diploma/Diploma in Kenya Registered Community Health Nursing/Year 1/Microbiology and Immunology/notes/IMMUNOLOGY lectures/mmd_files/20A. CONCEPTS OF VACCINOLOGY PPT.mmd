\section*{CONCEPTS OF VACCINOLOGY}

\section*{Objectives}

By the end of this session you should be able to
- To define vaccines and their importance
- To understand the development of a vaccine and its components
- To know the types/classification of vaccines, and the advantages/disadvantages

\section*{Introduction}
- Vaccines- all biological preparations, produced from living organisms, that induce immunity against disease and either prevent (prophylactic vaccines) or, in some cases, treat disease (therapeutic vaccines). Vaccines are administered in liquid form, either by injection, by oral, or by intranasal routes
- Composed of diseases causing microorganism or some of its components
- Agent stimulates the immune system to recognize it as foreign, destroy it and remember it.
- Targets the adaptive immune system
- Vaccines can be:
$\square$ Monovalent /univalent
- Multivalent /polyvalent
$\square$ Prophylactic or therapeutic

\section*{Immune system}

\section*{Vaccination}
- Administration of vaccine to induce immune response
- Passive-transfer of antibody
- Active-host induces the immune response
- Immunization- stimulation of the immune system via use of infectious agents

\section*{Aim of vaccination}
- Mimic natural infection and induce protective immunity by introducing pathogen components without causing disease
- Induce immunologic memory which leads to a better and faster response upon pathogen exposure
- Herd immunity- proportion of population that needs to be immunized to break transmission chain and provide protection to unvaccinated individuals

\section*{Immune response to vaccine}

\section*{antigens}
- Antigens are divided into T cell dependent and T cell independent
- The T cell independent are poor immunogens
- Induction of a T cell dependent antibody response initially requires activation of the $T$ helper CD4 lymphocytes by presentation of an antigen to the mononuclear phagocytes . (facilitated by adjuvants)
- The presentation triggers secretion of a cascade of cytokine which stimulate maturation of Thelper cells
- This is followed by secretion of antibodies after a latent period.

\section*{Immune response cont}
- IgM is detected first
- Within 2-6 wks the igM titers drop and the IgG titers rise
- In oral live vaccines, there is replication at the mucosal surfaces before host invasion and secretion of secretory IgA which neutralizes viruses efficiently, fix complement, prevent absorption of organisms to the intestinal wall and lyses gram negative bacteria.

\section*{Immune response cont}
- The antibodies produced in response to vaccine constituents therefore may be
$\checkmark$ antitoxins
$\checkmark$ opsonins
$\checkmark$ lysins
$\checkmark$ neutralizing antibodies
$\checkmark$ antiadhesins
Immunologic memory created by the $T$ and $B$ lymphocytes leads to heightened immune response on second exposure characterized by marked proliferation of antibody producing B and effector Tlymphocytes

\section*{Immune response to antigen}

\section*{Vaccinology}
- Science or methodology of vaccine development
- Scientific research regarding the organism pathogenesis and immune response it confers
- Identification of specific epitopes (antigenic determinants) to use as antigen
- Antigen generation and isolated from cells used to generate it
- Vaccine formulation
- Pre clinical trials in animals
- Clinical trial in human
- Phase 1-<100-safety, immunogenicity, dose response
- Phase 2-safety immunogenicity in several hundreds
- Phase 3-efficacy in thousands
- Phase 4-post marketing surveillance for safety and effectiveness

\section*{Vaccine additives}
- Adjuvant-non antigenic and enhance the immune response
$\square$ Enhance $T$ cell activation by promoting the accumulation of APC at site of exposure
$\square$ Increases expression of co stimulant molecules cytokines, HLA peptide complexes on the APC
$\square$ Slowed release of the Ag for sustained immune stimulation(depot effect)
[ Examples:liposomes,immune
stimulating complexes, aluminium salts etc

\section*{Other vaccine components.}
- Stabilizer- increases the storage life
- Preservatives-prevent contamination by bacteria of fungi
- Allow use of multidose vials
- Others include-suspending fluid, antimicrobial agents

\section*{Ideal vaccine}
- Long life immunity
- Protective against all variants of the organism
- Prevent disease transmission
- Induce effective immunity rapidly
- Transmit maternal protection to fetus
- Few immunization to induce protection
- Not administered by injection
- Cheap, stable, safe

\section*{Types of vaccines}
- Live attenuated
- killed
- Toxoid
- Subunit
- Conjugate
- Recombinant DNA based
- Anti-idiotype

\section*{Live attenuated vaccine}
- Live but virulent properties are disabled
- Use closely related organism less virulent
- Preferred in healthy persons
- More durable immune response
- Examples: Yellow fever, MMR, OPV, Typhoid, Rota

\section*{Killed vaccine}
- Outer coat is intact but the replicative function is destroyed
- Heat, chemicals, radioactivity, antibiotics
- More antigen needed
- Examples: IPV, Hepatitis A, Cholera, Rabies

\section*{LIVE vs KILLED VACCINES}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Properties & Live vaccine & Killed vaccine \\
\hline Dose & Low & High \\
\hline No. of doses & Single & Multiple \\
\hline Need for Adjuvant & No & Yes \\
\hline Duration of immunity & Many years & Less years \\
\hline Antibody response & Ig G & $\lg \mathrm{A}, \lg \mathrm{G}$ \\
\hline CMI & Good & poor \\
\hline Reverse to virulence & Possible & Not possible \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Toxoid vaccine}
- Inactivated toxic compounds that cause illness rather than the micro-organism
- Examples: Tetanus, Diptheria

\section*{Subunit vaccine}
- Purified subunit-fragment of the microorganism is used to create immune response

Example-hepatitis B surface protein
- Recombinant-production of the unit via gene therapy
${ }^{\circ}$ Others-HPV vaccine caspid protein

\section*{Conjugated vaccine}
- Linking of the outer polysaccharide coat to a carrier protein
- Polysaccharide has poor antigenicity
- Important in infants
- Examples: hemophilus influenza B vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine

\section*{Factors influencing timing of vaccines}
* Nature of vaccine
- Age specific risk of disease
- Age specific risk of complications
- Ability of a person at a certain age to respond to a vaccine
- Potential of interferance with the immune response by passively transfered maternal antibody
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Vaccine type & Recommended Childhood (ages 0-6) Immunization Schedule \\
\hline Live, attenuated & \begin{tabular}{l}
BCG,OPV \\
