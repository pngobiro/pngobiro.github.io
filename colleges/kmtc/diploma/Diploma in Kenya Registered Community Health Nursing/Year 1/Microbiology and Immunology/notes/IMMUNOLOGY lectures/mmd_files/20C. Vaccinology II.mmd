\section*{Vaccinology II}

MBChB II 4/7/11

\section*{Definitions and Immunological principles}
- Manipulation of the immune system to the benefit of the patient
- The adaptive immune response is manipulated in an antigen-specific manner to stimulate lymphocyte-mediated protective immunity
- Passive immunization: administration of preformed antibody ("antiserum") derived form human or animal donors to the recipient

\section*{Definitions and Immunological principles}
- The effect is immediate but shortlived as the transferred immunoglobulin is metabolized.
- Immunological memory does not develop
- Vaccination (active immunization): attenuated organisms, killed organisms or pathogen subunits are administered to an individual

\section*{Definitions and Immunological principles}
- The immune response develops slowly but immunological memory is evoked
- Re-exposure of the subject to the pathogenic organism produces a rapid, effective secondary response, which prevents symptomatic infection

\section*{Type of vaccines}
- Killed vaccines - preparations of normal infectious, pathogenic virus or bacteria that has been rendered non-pathogenic, usually by chemical treatment such as with formalin - cross-links viral proteins
- Attenuated vaccines - live virus or bacteria particles that grow in the vaccine recipient but do not cause disease as they have been altered (mutated) to a nonpathogenic form

\section*{Type of vaccines}
- Subunit vaccines - purified components of the virus, such as a surface antigen
- Toxoid - inactivated toxic compound
- Conjugate - polysaccharide capsule linked to a protein to increase the antigenicity
- Recombinant vector - physiology of one micro-organism combined to DNA of another

\section*{Aims of disease control to be achieved by immunization}
- Containment - accepts that disease will remain endemic but seeks to reduce morbidity to an acceptable level.
- Elimination - no endemic transmission in a population. Sporadic cases will occur because of imported cases, but transmission in immunized population fails to reestablish endemic transmission.

\section*{Aims of disease control to be achieved by immunization}
- Eradication- global destruction of pathogen allowing for cessation of all control measures achieving huge cost benefits for future generations.
- Requires the absence of an animal host \& a vaccine effective in preventing disease transmission.
- Smallpox only human disease eradicated thus far.

\section*{Passive immunization - clinical uses}
- Treatment of serious infections
- Secondary prevention post-exposure in individuals at high risk of mortality - botulism, rabies, tetanus, hepatitis B
- Neutralization of toxins (e.g. postsnake bite) and digitalis overdose (neutralizing antibody to inactivate the drug)

\section*{Active immunization (vaccination)}
- Produces an immune response capable of providing effective protective immunity in the absence of symptomatic infection
- In any population, some individuals will have contra-indications to particular vaccines or will fail to respond
- However, if 95\% of the population are vaccinated, those non-vaccinated subjects are unlikely to come in contact with an infected subject (herd immunity)

\section*{Active immunization (vaccination)}
- Live attenuated vaccines - provide strong immunization of the appropriate type \& site for natural infection
- Risk of reversion to pathogenic strains causing disease. Pose a particular risk especially immunocompromised subjects
- Killed vaccines - do not pose a risk of infection.
- Elicit weaker responses than live attenuated vaccines. Booster doses are usually required

\section*{Active immunization (vaccination)}
- Subunit vaccines - contain proteins, carbohydrates, or inactivated toxins from organisms.
- Less immunogenic than intact organisms, and may require adjuvants to elicit effective immune responses
- Schedules usually involve multiple doses
- Side effects are less prominent than with whole organisms
- No risk of vaccine-associated infection

\section*{Vaccination - clinical uses}
- Some vaccines are offered to everyone, while others are reserved for people at particular risk because of an underlying medical condition, occupational risk or travel
- Schedules of routine vaccination vary in different parts of the world
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline VACCINE & TYPE & INDICATIONS, SCHEDULE \\
\hline BCG & Live attenuated & Birth \\
\hline Tetanus & Toxoid & Childhood, 3 doses \\
\hline Diphtheri a & Toxoid & " \\
\hline Pertussis & Subunit or cellular & " \\
\hline HiB & Conjugated polysaccharide & " \\
\hline Hepatitis B & Subunit & Childhood; occupational risk, 3 doses \\
\hline Measles & Live attenuated & Single dose at 9 months \\
\hline Polio & Live attenuated or killed & Childhood; 3 doses \\
\hline Influenza & Subunit; new preparation on annual basis & Medical risk - chest dz, elderly, diabetes, immunocompromised) Environmental risk - nursing homes Occupational risk - healthcare workers \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Contra-indications to vaccination}
- Moderate or severe illness, with or without fever
- Anaphylactic reaction to vaccine or its constitute
- Live attenuated vaccines:
- Pregnant women
- Immunocompromised children
- Within 3 months of intravenous immunoglobulin

\section*{Properties of an ideal vaccine WHO}
- Safe
- Affordable worldwide
- Heat stable
- Effective after a single dose
- Applicable to a number of diseases
- Administered by a mucosal route
- Suitable for administration early in life

\section*{Modern approaches to vaccine development}
- Development of more effective \& safer vaccines, as well as vaccines for other diseases is a major area of research
- Molecular techniques have facilitated the production of large quantities of proteins for use as subunit vaccines safely \& relatively cheaply
- Vaccination has been particularly successful in diseases where natural infection leads to sterilizing immunity and long-term immunity. Many other diseases remain major public health problems
