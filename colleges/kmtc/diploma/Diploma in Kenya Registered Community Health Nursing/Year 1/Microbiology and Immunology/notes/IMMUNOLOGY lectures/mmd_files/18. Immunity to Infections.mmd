\section*{Immunity to Infections}

\section*{Why we have an immune system...}
- Host-Parasitic relationship: a form of symbiosis in which one organism benefits (the parasite) while the other is harmed (the host)
- some form of host defense is present in all multicellular organisms
- some inverts have phagocytes
- all vertebrates have phagocytes, NK cells, and T and B cells
- antibodies become more complex (mammals)
- Toll receptors in drosophila => Toll-like receptors in mammals (an important innate receptor)

\section*{Infectious threats}
- viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, etc.
- most are friendly or neutral
- tolerated or controlled
- the minority of microbes cause disease
- these are termed virulent or pathogenic
- microbe entry => invasion and colonization of host tissues => evasion of host immunity => tissue injury/ impairment
- protection against microbial infection is the main physiological function of the immune system

\section*{Innate immunity.}
- adaptive response typically takes 1-2 weeks to develop
- in the meantime, innate immunity:
- contains the infection transiently
- induces adaptive T and B cell responses
- in many cases innate immunity is also involved in pathogen clearance during the peak of the adaptive response

\section*{Basic principles of immunity}
- defense is mediated by effector mechanisms aimed at containment and clearance
- pathogens receive specialized responses
- pathogen survival hinges around evasion of effector responses.

\section*{Cellular versus Humoral immunity}

T helper type 2 (Th2)

\section*{Where the microbe lives plays a role in determining what type of immune response will be effective...}
- extracellular bacteria => antibody response
- intracellular bacteria => cell-mediated response
- viruses => both
- parasites => varies depending on the life cycle, structure, etc (often both)

\section*{Mechanisms of clearance: Phagocytosis}

\section*{Mechanisms of clearance: Opsonization}

\section*{Extracellular bacteria}
- Innate response involves activation of:
- complement (alternate) => LPS, PG, mannose
- TLR pathways, later activating adaptive response
- inflammatory response and influx of WBC
- can also cause fever, injury
- phagocytes => enhanced activity, opsonization, pathogen receptors
- neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs)

\section*{Extracellular bacteria (2)}
- Adaptive response, which relies mostly on antibody (humoral) responses
- block infection, eliminate microbes, neutralize toxins
- usually directed towards cell wall and secreted products
- opsonization, activation of classical complement
- CD4 response => cytokines and co-stimulation that help the mAb response
- Th1 cells => critical for neutrophil recruitment

\section*{Intracellular bacteria}
- adapted to replicate inside cells, often phagocytes
- no antibody accessibility => CMI is critical
- activation of NK cells => kill infected cells, secrete Th1 cytokines
- IL-12 => key to inducing a Th1 response
- macrophage activation via CD40L and IFN- $\gamma=>$ increases killing of ingested microbes
- induction of ROS, NO, lysosomal enzymes (anti-microbial)
- if bacteria escapes phagosomes -> cytosol, they can be recognized by CD8+ T cells

\section*{Examples of Microbial Evasion of Immune Defenses.}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Pathogen & Mechanism & Result \\
\hline Streptococcus pneumoniae & Capsule & Avoids phagocytosis \\
\hline Gram positive bacteria, some gram negative bacteria & Resist insertion of complement MAC & Avoid complement-mediated lysis \\
\hline Mycobacterium tuberculosis & Blocks lysosome fusion with phagosome & Avoids antibody and complement opsonization, macrophage killing \\
\hline Listeria monocytogenes & Escapes phagosome into cytoplasm & Avoids macrophage killing, presentation on Class II MHC \\
\hline Toxoplasma gondii & Escapes phagosome into own cytoplasmic vesicle & Avoids macrophage killing, presentation on both Class I and Class II MHC \\
\hline Treponema pallidum & Covers membrane with host proteins & Avoids immune system recognition \\
\hline Neisseria meningitidis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Haemophilus influenzae & Expresses IgA protease & Avoids IgA neutralization \\
\hline Pseudomonas aeruginosa & Secretes elastase that inactivates C3a and C5a & Blocks inflammation \\
\hline Staphylococcus aureus & Secretes superantigens & Suppresses immune response \\
\hline Mycobacterium leprae & Stimulates Th2 response & Suppresses Th1 response \\
\hline & & 20 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Viruses}
- take over cellular machinery => injury + death
- use cell-surface receptors to enter various cell types
- immunity => blocking infection and clearing infected cells
- Innate response involves:
- NK killing, cytokine secretion
- infected cells, plasmacytoid DCs => secrete Type 1 interferons

\section*{Adaptive immunity to viruses}
- antibody response:
- early in infection, or when virus is between cells
- neutralization => prevents attachment, entry to cell
- opsonization, complement activation
- IgA important mucosally
- CD8+ T cell response:
- detects virus inside cytoplasm (infected cells, ingested)
- usually require CD4 help (same as abs)
- secrete cytokines, kill infected cells (Perforin-granzyme pathway)
- can target more conserved regions of viral genomes

Anti-viral immunity

\section*{Viral evasion}
- evolution (antigen variation)
- HLA down-regulation
- homologs to human proteins (EBV -> IL-10)
- CTL exhaustion

\section*{Parasites}
- infect $30 \%$ of the world's population
- protozoa, helminths, ectoparasites
- complex life cycles with intermediate hosts
- most cause chronic infections => weak innate immunity and evade adaptive responses

\section*{Parasites (2)}
- Innate:
- many parasites can resist phagocytosis
- some bind TLRs and activate APCs
- Adaptive:
- differs widely depending on life cycle, structure of the pathogen
- if intracellular => similar to intracellular bacteria
- extracellular => special types of antibody responses (lgE)

\section*{Depending on the parasite...}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Parasite/Disease & Immunity \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Protozoa} \\
\hline Plasmodium spp. (malaria) & antibody and CD8+ CTL \\
\hline Leishmania & CD4+ Th1, macrophage act. \\
\hline Trypanosoma & antibodies \\
\hline Entamoeba (Amebiasis) & antibodies, phagocytosis \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Metazoa} \\
\hline Schistosoma spp. & ADCC via eosinophils, macrophages, Th2 \\
\hline Filaria & cell-mediated immunity, ?antibodies \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Evasion}
- change antigenicity
- stage specific, programmed (Trypanosomes), shedding
- resist effector mechanisms aimed at clearance
- ie. tegument is difficult to phagocytose
- sequester away from immune responses
- insides cells, in cysts, intestinal lumen
- induce T cell tolerance
- Tregs
