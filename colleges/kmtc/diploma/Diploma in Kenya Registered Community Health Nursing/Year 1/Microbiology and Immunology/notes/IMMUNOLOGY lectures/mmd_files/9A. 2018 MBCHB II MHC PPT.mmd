\section*{Major Histocompatibility Complex}

\section*{Learning Objectives}
- Definitions (tissue compatibility/incompatibility, haplotypes, polymorphism, codominance)
- MHC genes/proteins (Class I,II, and III)
- MHC structure (Class I \& II)
- Ag recognition (Intracellular by MHC class I Vs extracellular antigens by MHC class II
- MHC functions and restriction (ref; T-cells)
- Medical applications e.g paternity tests etc

\section*{MHC}
- Major Histocompatibility Complex
- Cluster of genes found in all mammals
- Its products play role in discriminating self/non-self
- Participant in both humoral and cell-mediated immunity
- MHC Act As Antigen Presenting Structures
- In Human MHC Is Found On Chromosome 6
- Referred to as HLA complex
- In Mice MHC Is Found On Chromosome 17
- Referred to as H-2 complex

\section*{MHC}
- Genes Of MHC Organized In 3 Classes
- Class I MHC genes
- Glycoproteins expressed on all nucleated cells
- Major function to present processed Ags to $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$
- Class II MHC genes
- Glycoproteins expressed on МФ, B-cells, DCs
- Major function to present processed Ags to $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$
- Class III MHC genes
- Products that include secreted proteins that have immune functions. Ex. Complement system, inflammatory molecules

\section*{Class I, II and III MHC}
- Class I MHC Genes Found In Regions A, B and C In Humans (K and D In Mice)

- Both involved in APC
- Class III MHC Have No Structural Similarity To Class I and II
- Ex. TNF, heat shock proteins, complement components

\end{tabular}

\section*{Human HLA complex}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Complex & \multicolumn{8}{|c|}{HLA} \\
\hline MHC class & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{II} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{III} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{I} \\
\hline Region & DP & DQ & DR & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{C4, C2, BF} & B & C & A \\

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{MHC Genes Are Polymorphic}
- MHC Products Are Highly Polymorphic
- Vary considerably from person to person
- However, Crossover Rate Is Low
- 0.5\% crossover rate
- Inherited as 2 sets (one from father, one from mother)
- Haplotype refers to set from mother or father
- MHC Alleles Are Co-dominantly Expressed
- Both mother and father alleles are expressed
- Inbred Mice Haplotypes Are Designated With Italic Superscript
- Ex. H-2 ${ }^{\text {b }}$
- Designation refers to entire set of H-2 alleles

\section*{Inheritance Of HLA Haplotypes}
(c) Inheritance of HLA haplotypes in a typical human family

\section*{Class I MHC Molecule}
- Comprised of 2 molecules
$\square \alpha$ chain ( 44 kDa ), transmembrane polypeptide
- $\beta_{2}$-microglobulin (12 kDa)
- Non-covalently associated with each other
- Association Of $\alpha$ Chain and $\beta_{2}$ Is Required For Surface Expression
$\forall \alpha$ Chain Made Up Of 3 Domains ( $\alpha 1, \alpha 2$ and $\alpha 3$ )
$\forall \beta_{2}$-microglobulin Similar To $\alpha 3$
$\forall \alpha 1$ And $\alpha 2$ Form Peptide Binding Cleft (groove)
- Fits peptide of about 8-10 a/a long
$\forall \alpha 3$ Highly Conserved Among MHC I Molecules
- Interacts with CD8 ( $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$ ) molecule

\section*{Class II MHC Molecule}
- Comprised of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains
${ }^{\square} \alpha$ chain and $\beta$ chain associate non-covalently
- $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains Made Up Of Domains
${ }^{\square} \alpha 1$ and $\alpha 2$ ( $\alpha$ chain)
- $\beta 1$ and $\beta 2$ ( $\beta$ chain)
$\forall \alpha 1$ and $\beta 1$ Form Antigen Binding Cleft
$\forall \alpha$ and $\beta$ Heterodimer Has Been Shown To Dimerize
- CD4 Molecule Binds $\alpha 2 / \beta 2$ domains

\section*{Class I And II Specificity}
- Several Hundred Allelic Variants Have Been Identified In Humans
- However, up to 6 MHC I And 12 MHC II Molecules Are Expressed In An Individual
- Enormous Number Of Peptides Needs To Be Presented Using These MHC Molecules
- To Achieve This Task MHC Molecules Are Not Very Specific For Peptides (Unlike TCR and BCR)
- Promiscuous Binding Occurs
- A peptide can bind a number of MHC
- An MHC molecule can bind numerous peptides

\section*{Class I And II Diversity And Polymorphism}
- MHC Is One Of The Most Polymorphic Complexes Known
- Alleles Can Differ Up To 20 a/a
- Class I Alleles In Humans: 240 A, 470 B, 110 C
- Class II Alleles In Humans: HLA-DR $350 \beta, 2 \alpha$ !
- HLA-DR
$\square \beta$ genes vary from 2-9 in different individuals!!!,
- $1 \alpha$ gene ( $\alpha$ can combine with all $\beta$ products increasing number of APC molecules)
- DP (2 $\alpha, 2 \beta$ ) and DQ (2 $\alpha, 3 \beta$ )

\section*{Class I MHC Peptides}
- Peptides Presented Thru MHC I Are Endogenous Proteins
- As Few As 100 Peptide/MHC Complex Can Activate $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$
- Peptide Features
- size 8-10 a/a, preferably 9
- Peptides Bind MHC Due To Presence Of Specific a/a Found At The Ends Of Peptide. Ex. Glycine @ Position 2

\section*{Class II MHC Peptides}
- Peptides Presented Thru MHC II Are Exogenous
- Processed thru endocytic pathway
- Peptides Are Presented To Th
- Peptides Are 13-18 a/a Long
- Binding Is Due To Central 13 a/a
- Longer Peptides Can Still Bind MHC II
- Like A long hot dog
- MHC I Peptides Fit Exactly, Not The Case With MHC II Peptides

\section*{MHC Expression}
- Expression Is Regulated By Many Cytokines
- IFN $\alpha$, IFN $\beta$, IFN $\gamma$ and TNF Increase MHC expression
- Transcription Factors That Increase MHC gene Expression
- CIITA (Transactivator), RFX (Transactivator)
- Some Viruses Decrease MHC Expression - CMV, HBV, Ad12
- Reduction Of MHC May Allow For Immune System Evasion
