\section*{AUTOIMMUNITY Dr. Oyaro}

\section*{Learning objectives}
- Define autoimmunity
- Classifications of autoimmune diseases (local/systemic or generalized)
- Failure in Immunological tolerance and autoimmunity (central vs peripheral)
- Effects of autoimmunity
- Effector mechanisms of autoimmunity
- Examples of autoimmune diseases

\section*{Self/Non-self Discrimination}

Autoimmunity is a problem of self/non-self discrimination.

Autoimmunity
-5 \% to 7\% adult affected.
-Two third women.
- More than 40 human diseases autoimmune in origin.

\section*{Effects of autoimmunity}
1) Tissue destruction

Diabetes: CTLs destroy insulin-producing b-cells in pancreas
2) Antibodies block normal function

Myasthenia gravis: Ab binds acetylcholine receptors
3) Antibodies stimulate inappropriate function

Graves' disease: Ab binds TSH receptor
Mimics thyroid-stimulating hormone
Activates unregulated thyroid hormone production
4) Antigen-antibody complexes affect function Rheumatoid arthritis:
IgM specific for Fc portion of IgG
IgM-Ig ${ }_{\text {complexes }}$ deposited in joints inflammation

Effector mechanisms of autoimmune damage
> Specific components:
-Antibodies (majority)
- T cells
> Nonspecific components:
- Complement
-Phagocytes (PMN and macrophages)
- NK and other cells

\section*{What causes Autoimmunity?}
-Defect in clonal deletion(-ve selection).
-Exposure to Ag absent during ontogeny (immunoprivileged sites).
- Ex: Following Vasectomy.
-Decreased regulatory T cell function.
Whereased Th17 function.

\section*{What causes autoimmunity:}
-Infections---Molecular mimicry:
>E.g 1.Adenovirus type 2 mimics myelin basic protein.
-E.g 2 Cell wall M protein of Streptococci mimics myosin of heart causing rheumatic fever.
- M.tuberculosis can cause arthritis.

\section*{Autoimmune Diseases}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Disease & Organ(s) affected \\
\hline Insulin dependent diabetes melitus & Pancreas \\
\hline Immune thrombocytopenic purpura & Platelets \\
\hline Hemolytic anemia & Red blood cells \\
\hline Systemic lupus erythematosus & Kidneys, skin, joints / tendons' muscle, nerves, lungs, heart valves, Gl tract \\
\hline Grave's disease & Thyroid \\
\hline Pernicious anemia & Gl tract \\
\hline Myasthenia gravis & Acebylcholine receptors on muscle cells \\
\hline Ulcerative colitis & Gl tract \\
\hline Rheumatoid arthritis & Joints and other organs \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
