                                    <li>The disease is related to an inherent inability of the B cells to properly rearrange immunoglobulin heavy chain genes.</li>
                                    <li>Without proper gene rearrangement, it is impossible for the pre-B cell to differentiate into a mature B cell.</li>
                                    <li>The molecular basis is a defect in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK).</li>
                                    <li>Symptoms appear 5-6 months after birth</li>
                                    <li>Histologically, these patients have underdeveloped germinal centers in lymphoid organs;</li>
                                    <li>They have decreased levels of circulating B cells but have normal levels of pre-B cells in the bone marrow.</li>
                                    <li>Total serum immune globulins are reduced.</li>
                                    <li>Clinically, the patients have a plethora of infections most commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and encapsulated organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae and Streptocococcus pneumoniae.</li>
                                    <li>These can result in lethal pneumonias.</li>

                                    <li>Some have B-cell defects while others are affected by antibodies directed against B cells.</li>
                                    <li>A few have T-cell regulatory abnormalities.</li>

                                    <li>IgA deficiency is characterized by frequent respiratory infections, diarrhea, and hypersensitivity reactions.</li>
                                    <li>This disease is relatively frequent, affecting 1:700 individuals</li>
                                    <li>Most remain entirely asymptomatic.</li>
                                    <li>The underlying disorder is not well characterized but it appears that the maturation and terminal differentiation of IgAsecreting B cells is blocked.</li>
                                    <li>Rare patients also lack IgG2 and IgG4 as well as IgA and are more susceptible to infections.</li>
                                    <li>About one half of patients have IgE directed to IgA; these patients can have anaphylactic reactions to exogenous IgA if given experimentally or therapeutically.</li>

                                    <li>This is a rare, severe immune deficiency and is a classic example of T-cell deficiency.</li>
                                    <li>It occurs when the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches fail to develop properly, leading either to absent or severely hypoplastic thymus.</li>
                                    <li>Additionally, these patients frequently lack parathyroid glands and have malformation of the great vessels of the heart.</li>
                                    <li>Presentation of this defect may be calcium abnormalities early in life, secondary to the lack of parathyroid glands.</li>
                                    <li>Abnormal facies are common.</li>
                                    <li>This disease is developmental but has a genetic basis in that 22q11 is deleted.</li>
                                    <li>If there is some thymic tissue, the patients frequently will develop normal thymic responses by the age of five years.</li>
                                    <li>The types of opportunistic infections mimic children with AIDS.</li>
                                    <li>They include fungal, viral, protozoan infections and recurrent infections with intracellular bacteria.</li>

                                    <li>The term "combined" suggests that a portion of both the humoral (B cells) and cellmediated (T cells) immune system is affected.</li>
                                    <li>Errors may occur primarily within one system or the other.</li>
                                    <li>Several variants exist. All are rare.</li>
                                    <li>In all cases, the thymus is hypoplastic.</li>
                                    <li>The most common form is X-linked and results from a mutation in the gamma ($\gamma$) chain of a cytokine receptor family, resulting in aberrant responses to a variety of cytokines.</li>
                                    <li>The second common variant, adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA), affects T cells more than B cells. In this disease, there is an accumulation of adenosine and deoxyadenosine triphosphate which is toxic to lymphocytes and especially to T lymphocytes.</li>
                                    <li>The most common opportunistic pathogens seen in SCID are Candida sp. Pneumocystis carinii, and cytomegalovirus although any number of bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections can occur.</li>
                                    <li>Therapy is bone marrow transplantation.</li>
