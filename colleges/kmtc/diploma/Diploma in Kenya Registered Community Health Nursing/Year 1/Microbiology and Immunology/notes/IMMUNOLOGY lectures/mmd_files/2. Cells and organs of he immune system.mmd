\section*{IMMUNOLOGY}

\section*{Cells and Organs of the Immune System}

\section*{Organs}

\section*{Thymus}
- It develops in utero and for the $1^{\text {st }} 8$ years of childhood
- It undergoes involution at around puberty
- Its primary function is to 'educate' na√Øve T-lymphocytes to recognize self from non-self. This is a critical phase of immune system development. Absence of the thymus results in De George Syndrome and you succumb within two years

\section*{Bone Marrow}
- This is the location of hematopoiesis and therefore all immune cells are dependent directly on a viable bone marrow including T-lymphocytes
- If you don't have a bone marrow you will lack an immune system and is common with those who have undergone bone transplants

\section*{Lymph Nodes}
- Have a cortex, medulla in which are scattered T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells which perform the function of antigen presentation

\section*{Spleen}
- Its functions are known but in the immune response it functions rather like a large lymph node where it performs the function of destruction of aged or old immune cells.
- It can affect the quantity of immune cells.

\section*{Cells}

\section*{Neutophils}
- Form $40-70 \%$ of circulating white cells
- Are involved primarily in phagocytosis
- Their cell structure and organization are geared to short life span 5.4 days

\section*{Macrophages}
- Are larger cells
- Cytosolic organization permits them to survive for longer periods in tissues where they perform the function of phagocytosis
- They can produce cytokines (these are fast acting hormones that affect the cell to cell wall communication) which are usefully referred to as chemical mediators of immune responses

\section*{Eosinophils}
- Resemble neutrophils in structure but have a prominent place or function in allergic diseases (asthma, hypersensitivity reactions) and parasitic infestations

\section*{Basophils}
- Involved to a lesser degree to allergic reactions

\section*{Lymphocytes}
- Lifespan averaging 30 days
- We have three types of lymphocytes;
- T-Lymphocytes
- B-Lymphocytes
- Non T and Non B Lymphocytes (Natural Killer Cells)
- There are 6 subsets of T-lymphyctes
- t-helper cells (Th1 and Th2)
- Th3-T regulatory Cells
- Tc-Cytotoxic
- Tm (memory) Cells
- Tdth - Delayed hypersensitivy T-Lymphocytes

\section*{Th1}
- Is pro inflammatory

\section*{Th2}
- Is pro allergic

\section*{Th3}
- Regulate the immune response

\section*{Tc}

Destroy cells that are infected by viruses or intracellular bacteria such as Mycobacteria tuberculosis

Tm
- Are crucial in remembering past ( prior) exposures with microbes

\section*{Tdth}
- Involved in type iv hypersensitivity

One special T-lymphocyte subset is Tc. It has a similar function like natural killer cells but they must recognize the cells they destroy unlike the natural killer cells which are cell mediated

\section*{B-Lymphocytes}
- Are responsible for antibody production
- Antibodies used by B-Cells are specific for the antigen that resulted in their production

\section*{Definitions}

Immunogen: Can provoke an immune response (e.g. like slapping someone to provoke anger) while an
Antigen: Can provoke or initiate a response and react with products of that response in this case, an antibody

\section*{Natural Killer Cells}
- Are large granular lymphocytes
- Constitute $16 \%$ of the lymphocytes
- Functions include;

Destroy virally infected cells and tumor cells. They do not require recognition to kill such cells. This function is thus referred to as cell mediated cytotoxicity

\section*{Innate and Adaptive Systems}
- The immune system is divided into two; Innate and Adaptive System

\section*{Innate}
- One is born with it

\section*{Constituents}
- It involves;
- Physical barriers like skin, hair and mucosa
- Protective chemicals like sebum having triglycerides and other chemical components
- Various mucosa are lined by cilia e.g. respiratory tract
- It also involves chemical barriers having;
- Saliva
- Tears containing lysozymes and lactoferrin
- Nasal fluids
- Stomach acid with its low pH and enzymes
- The small intestines which have enzymes as well
- Genitor-urinary tract where mechanical action of flushing out of urine that sweeps aside or sweeps away bacteria and microbes
- Vaginal secretions having lactobacillus that prevents the over growth of opportunistic infections
- Phagocytes are also present i.e. neutrophils and macrophages
- Cytokines

\section*{Adaptive}
- This is basically an arm of the immune system that develops after birth normally around 9 months to 12 years wherein the body is exposed to various microbes and develops specific immune responses (B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes)

Question: Compare and Contrast between the Innate and Adaptive Immune Systems
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline & INNATE & ADAPTIVE \\
\hline Recognition & Has toll receptors that help recognition via neutrophils and macrophages and destroy microbes & T and B Lymphocytes have efficient recognition system - MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) and CDs \\
\hline Specificity & Is non specific & Is very specific \\
\hline Memory & Has no memory & Has memory \\
\hline Response & Is rapid & Is slow on the $1^{\text {st }}$ exposure but rapid thereafter \\
\hline Diversity of Response & Poor in innate, reads general info & Refined in adaptive; reads detailed \\
\hline Specialization & No specialization & Highly specialized \\
\hline & & \\
