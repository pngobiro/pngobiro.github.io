                        <p><strong>Q. Tolerance is often mentioned in light of transplantation. But mechanisms for inducing tolerance couldn't have evolved in anticipation of medical technology. So, what is the evolutionary advantage to tolerance?</strong></p>
                        <p>A. Tolerance (induction of anergy) may simply be a reflection of the mechanisms for negative selection against self-reacting B and T cells. Tolerance may be necessary so the immune system doesn't respond to "self"antigens to which it is not exposed during maturation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q. When does the body naturally contain tissues which are genetically dissimilar (besides the rearranged B and T cells leading to idiotopes on ab and TCR - see later).</strong></p>

                        <p>Hiding self antigen from the immune system - e.g. lens of the eye, developing sperm cells, to some extent a developing fetus in the uterus.</p>
                        <p>These are considered immune "privileged sites". (Note that this is not really "tolerance" since it is a passive process rather than an active one of inducing anergy or apoptosis in potential responding cells.)</p>
                        <p><strong>Q What is the basis for antigen competition that may occur when recent exposure to one antigen limits response to another.</strong></p>
                        <p>e.g. A mouse will develop a given response when infected with horse red blood cells (HRBC). However, if it is first primed a few days before by an injection of sheep RBC, the later response to HRBC is less than if the SRBC had not been injected.</p>
                        <p>Thus, prior exposure to an unrelated antigen and priming of an ab response reduced the subsequent ab response.</p>
                        <p>A This may result from interference by the first ag utilizing much of the APC capacity so the second ag is not as effectively presented and/or by the presence of down-regulating cytokines in the process of reducing the response to the first ag.</p>

                        <p>Circulating ab may invoke a sort of negative feedback mechanism. For example, circulating maternal ab interferes with childhood vaccinations in kids under a year -- the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella is not given until 1 year since it is not likely to elicit an immune response prior to that.</p>
                        <p><strong>Q Why?</strong></p>
                        <p>A One way this might occur is by the circulating ab binding to the ag and promoting clearance before any naive B cells can bind and become activated.</p>
                        <p>Consider the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A primary immune response to a carrier + hapten A generates circulating ab to hapten A.</li>
                            <li>Next, a carrier with hapten A and a second hapten B is introduced to elicit a secondary response to hapten A. If the earlier statement is true, you would expect the circulating ab to bind to the hapten A epitopes and assist clearance of the whole carrier + hapten A + hapten B complex before an immune response to the hapten B could be elicited.</li>
                            <li>However, it turns out that this doesn't happen and a response to the second hapten does develop.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, it is likely that circulating ab inhibits immune response in an epitope-specific fashion by competing for ag with the ab on naive B cells. If the circ. ab. binds all the epitopes, then the naive B cells, which are in low concentration, may never see the ag.</li>
                            <li>However, other exposed epitopes such as those of hapten B in the example could be responded to.</li>
