\section*{Secondary Immunodeficiencies}
- Acquired defect in one or more components of the immune system that manifests clinically as increased susceptibility to infections
- Increased susceptibility to common infectious agents \& opportunistic infections
- Symptoms vary depending on degree of immunosuppression \& inherent host susceptibility factors
- Withdrawal of the external condition causing immunodeficiency can result in restoration of immune function
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Predisposing factors & Specific factors \\
\hline Premature and newborn infants & Physiological immunodeficiency due to immaturity of the immune system \\
\hline Hereditary and metabolic diseases & Chromosome abnormalities (e.g. Down syndrome), uraemia, DM, malnutrition, vitamin and mineral deficiency, protein-loosing enteropathies, NS, SCD \\
\hline Immunosuppressive agents & Radiation, immunosuppressive drugs, corticosteroids \\
\hline Infectious & Congenital infections (rubella), viruses (measles, varicella, HIV, CMV, EBV), acute bacterial disease, severe mycobacterial or fungal disease \\
\hline Infiltrative and haematological & Histiocytosis, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, leukaemia, myeloma, aplastic anaemia \\
\hline Surgery and trauma & Burns, splenectomy \\
\hline Miscellaneous & SLE, chronic active hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, ageing \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Acquired Hypogammaglobulinaemia}
- Young adults
- Low but detectable levels of total immunoglobulin
- Normal T cell numbers and function in most cases
- Rx - immunoglobulin therapy
- No evidence of genetic transmission, unlike CVID

\section*{Agent-Induced Immunodeficiency}
- Exposure to any of a number of environmental agents that induce an immunosuppressed state
- Corticosteroids - inhibition of T cell activation, B cell maturation \& cytokine synthesis; lymphopaenia
- Immunosuppressive \& cytotoxic drugs (AZA, MTX, 6-MP, cyclophosphamide), Radiotherapy - bone marrow suppression
- Cyclosporine - inhibits T cell signalling
- Biologics e.g. rituximab

\section*{Extremes of age}
- The very young and the very old
- Neonates, especially premature babies can be very susceptible to infection,
- Degree of prematurity linked to the degree of immune dysfunction
- All the basic immune components are in place in a full-term healthy newborn, but the complete range of innate and adaptive immune functions take some time to mature

\section*{Malnutrition}
- Affects both innate and adaptive immunity
- Low protein-calorie diets (hypoproteinemia) associated with depressed T-cell number \& function; deleterious B cell effects may take longer to appear
- Micronutrient insufficiency (zinc, ascorbic acid) also contributes to immunodeficiency
- Vitamin D deficiency linked to an inhibition in the ability of macrophages to act against intracellular pathogens e.g. M.tuberculosis

\section*{Medical states}
- Splenectomy
- Antibody deficiency \& susceptibility to infections with encapsulated bacteria, malaria, salmonellosis
- Poor nutrition; surgery/trauma/ICU
- Protein-loosing states
- Renal disease

Immunology of HIV Infection

\section*{HIV/AIDS}
- HIV causes AIDS
- AIDS first recognized as opportunistic infections in a cluster of individuals on both coasts of the US in June 1981
- Displayed unusual infections e.g. PJP, previously limited to individuals taking immunosuppressive drugs; KS, a rare skin tumour, etc.
- Evaluation revealed a deficiency in cell-mediated immune responses and a significant decrease in the CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cell subpopulation ( $T_{H}$ cells)

\section*{HIV/AIDS}
- Majority of the patients were homosexual males
- Others thought to be at risk at that time:
- Promiscuous heterosexual individuals of either sex and their partners
- Recipients of blood \& blood products prior to 1985
- Infants born to HIV-infected mothers

\section*{Adult HIV Prevalence, 2015}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-12.jpg?height=1307&width=2382&top_left_y=333&top_left_x=497)

\section*{HIV/AIDS Epidemic}
- Approximately 36.7 million people living with HIV at the end of 2016; 2.1 million were children ( $<15 \mathrm{yr}$ old)
- 1.8 million new infections
- 1 million AIDS-related deaths
- 35 million deaths since the start of the epidemic

\section*{HIV/AIDS Epidemic}
- Kenya - $4{ }^{\text {th }}$ largest epidemic (2016)
- 1.6 million people living with HIV
- 5.4\% adult HIV prevalence
- 62,000 new infections
- 36,000 people died from AIDS-related deaths (64,000 in 2010)
- 64\% adults with HIV on ART, 65\% children

\section*{Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1)}
- Retrovirus of the lentivirus genus (displays long incubation periods)
- Characterized by Luc Montagnier in Paris \& Robert Gallo in Bethesda, Maryland, USA (1983)
- RNA virus; reverse-transcribed to DNA when the virus enters a cells, by the virally coded reverse transcriptase enzyme
- This copy of DNA is called a provirus; it's integrated into the cell genome and replicated along with the cell DNA
- When the provirus is expressed to form new virions (viral particles), the cell lyses

\section*{HIV-1}
- Alternatively, the provirus may remain latent in the cell until some regulatory signal starts the expression process
- HIV-2 isolated from AIDS sufferers in Africa about 5 years after the discovery of HIV-1
- HIV-2 prevalence limited mostly to West Africa; disease progresses much more slowly

\section*{Structure of HIV}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-17.jpg?height=1234&width=1464&top_left_y=391&top_left_x=289)
- Lipid envelope derives from the host cell; contains some host cell membrane proteins e.g. MHC I \& II
- Env studded by 2 viral glycoproteins, gp120 \& gp41 which are important for the infection process
- Within the env is the viral matrix p17 and the core/nucleocapsid (p24)
- Genome consists of 2 copies of ssRNA, associated with 2 molecules of RT (p64), a protease (p10) and and integrase (p32) - viral enzymes

\section*{Transmission}
- Intimate contact with body fluids
- Sexual contact (75\%)
- Unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse
- Receipt of infected blood or blood products
- Transfusions, contaminated needles \& syringes
- Perinatal transmission HIV-infected mothers to their infants
- During labour and delivery (in utero)
- Breast milk

\section*{Spread}
- Direct infection of activated but resting memory CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells present within vaginal mucosa is the likely primary initial source in the FGT (the most studied location)
- Dendritic cells take up the virus (may not become infected) \& transport intact infectious virus to T cells
- Free virus can also squeeze between epithelial cells or gain access through microabrasions
- Whether free of cell-associated, the virus migrates through the submucosa to the draining lymph node, where the adaptive immune response can be initiated (\& further spread)

\section*{HIV-1 Life Cycle}
- Infects cells that carry the CD4 antigen - $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$ cells, monocytes, macrophages
- High-affinity interaction between gp120 \& CD4
- Expression of a co-receptor required for viral entry - CCR5 or CXCR4 (chemokine receptors)
- Infection of a T cell assisted by CXCR4, while CCR5 is the preferred coreceptor for viral entry into monocytes and macrophages
- RNA genome of the virus reverse transcribed \& a complementary DNA (cDNA) copy integrates into the host genome

\section*{HIV-1 Life Cycle}
- The integrated provirus is transcribed
- The various viral RNA messages are spliced \& translated into proteins
- These initial viral proteins are cleaved by the virally encoded protease into forms that make up the nuclear capsid in a mature infectious viral particle
- Viral expression leads to newly formed virions that bud from the surface of the infected cell, often causing cell lysis
- HIV-1 can also become latent or remain unexpressed for long periods of time in an infected cell

(1) HIV gp120 binds to CD4 on target cell.
(2) HIV gp41 binds to a chemokine receptor (CXCR4 or CCR5) and fuses with the target cell membrane.
(3) Nucleocapsid containing viral genome and enzymes enters cells.
4) Viral genome and enzymes are released following removal of core proteins.
(5) Viral reverse transcriptase catalyzes reverse transcription of ssRNA, forming RNA-DNA hybrids.
(6) Original RNA template is partially degraded by ribonuclease H, followed by synthesis of second DNA strand to yield HIV dsDNA.
(7) The viral dsDNA is then translocated to the nucleus and integrated into the host chromosomal DNA by the viral integrase enzyme.

(1) Transcription factors stimulate transcription of proviral DNA into genomic ssRNA and, after processing, several mRNAs.
(2) Viral RNA is exported to cytoplasm.

3a. Host-cell ribosomes catalyze synthesis of viral precursor proteins.
(3b) Viral protease cleaves precursors into viral proteins.
4) HIV ssRNA and proteins assemble beneath the host-cell membrane, into which gp41 and gp120 are inserted.

5a The membrane buds out, forming the viral envelope.
(5b) Released viral particles complete maturation; incorporated precursor proteins are cleaved by viral protease present in viral particles.

\section*{Pathophysiology and Clinical Course}
- Gradual impairment of immune function \& progression to AIDS
- Isolation of HIV-1 \& its growth in culture allowed purification of viral proteins \& development of tests for detection infection
- ELISA - detection of Abs against HIV-1 proteins e.g. gag p24, one of the most immunogenic HIV proteins
- Antibodies appear in serum of infected individuals within 6 12 weeks after exposure, but can take up to 6 months to appear - seroconversion

\section*{Phases of HIV infection}
- 3 phases which occur over 8 to 12 years
- Acute/primary infection phase
- No detectable anti-HIV-1 antibodies
- Flu-like symptoms (fever, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, malaise, headache) approximately 2 to 4 weeks after exposure
- High rate of viral replication; viral load (number of virions) can be quite high in blood and other body fluids
- Decreasing amount of CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells
- After a few weeks the immune system catches up controlling viral replication where it remains for several years

\section*{Phases of HIV infection}
- Chronic asymptomatic phase/Latency
- No signs or symptoms of illness
- This phase lasts 10 years on average
- Gradual decline in CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells
- Driven by an immune response involving antibodies \& cytotoxic CD8 ${ }^{+}$T cells that keep viral replication in check \& drive down the viral load
- Viral load can be measured by PCR assays for viral RNA

\section*{Phases of HIV infection}
- AIDS
- Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome - profound deficiency in T cell immunity
- Greatly diminished numbers of CD4+ T cells ( $<200 \mathrm{cells} / \mu \mathrm{l}$ of blood)
- Opportunistic infections - C.albicans, PJP, TB etc
- Without ART this phase can lead to death within 2 to 3 years

\section*{HIV, CD4 Decline, Complications}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-36.jpg?height=1570&width=2548&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=376)

\section*{Mechanism of Progression to AIDS}
- Understanding how the immune system holds HIV-1 in check during the asymptomatic phase could aid in the design of effective therapeutic \& preventive strategies
- Long-term nonprogressors (infected individuals who remain asymptomatic for very long periods without treatment) are the subject of intense study
- Also high-risk populations who remain seronegative despite known \& repeated exposure e.g. CSWs
- Discovery of CCR5 deletion
- Presence of strong CD8+ T cell responses
- HLA-associated influences on disease susceptibility

\section*{Mechanism of progression to AIDS}
- Plasma viral loads remain fairly stable throughout the period of chronic HIV infection
- LN biopsies show high levels of infected cells at all stages of infection, with effacement, long before plasma viral load increases above the steady-state level
- Lymphoid tissue in the GI tract also depleted - thought to be the main site of HIV-1 replication and CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cell depletion
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-39.jpg?height=1349&width=2931&top_left_y=108&top_left_x=184)

2. Kuby Immunology, $7^{\text {th }}$ edition

\section*{Immunological Abnormalities in HIV/AIDS}
- Progressive depletion of CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells
- Impaired T-cell immunity (even when CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells are present in normal numbers)
- Impaired mononuclear macrophage function
- Impaired production of specific antibody despite a polyclonal increase in serum immunoglobulins that lack antibody functions

\section*{HIV infection leads to a state of generalized immune activation}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-41.jpg?height=1383&width=1829&top_left_y=389&top_left_x=761)

\section*{$\mathrm{CD}^{+}{ }^{+}$T Cell Depletion}
- Direct viral infection \& destruction
- Half-life of an actively infected $\mathrm{CD} 4^{+}$T cell is less than 1.5 days
- Smaller numbers of CD4 ${ }^{+}$T cells become infected but do not actively replicate virus; these latently infected cells persist for long periods
- $\mathrm{CD}^{+}$T cell count (and viral load) are the primary focus of follow-up testing in HIV-infected individuals

\section*{Other Immunologic Consequences}
- Decrease or absence of delayed type hypersensitivity
- Decreased serum immunoglobulins (especially IgG \& IgA)
- Impaired cellular responses to antigens
- The HIV-infected individual loses the ability to mount T-cell responses in a predictable sequence
- Responses to specific recall antigens (e.g. influenza virus) are lost first
- Then response to alloantigens declines
- Finally mitogenic responses to stimuli disappear
- Innate responses also impacted, including NK \& dendritic cell functions

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Stage of Infection & Typical abnormalities observed \\
\hline & LYMPH NODE STRUCTURE \\
\hline Early & Infection and destruction of dendritic cells; some structural disruption, especially to gastrointestinal tractassociated lymphoid tissues \\
\hline Late & Extensive damage and tissue necrosis; loss of follicular dendritic cells and germinal centers; inability to trap antigens or support activation of T and B cells \\
\hline & T HELPER ( $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$ ) CELLS \\
\hline Early & Depletion of CD4 ${ }^{+} \mathrm{T}$ cells, especially in the gut ( $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ main targets); loss of in vitro proliferative response to specific antigen \\
\hline Late & Further decrease in $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$-cell numbers and corresponding helper activities; no response to T -cell mitogens or alloantigens \\
\hline

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Stage of Infection & Typical abnormalities observed \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{ANTIBODY PRODUCTION} \\
\hline Early & Enhanced nonspecific IgG and IgA production but reduced IgM synthesis \\

\hline Late & Elimination of DTH response; complete absence of skin-test reactivity \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{T CYTOTOXIC (T/) CELLS} \\
\hline Early & Normal reactivity \\
\hline Late & Reduction but not elimination of CTL activity due to impaired ability to generate CTLs from $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$ cells \\

\section*{Therapeutic targets to inhibit HIV replication}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_f1dc6931b2e709d97ac8g-46.jpg?height=1490&width=1774&top_left_y=114&top_left_x=1333)

\section*{Antiretroviral Therapy}
- HAART/cART - use of 3 or more anti-HIV drugs from different classes, to overcome the ability of the virus to rapidly produce drug resistant mutants
- In many cases, cART has lowered plasma viral loads to undetectable levels
- Virus may persist in sites that are not readily penetrated by ART, e.g. brain, thereby making it difficult to eradicate all virus from an infected individual and cure AIDS

\section*{A vaccine may be the only way to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic}
- Prevent infection and/or progression to disease
- Challenges to vaccine development
- Rapid mutation of HIV-1 (many variants)
- Neutralizing antibodies do not necessarily inhibit viral spread
- Limited animal models
