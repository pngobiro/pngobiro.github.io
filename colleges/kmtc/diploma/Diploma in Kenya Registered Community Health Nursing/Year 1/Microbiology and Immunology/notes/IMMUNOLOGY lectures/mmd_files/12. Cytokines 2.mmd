\section*{CYTOKINES AND INTERFERONS.}

\section*{Learning objectives:}
- Classification and naming of cytokines.
- Properties and function of cytokines.
- Mode of action in immune response and regulation.
- Clinical applications of cytokines

\section*{What are Cytokines?}
- Low-molecular-weight regulatory proteins secreted by white blood cells and various other cells in response to a number of stimuli.
- Soluble proteins secreted by one cell that can alter the behaviour or properties of the same cell or of another cell.

\section*{What are Cytokines ?}
- Secreted molecules that regulate the intensity and duration of the immune response by exerting a variety of effects on lymphocytes and other immune cells
- Cytokines = messengers of the immune system, just as hormones = messengers of the endocrine system

\section*{Classification of cytokines.}
- classified into four groups based on structure:
- Haematopoietin family ( e.g. IL-2, IL-4)
- Inteferon family (e.g. interferon-beta)
- Tumor necrosis factor family (e.g. TNF-alpha) and
- Chemokine family (e.g., IL-8, MCP-1)

\section*{Cytokines by any other name....}

Lymphokines - cytokines secreted by lymphocytes

Monokines - cytokines secreted by monocytes/macrophages

Interleukins - secreted by leukocytes, act on leukocytes

Chemokines - cytokines that are chemotactic and play important roles in inflammation

Interferons, CSFs, tumor necrosis factors.

\section*{Properties of Cytokines}
- autocrine (binds receptors on the same cell that secreted the cytokine),
- paracrine (binds to receptors on a nearby cell, a variation on paracrine is "juxtacrine" meaning binds a neighboring cell) or in some cases,
- endocrine fashion (binds to receptors on distant target cell).
- Pleiotropy: a cytokine may have different biological effects on different target cell.
- Redundancy: two or more cytokines may have the same effect on a target cell (e.g. IL2 and IL-15).
- Synergy: additive effect of cytokines used
- Antagonism: negate effect of another cytokine.
- cascade effect: stimulate other cytokines, forming cytokine networks.

\section*{Autocrine property of cytokines}

Cytokines bind to specific receptors on target cell membranes, trigger signal-transduction pathways and alter gene expression

\section*{Redundancy}
- Different cytokines can have the same effect (redundancy- e.g., IL-2 and IL-15)

\section*{Cytokines as intercellular messenger molecules}
1. Development of cellular \& humoral responses
1. Induction of inflammatory responses
2. Regulation of hematopoiesis
3. Cellular proliferation and differentiation
4. Growth inhibition, apoptosis
5. Wound healing
- Cytokines, despite being antigen nonspecific:
regulate the intensity and duration of the inflammatory/immune response;

\section*{by stimulating/inhibiting:}
- activation,
- proliferation and/or differentiation and
- migration of multiple cell types and
-by regulating the synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulins.

\section*{How do nonspecific cytokines maintain the specificity of the immune response?}
- Limited production of the cytokine: often cytokines are only made following some stimulus, for example
- a macrophage phagocytosing bacteria,
-a T cell engaging the T cell antigen receptor, or
- some other cell-cell or pathogen-cell contacts.
- Limited radius of effectiveness, i.e., only those cells in physical contact with or in the immediate vicinity of the cytokine-secreting cell will be exposed to an effective concentration of the cytokine.
- Short half lives mean that cytokines can only act for a limited period of time.
- Regulation of cytokine receptor expression. For example, only lymphocytes which have interacted with antigen may express particular cytokine receptors.
- Antagonism, includes shedding receptors which may occupy a cytokine in solution preventing it from binding another receptor. Examples of shed receptors becoming antagonists are IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, -6, and -7, IFN- $\alpha$, - $\gamma$, TNF- $\beta$, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF).

\section*{Cytokine secretion by Th1 and Th2 cells}
- $\mathrm{T}_{\text {н }}$ cells (CD4+ lymphocytes) can be divided into Th1 and Th2 subsets, each with distinct cytokine secretion profiles.
- The Th1 subset is involved in response to intracellular pathogens including the production of opsonizing antibodies.
- Th1 cytokines promote the differentiation of CD8+ cells to become cytotoxic
- The Th2 subset mediates the responses to extra cellular pathogens, including
- eosinophil activation and promoting production of $\operatorname{lgM}$ and $\lg \mathrm{E}$ and
- non-complement-activating IgG isotypes, much of which contributes to allergic reactions.
- Cytokines produced by Th1 and Th2 cells exhibit cross-regulation.
-IFN-y inhibits Th2 proliferation while IL-10 indirectly (by acting on antigen presenting cells) downregulates IFN-Y and IL-2 production by Th1 cells (required for Th1 proliferation).
-IL-4 directly antagonizes IFN-ү activity.

\section*{T cells}
