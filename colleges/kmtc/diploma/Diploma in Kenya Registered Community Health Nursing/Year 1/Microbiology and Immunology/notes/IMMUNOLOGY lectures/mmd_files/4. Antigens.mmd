ANTIGENS: IMMUNOGENICITY AND ANTIGENICITY

ANTIGENS

\section*{ANTIGEN: DEFINITION AND ESSENTIAL FEATURES}

\section*{Antigen}
- A substance that can induce an immune response.
- Essential features of antigens
- It is essential that molecules first be recognized as foreign if they are to stimulate the immune system.
- Processing that antigens must undergo places physical and chemical restrictions on the types of foreign molecules that can stimulate the immune system.
- Most effective antigens are:
- Large
- Rigid.
- Chemically complex. "Molecules that are not totally chemically inert".

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}

Antigenicity: The ability of a molecule to be recognized by antibodies or lymphocytes.
- Molecular size: Large molecules are better antigens then small molecules.
- Very small molecules may, however, bind to large proteins, and the resulting complexes may provoke an immune response
- Complexity: The more complex an antigen, the better.
- Starch and other simple repetitive polysaccharides are poor antigens.
- Complex bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are good antigens.
- Complex proteins are better antigens than large repeating polymers such as lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids.

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}

Structural stability:
- In order to recognize a molecule as a foreign the immune system must recognize its shape.
- Highly flexible molecules that have no fixed shape are poor antigens, e.g. gelatine (protein with structural instability). It is poor antigen unless it is stabilized by incorporation of tyrosine or tryptophan molecules.
- Flagellin, major protein of bacterial flagella, is structurally unstable weak antigen

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}
- Degradability:
- Not all foreign molecules are capable of stimulating an immune response. Stainless steel pins and plastic joints are implanted in the body without triggering an immune response.
- The lack of antigenicity of the large, inert organic polymers is due to their molecular uniformity and their inertness.
- Foreign molecules that are unstable and destroyed very rapidly may not provide sufficient antigen to stimulate an immune response.

\section*{FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ANTIGENICITY}
- Foreignness:
- The suppression of cells that react with normal body components (self antigens) occur because these cells are exposed to self-antigen when immature (usually early in foetal life) and consequently eliminated (selectively killed or otherwise suppressed).
- Trauma testes (or vasectomy) Anti-sperm antibodies.
- Extensive cell destruction (heart attack) $\qquad$ anti-mitochondrial antibodies.

\section*{AUTOANTIGENS:}
- Antigens that induce autoimmunity are called autoantigens.
- Autoantigens $\longrightarrow$ Autoimmune responses $\longrightarrow$ Autoantibodies.
- Hormones (thyroglobulin).
- Structural components (basement membranes).
- Complex lipids (myelin).
- Intracellular components (mitochondrial proteins).
- Nucleic acids.
- Nucleoproteins.
- Cell surface proteins.

\section*{CHARACTERISTICS OF ANTIGENS}
- Any molecule that is immunogenic must also be antigenic, but the reverse need to be true.
- Proteins are the best antigens because of:
- Molecular size.
- Structural complexity.
- Polysaccharides (starch and glycogen) are not good antigens:
- Readily degraded within cells.
- Lipids are poor antigens:
- Relative simplicity.
- Structural instability.
- Rapid metabolism

\section*{ANTIGENS TYPES}

\section*{- Non microbial antigens :}
- Snake venoms.
- Mosquito bite.
- Pollen grains.
- Serum proteins.
- Milk and food proteins (Macromolecules of diet).
- Antibody molecules.
- Histocompatibility antigens (Organ grafts).

\section*{- Bacterial antigens}
- Capsule (K-antigen) capsular antigen.
- Cell wall (O-antigen) somatic antigen.
- Flagellum (H-antigen) flagellar antigen.
- Pili (F-antigen)

\section*{- Viral antigens}
- The capsid proteins are good antigens, highly capable of provoking antibodies.

\section*{CELL SURFACE ANTIGENS}
- Histocompatibility antigens: on WBCs $\longrightarrow$ graft rejection.
- Clusters of Differentiation (CD):
- Lymphocytes possess large number of different surface proteins each of which possesses many distinct epitopes.
- CD: denotes a protein of specific function.
- CD4 is associated with cells that help immune response.
- CD8 is found on cells that suppress immune response
