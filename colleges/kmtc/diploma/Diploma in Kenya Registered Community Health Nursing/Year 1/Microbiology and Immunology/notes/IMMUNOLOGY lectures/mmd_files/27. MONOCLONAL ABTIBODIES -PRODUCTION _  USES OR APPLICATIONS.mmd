\section*{Definitions}
$$\begin{aligned}
\text { Fab }= & \text { Fragment, antigen binding } \\
& \text { Fc }=\text { Fragment, crystalline }
\end{aligned}$$

The Fc fragment specifies other biological • activities of the molecule. For example, the

Fc fragment may determine whether the antibody simply prevents signaling through a receptor, or alternatively, causes the cell's destruction through complement .fixation or targeting immune effector cells

\section*{Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb)}

\section*{Monoclonal antibodies are:}
monospecific antibodies that are identical because they are produced by one type of immune cell (a single parent cell).
* Antibodies produced from a single clone of B cells.
* Produced by fusing a B cell secreting the desired antibody with a myeloma cell capable of growing indefinitely in tissue culture.

Monoclonal antibodies all have identical antigen-binding sites. i.e. they all bind to the same epitope with the same affinity.
* They are all of the same antibody class (isotype).

\section*{Polyclonal antibodies}
- are a mixture of antibodies with different antigen binding sites that may bind to different epitopes or antigens with varying affinities.
- They may be of different antibody classes.
- The serum obtained from an immunized animal is referred to as a polyclonal antiserum.

\section*{Hybridoma}
are cells that have been engineered to produce a desired antibody in large amounts.
\$ To produce monoclonal antibodies, B-cells are removed from the spleen of an animal that has been challenged with the relevant antigen
\$ These B-cells are then fused with myeloma tumor cells that can grow indefinitely in culture
\$ This fusion is performed by making the cell membranes more permeable.
* The fused hybrid cells (hybridomas), being cancer cells, will multiply rapidly and indefinitely and will produce large amounts of the desired antibodies

\section*{Practical steps in monoclonal antibody production:}
1) Immunize animal
2) Isolate spleen cells (containing antibody-producing B cells)
3) Fuse spleen cells with myeloma cells (e.g. using PEG - polyethylene glycol)
4) Allow unfused B cells to die
5) Add aminopterin to culture to kill unfused myeloma cells
6) Clone remaining cells (place 1 cell/well and allow each cell to grow into a clone of cells)
7) Screen supernatant of each clone for presence of the desired antibody.
8) Grow the chosen clone of cells in tissue culture indefinitely.
9) Harvest antibody from the culture supernatant.

\section*{Monoclonal Antibody Production}

\section*{Hybridoma Selection "The "HAT Trick}

Myeloma cells lack certain enzymes so that they can not use hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine(HAT medium) as a source for nucleic acid biosynthesis and will die in culture.
$\square$ Only B cells that have fused with the engineered myeloma cells will survive in culture when grown in HAT medium.

\section*{Purification of monoclonal Antibodies}

Cotaminants:
\$ Media components: hormones, growth factors, transferrins......etc
* Viral, bacterial,endotoxins...etc

Methods of purification:
1. Filteration for larger particles
2. Ultrafilteration esp. for low concentration samples
3. Chromatography:
- Ion exchange chromatography (either cation or anion) can be used (Most impurities are usually anions)
- Size exclusion chromatography

\section*{Recombinant monoclonal antibodies}
- The term recombinant and especially recombinant DNA refers to an artificial method of producing DNA (synthetic DNA and proteins).
- Recombinant DNA is produced through the addition of relevant DNA into an existing organismal genome, such as the plasmid of bacteria
- Recombinant antibody engineering involves the use of viruses or yeast to create antibodies, rather than mice.
- A segment of DNA is recombined (recombinant) with the original DNA of the bacteria, these genetically modified bacteria rapidly reproduce and by that reproduce the DNA segment that was recombined with the original genome.

\section*{Uses of monoclonal Abs}

Measuring protein and drug levels in serum
Typing tissue and blood
Identifying infectious agents
Identifying clusters of differentiation (CDs) for classification and follow-up therapy of leukemias and lymphomas
Identifying tumor metastasis
Identifying and quantifying hormones
Immunoaffinity Purification

\section*{Applications of Monoclonal Antibodies}
- Diagnostic Applications
- Therapeutic Applications

Transplant rejection
Cardiovascular disease
Cancer
Infectious Diseases
Inflammatory disease
- Clinical Applications

Purification of drugs, Imaging the target
- Future Applications

Fight against Bioterrorism

\section*{Diagnostic Applications (Immuno-ctochemistry)}
1. Tissues and tumors can be classified based on their expression of certain defined markers: e.g. Prostate specific antigen(PSA)
2. Classification of tissues and tumors
3. Distinguishing morphologically similar lesions, like mesothelioma and adenocarcinoma
4. Detecting small quantities of metastatic cancer and MDR

\section*{Therapeutic Applications}

One possible treatment for cancer involves monoclonal antibodies that bind only to cancer cell-specific antigens and induce an immunological response against cancer cells.
Three mechanisms responsible for the cancer treatment:
1.mAbs act directely when binding to a cancer specific antigens and induce immunological response to cancer cells(apoptosis, inhibiting growth)
2.mAbs can be modified for delivery of a toxin, radioisotope, cytokine or other active conjugates.
3.it is also possible to design bispecific antibodies that can bind with their Fab regions both to target antigen and to an effector cell

\section*{Naked' Monoclonal' Antibodies}

Naked' means these antibodies are not‘ • .fused to a toxin
Naked Monoclonal antibodies can kill cells • via a variety of mechanisms, including:
Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), Complement-Dependent
Cytotoxicity (CDC), and direct induction of .apoptosis
However, the precise clinical mechanisms often remain uncertain

\title{
Nomenclature of Therapeutic Antibodies
}

\section*{Terminate the name in -ximab for chimeric antibodies and -umab for .humanized antibodies}

\section*{Rituximab (Rituxan)}

Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that .targets the CD20 B-cell antigen
This antigen is expressed on $90 \%$ of B-cell neoplasms The precise biological functions of CD20 are uncertain, but the antibody is believed to function by flagging the B-cells for destruction by the body's own immune .system, including ADCC, CDC, and apoptosis
This antibody thus leads to the elimination of all Bcells from the body (including cancerous ones), allowing new, healthy B-cells to be produced from .lymphoid stem cells
