\section*{Introduction}
- The term parasite encompasses a vast number of protozoan and helminthic organisms (worms).
- Protozoans are unicellular eukaryotes that usually live and multiply within host cells for at least part of their life cycle,
- Helminths are multicellular organisms that can be quite large and have the ability to live and reproduce outside their human host.
Parasite-Is an organism (unicellular/multicellular) that depends on one or more organisms (host/hosts) to completes part or whole of its life cycle

\title{
Mechanisms of defense against parasites
}

\section*{Mehanisms of innate immunity}

Protozoa and helmints - mostly resistant
- complement and phagocytosis (protozoa)
- eosinophils and macrophages (helmints)

\section*{Immune responses to Protozoan parasites.}
1. Innate immune responses.
1. Extracellular protozoa eliminated -phagocytosis \& complement activation
2. Acquired immune responses
1. T cell responses.

ㅁ. Extracellular protozoa - $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 2$ cytokines - ab production.
ㅁ Intracellular protozoa - $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$ (cytotoxic lymphocytes) kill infected cells.
${ }^{0} \quad \mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{H}} 1$ cytokines activate macrophages \& $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{C}}$.
2. Antibody + Complement, e.g. lysis of blood dwelling trypanosomes.

\section*{Mechanisms of defense against parasites}

\section*{Mehanisms of adaptive immunity}

Protozoa
$\mathcal{B}$-cells, $C D 4^{+} \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 1$ and $C D 8^{+} \mathcal{T}$ cells
- antibodies (B-cells) - Entamoeba sp., Plasmodium sp.
-IFN-y production and macrophage stimulation (CD4+ $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 1$ cells) - Leishmania sp.
- cytotoxicity (CD8+ $\mathcal{T}$ cells)-Plasmodium sp.

Helmints
$\mathcal{B}$-cells and $C D 4^{+} \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}_{1}} 2$ cells
- stimulation of B-cells to produce IgE (IL-4)
- stimulation of eosinophils (IL-5 and IgE)
- degranulation of mast cells (IgE)
2. Note
- Activated macrophages effective against intracellular protozoa, e.g. Leishmania, Toxoplasma, Trypanosoma cruzi.
- CD8+ cytotoxic T cells kill parasite infected host cells, e.g. Plasmodium infected liver cell.

\section*{Acquired immune responses.}
1. Antibody responses.

Extracellular protozoa
1. opsonization,
2. complement activation
3. Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC).

Intracellular protozoa
4. Neutralisation: e.g. neutralising ab prevents malaria sporozoites entering liver cells.

\section*{Immune responses to helminth infections.}
- Most extracellular
- Size: too large for phagocytosis.
- Some gastrointestinal nematodes - host develops inflammation \& hypersensitivity.
- Eosinophils \& IgE initiate inflammatory response in intestine / lungs.
- Histamine elicited - similar to allergic reactions.

\section*{Immune responses to helminth infections.}
1. Acute response
1. IgE \& eosinophil mediated systemic inflammation = worm expulsion.
2. Chronic exposure = chronic inflammation:
1. DTH, Th1 / activated macrophages granulomas.
2. Th2 / B cell responses increase lgE, mast cells \& eosinophils = inflammation.

\section*{Immune responses to helminth infections.}
- Helminths induce Th2 responses - IL-4, IL5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-13 \& eosinophils \& ab (IgE).
- Characteristic ADCC reactions, i.e. killer cells directed against parasite by specific ab.
- E.g. Eosinophil killing of parasite larvae by IgE.

\section*{Injurious effect of immune response}
- granuloma formation and fibrosis (Schistosoma sp.)
- immune complex formation (Plasmodium sp.)

\section*{Mechanisms of immune evasion}
- existence of different forms/stages (Plasmodium sp...)
- alteration of surface antigens (Irypanosoma sp....)
- complement resistance (many parasites)
- "concealing" - cysts (Toxoplasma sp.), residence in gut (intestinal parasites)

\section*{Mechanisms of Immune evasion by Parasites}

1- Sequestration of Parasite
2-Parasite movement
4- Antigenic modification: variation, mimicry , shedding
5-Inhibition of Immune Factors (cytokines)
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_1f48b5e95db49283fef6g-15.jpg?height=609&width=758&top_left_y=652&top_left_x=2466)

6- Immunosuppression
7- Size (large)

\section*{Immunopathology}
- Pathological effect of the immune response
- Result of inappropriate and excessive host response
- May be an inevitable outcome of persistent parasitic infection
- Variability in clinical outcome - from asymptomatic disease to fatal outcome

\section*{Examples:}

1- Allergic reactions (type 1 hypersensitivity)
2- Eosinophilic pneumonia
3- Autoimmune reactions
4-Deposition of immune complex (type 3 hypersensitivity reaction)
5- Granuloma formation (delayed type hypersensitivity)
6-Immunosuppression:

\section*{Parasite vaccine strategies}
- There is as yet no safe uniformly effective vaccine against any human parasitic infection
* Complexity of the life cycle of the parasite makes the stage to be chosen for vaccine preparation difficult.
* Difficulty of identification and isolation of protective antigen to be used as vaccine.
* Possibility of inducing immunopathological lesions in response to the vaccine.
* Parasites may evade the immunity produced by the vaccine.
* Vaccine preparation may not be equally effective.

\section*{Fungi}
- extracellular agents
(some survive phagocytosis)
- yeast (unicelfular)
- molds (multicelfular)
- local and systemic mycoses
- most systemic infection - opportunistic
some endemic (dimorphic fungi)
- risk factor - immunodeficiency (neutropenia)

\section*{Fungi as Infectious Agents}
- Molds and yeasts are widely distributed in air, dust, fomites and normal flora.
- Humans are relatively resistant.
- Fungi are relatively nonpathogenic.
- Of the 100,000 fungal species, only 300 have been linked to disease in animals.
- Fungi are the most common plant pathogens.
- Human mycoses are caused by true fungal pathogens and opportunistic pathogens.
- True or primary fungal pathogen can invade and grow in a healthy, noncompromised host.
- Most striking adaptation to survival and growth in the human host is the ability to switch from hyphal cells to yeast cells.
- Thermal dimorphism - grow as molds at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and as yeasts at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\section*{Emerging Fungal Pathogens}
- Opportunistic fungal pathogen has little or no virulence; host defenses must be impaired.
- Vary from superficial and colonization to potentially fatal systemic disease
- An emerging medical concern; account for 10\% of all nosocomial infections
- Dermatophytes may be undergoing transformation into true pathogens.

\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{TABLE 22.3} \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Common Opportunistic Fungi and Conditions That Predispose Patients to Them} \\
\hline Pathogen & Associated with \\
\hline Candida & Antibiotic therapy, catheters, diabetes, corticosteroids, ${ }^{\star}$ immunosuppression** \\
\hline Aspergillus & Leukemia, corticosteroids, tuberculosis, immunosuppression, IV drug abuse \\
\hline Cryptococcus & Diabetes, tuberculosis, cancer, corticosteroids, immunosuppression \\
\hline Zygomycota Species & Diabetes, cancer, corticosteroids, IV therapy, third-degree burns \\
\hline \multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\begin{tabular}{l}
* Antiinflammatory drugs are often given for chronic lung diseases and to transplant patients to prevent rejection. \\
$\star \star$ Includes AIDS, and genetic conditions that compromise host defenses.
\end{tabular}} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Epidemiology of the Mycoses}
- Most fungal pathogens do not require a host to complete their life cycles and infections are not communicable.
- Dermaphytes and Candida sp naturally inhabit human body and are transmissible.
- True fungal pathogens are distributed in a predictable geographical pattern - climate, soil.
- Dermaphytoses most prevalent
- Cases go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
- Systemic, subcutaneous, cutaneous or superficial infections

\section*{Pathogenesis of the Fungi}
- Portal of entry
- primary mycoses - respiratory portal; inhaled spores
- subcutaneous - inoculated skin; trauma
- cutaneous and superficial - contamination of skin surface
- Virulence factors - thermal dimorphism, toxin production, capsules and adhesion factors, hydrolytic enzymes, inflammatory stimulants

\section*{Antifungal Immunity}
- Antifungal defenses are the integrity of the barriers and respiratory cilia.
- Most important defenses are cell-mediated immunity, phagocytosis, and inflammation.
- Long-term immunity can only develop for some.

\section*{Mechanisms of defanse against fungi}

Mechanisms of innate immunity
Fungi - mostly susceptible
- phagocytosis (neutrophils)
- complement

Mechanisms of adaptive immunity
Cell-mediated immunity
- macrophage and neutrophil activation (CD4 ${ }^{+} \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 1$ and $\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{H}} 17$ cells)

Injurious effect of immune response
- granuloma formation and fibrosis (Histoplasma capsulatum)

Mechanisms of immune evasion
- infibition of phagocytosis (C. neoformans...)

\section*{Infections}
- Diagnosis and identification require microscopic examination of stained specimens, culturing in selective and enriched media and specific biochemical and serological tests.
