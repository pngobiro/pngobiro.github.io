\section*{GRAFT vs. HOST DISEASE.}

\section*{Learning Objectives:}
- Be able to define the GVHD.
- Be able to classify the organs most affected.
- Be able to describe manifestations of GVHD in the affected organs.
- Describe the mechanism of GVHD leading to tissue damage.

\section*{Introduction to Graft vs. Host Disease.}
- Graft vs. Host disease is a syndrome that occurs when immune cells from a donor attack the host's normal cells.
- GVHD is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality associated with an allogenic stem cell transplant.
- GVHD occurs in 30 to $50 \%$ of HLA-matched sibling transplants and 60 to $90 \%$ of mismatched.

\section*{Introduction to Graft vs. Host Disease.}
- Unfortunately at this time, we can not separate GVHD from the beneficial graft vs. leukemia effect.
- GVHD is divided into acute and chronic depending on whether the initial symptoms developed before 100 days following Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)
- The organ systems primarily affected by acute GVHD are the skin, liver, and GI tract.

\section*{Manifestations of Graft vs. Host Disease.}
- The liver manifestations are primarily increases in the bilirubin but can also involve transaminitis
- The GI manifestations are diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
- The severity of acute GVHD is staged on a I to IV system.

\section*{Proposed mechanism for acute GVHD.}
- There appear to be 3 phases to the development of acute GVHD.
- Damage to host tissues.
- Activation and proliferation of donor lymphocytes.
- Attack on the host cells.

\section*{I. Damage to the Host.}
- The damage primarily comes from the conditioning regimen.
- The damage to the host leads to the release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1.
- In the gut, microbial products such as lipopolysaccharide can enter the circulation.

\section*{II. Donor T-cell activation.}
- The inflammatory cytokines stimulate antigen presenting cells (APC); followed by activation and proliferation of the donor lymphocytes.
- The APC present host antigens not recognized by the donor lymphocytes.
- The lymphocytes then multiply and differentiate under the influence of IL-2.

ACTIVATION AND PROLIFERATION OF DONOR LYMPHOCYTES

\section*{III. Attack of Target Tissues.}
- GVHD is primarily mediated by cytoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) but helper T lymphocytes (CD4+) and NK cells are also involved.
- The host cells are destroyed by either direct cytotoxic activity or inflammatory cytokines.

\section*{Decreasing the damage to the host.}
- This can be divided into giving less rigorous conditioning regimens or blocking the cytokines or other products that lead to the activation of APC's.
- Antibiotics have been shown to decrease the frequency of acute GVHD.

\section*{Decreasing the damage to the host.}
- TNF-alpha inhibitors have been tried to decrease GVHD
- Other investigations have shown delay in the development of acute GVHD but not reduction rate with the use of prophylactic TNF-alpha inhibitors.

\section*{Stopping activation and proliferation of donor lymphocytes.}
- Cyclosporine
- Methotrexate
- Tacrolimus
- Sirolimus
- Mycophenolate mofetil
- Steroids
- Alemtuzamab (Campath)
- Anti-IL2 antibodies

\section*{Methotrexate.}
- Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite
- As a single agent significant GVHD develops in 70\%
- It has found a significant role in prevention when used in combination with other immune suppressant medications.

\section*{Cyclosporine.}
- Cyclosporine is a calcineurine inhibitor
- Inhibition of calcineurine prevents the transcription of TNF-alpha and many cytokines (IL-2, IL-3, IL-4) which decreases the proliferation of lymphocytes.
- Notwithstanding, a 40\% development rate for acute GVHD (Grade II-IV) in HLA-matched transplants has been reported.

\section*{Summary.}
- Graft vs. Host disease is a syndrome that occurs when immune cells from a donor attack the host's normal cells.
- GVHD is divided into acute and chronic depending on whether the initial symptoms developed before 100 days following Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT).
- 3 phases to the development of acute GVHD: Damage to host tissues; activation and proliferation of donor lymphocytes; attack on the host cells.
