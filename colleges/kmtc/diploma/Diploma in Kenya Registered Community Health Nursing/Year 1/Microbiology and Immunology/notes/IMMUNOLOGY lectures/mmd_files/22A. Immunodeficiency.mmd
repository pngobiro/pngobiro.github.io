- Understand the relationship between site of lesion and resulting immunodeficiency
- Know the major primary immunodeficiencies and their features
- Know immunodeficiencies in AIDS and other conditions
- Know the diagnostic tests for different immunodeficiencies

\section*{Types}
- SECONDARY AND IATROGENIC IMMUNODEFICIENCIES
- PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES

\section*{SECONDARY AND IATROGENIC LCAMbJASSOEREEAWithENCIES}
- Infections
$\square$ aging
$\square$ Malignancies
$\square$ chemotherapeutic agents
$\square$ other diseases

\section*{Immunodeficiencies associated with infections}
- Bacterial, viral, protozoan, helminthic and fungal infections may lead to problems with:
- B cell
- T cell
$\square$ PMN
- Macrophage
- Most prominent is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

\section*{Immunologic abnormalities in the AIDS}
- Cellular abnormalities of lymphocytes
$\square$ decrease in the number of helper inducer (CD4) T cells
- a reversal in CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio.
$\square$ NK cell number is within normal range but their activity is reduced.
- Functional abnormalities seen in vivo
$\square$ increased susceptibility to infections with opportunistic organisms
$\square$ increased incidence of neoplasms (Kaposi's sarcoma).
- decreased Delayed hypersensitivity response to common antigens
- E.g. tetanus, diphtheria, streptococcal antigen, tuberculin, Candida antigen, trichophyton, etc
- failure to produce antibody in response to various antigenic challenges, both primary and recall antigens (DTP)

\section*{Immunodeficiencies associated with aging}
- These include
$\square$ progressive decrease in thymic cortex
$\square$ hypo-cellularity of and reduction in the size of thymus
$\square$ decrease in suppressor cell function and hence an increase in auto-reactivity
$\square$ decrease in CD4 cells functions
$\square$ In contrast B cells functions may be somewhat elevated

\section*{Immunodeficiencies associated with malignancies arrotherothrem idiseases}
- multiple myeloma
- Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia
- chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
- well-differentiated lymphomas
- impaired T cell functions noted in:
- Hodgkin's disease
- advanced solid tumours
- Most chemotherapeutic agents used for treatment of malignancies are also immunosuppressive

\section*{Other conditions which cause secondary immunodeficiencies}
- sickle cell anaemia
- diabetes mellitus
- protein calorie malnutrition
- Burns
- alcoholic cirrhosis
- rheumatoid arthritis
- renal malfunction
etc.

\section*{PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES}
- inherited defects of the immune system
- may be in the specific or non-specific immune mechanisms
- classified on the basis of the site of lesion in the developmental or differentiation pathway of the immune system
- Individuals are susceptible to a variety of infections
$\square$ type of infection depends on the nature of immunodeficiency

\section*{Disorders of pleuripotential (myeloid /lymphoid) stem cellifular dysgenesis}
- extremely rare but fatal abnormality
$\square$ characterized by the absence or severe deficiency of lymphocytes and granulocytes
$\square$ erythrocytes and platelets are normal.

\section*{Disorders of lymphoid}

\section*{S Eerorigmbinedeninusdeficiency}
- $50 \%$ of SCID is x-linked - lymphopenic hypogammaglobulinemia (agamma-globulinemia)
- defect in ĩy-chain of IL-2 receptor (CD132), also shared by IL-4, -7, -11 and 15
- the cytokine receptors that are involved in lymphocyte proliferation and/or differentiation are dysfunctional.
- $50 \%$ of SCID is of autosomal nature due to a variety of defects
- defects in adenosine deaminase (ADA) or purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) genes
a accumulation of dATP or dGTP causing toxicity to lymphoid stem cells
- Defects in RAG1 and RAG2 genes
$\square$ their absence results in the absence of antigen receptor and hence lack of T and B cell differentiation.
- Defects in IL2 receptors $\int \frac{3}{7} \alpha$-chain (CD25) gene which is shared by IL7 and IL13 receptors

\section*{Character of both forms of}
absendepf T cell and B cell immunity
- absence (or extremely low numbers) of circulating T and B lymphocytes
- absent Thymic shadow on X rays
- Susceptibility to a variety of bacterial, viral, mycotic and protozoan infections
- patient must not receive live vaccines
- diagnosis based on enumeration of T (CD3) and B (CD19) cells and immunoglobulin measurement
- can be treated with bone marrow transplant
- some success of treatment of autosomal SCID patients with ADA deficiency with a retroviral vector transfected with the appropriate gene

\section*{Disorders of T cells}
- DiGeorge's syndrome: a.k.a
- congenital thymic aplasia/hypoplasia,
- immunodeficiency with hypoparathyroidism
- most clearly defined T cell immunodeficiency
$\square$ associated with:
- hypoparathyroidism,
- congenital heart disease,
- low set notched ears
- fish shaped mouth
- defects result from abnormal development of fetus during 6th-10th week of gestation when parathyroid, thymus, lips, ears and aortic arch are being formed
- No chromosomal association is clear and not all DiGeorge syndrome babies have thymic aplasia
- A thymic graft taken from an early fetus (13-14 weeks of gestation) can be used for treatment
- Grafts from older fetuses are likely to cause GVH reaction
- severely immunodeficient DiGeorge patients should not receive live vaccines

\section*{T cell deficiencies with variable degrees of B cell}

\section*{d thafficingionaciay}
- deficiency of T cells associated with a lack of coordination of movement (ataxis) and dilation of small blood vessels of the facial area (telangiectasis)
- T cells and their functions are reduced to various degrees
- B cell numbers and IgM concentrations are normal to low
- IgG is often reduced and IgA is considerably reduced (in 70\% of the cases)
- high incidence of malignancy, particularly leukemias, in these patients
- defects arise from a breakage in chromosome 14 at the site of TCR and Ig heavy chain genes

\section*{Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome}
${ }^{-}$associated with normal T cell numbers with reduced functions, which get progressively worse
- IgM concentrations are reduced but IgG levels are normal
- Both IgA and IgE levels are elevated
- Boys with this syndrome develop severe eczema, petechia (due to platelet defect and thrombocytopenia)
$\square$ respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens and are prone to pyogenic infections
defective WASP protein which is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization
- MHC deficiency (Bare leukocyte syndrome)
$\square$ defect in the MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) protein gene- lack of class-II MHC molecule on their APC
${ }^{\square}$ positive selection of CD4 cells in the thymus depends on the presence of CIITA
- fewer CD4 cells and suscepitibility to infection
$\square$ defect in transport associated protein (TAP) gene lead to lack of class-I MHC molecules and consequently are deficient in CD8+ T cells

\section*{Disorders of B}

\section*{T cell numbers and functions are normal lymphocytes}
- B cell numbers may be low or normal but immunoglobulin levels are low
- X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia-Bruton's hypoglobulinemia or agammaglobulinemia
- most severe B cell immunodeficiency
- B cell numbers and all immunoglobulin levels are very low or undetectable
- patients have failure of B-cell maturation associated with a defective B cell tyrosine kinase (btk) gene
- Diagnosis based on enumeration of B (CD19) cells and immunoglobulin measurement

\section*{Transient hypogammaglobulinemia}
- Children at birth have IgG levels comparable to that of the mother
- half life of IgG being 30 days
- its level gradually decline
- By three months of age normal infants begin to synthesize their own IgG
- However in some infants IgG synthesis may not begin until they are 2-3 years old
- delay attributed to poor T cell help
- results in a transient deficiency of IgG that can be corrected with ${ }_{23}$ gamma-globulin treatment

\section*{- Common variable hypogammaglobulinemia}
- acquired deficiencies of IgG and IgA in the 2nd or 3rd decade of their life
- susceptible to a variety of pyogenic bacteria and intestinal protozoa
- treated with specially prepared ĩ globulin for intravenous use.

\section*{- IgA deficiency}
- the commonest of all immunodeficiencies (1/700 of all Caucasians)
- About 20\% of individuals with IgA deficiency also have low IgG
- IgA deficient patients are very susceptible to gastrointestinal, eye and nasopharyngeal infections
- Patients with IgA deficiency have a high incidence of autoimmune diseases (particularly immune complex type) and lymphoid malignancies
- Anti_IgA antibodies (IgG) are detected in 30 to 40 percent of patients who should not be treated with î-globulins
- Selective IgG deficiency
- Deficiencies of different IgG subclasses leading to susceptibility to pyogenic infections
- Hyper-lgM immunodeficiency
- low IgA and IgG concentrations with abnormally high levels of IgM
- patients cannot make a switch from IgM to other classes which is attributed to a defect in CD40L on their CD4 cells
$\square$ very susceptible to pyogenic infection and should be treated with intravenous Î-globulins

\section*{Non-specific immune}

Defects of the phagocytic system-lead to increased
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_39cd982f7284a5a6fcd6g-26.jpg?height=122&width=1863&top_left_y=338&top_left_x=146) infections
- Cyclic neutropenia-low numbers of circulating neutrophil approximately every three weeks lasting about a week during which the patients are susceptible to infection
- defect appears to be due to poor regulation of neutrophil production
- Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD)

\section*{Chronic granulomatous disfease splenomegaly and chronic draining lymph nodes}
- Leukocytes have poor intracellular killing and low respiratory burst
- majority have a defect in NADPH oxidase (cytochrome b558: gp91phox, or rarely gp22phox) or other cofactor proteins (gp47phox, gp67phox) that participate in phagocytic respiratory burst
- diagnosed on the basis or poor Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction which is a measure of respiratory burst (they are negative in the test)
- Interferon- $\boldsymbol{y i}$ i therapy has been successful

\section*{- Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency}
- Leukocytes lack the complement receptor CR3 due to a defect in CD11 or CD18 peptides
$\square$ cannot respond to C3b opsonin
- alternatively defect in integrin molecules, LFA-1 or mac-1, arising from a defective CD11a or CD11b peptide may occur
- molecules involved in diapedesis and hence individuals with an aberration in these chains cannot respond effectively to chemotactic signals

\section*{Chediak-Higashi}

\section*{Sparked to ta reduoed (slower rate) intracellular killing and chemotactic movement accompanied by an impaired phagosome-lysosome fusion and lysosomal proteinase deficiency}
- Respiratory burst is normal
- Accompanying NK cell defect and platelet and neurological disorders have been noted

\section*{Disorders of complement}
sheadrome reased susceptibility to infections particularly with Neisseria
- genetic deficiencies of various components of complement system
- most serious among these is the C3 deficiency that may arise from low C3 synthesis or deficiency in factor I or factor H
