PHAGOCYTOSIS DR DEEPA PATEL
- Phagocytosis is a specific form of endocytosis by which cells internalise solid matter, including microbial pathogens
- Phago in Greek - Eat
- Professional phagocytes of the immune system
- Macrophages,
- Neutrophils
- Immature dendritic cells
- Phagocytosis is a mechanism by which microorganisms can be
- Contained \& killed
- Processed for antigen presentation

\section*{STEPS IN PHAGOCYTOSIS}
1. Contact between phagocyte and microbial cell
2. Engulfment
3. Phagosome formation
4. Phagosome-lysosome fusion
5. Killing and digestion
1. Chemotaxis: Phagocytes are chemically attracted to site of infection.
2. Adherence: Phagocyte plasma membrane attaches to surface of pathogen or foreign material.
- Adherence can be inhibited by capsules (S. pneumoniae) or M protein (S. pyogenes).
- Opsonization: Coating process with opsonins that facilitates attachment.

(2) Dilation and increased permeability of capillary
(3) Phagocytosis of pathogens
3. Ingestion: Plasma membrane of phagocytes extends projections (pseudopods) which engulf the microbe. Microbe is enclosed in a sac called phagosome.
4. Digestion: Inside the cell, phagosome fuses with lysosome to form a phagolysosome.
- Microorganisms are killed by
- Oxygen dependent mechanism
- Oxygen independent mechanism
5. After digestion, residual body with undigestable material is discharged.

\section*{OXYGEN-DEPENDENT}
- When a phagocyte ingests its oxygen consumption increases (respiratory burst)
- This produces reactive oxygen containing molecules
- Superoxide, which is converted to hydrogen peroxide \& singlet oxygen by superoxide dismutase
- Superoxide also react with the hydrogen peroxide to form hydroxyl radicals
- The other type involves the use of the enzyme myeloperoxidase which is released into the phagolysozome. This uses hydrogen peroxide \& chlorine to create Hypochlorite

\section*{OXYGEN-INDEPENDENT}
- Lysosomal enzymes kill most bacteria within 30 minutes and include:
- Lysozyme: Destroys cell wall peptidoglycan
- Lactoferrins
- Lipases and Proteases
- RNAses and DNAses
