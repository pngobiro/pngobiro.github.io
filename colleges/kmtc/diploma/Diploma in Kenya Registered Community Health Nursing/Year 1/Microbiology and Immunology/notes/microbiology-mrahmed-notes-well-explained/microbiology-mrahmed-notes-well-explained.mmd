\section*{Introduction}

Microbiology is divided into two ;

Micro-very small ,Can only be seen with-microscope

Bio-life

Ology-study of life

Def- microbiology is the study of very small living organism or the science of microbes. (Microorganism), (Arora, 2012),

Example of microorganism;

Bacteria, Algae, Protozoa, Fungi, Virus

Medical microbiology is the study of causative agents of infectious disease of human beings and their reaction to such infections

\section*{History of microbiology}

The origin of microbial life was discovered by Louis Pasteur when was discovering about alcohol fermentation and spoilage, in 1860-64.

In 1863-65 he discovers distraction of bacterial by pasteurization.

In 1865 he discovered protozoa as a cause of silkworm disease

In 1877 he he discovered that anthrax is caused by bacteria

In 1880 he first cultured staphylococci in liquid medium and produce abscesses by inoculation into rabbits.

In 1881 he developed live attenuated anthrax vaccine
In 1881 he and Sternberg notice pneumococci.

In 1885 he discovered anti rabies vaccine

1887 he and Joubert fist described clostridium septicum and called it vibrion septique

Robert Koch discovered ;

He introduced the method of making smear of bacteria on glass slide and stain them with aniline dye.

In 1877 he substitute agar in place of geltin as a solidifying agent.

In 1882 he announces his discovery of tubercle bacillus the causative agent of tuberculosis, (mycobacterium tuberculosis).

In 1883 he discovered the causative agents of cholera (vibrio cholera, Egyptian ophthalmic (pink ye) and Koch week's bacillus

In 1884 he discovered tuberculin a substance in treatment of tuberculosis.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered the use of magnifying lenses in observing living organism through a microscope.

Edward Jenner he introduces the modern method of vaccination to prevent smallpox.
Paul Ehrlich he developed idea of applied stain to cells and tissue for the purse of revealing their function.

In 1882 he reported the acid-fastness of tubercle bacillus from 1890-1900 he did research on immunology and found that specific effect of immune serum could be demonstrated in vivo and vitro and introduced method of standardizing toxin and antitoxin.

In 1898 he proposed side chain theory of antibody production.
In 1909 he introduced a substance that was able to destroy the spiroc haete of syphilis with only moderate toxic effect

In 1912 he created a branch of chemotherapy.
Subdivision of microbiology
1. Medical microbiology
2. Industrial microbiology
3. Solid/land/ microbiology
4. plant microbiology
5. Food microbiology

In medical microbiology we are concern with the study of human pathogens, animal pathogens how they are transmitted to man and those commensals which on occasion particularly when outside their normal habitat causes serious diseases to main host.

\section*{Aim/ importance of microbiology}

One is required to know the;-
1. Diagnosis- one need to know the cause (etiology) of a disease by isolation and identification of causative organism from pathological specimen
2. Mode of transmission i.e blood, sexual intercourse, ingestion, and through skin so that to stop the spread.
3. Prognosis of the disease-Laboratory results and interpretation determine whether treatment is effective and the disease cure or infective or presence of active disease
4. Guidance in treatment of microorganism respond to treatment either further investigation is needed or not.
5. Epidemiology- to know the disease pattern, distribution and how it spread and factors contributing to spread.(sources of infection).
6. Detections of new pathogens and then development

The areas covered in microbiology are:
1. Parasitology- study of parasites causing diseases to human beings
2. Mycology- study of fungi causing disease in human body
3. Bacteriology-study of bacteria causing diseases in human body
4. Virology- study of virus
5. Immunology- concerned with mechanism involved in the development of resistance by body to infectious diseases
6. Genetics- study of heredity and variation

\section*{Classification of microorganism}

Bacterial are free-living microscopic unicellular organism capable of performing life function, growth, metabolism and reproduction because they possess both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid, (RNA) and lack chlorophyll, (Arora,2012). Bacteria have been placed in separate kingdom of Protista from animals and plants.

They are classified into Eukaryotes and prokaryotes

Example of Eukaryotes; fungi, algae, slime moulds and protozoa
Example of Prokaryotes; bacteria and green algae (it contain chlorophyll photosynthetic bacteria),

\section*{Sources of infection}

\section*{1. Man-patients}
-carriers - we have health carriers who harbor pathogens organisms without causing any disease to himself
-convalescent carriers who has recovery from diseases but continue to harbor pathogens in body. e.g typhoid fever
2. Commensals-Normal floral of upper respiration tract, streptococcus, pneumonia. They invade tissue causing bronchitis, bronchopneumonia when mucus membranes are damaged by viral infection.
3. Animals-infection transmitted from animals to man are called zoonosis. E.g Rats, reckettisa infections
4. Fungal infection-dermatophytes transmitted through dogs and cats.
5. Insects-disease transmitted by insects are called athropoda.e.g malaria, plague,trench fever.

\section*{Mode of transmission}

Ingestion-organisms enter the through mouth to intestines, e.g cholera, food poisoning, dysentery.

Innoculation-is contacts between skin and infected materials these include general diseases of the skin. E.g -Rashes of secondary syphilis
-conjunctiva infection
-bacterial infection, empetigo
-viral infection.g herpes simplex
-fungal infection- tineassis
Inhalation-infection through respiratory tract. E.g TB
Wound infection-e.g clostridium tetani and perfrigens rabies virus
Escheriechia coli- intestinal commensals that causes sepsis by entering wound during abdominal surgical operations.

Injection- there of 2 types- medical injection through contaminated needle and syringe -viral injection e.g hepatis B
-biting insects and arthropoda e.g mosquito transmitting malaria parasite

\section*{Stages of infection development}

Infection occurs when an organism, such as a virus or bacterium, invades the body. The infectious agent rapidly multiplies in the body's tissues. Although not all infections result in disease, some can trigger the immune system, causing symptoms of illness.

There are five stages of infection:
- incubation
- prodromal
- illness
- decline
- convalescence

\section*{1. Incubation}

Is the time from exposure to an infectious agent until the onset of symptoms. The exact time frame of the incubation stage varies depending on the infection.

\section*{Flu 1-4 days}

\section*{Hepatitis B 1-6 months}

\section*{Salmonella 6 hours- 6 days}

\section*{2. Prodromal}

The prodromal stage refers to the period after incubation and before the characteristic symptoms of infection occur. People can also transmit infections during the prodromal stage. During this stage, the infectious agent continues replicating, which triggers the body's immune response and mild, nonspecific symptoms. These symptoms can include: fatigue,

\section*{Duration}

The duration of the prodromal stage varies depending on the type of infection.

For example, the flu has a short incubation period of about 2 daysTrusted Source. As a result, the prodromal stage may overlap with the incubation stage and the onset of illness..

\section*{3. Illness}

It is the time when a person shows apparent symptoms of an infectious disease.

\section*{Symptoms}

The symptoms of infection vary widely depending on the underlying cause because people who have an active infection may experience, fever, headache, fatigue

\section*{4. Decline}

During the decline stage, the immune system mounts a successful defense against the pathogens, and the number of infectious particles decreases.However, a person can develop secondary infections during this stage if the primary infection has weakened their immune system.During this stage, the virus can still transmit to other people.

\section*{5. Convalescence}

The final stage of infection, where symptoms resolve, and a person can return to their normal functions. Depending on the severity of the infection, some people may have permanent damage even after the infection resolves

\section*{Eukaryotes}

They have cells that contain a membrane bound nucleus and organelles.ie protozoa, plant, fungi, and animals

\section*{Characteristics of eukaryotic cell}
1. have the nucleus enclosed within the nuclear membrane.
2. The cell has mitochondria.
3. Have Flagella and cilia for locomotion
4. A cell wall is the outermost layer
5. The cells divide by a process called mitosis.
6. The eukaryotic cells contain a cytoskeletal structure.
7. The nucleus contains a single, linear DNA, which carries all the genetic information

\section*{Eukaryote cell}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-18.jpg?height=901&width=1362&top_left_y=634&top_left_x=284)

\section*{Plasma Membrane}
- The plasma membrane separates the cell from the outside environment.
- It comprises specific embedded proteins, which help in the exchange of substances in and out of the cell.

\section*{Cell Wall}
- A cell wall is a rigid structure present outside the plant cell. It is, however, absent in animal cells.
- It provides shape to the cell and helps in cell-to-cell interaction.
- It is a protective layer that protects the cell from any injury or pathogen attacks.
- It is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins, proteins, etc.

Also refer: Cell Wall

\section*{Cytoskeleton}

The cytoskeleton is present inside the cytoplasm consisting microfilaments, microtubules, and fibres to provide perfect shape to the cell, anchor the organelles, and stimulate the cell movement.

\section*{Endoplasmic Reticulum}

It is a network of small, tubular structures that divides the cell surface into two parts: luminal and extraluminal.
Endoplasmic Reticulum is of two types:
- Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum contains ribosomes.
- Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum that lacks ribosomes and is smooth.

\section*{Nucleus}
- The nucleoplasm enclosed within the nucleus contains DNA and proteins.
- The nuclear envelop consists of two layers- the outer membrane and the inner membrane. Both the membranes are permeable to ions, molecules, and RNA material.
- Ribosome production also takes place inside the nucleus.

\section*{Golgi Apparatus}
- It is made up of flat disc-shaped structures called cisternae.
- It is absent in red blood cells of humans and sieve cells of plants.
- They are arranged parallel and concentrically near the nucleus.
- It is an important site for the formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids.

\section*{Ribososm}

These are the main site for protein synthesis and are composed of proteins and ribonucleic acid

\section*{Mitochondria}
- These are also known as "powerhouse of cells" because they produce energy.
- It consists of an outer membrane and an inner membrane. The inner membrane is divided into folds called cristae.
- They help in the regulation of cell metabolic

\section*{lysosomes}

They are known as "suicidal bags" because they possess hydrolytic enzymes to digest protein, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.

\section*{plastids}

These are double-membraned structures and are found only in plant cells. These are of three types:
- Chloroplast that contains chlorophyll and is involved in photosynthesis.
- Chromoplast that contains a pigment called carotene that provides the plants yellow, red, or orange colours.
- Leucoplasts that are colourless and store oil, fats, carbohydrates, or proteins.

\section*{prokaryotes}

They are cells that do not have a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles." Prokaryotes include Bacteria and Archaea. The photosynthetic prokaryotes include cyanobacteria that perform photosynthesis. Their cell consists of a single membrane and therefore, all the reactions occur within the cytoplasm. They can be free-living or parasites.
1. They lack a nuclear membrane, Mitochondria, Golgi bodies, chloroplast, and lysosomes
2. The genetic material is present on a single chromosome.
3. The histone proteins, the important constituents of eukaryotic chromosomes, are lacking in them.
4. The cell wall is made up of carbohydrates and amino acids.
5. The plasma membrane acts as the mitochondrial membrane carrying respiratory enzymes.
6. They divide asexually by binary fission. The sexual mode of reproduction involves conjugation

\section*{Prokaryote cell structure}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-21.jpg?height=1075&width=1535&top_left_y=731&top_left_x=303)

\section*{Structures of prokaryotes}
1. Capsule- It is an outer protective covering found in the bacterial cells, in addition to the cell wall. It helps in moisture retention, protects the cell when engulfed, and helps in the attachment of cells to nutrients and surfaces.
2. Cell Wall- It is the outermost layer of the cell which gives shape to the cell.
3. Cytoplasm- The cytoplasm is mainly composed of enzymes, salts, cell organelles and is a gel-like component.
4. Cell Membrane- This layer surrounds the cytoplasm and regulates the entry and exit of substances in the cells.
5. Pili- These are rod hair-like outgrowths that transfer genetic material, locomotion and attach to the surface of other bacterial cells.
6. Fimbriae- are numerous, hair-like structures that are used for attachment to host cells and other surfaces
7. Flagella- These are long structures in the form of a whip, that help in the locomotion of a cell.
8. Ribosomes- These are involved in protein synthesis.
9. Plasmids- Plasmids are non-chromosomal DNA structures. These are not involved in reproduction.
10. Nucleoid Region- It is the region in the cytoplasm where the genetic material is present.

NOTE: A prokaryotic cell lacks certain organelles like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi bodies.

\section*{prokaryotic cells have four main components:}

Plasma Membrane- It is an outer protective covering of phospholipid molecules which separates the cell from the surrounding environment.

Cytoplasm- It is a jelly-like substance present inside the cell. All the cell organelles are suspended in it.

DNA- It is the genetic material of the cell. All the prokaryotes possess a circular DNA. It directs what proteins the cell creates. It also regulates the actions of the cell.

Ribosomes- Protein synthesis occurs here.

\section*{Classification of infection}

Primary infection- is the initial infection in a host.
Secondary infection-invasive in a new organism in a host who are resistence and immunity lowered by pre-existing infection diseases where by setting up a new infection

Re-infection- subsequent infection with the same organism
Focal infection-it is a localized infection
Cross infection-when a patient is suffering from a disease and a new infection is set up from another host or external host.

Nosocomial infection- this are infection which are acquired from hospital. It can be through-
1. Interaction with infected people e.g TB, diphtheria, measles or children with echierichia coli, gastro enteritis. This infection should be treated in an open air.
2. Washing facilities belonging to patients-
3. Use of infected bedding and clothings before sending them to laundry
4. Sterilization of equipment
5. Subclinical infection
6. Self-infection while working in the ward.

\section*{Preventing nosocomial infections}

The responsibility of HAI prevention is with the healthcare facility. Hospitals and healthcare staff should follow the recommended guidelines for sterilization and disinfection. Taking steps to prevent HAIs can decrease your risk of contracting them by 70 percentTrusted Source or more. However, due to the nature of healthcare facilities, it's impossible to eliminate 100 percent of nosocomial infections. The measures include
1. Prevent transmission from environment
2. Screening the working areas, wards, radiation, ICU etc to prevent infectionton .
3. Identifying the type of isolation needed, which can help to protect others or reduce chances of further infection.
4. Observing hand hygiene, which involves washing hands before and after touching people in the hospital.
5. Wearing appropriate gear,(PPE). including gloves, gowns, and face protection.
6. Cleaning surfaces properly, with recommended antiseptic in right proportion frequency.
7. Making sure rooms are well ventilated.
8. Facilitate infection control programs i.e aseptic technique, hand washing, proper sterilization of instrument
9. Isolated any prone clients of patient to prevent the spread
10. Observe hospital waste management

To reduce the risk of UTIs, your healthcare provider can:
- Follow the aseptic insertion technique to minimize infection.
- Insert catheters only when needed and remove when no longer needed.
- Change catheters or bags only when medically indicated.
- Make sure the urinary catheter is secured above the thigh and hanging below the bladder for unobstructed urine flow.

Keep a closed drainage system

\section*{What causes nosocomial infections?}

Bacteria, fungus, and viruses can cause HAIs. Bacteria alone cause about 90 percent of these cases. Many people have compromised immune systems during their hospital stay, so they're more likely to contract an infection. Some of the common bacteria that are responsible for HAIs are:
\begin{tabular}{l|l}

Cause: Genus Plasmodium (In humans, malaria is brought about by four different species of the organism: Plasmodium malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium ovale).

Vector: The parasite is only carried by the female Anopheles mosquito. Usually, it bites during dusk and dawn.

Nature: Malaria is an illness that needs an incubation period of more than 7 days. Hence, if the illness developed in less than a week after exposure, it is safe to say that it is not malaria.

Symptoms: Among all types of malaria, the most severe is the one that is caused by the species Plasmodium falciparum. Some of the most common symptoms include fever, headache, muscle pain, vomiting, abdominal pain, and cough. In worse cases, organ failure, convulsions, and the collapse of the circulatory system may occur.

Treatment: Malaria is preventable using antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, etc.

\section*{2. Amoebiasis}

Cause: Amoebas of the Entamoeba genus. The parasite Entamoeba histolytica is the most common.

\section*{Vector: none}

Nature: Also known as amoebic dysentery, amoebiasis is a type of gastrointestinal infection that is often linked to poor sanitation and socioeconomic status rather than the weather or climate.

Symptoms: Most of the time, amoebiasis starts with abdominal pain that eventually develops into loose bowel movements. Aside from that, fever, nausea, loss of appetite and bloody stools are also an indication of amoebiasis.

Treatment: To treat amoebiasis, most doctors prescribe metronidazole or tinidazole.

\section*{3. Trypanosomiasis (aka African Sleeping Disease)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-35.jpg?height=1310&width=1844&top_left_y=592&top_left_x=241)

Cause: Trypanosoma brucei. In humans, two types of this species can infect humans: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (TbG) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (TbR).

Vector: The protozoa are transmitted by the blood-sucking insect called tsetse fly (genus Glossina).

Symptoms: Some of the most common symptoms of the disease include a headache, high fever, irritability, muscle and joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes. In worse cases, some people get
skin rash and develop neurological problems. If left untreated, the infected patient may die within a few months.

Treatment: While the type of treatment differs depending on the type of trypanosomiasis infection, the most common medicine recommended during its early stages are pentamidine, suramin, nifurtimox, eflornithine, and melarsoprol.

\section*{4. Chagas disease (aka American Trypanosomiasis)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-36.jpg?height=1009&width=1834&top_left_y=948&top_left_x=243)

Cause: The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It was named after its discoverer, Brazilian physician, and researcher, Carlos Chagas (1909).

Vector: This parasite is acquired by humans when they get in contact with the urine or feces of bugs known as reduviid bugs (also called as triatomine bugs or "kissing bugs"). The disease is not transmitted from person to person.

Symptoms: The most common symptoms of the disease are swelling/redness at the infection site (called as chagoma), fever, swollen lymph nodes, headache, body pain, nausea, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue.

Treatment: The disease is highly treatable if treatment is made possible as the patient gets infected. Usually, Chagas disease is treated with benznidazole and nifurtimox. Some Alternatively, the patient can still undergo antiparasitic treatment during disease progression.

Cause: The disease is caused by the parasite Giardia lamblia, a parasite of the duodenum part of the small intestine.

Vector: none. The disease is only acquired by ingesting parasite-contaminated drinking water or parasite-contaminated food.

Symptoms: The disease is often manifested by watery and foul-smelling diarrhea, frequent flatulence, extreme fatigue, nausea, and significant weight loss. Interestingly, some people may have the parasite in their small intestine but may never manifest the symptom at all.

Treatment: The most common antibiotics used to treat lambliasis are metronidazole and tinidazole.

\section*{6. Babesiosis}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-39.jpg?height=1234&width=1838&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=241)

Cause: The disease is caused by the microscopic red blood cell-infecting parasite Babesia microti.

Vector: The protozoan is transmitted through the bite of the infected tick Ixodes scapularis. Most of the time, it is transmitted when the said tick is in the nymph stage.

Symptoms: Most of the time, people infected with the protozoan do not exhibit any noticeable symptoms. In some cases, they develop fever, headache, fatigue, body pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. Babesiosis can be sometimes life-threatening especially for some people who have weak immune systems.

Treatment: Patients with babesiosis can be treated within 7 to 10 days, with a combination of prescription drugs. Such combinations may be clindamycin and quinine, or azithromycin and atovaquone.

\section*{7. Cryptosporidiosis}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-41.jpg?height=1226&width=1830&top_left_y=458&top_left_x=245)

Cause: In humans, the disease is caused by the apicomplexan protozoan members of the genus Cryptosporidium. The most common species found in humans are C.parvum and C.hominis.

Vector: Unlike other parasites, Cryptosporidium species do not need a vector and have the ability to complete their life cycle on their own.

Symptoms: In humans, the disease is characterized by the infection of the small intestine, particularly the jejunum and the ileum. As a result, an infected patient experiences watery diarrhea that could last up to two weeks. In severe cases, the infection could reach the stomach and the lungs.

Treatment: At present, there is still no prescribed medication for the disease. Most of the time, the recovery period is dependent on the immunity of the patient. Usually, it takes about two weeks to recover without medication.

\section*{8. Sappinia amoebic encephalitis (SAE)}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-42.jpg?height=1218&width=1838&top_left_y=741&top_left_x=241)

Cause: As its name suggests, Sappinia amoebic encephalitis is caused by the species Sappinia pedata (previously known as Sappinia diploidea), a species not previously known to be lethal to humans. Basically amoebic encephalitis can be caused by a wide variety of amoeba species such as Acanthamoeba, Entamoeba histolytica, Naegleria fowleri, and Balamuthia mandrillaris.

Vector: The protozoan does not require a vector to be transmitted to humans.

Symptoms: Infection of the parasite is usually manifested by the following symptoms: a headache, nausea, blurred vision, light sensitivity, and frequent loss of consciousness. The infection can be further confirmed by the presence of a tumor-like mass in the brain.

Treatment: Infection from the said parasite is usually treated with drugs such as azithromycin, flucytosine, itraconazole, and pentamidine. Ultimately, a surgery to remove the mass of tumor can be performed.

\section*{9. Blastocystosis}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-44.jpg?height=1722&width=1828&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=249)

Cause: The disease is caused by the water-borne protozoan Blastocystis hominis.

Vector: None. While its mode of transmission remains unknown, the number of infected people increases in areas with poor hygiene and sanitation.

Symptoms: Blastocystosis is often asymptomatic; it could occur without showing any symptoms. This is because of the way the parasite attacks the body and creates more trouble
when the immunity is weakened. However, if you are experiencing severe diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, and fatigue, it might be good to have yourself checked for the parasite.

Treatment: The disease is very hard to treat because of the ability of the parasite to attach itself to the intestinal mucus. Nevertheless, antibiotics such as tinidazole and metronidazole, and antiprotozoal drugs like paromomycin can be used.

Cause: Trichomoniasis is a sexually-transmitted disease that is caused by the protozoan Trichomoniasis vaginalis.

Vector: None. The parasite is transmitted from person to person during sexual intercourse. In men, the inside of the penis (urethra) is the most commonly affected. On the other hand, in women, the lower genitalia (includes the vagina, cervix, vulva, and the urethra) is the most commonly affected.

Symptoms: Most of the time, trichomoniasis occurs with no noticeable symptoms. Both men and women with the disease may experience itching and burning sensation in the affected areas, as well as having weird discharge.

Treatment: Regarding treatments available, this disease is considered to be one of the most treatable diseases in the United States.

\section*{11. Toxoplasmosis}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-47.jpg?height=1212&width=1836&top_left_y=665&top_left_x=242)

Cause: Toxoplasmosis is a type of infection from one of the world's most common protozoan Toxoplasma gondii.

Vector: The parasite can be ingested via contact with contaminated water and soil in various areas. Aside from that, the eggs (oocysts) of the parasite may also attach to the fur of animals that have come in contact with contaminated cat feces.

Symptoms: People infected with the disease may develop flu-like symptoms, and experience blurred vision and redness of the eyes. Aside from that, infected people may also experience body pain and fatigue.

Treatment: Some of the most common prescription drugs for the disease include pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and the antibiotic sulfadiazine.

\section*{12. Schistosomiasis}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_05_13_347842386d4316108e9ag-48.jpg?height=1185&width=1834&top_left_y=947&top_left_x=243)

Cause: The disease is caused by the blood flukes of the Schistosoma genus.

Vector: None. However, the parasites are transmitted in their larval forms when they are released by their vector - freshwater snails. After that, they can get into the skin after contact with contaminated water.

Symptoms: The most common symptoms associated with Schistosomiasis include blood stool, frequent diarrhea, and severe abdominal pain. In worse cases, enlargement of the liver may occur. All of these symptoms are a result of the body's adaptation to the eggs of the parasite.

Treatment: The drug praziquantel is the most prescribed treatment for all types of the disease. It is safe, affordable, and very effective. Repeated treatments in some patients are also advised.

\section*{Fungal diseases}

Fungi was recognized as a causative agent of human diseases much earlier than bacteria. Dermatomycosis is a cutaneous infection caused by fungi belonging to the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum and Epidermophyton.

Ringworm is one of the most common fungal disease in humans. Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on the skin, nails and scalp are the main symptoms of the disease. Heat and moisture help these fungi to grow and makes them to thrive in skin folds such as those in the groin or between the toes. Ringworms of the feet is known as Athlete's foot caused by Tinea pedis. Ringworms are generally acquired from soil or by using clothes, towels and comb used by infected persons.

\section*{Helminthic diseases}

Helminthes are mostly endoparasitic in the gut and blood of human beings and cause diseases called helminthiasis. The two most prevalent helminthic diseases are Ascariasis and Filariasis.

Ascaris is a monogenic parasite and exhibits sexual dimorphism. Ascariasis is a disease caused by the intestinal endoparasite Ascaris lumbricoides commonly called the round worms. It is transmitted through ingestion of embryonated eggs through contaminated food and water. Children playing in contaminated soils are also prone to have a chance of transfer of eggs from hand to mouth.

The symptoms of the disease are abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, anaemia, irritability and diarrhoea. A heavy infection can cause nutritional deficiency and severe abdominal pain and causes stunted growth in children. It may also cause enteritis, hepatitis and bronchitis.

Filariasis is caused by Wuchereria bancrofti, commonly called filarial worm. It is found in the lymph vessels and lymph nodes of man. Wuchereria bancrofti is sexually dimorphic, viviparous and digenic. The life cycle is completed in two hosts, man and the female Culex mosquito The female filarial worm gives rise to juveniles called microfilariae larvae. In the lymph glands, the juveniles develop into adults. The accumulation of the worms block the lymphatic system resulting in inflammation of the lymph nodes.

In some cases, the obstruction of lymph vessels causes elephantiasis or filariasis of the limbs, scrotum and mammary glands treatments in some patients are also advised.

\section*{List of virus and disease}

\section*{Viral diseases}

Viruses are the smallest intracellular obligate parasites, which multiply within living cells. Outside the living cells they cannot carry out the characteristics of a living organism. Viruses invade living cells, forcing the cells to create new viruses. The new viruses break out of the cell, killing it and invade other cells in the body, causing diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses cause one of the most infectious human ailment called the "Common cold".

Viral diseases are generally grouped into four types on the basis of the symptoms produced in the body organs.
ii. Dermotropic diseases (skin and subcutaneous tissues affected by chicken pox and measles)
iii. Viscerotropic diseases (blood and visceral organs affected by yellow fever and dengue fever)
iv. Neurotropic diseases (central nervous system affected by rabies and polio). Some common viral diseases of human beings are given in
