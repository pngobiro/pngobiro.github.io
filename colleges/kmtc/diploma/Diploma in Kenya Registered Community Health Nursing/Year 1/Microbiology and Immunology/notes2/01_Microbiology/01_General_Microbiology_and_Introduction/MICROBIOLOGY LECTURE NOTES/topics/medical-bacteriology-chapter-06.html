                        <p>Food may acquire their micro-organism from various sources and the following are the important sources.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Animals
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Animals could be a source of contamination of food.</li>
                                    <li>The surface of animals, the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, hides, Loofs and waste products of animals are important sources of contamination.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Plants (Green plants)
                                <p>Food may get their microbial contamination from green plants.</p>
                                <p>The natural flora of growing plants includes pseudomonas, alcaligenes, bacissus, Micrococcus, coliform etc.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Sewage
                                <p>Gastrointestinal pathogens, coliforms, Enterococci of untreated domestic sewage could be source of contamination of raw plant foods.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sewage can also contaminate natural waters and contribute micro-organisms to shellfish, fish and other sea foods.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>Soil is a very rich environment in microbes and is a major source of contamination of food.</li>
                                    <li>Bacillus, clostridium, enterobacter, Escherichia, Micrococcus, Alkaligens, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, proteus, Aerobacter, molds and yeast are kinds of organisms that contaminate food from soil.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Nutrient found in foods
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Organisms obtain their energy for carrying their metabolic activity mainly from the food.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Hydrogen ion concentration (pH)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The optimum pH for many microorganisms is near the neutral point of pH 7 . However molds and yeasts as a rule are acid tolerant. This is one of the reasons why fungi are usually associated with acid foods especially fruits.</li>
                                    <li>Many bacteria are not acid tolerant, accordingly, several acid like acetic, benzoic, propionic acids are used to preserve foods.</li>
                                    <li>It has been found that pH of 4.5 or below is lethal to salmonellae and staphylococci.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Oxidation reduction potential (O-R)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Organisms can be classified into aerobic and anaerobic based on their oxygen requirements. There fore, the reducing and oxidizing power of the food influences the type of organism that growth on it.</li>
                                    <li>Foods with high oxidation potential favours the growth of aerobes and faculitative anaerobic organisms.</li>
                                    <li>Foods with low oxidation potential favours the growth of anaerobic and faculitative anaerobic organism.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Growth inhibitors: - These are chemicals such as sodium chloride (NaCl), Nitrate, Nitrite, Sulphur dioxide and hypochlorites that are added to foods to the growth of certain organisms.</li>
                            <li>Temperature
                                <p>It was found that E.coli, for example, requires the following periods for a cell to divide at different temperatures.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>60 minutes at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                                    <li>40 minutes at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                                    <li>29 minutes at $29^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                                    <li>17 Minutes at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                                    <li>19 minutes at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                                    <li>32 minutes at $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>It is clear that rate of growth is optimal at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but decreases when the temperature is lowered below, or raised above $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Water acitivity ($\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{W}}$)
                                <ul>
                                    <li>No microbial activity can occur unless water is available.</li>
                                    <li>Water activity is the ratio between the vapour pressure of the food and that of pure water.</li>
                                    <li>Pure water has $\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{w}}=1.0$ and a relative humidity of $100 \%$. This means that $\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{w}} \times 100$ indicates the equilibrium relative humidity, which the particular food would produce if enclosed in a sealed container at a constant temperature.</li>
                                    <li>Organisms have their own characterstic optimal $\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{w}}$ and range of $\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{w}}$ for their growth.</li>

                        <p>Micro-organisms of interest in food bacteriology are:</p>
                        <p><strong>(i) Indicator organism(s):-</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An indicator organism or group of organisms is/are one whose numbers in a product reflects the success or failure of good manufacturing practices.</li>
                            <li>Indicator organisms are bacterial groups (or species) whose presence in foods, above a certain numerical limits, is considered to indicate exposure of food to conditions that might introduce hazardous organisms and/or allow proliferation of pathogenic or toxinogenic species.</li>
                            <li>They have value in assessing both the microbiological safety and quality of foods. Indicator organisms include coliforms and faecal streptococci.</li>
                            <li>The best example of indicator organisms are the coliforms.</li>
                            <li>Coliform group is defined to include all aerobic and faculitative anaerobic, gram negative, non-spor forming, rod shaped species which ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas within 48 hours at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                            <li>Coliform are either part of the normal flora of intestinal tract of man and animals or found in environments such as soil and plants.</li>
                            <li>Coliform that are commonly found in the intestinal tracts of man and animals (faeces) are called faecal coliform and those coliforms that are normal inhabitants of soil and plants are called non faecal coliform.</li>
                            <li>The recovery of coliform from food or water above a certain numerical limits implies that diseases causing organism may be present and the food is potentially dangerous for human consumption.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Differentiation of faecal from non faecal coliform:-</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In many laboratories differentiation of faecal coliforms from non faecal coliform is considered of limited value in determining the suitability of water or food for human consumption, as contamination with either type renders water or food potentially dangerous and unsafe from a sanitary stand point. However, differentiation may be advantageous under some conditions where the identity of specific members of the group present may indicate the source of pollution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Coliform such as a aerogenes and E. freundui only occessionally found in the intertinal contents of man and animans ( $6 \%$ ). They are normally found in soil. Therefore, there presence in food or water is of doubtful sanitary significance.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On the other hand E.coli, rarely found in the soil but constitute the predominant organisms in the intestinal contents of man and animals. Therefore, isolation E.coli in food may strongly suggest the food has been polluted with feaces than isolation of A.aerogenes or E.freundii.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Methods used for differentiation of faecal from non faecal coliforms indole, methyl red, voges proskauer, citrate test (IMVic). IMvic test is one of the test used to differentiate faecal coliforms (E.coli) from non faecal coliforms (A.aerogenes and E.freundsi) as shown in the table below.</p>

                            <li>This method is based on the assumption that the microbial cells present in a sample mixed with an agar medium each form visible, separated colonies.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This is obtained by mixing decimal dilutions of the food sample homogenatte or warer with the medium</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After incubation of the plates at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ 72 hours the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria per g of food sample is calculated from the number of colonies Obtained in selected petridishes at levels of dilutions giving a significant result.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Microbial cells often occur as clumps, clusters, chains, or pairs in foods, and may not be well distributed irrespective of the mixing and dilution of the sample.</li>
                            <li>Consequently, each colony that appears of the agar plate may arise from a single cell or from groups of cell and Moreover, some microorganisms may fail to grow and form visible colonies on the agar medium as a result of unfavourable conditions of temperature, oxygen or nutrition, or because the cells are weak.</li>
                            <li>Hence the colony count may nor reflect the actual number of viable bacteria in the food.</li>

                        <p><strong>Incubation</strong></p>
                        <p>Incubate broth tubes overnight at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
                        <p><strong>Confirmation</strong></p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>After incubation, streak a loopful of the culture from the three highest dilutions of GSTB showing growth onto TCBS agar plates.</li>
                            <li>Incubate the plates for 18 hours at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</li>
                            <li>The colonies of V.parahaemolyticus on TCBS appear round, $2-3 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter with green or blue centres. V.alginolyticus colonies are larger and yellow. Coliforms, proteus and enterococci colonies are small and translucent.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>Biochemical identification</strong></p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>TSI : Streak the slant and stab the butt and incubate overnight at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. V.parahaemolyticus produces alkaline slant and acid butt, no gas and no $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ (typical shigella-like reaction).</li>
                            <li>Motility medium: inoculate 4 tubes by stabbing. Diffuse circular growth occurs after 24 hours incubation at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</li>
                            <li>Make a Gram stain from growth on TSA slant.</li>
                            <li>Halophilic nature: inoculate 4 tubes of STB containing $0,6,8$ and $10 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$, incubate; V.parahaemolyticus will grow well in 6 and $8 \% \mathrm{NaCl}$ but not in 0 and 10% concentrations.</li>

                            <li>Carbohydrate fermentation: Inoculate one tube each of glucose, lactose, sucrose, maltose, mannitol, etc. from TSA saint. After incubation check for acid production.</li>
                            <li>Glucose fermentation: stab 2 subes of HLGB medium, overlay one tube with sterile paraffin oil and incubate for 2 day at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. yellow coloration of both tubes indicates fermentation, in the tube without oil only indicates oxidation. V.paraphaemolyticus is a glucose fermenter producing no gas.</li>
                            <li>Cytochrome oxidase test: Allow 2-3 drops of alphanaphthol solution to flow over a fresh slant of V.parahaemolyticus or over a colony on a plate, then follow this by an equal amount of phenylenediamine solution. The development of dark blue colour within 2 minute is positive LDC</li>
                            <li>Growth at $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$: incubate an inoculated TSB at $42^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a water bath for 24 hours.</li>
