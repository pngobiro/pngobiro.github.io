\section*{BACTERIOLOGY}

This is the study of bacteria MORPHOLOGY OF BACTERIA
- Bacteria are free living microscopic, unicellular organisms capable of performing all the essential functions of life e.g growth, metabolism and reproduction.
- They poses both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) and lack chlorophyll.
- Belong to the kingdom Protista
- This kingdom has further been divided into eukaryotes and prokaryotes

\section*{CONT'}
- Bacteria is a prokaryote.
- The approximate size is 1 micrometre in diameter.
- Grows on ordinary media
- Replication is by binary fission
- Has no endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes free in the cytoplasm or attached to the cell membrane, no mitochondria present

\section*{SHAPE OF BACTERIA}

Bacteria exist in different shapes.
1. Cocci-are round or oval cells
- Diagram (coccus)
- 2. Bacilli-are rod or stick-shaped
- Diagram (bacillus)
- In some of the bacilli the length of the cells may be equal to width. Such forms are known as coccobacilli
- Diagram (coccobacillus)
- 3. Vibrios-are curved or comma shaped
- diag (vibrio)
- 4. Spirilla-are non-flexuous spiral forms with one to three fixed curves in their rigid bodies
- Diag (spirillum)

\section*{CONT'}
- 5.Spirochaetes-are slender and flexuous spiral forms
- Diag (spirochaete)
- 6. Mycoplasma-are cell wall deficient organisms. Therefore, they do not posses stable morphology. They occur as round or oval bodies or as interlacing filaments.

\section*{GROUP PATTERNS}
- The most frequent method of reproduction among bacteria is asexual binary fission, that is, each cell splits in half, forming two new cells. As they increase in number they form distinct groups.

\section*{ANATOMY OF A BACTERIAL CELL-}
- ASSIGNMENT
- Draw a well labelled diagram of a bacterial cell
- Read and make notes on bacterial growth curve

\section*{REQUIREMENT FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF BACTERIA}
- For their optimal growth, bacteria require proper nutrients, oxygen, pH and temperature. Most of the bacteria of medical importance will grow only if a source of organic material as a nutrient is available.
- Bacteria also require a source of nitrogen and a number of salts to have a supply of Potassium, Magnesium, Iron, Phosphate and Sulphate.
- Minor concentrations of Calcium and Manganese are also required whereas growth is facilitated when trace quantities of Cobalt, Zinc, Chlorine, Copper and Nickel are present in the medium.

\section*{1. Oxygen}
- The need of Oxygen for a particular bacterium reflects it's mechanism to meet the requirement of energy. On this basis, bacteria have been divided into 4 groups:
- Obligate anaerobes-these grow only under conditions of high reducing intensity. These bacteria lack catalase, Peroxiadase, Superoxide dismutase and cytochrome systems.
- Facultative anaerobes-can grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and include members of family enterobacteriaceae and many others
- Obligatory aerobes-cannot grow unless oxygen is present in the medium e.g Pseudomonas
- Microaephilic-can grow under conditions with low oxygen tension e.g Clostridium tetani

\section*{2. Temp}

In regard to temperature, 3 groups are recognized
- Psychrophilic-grow in the range of 5-30 degrees celcius with an optimum of 10-20 degrees
- Mesophilic-grow best at 20-40 degrees with a range of 10-45 degrees.
- All the medically important bacteria belong to this group. The optimum temp is 37 degrees
- Thermophillic organisms-prefer high temperature 25-80 degrees for growth and yield maximum growth at 50-60 degrees

\section*{3) $\mathbf{P H}$}
- -The pH range tolerated by most bacteria extends over 3-4 units but rapid growth is confined for 1 unit or less. Most pathogenic bacteriaa require a pH of 7.27.6 for their optimal growth.
- Some like Lactobacilli grow at acidic pH while cholera vibrio grow at alkaline pH .
4) Carbon dioxide-some organisms such as pneumococci and gonococci grow better in air supplemented with 5-10\% carbon dioxide

\section*{Light and other Radiations}
- Darkness provides a favourable condition for growth and viability of bacteria. UV rays from direct sunlight or a mercury lump are bacteriacidal. Bacteria are also killed by ionizing radiations.

\section*{IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA}
- Suitable criteria for the purpose of microbial identification include cell shape, gram reaction and the prescence or absence of specialized structures such as spores or flagella.
- Most important duty of a medical microbiologist is isolation and accurate identification of disease causing micro-organisms from morbid material and its antibiotic susceptibility.

\section*{CONT'}
- Identification of the isolate is carried out by examination of stained and unstained smears of the morbid material, isolation in pure culture, study of macro and microscopic morphology of the isolate and biochemical characteristics.
- Finally antibiotic susceptibility of the isolate is carried out and specific chemotherapy initiated.

\section*{CONT'}
- There are various techniques used:
i) Unstained Wet Film
- Also called hanging drop.
- Examined under a light microscope or dark-ground microscope for observation and demonstration of motility.

\section*{ii) Staining techniques}
a) Gram stain
- Most frequently used in diagnostic bacteriology. Dyes are used.
- On the basis of their reaction to the gram stain, bacteria can be divided into two:
$\checkmark$ Gram positive
$\checkmark$ Gram negative
The gram positive retain the dye while the gram negative do not

\section*{b)Ziehl-Neelsen stain}
- Next to gram stain, this is the method that is most frequently used in diagnostic bacteriology.
- It is of value in distinguishing a few bacterial species e.g tubercle bacilli, atypical mycobacteria, lepra bacilli and Nocardia

\section*{MYCOLOGY}

Mycology is the study of fungi.

\section*{Morphology}

Fungi are a group of non-motile eukaryotic organisms which exist as saprophytes, parasites or commensals.
They lack chlorophyll and reproduce by means of spores or candida. They produce sexually or asexually.

\section*{Classification of Fungi}

On the basis of morphology, there are 4 groups of fungi:
1) Yeasts-are round, oval or elongated unicellular fungi. Most reproduce by an asexual process called budding in which the cell develops a protuberance which enlarges and seperates from parent cell. (diag-stages of budding)

\section*{2)Yeast-like}
- The bud remains attached to the mother cell and elongates, followed by repeated budding, forming chains of elongated cells known as pseudohyphae. Some produce true hyphae.
- Diag-pseudohyphae
- 3)Moulds
- In moulds, spores germinate to produce branching filaments called hyphae. (Singular hypha) They are $2-10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter.
- They may be septate or nonseptate (coenocytic)
- (diag-septate and aseptate)

\section*{CONT'}
- The hyphae continue to grow and branch to form tangled mass of growth called mycelium.
-(Diag)
-4)Dimorphic fungi-have a yeast form in the host tissue and in media which is enriched and at temp of 37, but in media at temp of 25 they have hyphal (mycelia) form
