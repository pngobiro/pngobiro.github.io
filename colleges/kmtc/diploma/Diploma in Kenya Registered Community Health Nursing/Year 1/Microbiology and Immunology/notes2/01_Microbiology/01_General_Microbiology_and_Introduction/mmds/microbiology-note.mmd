\section*{MICROBIOLOGY}
- Is the study of small living organism.
- Micro means very small and can be viewed by use of microscope.
- Bio means living organism.
- Ology mean study of.

\title{
HISTORY OF MICROBIOLOGY
}
${ }^{-}$Long ago it was known that some disease could be transmitted from one person to another e.g. leprosy, plague, small pox which was eradicated in 1979 .
- Microbiology developed in to science.
${ }^{-}$Inquisitive question raised thus answers were sought about every day event e.g. why does milk ferment? How people who are recovering from cow pox do not get small pox? What were the causes of anthrax? where does microorganisms that contaminate food come from?

\section*{ROBERT HOOK}
- Lived from 1635-1703.
- Was the first to describe simple moulds growing on leather.
- He suggested that the moulds were seeds similar to those found on top of mushroom.

\section*{ANTONY VAN LECUWENHOCK}
*Was known as microbic hunter or father of microbiology
${ }^{\circ}$ He lived in Holland as a business manager of a shop
${ }^{\circ}$ He invented lenses and started looking at things as glass magnified them.
${ }^{-}$In 1667 he described bacteria using a simple primitive microscope. This lens could magnify 300 times normal size the size of a pin head.
observed materials placed on the pin head, he discovered the microscope hence father of microbiology.

\section*{CONT..............}
${ }^{\text {- }}$ He wrote letters to the society of Lagga which convinced scientist of the $18{ }^{\text {th }}$ century about the existence of microorganism.
- Described small animals as animalcules. He did not speculate or associate there origin as causing disease.
- The causes of disease in relation with animalcules was started in the $19{ }^{\text {th }}$ century.
- He was the first person to describe three shapes of bacteria:
- rod shapes- bacilli
- Spherical shaped- cocci
- Spiral shaped- cock screw.
${ }^{-}$He also discovered Protozoa, sperms, blood and blood cells.

\section*{LOUIS PASTEUR(1833-1895)}
- He was educated in chemistry.
- In $19{ }^{\text {th }}$ he studied microbiology in relation to animalcules .
- Many other sciencetist experimented about spontaneous creatures in infected wounds, fermenting grain, decaying meat they wondered how decaying occurred.
- They believed that life could develop spontaneously from decomposing organisms.
- This was the concept of abiogenesis or spontaneous generation.

\section*{CONT....................}
${ }^{-}$Louis disapproved this and came up with the theory of biogenesis which explain that there must be same air for life to exist.
- He investigated spoiling of bear and wine which is referred to as germ theory of fermentation.
${ }^{-}$He concluded that sugar of ferment served as the food of micro-organism
- He said that each ferment is caused by specific organism that develop and grows only when the specific requirement of its well being are met.

\section*{CONT......................}
- Sugar was converted by this organism to alcohol.
- Yeast naturally occur on skin of grapes fruits and grains.
- Some other contaminants bacteria may change alcohol aseptic acid or vinegar which ruins the taste of wine.
- To eliminate these bacteria from wine and bear pasture heated it at temperature of 120c-140c and the process is known as pasteuration.

\section*{CONT..............}
${ }^{\bullet}$ For milk he heated at a temperature of 68c for 30mins or at a temperature of 72c for a period of 15 mins
${ }^{-}$He extended this theory from animal to human and stated that a specific disease is caused by a specific type of micro-organism.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ He invented a method to culture organism where they don seem to be.
- He invented methods on how to weaken or attenuate micro-organism by vaccination hence became the father of immunology.
${ }^{\bullet}$ He discovered rabbis vaccine in 1885.

\section*{JOHN TYNDAL-1820-1893}
${ }^{\bullet}$ He continued with the work of Pasteur
${ }^{\bullet}$ He discovered that bacteria endospores are extremely heat resistance.
*When spores are exposed to heat briefly, they germinate into vegetative form of bacteria.
*Subsequently, boiling killed the newly formed vegetative form of bacteria. he advised an alternative sequent of heat that killed all bacteria present.
${ }^{-}$He said that solutions to be treated are heated at 80c-100c for several minutes then incubated at 30c-37c for 24 hours on 3 days- tyndallisation.
${ }^{\bullet}$ This allows the endospores to germinate when boiled for the first time then killed by next boiling.

\section*{ROBERT KOCH-18991910}
${ }^{-}$He was a physician and was a rural doctor whose interest in disease lead him to investigate anthrax.
- He showed that anthrax was caused by bacteria
${ }^{-}$He grew the anthrax bacilli in pure culture and showed that it caused anthrax
- He had resistance known as Julius Petri and developed a petri dish that is used for microbial growth for solid medium
${ }^{-}$He proved that a specific disease was caused by a specific micro-organism in a scientific procedure known as Koch's pastulates.

\section*{CONT......................}
- Microorganism must be present in all cases of disease and must not be present in a healthy animal.
- Microorganisms must be isolated from the diseased animals and grown in pure culture.
- Microorganism in this pure culture must cause the same disease when inoculated in healthy animal.
- The experimentally infected animals must contain microorganism which must be recovered again in pure culture.
- The pastulate become the scientific approach in demonstrating the infectious for a disease.

\section*{EXCEPTION OF KOCH'S}
- Some people are healthy carriers of diseases but don't show symptoms.
- Some microorganism are difficult to be grown such as most viruses, leprosy and syphilis.
- Most of this microorganism may be grown in tissue culture such as egg embryo, scrotum of rabbits.
- In HIV human lymphocytes are required to act as culture for it to grow.
- Koch discovered vibro cholerae, tuba cal bacilli(cocci bacilli) that causes TB and anthrax bacilli.

\section*{EDWARD JENNER 19491823}
- He was a rural doctor.
- He observed that dairy maids contracted cowpox which from infected cows which had lesions on their teats never contracted small pox even from infected family member.
- He become convinced that patient who were recovering from cow pox where were ale to resist small pox.
${ }^{-}$In 1796 he used cowpox virus to vaccine people suffering from small pox and discovered small vaccine.

\section*{EMIL VEN BEHRIN}
- Made toxoids of diphtheria and tetanus toxins thus started the use of anti-toxin.

\section*{SEMEMELIREIS}
${ }^{\bullet}$ Showed that puerperal sepsis was caused by infected agencies in the mother or hands of midwifes and doctors thus emphasized on washing hands before delivery thus become the founder of disinfection.

\section*{JOSEPH LISTER}
- Showed that there were fewer infection if instrument was boiled and disinfected.

\section*{UNITS OF MEASUREMENT}
${ }^{\text {0 }}$ The metric measurement are used to describe the size of microorganism.
- A metre is the basic units.
- Metre is divided to $10 \mathrm{dm}, 100 \mathrm{~cm}, 1000 \mathrm{~mm}$, one million micrometer, and one thousand million nanometer.

\section*{CONT....................}
- Bacteria- 2 micrometer .
- Virus- 0.05-0.15 nanometer.
- Protozoa- 2000 nanometer.
- Red blood cells- 10 nanometer.
- Size of microorganism is calculated by use of a microscope and a device called micrometer and the procedure is called calibration.

\section*{IDENTIFICATION}
- Shape.
- Is the first clue to identification e.g. bacteria may be spherical (cocci), Rod shaped ( bacillus) and coma shaped.

\section*{CONT......................}
- Size
- Some cannot viewed by bright field microscope but by dark build microscope e.g. tryponema pallidium.
- Cellular arrangement.
${ }^{\bullet}$ This method concentrate on how the cells are arranged e.g. some grow in pairs, clusters, chains and others have internal and external structures e.g. flagella and fimbria.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Form and structure.
- Most bacteria divide by binary fusion (mitosis) and is a process of division which results in to two equal daughter cells.
- A few bacteria cells reproduce by budding to [produce daughter cells of equal size.

\section*{CONT \\ \section*{Motility:}}
- Bacteria cells with curved cells move with polar flagella which produce movement.
- Use of simple stains.
- Bacteria structure are stained with chemical dyes to make them more visible in bright field microscope.
- Procedure in which a single dye is used to stain a cell is called simple stain.
- Many of the useful bacteria stains are positively charged chemicals e.g. crystal violet, basic fuschin and methyline blue.
- The basic dye react with negative charged component to color the cells. Spores can be stained by malachite green only after significant heat is applied to penetrate the pores e.g. differential stain, acid fast acid stains and gram stain.

\section*{CONT.......................}

\section*{Gram stain.}
- Gram is the person who developed differential stain procedure in 1884 as a means of identifying cocci in lung tissue which was taken from patient who died of pneumonia.
- Gram stain is used today to determine gram negative and positive.
${ }^{-}$The bacteria to be stained are spread on a microscopic slide and air dried.
- The slide is slightly heated over a low flame to fix the bacteria to the slide.
${ }^{-}$A drop of crystoviloet is supplied to the smear for a short time before it washed of the slide with water.
${ }^{-}$The crystal violet stain both cell type positive and negative blue.
- Grams iodine solution is then added to the slide which acct as a fixative by combining with crystal violet..

\section*{CONT...................}
${ }^{-}$The film is washed with water again dried and treated with alcohol or acetone until no more of this dyes is able to come out in a process called discoloration
${ }^{-}$During discolourization the blue crystal violet iodine complex is washed out of the gram negative cells. The slide is counter stained with safranin.
${ }^{\text {0 }}$ The gram positive cell remain blue violet through out this procedure since they retain crystal violet stain.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ The gram negative cells initially stained blue but loose the crystal violet when washed with alcohol or acetone.
- The safranin counter stain or convert the colorless gram negative cells to a red color that makes them visible under the light microscope.
${ }^{-}$Most bacterial species are either positive or negative.

\section*{ACID FAST STAIN}
${ }^{-}$It is a differential stain used to identify mycobacterium spices.
- Acid fast bacterial contain wax like material that bind a primary dye even when they are washed with acidified alcohol.
${ }^{-}$In the ziehl Nelson acid fast stain the cell are treated with hot carblofulschin.
- Non acid fast bacteria are initially stained with red dye but are decolorized when they are washed with acidified alcohol.
- Methylene blue is used to counter stain the non acid bacteria. When an acid fast stain is done on a sample of human sputum, the microbacteria are red while the tissue cell and non acid fast bacteria are blue.

\section*{OTHER METHODS OF IDENTIFICATION}
- Metabolic reaction.
- Bacteria produce secretion which are specific that increase the virulence of the microorganism e.g. some produce pus, enzyme(staphylococci) Toxin(streptococci), clostridium.

\section*{PHYSIOLOGY OF MICROORGANISM}
- It is similar with organism cells.
- Majority of microbes are aerobes, this mean they grow best in an atmosphere that contain oxygen
- Anaerobe bacteria grow in the absence of oxygen.
- Obligate anaerobe die if the are exposed to oxygen.
- Facultative anaerobe can survive in an atmosphere having oxygen or no oxygen.
- All bacteria require temperature of 37 degrees centigrade but some can grow in dry condition e.g. rode shaped bacilli, other can only survive in moisture e.g. HIV/AIDS.

${ }^{-}$The diseases caused by fungi is called mycosis.
${ }^{-}$Fungi are microorganism that are incapable of producing their own food and live on decay organic material.
- Structure-Fungi have along branching fill lament( hyphae ) that branch and form a network which called mycelium
${ }^{-}$Reproduction- produce sexually by spores where there is fusion.
${ }^{-}$Also reproduce a sexually by nuclei where there is no fusion.

\section*{CONT...............}
${ }^{\text {- }}$ PATHOGENISIS GROUP.
- Mycotic diseases/ fungal diseases-
- Are caused by yeast and moulds.
- Produce agglutination reaction in the host resulting in tissue granules.
- Fungi generally don't produce toxin like bacteria.
${ }^{-}$Groups of fungi- are four groups:
- Fillamental fungi moles
${ }^{\bullet}$-Form branching tubular filament which are interwoven in to a myserium.
- They produce asexual spore of many kinds.
- Moulds are the main source of antibiotic.
- Yeast-
- are single round or oval cells.
- Response produce by forming small lateral buds that enlarge and develop in to new cells.
- Yeast like fungi-
- medically important is called Candida which can reproduce by budding , the buds tend to elongate in to filaments which remain linked together in chain that have some resemblance to mould myserium.
- Common yeast ferment sugar to alcohol and rise bled during backing
- Dimorphic fungi-
- it has a yeast morphology in tissue of when growing cultures at 37degress.

- Entering human blood as a minute spidal shaped sporozoite.
- The plasmodium pass to the liver where they develop in to large multicelullar schizoids usually after five to ten days of infection.
- this schizoitess develop in to many merozoites and is called preerythrolytic cycle before entering RBC
- Some of the merozoits reenter the liver and the site is now called exoerythrolytic cycle.
- Cycle is repeat over and over except in plasmodium falciparum

\section*{GAMETOCYTES}
${ }^{-}$This sexual forms are sucked by female anopheles mosquito.

\section*{DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BACTERIA AND VIRUSES}

\section*{bacteria}
- Have cell wall
- Large in size
- Contain RNA and DNA molecules
- Multiply by binary fusion
- Grow in inanimate calcium media
- Have ribosome.
- Are sensitive.

\section*{viruses}
- Have envelope/ cuspid.
- Small in size.
- Contain either RNA or DNA molecules but not both
- Replicate inside bacteria and animal
- Cannot survive in inanimate calcium media
- Have no ribosome
- Not sensitive.

\section*{VIRUS}
${ }^{-}$Infective agent smaller than bacteria.
${ }^{-}$DNA and RNA are information molecules of a cell.
- DNA contain genetic information for the production of essential protein that will enable the cells to function properly.
${ }^{-}$RNA is a nucleic acid necessary for protein synthesis.
${ }^{-}$All the biological information the cell need for growth and reproduction is stored in DNA.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Genetic material of most viruses is either double stranded DNA or single stranded RNA.
- Viruses vary in size, appearance and behavior.
- Complete infective particle of the virus is known as virion.
${ }^{\bullet}$ Virion is protected by closed protein called cupsid.

\section*{REPRODUCTION}
- Viruses are not complete there fore cannot reproduce y themselves. They attach the permissive receptor of the host cell membrane and inject RNA or DNA which then takes control of the living cell.
- Viral genetic material is injected from the cupsid to the recipient cell through it is tail.
${ }^{\bullet}$ The viral particle does the following-
- Alter protein synthesis.
- Alter the gene of the host.
- Causes chromosomal changes.
${ }^{\bullet}$ The cell then synthesizes new viral protein and nucleic acid, the process continues until the cell raptures releasing new infective virions.
${ }^{\bullet}$ The cupcid of the virus have varions.

\section*{POLYHEDRAL}
- Many sided
- Helicle
- Bullet shaped.
- Spherical
- Each facet has several cupsomeres.
- Some virus have 20 sites.
- The virus that infect the bacteria is called bacteriophages.

\section*{COMMON DNA VIRUSES}
- Pox virus- cause small pox and cow pox
- Papilloma virus- cause warts, tumours and cancers .
${ }^{-}$Herpes virus-
- cause oral lesions called sole, fever.
- Herpes zoosta- causes shingles which follows the nerve part of the body infected and common in HID/AIDS.

- Picorna virus
- Rheo virus
- Arbo virus
- retro virus
- Ebola virus

\section*{EBOLA VIRUSES}
${ }^{\text {- }}$ Ebola is a river in Zaire and Ebola virus occurred as a hymnologic in Sudan and Zaire in 1976.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ In Zaire 200 people died out of 300 people while in Sudan 30 people died out of 70 people.
- It is transmitted through body contacts
- Once Ebola virus has been transmitted through contact of unknown reservoir they adopt themselves from direct to direct which introduce severe infection or out break.
${ }^{-}$Is a filo virus of the family of filo viridae.
${ }^{-}$It is an RNA and enveloped with a characteristic of filamental structure.
${ }^{-}$It has four known stray or species
- Zaire, Sudan, Reston and ivory cost.
- The actual distribution is unknown.
${ }^{\text {- }}$ In April 2001 Ebola virus occurred in Gulu district and was found to e caused by Sudan species.
- Transmission is contact $\qquad$ or any organ of the infected person . Injuries with needle or handling body fluids with out protection, handling of dead bodies of suspected victim should be discouraged.

\section*{SIGNS OF EBOLA}
