                        <p>Good quality of water is odorless, colorless, tasteless and free from fecal pollution and harmful chemicals.</p>
                        <p>Human illness is caused by water supplies becoming contaminated from feces being passed or washed into rivers, streams, or being allowed to seep into wells.</p>
                        <p>Feces contain microorganisms like Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringens, which contaminate safe water.</p>
                        <p>Determining whether a water supply is fecally polluted is to test for the presence of normal fecal organism.</p>
                        <p>Testing for normal fecal organisms as indicators of fecal pollution is a reliable way of determining whether water is bacteriologically safe to drink.</p>
                        <p>A single laboratory examination of any water does not justify the conclusion that the supply is safe for drinking so bacteriologic analysis of water should be performed at regular intervals.</p>
                        <p>Organisms used as indicators of fecal pollution are the coliform group particularly E. coli.<br>
                        E. coli is a coliform organism, which is capable of fermenting lactose with the production of acid and gas at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $44^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in less than 48 hours, produces indole in tryptophan-containing peptone water and gives positive result in methyl red test.</p>
                        <p>When organisms of coliform group other than E.coli are found in a water sample, Presence of S.faecalis confirms fecal pollution of water.<br>
                        The presence of C . perfringens in the absence of coliform group in water suggests fecal pollution of water at some remote date since cloostridial spores are capable of surviving in water for a long duration.</p>
