                        <p>The world pandemic of AIDS has been with us for more than twenty five years and shows no signs of abatement. Three million people around the world die of AIDS each year and, so far, more than 25 million people have died of the disease. Today, at least 33 million people are infected and there are more than 14,000 new infections every day.</p>
                        <p>AIDS is caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) which is found in all cases of the disease. The primary targets of HIV are activated CD4+ T4 helper lymphocytes but the virus can also infect several other cell types including macrophages. It is the loss of T4 helper lymphocytes that leads to immunosuppression in the patient and the consequent fatal opportunistic infections.</p>
                        <p>HIV is a lentivirus, a class of retrovirus. The name lentivirus means slow virus, so called because these viruses take a long time to cause overt disease.</p>
                        <p>Most lentiviruses target cells of the immune system and thus disease is often manifested as immunodeficiency.</p>
                        <p>There are five known serogroups of lentivirus that infect primates, sheep and goats, horses, cats, and cattle.</p>
                        <p>Two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. These cause clinically indistinguishable disease, although the time to disease onset is longer for HIV-2.</p>
                        <p>The worldwide epidemic of HIV and AIDS is caused by HIV-1 while HIV-2 is mostly restricted to west Africa.</p>
                        <p>Lentiviruses integrate into the host cell genome as a provirus in the same manner as other retroviruses</p>
                        <p>HIV can lie dormant in the proviral form within a cell for many years, especially in resting (memory) CD4+ T4 lymphocytes, and may set up a lifelong infection. When these cells become reactivated, viral production occurs again and ultimately destroys the cell.</p>
                        <p>Although HIV may disappear from the cells of the circulation, replication and budding continue to occur in other tissues in the absence of chemotherapy.</p>
                        <p>HIV can be detected by the presence of anti-HIV antibodies or by the presence of the virus itself using (PCR) that detects viral RNA.</p>
                        <p>From the original infection, there is usually a period of 8 to 10 years before the clinical manifestations of AIDS occur; however, this period may be two years or less. Approximately 10% of patients succumb to AIDS within 2 to 3 years.</p>

                        <p>This period lasts for 6 to 12 weeks after initial infection until antiHIV antibodies are detectable.</p>
                        <p>If acquired by sexual activity, the virus enters the body in infected macrophages in semen or vaginal secretions. Dendritic cells in the mucosal linings bind the virus shed by macrophages and carry it to the lymph nodes where $\text{CD4}^{+}\text{T4}$ cells become infected. During the course of the disease, the virus migrates to other cell types.</p>
                        <p>Initially, HIV infection produces a mild disease that is selflimiting. This is not seen in all patients and about 30% remain asymptomatic during the initial period of infection. In the period immediately after infection, virus titer rises (about 4 to 11 days after infection) and continues at a high level over a period of a few weeks.</p>
                        <p>Patient experiences some symptoms (fever, rash, swollen lymph glands) but none of these is life-threatening. There is an initial fall in the number of $\text{CD4}^{+}$ cells and a rise in $\text{CD8}^{+}$ cells but they quickly return to near normal. At this stage virus titers are very high with as many as one hundred million virus particles per milliliter of plasma.</p>
                        <p>There is a "window period" of seronegativity during which an infected person does not give a positive western blot HIV test or ELISA, even though the viral load is high and the patient may exhibit some symptoms.</p>
                        <p>This seronegative period can last for six months before seroconversion although the latter usually occurs between one and four weeks after infection.</p>

                        <p>Cytotoxic B and T lymphocytes mount a strong defense and virus largely disappears from the circulation. After the increased cell-mediated immune response, there is a rise in humoral antibodies. During this period of strong immune response to the virus, more than 10 billion new HIV particles are produced each day but they are rapidly cleared by the immune system and have a half life of only 5 to 6 hours.</p>
                        <p>At this stage, most of this virus is coming from recently infected proliferating $\text{CD4}^{+}$ cells. Thus, the virus is destroying the very cells that are proliferating to protect against it. The infected cells that are producing this virus are destroyed either by the immune system or by the virus and have a half life about 1 day. However, the rate of production of $\text{CD4}^{+}$ cells can compensate for the loss of cells and a steady state is set up in which most CD4+ cells are uninfected.</p>
                        <p>Although activated, proliferating CD4+ cells are destroyed by the immune system, a small fraction of the infected cells survive long enough to revert back to the resting memory state (as do non-infected $\text{CD4}^{+}$ memory cells). The resting memory cells (also referred to as anamnestic T cells) do not express viral antigens but do carry a copy of the HIV genome which remains latent until the cells are reactivated by antigen. These memory cells may survive many years and constitute a reservoir that is very important in drugbased therapy.</p>
                        <p>During this period, the virus disseminates to other regions including to lymphoid and nervous tissue. This is the most infectious phase of the disease.</p>

                        <p>As a result of the strong immune defence, the number of viral particles in the blood stream declines and the patient enters clinical latency.</p>
                        <p>Little virus can now be found in the bloodstream or in peripheral blood lymphocytes and, initially, the number of blood CD4+ cells is only slightly decreased.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, the virus persists elsewhere, particularly in lymph nodes and here viral replication continues</p>
                        <p>Although the number of HIV particles in the bloodstream is much reduced during clinical latency, the virus is detectable.</p>
                        <p>After the initial peak of virus, the virus reaches a "set point" during latency. This set point predicts the time of onset of clinical disease.</p>
                        <p>With less than 1000 copies/ml of blood, disease will probably occur with a latency period of more than 10 years. With less than 200 copies/ml, disease does not appear to occur at all.</p>
                        <p>Most patients with more than 100,000 copies per ml, lose their CD4+ cells more rapidly and progress to AIDS before 10 years.</p>

                        <p>One reason that the immune system fails to control HIV infection is that the $\text{CD4}^{+}$ T helper cells are the target of the virus. Also follicular dendritic cells can be infected with HIV and these also diminish in number over time.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, dendritic cells present antigen to $\text{CD4}^{+}$ cells and may bring the virus into contact with these cells at the time that they are stimulated to proliferate by antigen.</p>
                        <p>During the course of infection, there is a profound loss of the specific immune response to HIV because:</p>

                        <p>During the course of HIV infection, most CD4+ cells are never actually infected by the virus but die from some other means.</p>

                        <p>The period of clinical latency varies in length from as little as 1 to 2 years to more than 15 years. Onset of AIDS is rare in less than 3 years except in children.</p>
                        <p>Eventually, the virus can no longer be controlled as helper CD4+ (T4) cells are destroyed. Ironically, the killer cells needed to control HIV also damage the helper T cells that they need to function efficiently.</p>
                        <p>With the lack of $\text{CD4}^{+}$ cells, new cytotoxic T cell responses cannot occur as helper cells are lacking and such new responses are required as the virus mutates. As the CD4+ cells fall below 200 per cu mm, virus titers rise rapidly and immune activity drops precipitously.</p>
                        <p>It is the loss of immune competence that enables normally benign opportunistic parasites such as viruses, fungi or protozoa to cause infections</p>
                        <p>Once AIDS develops, patients rarely survive more than two years without chemotherapeutic intervention.</p>
                        <p>There is considerable variability at this stage. Some patients with clinical AIDS do survive for several years while others who appear relatively healthy can suddenly succumb to a major opportunistic infection.</p>
                        <p>It is the onset of HIV-associated cancers and opportunistic infections that defines AIDS proper. At this stage, also, syncytiuminducing HIV appear in many (about half) AIDS patients. These are more CD4+ cell tropic than the initially infecting HIV and this contributes to the rapid loss of CD4+ cells in later stages of the disease.</p>
