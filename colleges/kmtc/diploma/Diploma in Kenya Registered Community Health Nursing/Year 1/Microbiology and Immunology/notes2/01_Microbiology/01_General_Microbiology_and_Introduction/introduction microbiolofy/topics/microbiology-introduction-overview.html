                        <p>During this time knowledge on public sanitation and transmission was lost in Europe and there was a general stagnation of culture and learning and it went on for about 1000 yrs</p>

                        <p>Due to the negligence of public health, epidemics increased eg small pox, syphilis, rabies. This led to the early practioners to start thinking of the sources and transmission of these diseases. Most people believed that the diseases were curses from gods and started crude methods of treatment eg bleeding.</p>
