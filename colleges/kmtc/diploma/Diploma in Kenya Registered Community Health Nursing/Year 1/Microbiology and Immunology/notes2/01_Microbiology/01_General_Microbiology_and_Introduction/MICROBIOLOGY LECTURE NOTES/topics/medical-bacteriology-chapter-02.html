                        <ul>
                            <li>If pathogens are to be isolated successfully, the type of specimen, its collection, time and method of its dispatch to the laboratorty must be correct.</li>
                            <li>Adequate information about the patient's condition and antimicrobial treatment must also be sent in the Specimen.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Type of specimen</h3>
                        <p>The correct type of specimen to be collected will depend on the pathogens to be isolated.</p>
                        <p>For example: a cervical not a vaginal swab is required for the most successful isolation of N. gonorrhoeae from a woman.<br>:sputum not a saliva is essential for the isolation of respiratory pathogens.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Time of collection</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Specimens such as urine and sputum are best collected soon after a patient wakes when organisms have had the opportunity to multiply over several hours.</li>
                            <li>Blood for culture is usually best collected when a patient's temperature begins to rise.</li>
                            <li>The time of collection for most other speciemens will depend on the condition of the patient, and the time agreed between medical, nursing and laboratory personnel for the delivery of the specimen to the laboratory.</li>
                            <li>Every effort must be made to collect specimens for microbiological investigation before antimicrobial treatment is started.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Collection techniques</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The laboratory should issue written instruction to all those responsible for collecting specimens including staff of wards, out patient clinics and health centres.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Precaution apply to the collection of most microbiological specimens:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Use a collection technicnque that will ensure a specimencontains only those organisms from the site where it was collected.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If contaminating organisms are introduced in to a specimen during its collection or subsequent handling, this may lead to difficulties in the interpretation of cultures and delays in the issuing reports.</li>
                                    <li>A strictly sterile (aseptic) procedure is essential when collecting from site that are normally sterile.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Example: collection of blood, CSF or effusions<br>This teachings is necessary not only to prevent contamination of the specimen but also protect the patient.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Avoid contaminating discharges or ulcer material with the skin commensals. The swabs used to collect the specimens must be sterile and the absorbent cotton wool from which the swabs are made must be free from antibacterial substances.</li>
                            <li>Collect specimens in sterile, leak- proof, dry containers, free from all traces of disinfectant.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Container must be clean but need not be sterile for the collection of feaces and sputum.</p>
                        <ol start="4">
                            <li>Those responsible for collecting specimens should report any abnormal features, such as coldiness in a specimen which should appear clear, abnormal coloration or presence of pus, blood, mucus or parasites.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Labelling of specimens and sending of a request form</h3>
                        <p>Each specimen must be accompanied by a request form which gives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The patient's name, age (whether an infant, child or adult), number, and ward or health center.</li>
                            <li>Type of specimen and the date and time of it collection.</li>
                            <li>Investigation required</li>
                            <li>Clinical note giving details of the patient's illness, suspected disease, and any antimicrobial treatment that may have been started at home or in the hospital.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Specimen containing dangerous pathogen</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Those delivering, receiving and examining specimens must be informed if a specimen is likely to contain highly infection organisms. Such specimen should be labelled HIGH RISK, and whenever possible carry a warning symbols such as red dot, star or triangle</li>
                            <li>Specimen which should be marked as HIGH RISK include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sputum likely to contain M. tuberculosis</li>
                                    <li>Faecal specimen that may contain V. cholerae</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Preservatives and transport media for microbiological specimen</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In general, specimens for microbiological investigations should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible. This will help to ensure that pathogens are living when they reach the labratory.</li>
                            <li>When a delay in delivery is unavoidable, For example, when transporting a specimen from health center to a hospital laboratory, a suitable chemical preservative or transport culture medium must be used.</li>
                            <li>This will help to prevent organisms from dying due to enzyme action, change of pH, or lack of essential nutrients. Example. Amies transport medium widely used and effective in ensuring the survival of pathogens like the more delicate organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Cary - Blair medium in used as transport medium for faeces that may contain Salmonella, shigella, campylobacter or vibro species.</p>
                        <p>Example of Preservatives include boric acid added to urine and cetylpyridinium- chloride sodium chloride (CPC-Nacl) added to sputum for the isolation of M.tuberculosis.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Transport of microbiological specimens collected in a hospital</h3>
                        <p>Specimen should reach to the laboratory as soon as possible or a suitable preservative or transport medium must be used.<br>
                        Refrigeration at $4-10 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ can help to preserve cells and reduce the multiplication of commensals in unpreserved specimens.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>However, specimens for isolation of Haemophilus, S. pneumoniae or Neisseria species, must never be refrigerated because cold kills these pathogens.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If specimen are to be mailed, the regulations regarding the sending of "pathological specimens" through the post should be obtained from the post office and followed exactly. When dispatching microbilogical speciemens:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Keep a register of all specimens dispatched.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Record Name<br>
                        Number<br>
                        Ward or health centre of the patient.<br>
                        Type of specimen<br>
                        Investigation required<br>
                        Date of dispatch<br>
                        Method of sending the specimen (eg. Mailing, hand-delivery etc.)</p>
                        <ol start="2">
                            <li>Ensure that the specimen container is free from cracks, and the cap is leak proof. Seal round the container cap with adhesive tape to prevent loosening and leakage during transit.</li>
                            <li>If the container is glass tube or bottle, use sufficient packaging material to prefect a specimen.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If the specimen is fluid, use sufficient absorbent materiel to absorb it.</p>
                        <ol start="4">
                            <li>Mark all specimen that may contain highly infectious organism "HIGH RISK"</li>
                            <li>Dispatch slides in a plastic slide continer or use slide carrying box.</li>
                            <li>Label speciments dispetched by mail, "FRAGILE WITH CARE- PATHOLOGICAL SPECIMGN".</li>

                            <li><strong>Culture the specimen</strong>
                                <p>To obtain as pure a culture as possible of a respiratory pathogen it is necessary to reduce the number of commensals inoculated.</p>
                                <p>Ways of reducig commensal numbers include washing the sputum free from saliva or liquefying and diluting it.</p>
                                <p><strong>Blood agar and chocolate agar</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Wash a purulent part of the sputum in about sml of sterile physiological saline.</li>
                                    <li>Inoculate the washed sputum on plates of blood agar and chocolate (heated blood) agar.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Add an optochin disc to the chocolate agar plate. This will help to identity S. pneumonia.</p>
                                <p>Incubate the blood agar plate aerobically and the chocolate agar in a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enriched atmosphere at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for upto 48 hours, examining for growth atfter ovemight incubation.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>About 20 minuets before culturing, decontaminate the specimen by mixing equal volumes of sputum and sodium hydroxide (NaoH) $40 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ or ( $4 \% \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{v}$ ) solution. Shake at intervals to homogenize the sputum.</li>
                                    <li>Using a sterile pasteur pepitte, inoculate $200 \mathrm{Nl}(0.2 \mathrm{ml})$ of the well-mixed homogenized sputum on a slope of acid Lowenstein Jensen medium. Allow the specimen to run down the slope.</li>
                                    <li>Incubate at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{c}-37^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ in a rack placed at an agle of about $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to ensure that the specimen is incontact with the full length of the slops.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>After one week, place the slope in an upright position and continue to incubate, examining twice a week for groth.</p>

                            <li>Inflammation of the meninges (membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord) is called meningitis.
                            <p>Pathogens reach the meninges in the blood stream or occasionally by spreading from nearby sites such as the middle ear or nasal sinuses.</p>
                            <p>Meningitis is described as:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pyogenic (purulent), when the C.S.f contains mainly poly morphonuclear neutrophils (pus cell), as in acute meningitis caused by N. meningitides, H. influenzae and S. pneumonae.</li>
                                <li>Pus cells are also found in the C.S.f in acute amoebic meningoencephalitis.</li>
                                <li>Lymphocytic, when the C.S.f contains mainly lymphocytes, as in meningitis caused by viruses, M. tuberculosis and C. neoformans.</li>
                                <li>Lymphocytes are also found in the C.S.f in trypanosomlasis meningoencephalitis and neurosyphilis.</li>
                                <li>Eosinophilic, when the CSf contain mainly eosinophilus. This rare form of meningitis is caused by helminthes larvae such as Angiostrongylus cantonensis and Dirofilaria imitis</li>
                                <li>Meningitis of the newborn (neonatal meningitis) is caused mainly by E.coli, S. agalactiae (Group B), S. avreus, L. Monocytogenes.</li>
                                <li>Haemophilus meningitis occurs mainly in infants and young children.</li>
                            </ul></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Collection of Csf</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It should be collected by medical officer in aspectic procedure</li>
                            <li>The fluid is usually collected from the arachnoid space. A sterile wide-bore needle is inserted between the $4^{\text {th}}$ and $5^{\text {th}}$ lumbar vertebrate and C.s.f. is allowed to drip into a dry sterile container.</li>
                            <li>A delay in examining C.S.f reduces the chances of isolating a pathogen.</li>
                            <li>It will also lead to a falsely low glucose value due to glycolysis. If typanosomes are present, they will not be found because they are rapidly lyzed once the C.S.f has been withdrawn.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take two sterile, dry, screw-cap containers and label one No 1 (first sample collected, to be used for culture), and the other No 2 (second sample collected, to be used for other investigations).</li>
                            <li>Collect about 1 ml of C.S.f in container No 1 and about $2-3 \mathrm{ml}$ in container No2</li>
                            <li>Deliver immediately the samples with a request form to the laboratory.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Note: It is necessary to culture the C.S.f in the health center because pathogens such as N.meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, are unlikely to survive transport to the bacteriology laboratory.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If unable to perform a cell count and estimate the protein and glucose, transfer C.S.f sample № 2 to a screw-cap bottle containing sodium fluoride exalate and mix This will preserve the cells and prevent the breakdown of glucose. Protein can also be estimated from a floride oxalated specimen.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Laboratory examination of C.S.f</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It should be performed without delay and should be reported micro-organism especially Gram smear. The fluid should be handled with special care because it is collected by lumbar puncture and only a small amount can be withdrawn.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Two samples of C.S.f</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is usual to use sample No 1 for the culture, and sample No 2 for the cell caunt, microscopy and biochemistry.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This is because sample No 1 may contain blood (due to a traumatic lumbar puncture) which will affect the accuracy of the cell count and biochemical estimations.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">I. Describe the appearance of the specimens</h4>
                        <p><strong>Report:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whether the C.S.f is clear, slightly cloudy, cloudy or definitely purulent (looking like pus).</li>
                            <li>If the C.S.f is purulent or markedly cloudy, make immediately a smear for gram staining, and report it as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li>Whether it contain blood and if so whether sample No 2 contains as much blood as sample no 1.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If blood is present in the C.S.f due to a traumatic lumbar puncture, sample No 1 will usually contain more blood than sample No 2.<br>
                        If the blood is due to haemorrahage in the CNS, the two samples will probably appear equally blood-stained.</p>
                        <p>Following a subarachnoid haemorrhoge the fluid may appear xanthochromic, ie. Yellow-red (after centrifuting)<br>
                        The fluid may also appear xanthromic if the patient is jaundiced or when there is spinal constriction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Whether it contains clots</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Clotted C.S.f indicate an increase in fibrinogen.</li>
                            <li>It occurs when there is spinal construction</li>
                            <li>Clots can also be found in C.S.f. from patients with pyogenic meningitis (sterile beads to break the clot)</li>
                            <li>In tuberculosis meningitis, if the C.S.f is allowed to stand for several hours; skin (spider web clot) may form on the surface of the fluid.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This should be transferred to a slide, pressed out, alcoholfixed, and stained by the Ziel-Neelsen method I.</p>

                        <p>It is necessary, if the fluid contains cells and, or, the protein concentration is abnormal.</p>
                        <p>Note: C.S.f should be cultured as soon as possible after collection.</p>
                        <p>If a delay is unavoidable, the fluid should be kept at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (never refrigerated).</p>
                        <p>If the C.S.f appears only slightly cloudy, centrifuge it in a sterile tube for $15-20$ minute and use the sediment for inoculating the plates.</p>

                        </ol>
                        <p>In chronic salmonellosis, bacteria are often more rapidly and successfully isolated from bone marrow, especially once antimicrobial treatment has been started.</p>

                        <p>Neither blood nor bone has a normal microbial flora.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Collection and culture of Blood and Borne marrow</h3>
                        <p>$\checkmark$ Blood and bone marrow require culturing immediately after collection, before clotting occurs.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Choice of culture media</h4>
                        <p>$\checkmark$ Because septicaemia is such a serious condition, it is essential to use media that will provide the fastest growth and isolation of as wide a range of pathogens as possible.<br>
                        $\checkmark$ The following media are suitable for routine culture of blood and bone marrow:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tryptone soya (tryptic soy) diphasic medium</li>
                            <li>Thioglycollate broth medium</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Tryptone soya (tryptic soy) diphasic medium</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A diphasic (two phase) medium is one that combines an agar slope with a broth medium.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Because the bacteria can be seen growing on the slope, the need to subculture on a solid medium every few days is avoided, thus reducing the risk of contamination.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tryptone soya diphasic medium consists of a tryptone soya agar slope and a tryptone soya broth to which is added Liquoid and P-aminobenzoic acid.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Liquoid: It is the commercial name for sodium polyanethol sulphonate. It prevents clotting of the blood and neutralize the natural bactericidal substances in fresh blood.<br>
                        P. Aminobenzoic acid: This neutralizes the action of sulphonamides should these be present in the blood.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tryptone soya diphasic medium is suitable for the growth of a wide range of pathogens.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Incubation in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is required for the culture of brucella species. Strict anaerobes will not grow in this medium.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Thioglycollate broth</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This consists of a nutrient broth to which is added thiogiycollate to provide the condition necessary for the growth of anaerobes. Most aerobic bacteria will also grow in thioglycollates broth.</li>
                            <li>Because liqoid is not added to this medium, a sufficient volume of broth must be used to prevent the blood from clotting and to dilute out the blood's natural bactericidal substances.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The blood should be diluted at least 1 in 10 in the broth.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Examination of Blood and Bone marrow</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Collect and culture the specimen</strong>
                                <p><strong>Blood</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>It should be collected before antimicrobial treatement has been started and at the time the patient's temperature is beginning to rise.</li>
                                    <li>To increase the chance of isolating a pathogen, it is usually recommended that at least two specimens (collected at different times) should be cultured.</li>
                                    <li>Blood for culture must be collected as aseptically as possible.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Insert the needle through the rubber line of the bottle cap and dispense 5 ml of blood into each culture bottle.</li>
                            <li>Gently mix the blood with the bruch.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The blood must not be allowed to clot in the culture media because any bacteria will become trapped in the Culture medium.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p>At $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 2 weeks, examining and sub-culturing</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Look for visible signs of bacterial growth such as turbidity above the red cell layer, colonies growing on top of the red cells ("cotton balls"), haemolysis, gas bubbles and clots.</li>
                            <li>A sterile culture usually remains clear</li>
                            <li>If there are signs of bacterial growth, subculture the broth and examine a gram stained smear for bacteria</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Look for colonies on the agar slope (preferably using a hand lense), and signs of bacterial growth in the broth.</li>
                            <li>Colonies of staphycococ, s .typhi, brucellosis and most coliforms can usually be seen easily. Where as colonies of pneumococci, S. pyogens, and Y.pestis are not easily seen.</li>
