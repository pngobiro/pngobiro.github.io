                        <p>Viruses are the smallest infectious agents and contain only one kind of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA) as their genome.</p>
                        <p>The nucleic acid is encased in a protein shell, which may be surrounded by a lipid-containing membrane. The entire infectious unit is termed a virion.</p>
                        <p>Viruses are inert in the extracellular environment; they replicate only in living cells, being parasites at the genetic level.</p>
                        <p>The viral nucleic acid contains information necessary for programming the infected host cell to synthesize virusspecific macromolecules required for the production of viral progeny.</p>
                        <p>During the replicative cycle, numerous copies of viral nucleic acid and coat proteins are produced. The coat proteins assemble together to form the capsid, which encases and stabilizes the viral nucleic acid against the extracellular environment and facilitates the attachment and penetration by the virus upon contact with new susceptible cells. The virus infection may have little or no effect on the host cell or may result in cell damage or death.</p>
                        <p>The universe of viruses is rich in diversity. Viruses vary greatly in structure, genome organization and expression, and strategies of replication and transmission. The host range for a given virus may be broad or extremely limited. Viruses are known to infect unicellular organisms such as mycoplasmas, bacteria, and algae and all higher plants and animals.</p>

                        <p><strong>Virion:</strong> The complete virus particle. In some instances (eg, papillomaviruses, picornaviruses), the virion is identical with the nucleocapsid. In more complex virions (herpesviruses, orthomyxoviruses), this includes the nucleocapsid plus a surrounding envelope. This structure, the virion, serves to transfer the viral nucleic acid from one cell to another.</p>

                        <p>Certain viruses contain ribonucleic acid (RNA), while other viruses have deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The nucleic acid portion of the viruses is known as the genome. The nucleic acid may be singlestranded or double-stranded; it may be linear or a closed loop; it may be continuous or occur in segments.</p>
                        <p>The genome of the virus is surrounded by a protein coat known as a capsid, which is formed from a number of individual protein molecules called capsomeres. Capsomeres are arranged in a precise and highly repetitive pattern around the nucleic acid. A single type of capsomere or several chemically distinct types may make up the capsid. The combination of genome and capsid is called the viral nucleocapsid.</p>
                        <p>A number of kinds of viruses contain envelopes. An envelope is a membrane like structure that encloses the nucleocapsid and is obtained from a host cell during the replication process. The envelope contains viral-specified proteins that make it unique. Enveloped viruses - herpes simplex, chickenpox, and infectious mononucleosis etc</p>
                        <p>The nucleocapsids of viruses are constructed according to certain symmetrical patterns. The virus that causes tobacco mosaic disease, for example, has helical symmetry. In this case, the nucleocapsid is wound like a tightly coiled spiral. Other viruses take the shape of an icosahedron, and they are said to have icosahedral symmetry. In an icosahedron, the capsid is composed of 20 faces, each shaped as an equilateral triangle. Among the icosahedral viruses are those that cause yellow fever, polio, and head colds.</p>

                        <p>During the process of viral replication, a virus induces a living host cell to synthesize the essential components for the synthesis of new viral particles. The particles are then assembled into the correct structure, and the newly formed virions escape from the cell to infect other cells.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. The first step in the replication process is attachment.</strong> In this step, the virus adsorbs to a susceptible host cell. High specificity exists between virus and cell, and the envelope spikes may unite with cell surface receptors. Receptors may exist on bacterial pili or flagella or on the host cell membrane.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. The next step is penetration of the virus or the viral genome into the cell.</strong> This step may occur by phagocytosis; or the envelope of the virus may blend with the cell membrane; or the virus may "inject" its genome into the host cell. The latter situation occurs with the bacteriophage when the tail of the phage unites with the bacterial cell wall and enzymes open a hole in the wall. The DNA of the phage penetrates through this hole.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. The replication steps of the process occur next.</strong> The protein capsid is stripped away from the genome, and the genome is freed in the cell cytoplasm. If the genome consists of RNA, the genome acts as a messenger RNA molecule and provides the genetic codes for the synthesis of enzymes. The enzymes are used for the synthesis of viral genomes and capsomeres and the assembly of these components into new viruses.</p>
                        <p>If the viral genome consists of DNA, it provides the genetic code for the synthesis of messenger RNA molecules, and the process proceeds.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, such as in HIV infection, the RNA of the virus serves as a template for the synthesis of a DNA molecule. The enzyme reverse transcriptase catalyzes the DNA's production. The DNA molecule then remains as part of the host cell's chromosome for an unspecified period. From this location, it encodes messenger RNA molecules for the synthesis of enzymes and viral components.</p>

                        <p><strong>4. Once the viral genomes and capsomeres have been synthesized, they are assembled to form new virions.</strong> This assembly may take place in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of the host cell. After the assembly is complete, the virions are ready to be released into the environment.</p>
                        <p><strong>5. For the release of new viral particles, any of a number of processes may occur.</strong> For example, the host cell may be "biochemically exhausted," and it may disintegrate, thereby releasing the virions.</p>
                        <p>For enveloped viruses, the nucleocapsids move toward the membrane of the host cell, where they force themselves through that membrane in a process called budding. During budding, a portion of cell membrane pinches off and surrounds the nucleocapsid as an envelope. The replication process in which the host cell experiences death is called the lytic cycle of reproduction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Lysogeny.</strong> Not all viruses multiply by the lytic cycle of reproduction. Certain viruses remain active within their host cells for a long period without replicating. This cycle is called the lysogenic cycle.</p>
                        <p>An example of lysogeny occurs in HIV infection. In this case, the human immunodeficiency virus remains latent within the host T-lymphocyte. An individual whose infection is at this stage will not experience the symptoms of AIDS until a later date.</p>
                        <p>Viruses infect all major groups of organisms: vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, bacteria but some viruses have a broader host range than others; however, none can cross the eukaryotic/prokaryotic boundary.</p>
