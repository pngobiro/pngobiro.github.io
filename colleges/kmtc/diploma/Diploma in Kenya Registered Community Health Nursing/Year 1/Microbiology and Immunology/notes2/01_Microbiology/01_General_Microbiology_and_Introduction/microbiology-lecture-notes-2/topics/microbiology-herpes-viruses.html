                        <p>Herpes viruses are a leading cause of human viral disease, second only to influenza and cold viruses. They are capable of causing overt disease or remaining silent for many years only to be reactivated, for example as shingles.</p>
                        <p>The name herpes comes from the Latin herpes which, in turn, comes from the Greek word herpein which means to creep. This reflects the creeping or spreading nature of the skin lesions caused by many herpes virus types.</p>
                        <p>There are at least 25 viruses in the family Herpesviridae.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The hallmark of herpes infection is the ability to infect epithelial mucosal cells or lymphocytes. The virus then travels up peripheral nerves to a nucleated neurone where it may stay for years followed by reactivation.</p>
                        <p>A reddened area gives rise to a macula which crusts to form a papula. The fluid in this blister is full of virus. As long as the virus is kept moist it can remain infectious</p>
                        <p>Herpes simplex 1 and 2 can infect both humans and other animals but only humans show symptoms of disease.</p>
                        <p>HSV-1 and HSV-2 first infect cells of the mucoepithelia or enter through wounds. They then frequently set up latent infections in neuronal cells.</p>
                        <p>Both types of HSV can also persistently infect macrophages and lymphocytes.</p>
                        <p>Once epithelial cells are infected, there is replication of the virus around the lesion and entry into the innervating neurone. The virus travels along the neurone (by a process called retrograde transport) to the ganglion.</p>
                        <p>In the case of herpes infections of the oral mucosa, the virus goes to the trigeminal ganglia whereas infections of the genital mucosa lead the virus entering the sacral ganglia.</p>
                        <p>Vesicles containing infectious virus are formed on the mucosa and the virus spreads. The vesicle heals and there is usually no scar as a result.</p>

                        <p>HSV 1 and 2 infections are life-long and although latency is soon set up, the infected patient can infect others as a result of recurrence.</p>
                        <p>The virus is found in the lesions on the skin but can also be present in a variety of body fluids including saliva and vaginal secretions.</p>
                        <p>HSV-1 is usually spread mouth to mouth (kissing or the use of utensils contaminated with saliva) or by transfer of infectious virus to the hands after which the virus may enter the body via any wound or through the eyes. A large proportion of the population has evidence of HSV-1 infection as judged by antibodies.</p>
                        <p>As a result of poor hygiene in underdeveloped countries, HSV-1 antibodies are found in more than 90% of children.</p>
                        <p>HSV-2 is normally spread sexually and is found in the anus, rectum and upper alimentary tract as well as the genital area.</p>
                        <p>In addition an infant can be infected at birth by a genitallyinfected mother. The infant can also be infected in utero if the mother's infection spreads.</p>
                        <p>Anyone who comes in contact with fluid containing infectious virus is at risk.</p>
                        <p>As might be expected, HSV-2 infections are more prevalent later in life as the number of sexual contacts increases. Thus, the lowest rates of infection are found in children and the highest rates in prostitutes among whom as many as 80% are infected with HSV-2.</p>

                        <p>Herpes simplex 1 and 2 are frequently benign but can also cause severe disease. In each case, the initial lesion looks the same. A clear vesicle containing infectious virus with a base of red (erythomatous) lesion at the base of the vesicle. From this pus-containing (pustular), encrusted lesions and ulcers may develop.</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Oral herpes - Cold sores</strong> - Can be the result of an HSV-1 or an HSV-2 infection. Because of the association of HSV-2 with sexual transmission, infections in children are usually the result of HSV-1</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Herpes keratitis</strong> - This is an infection of the eye and is primarily caused by HSV-1. It can be recurrent and may lead to blindness.</p>
                        <p><strong>3.Herpes whitlow</strong> - disease of persons who come in contact with herpes-infected body secretions can be caused by either type of HSV and enters the body via small wounds on the hands. It can also be caused by transfer of HSV-2 from genitals to the hands.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Herpes gladiatorum</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>5. Eczema herpeticum</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>6. Genital herpes</strong> - Genital herpes is usually the result of HSV-2 with about 10% of cases being the result of HSV-1. Primary infection is often asymptomatic but many painful lesions can develop on the glans or shaft of the penis in men and on the vulva, vagina, cervix and perianal region of women.</p>
                        <p>Secondary episodes of genital herpes, which occur as a result of reactivation of virus in the sacral ganglion, are frequently less severe (and last a shorter time) than the first episode.</p>
                        <p>Whether there is an apparent active disease or not, an infected patient remains infectious without overt symptoms. Clearly, these persons are very important in the spread of herpes infection.</p>
                        <p><strong>7. HSV proctitis</strong> - This is an inflammation of the rectum and the anus</p>
                        <p><strong>8. HSV Encephalitis</strong> - This is usually the result of an HSV-1 infection and is the most common sporadic viral encephalitis.</p>
                        <p><strong>9. HSV Meningitis</strong> - This is the result of an HSV-2 infection.</p>

                        <p>The association between EBV and Burkitt's lymphoma has long been established. This is a tumor of the jaw and face found in children. The tumor cells show evidence of EBV DNA and tumor antigens and patients show a much higher level of anti-EBV antibodies than other members of the population.</p>
                        <p>This lymphoma is endemic in equatorial Africa . Why this is so is unclear but there is probably a genetic reason possibly involving an association with malaria. Persons who are resistant to malaria appear more susceptible to progression to the lymphoma.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nasopharyngeal cancer</strong> - This disease is also associated with EBV. There may be a genetic predisposition to the development of EBV cancers</p>
                        <p><strong>Oral hairy leukoplakia</strong> - This EBV-associated disease results in lesions in the mouth and has increased in frequency recently as it is an opportunistic infection of HIV-infected patients</p>

                        <p>In patients who have received an organ transplant or have an immunosuppressive disease (e.g. AIDS), cytomegalovirus can be a major problem. Particularly important is cytomegalovirus-retinitis in the eye which occurs in up to 15% of all AIDS patients. In addition, interstitial pneumonia, colitis, esophagitis and encephalitis are seen in some patients.</p>
