                        <p>People are so susceptible to botulism that if appreciable amounts of toxin are present. Consumption of very small pieces of food can cause illness and death. The typical symptoms of botulism usually appear within 12 to 36 hours. The earliest symptoms usually are an acute digestive disturbance followed by nausea and vomiting and possibly diarrheal, together with fatigue, dizziness and a headache. Later there is constipation. Double vision may be evident early and difficulty in swallowing and speaking may be noted. Patients may complain of dryness of the mouth and constriction of the throat and the tongue may become swollen and coated. Involuntary muscles become paralyzed. Paralysis spreads to the respiratory system and heart, and death usually result from respiratory failure. In fatal case, death usually comes within 3 to 6 days after the poisonous food has been ingested, but the period may be shorter or longer.</p>

                        <p>Salmonellosis may result following the ingestion of viable cells of the member of the genus Salmonella. It is the most frequently occurring bacterial food infection. In addition to the typical food-poisoning salmonellosis syndrome, there are two other disease syndromes result by consumption of salmonella, which is typhoid fever and parathyphoid fever.</p>

                        <p>The important source of salmonella are poultry and their eggs and rodents, and also come from cats, dogs and cattle. About one-third of all the food products involved in salmonella outbreak are meat and poultry products. Infected rodents, rats and mice, may contaminate unprotected foods with their feces and thus spread Salmonella bacteria. Flies may play an important role in the spread of Salmonella, especially from contaminated faecal matter to foods. Roaches apparently also can spread the disease.</p>

                        <p>Incubation period for salmonellosis usually 12 to 36 hr . The principal symptoms of a Salmonella gastrointestinal infection are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrheal that usually appear suddenly. This may be proceeded by a headache and chills. Other evidences of the disease are muscular weakness, usually a moderate fever, restlessness and drowsiness. Usually the symptoms persist for 2 to 3 days.</p>

                        <p>The organism can be found on a small number of cattle farms and can live in the intestines of healthy cattle.

                        <p>Eating meat, especially ground beef, that has not been cooked sufficiently to kill E. coli 0157:H7 can cause infection. Drinking unpasteurized milk and swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water can also cause infection.</p>

                        <p>Bacteria in diarrheal stools of infected persons can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or hand washing habits are inadequate. This is particularly likely among toddlers who are not toilet trained. Family members and playmates of these children are at high risk of becoming infected.</p>
                        <p>E. coli 0157:H7 infection often causes bloody diarrheal and abdominal cramps, sometimes the infection causes nonbloody diarrheal or no symptoms. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days.</p>
                        <p>In some persons, the infection can also cause a complication called haemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail.</p>

                        <p>Most persons recover without antibiotics or other specific treatment in 5-10 days. Haemolytic uremic syndrome is a life-threatening condition usually treated in an intensive care unit. Blood transfusions and kidney dialysis are often required. With intensive care, the death for haemolytic uremic syndrome is $3-5\%$.</p>
