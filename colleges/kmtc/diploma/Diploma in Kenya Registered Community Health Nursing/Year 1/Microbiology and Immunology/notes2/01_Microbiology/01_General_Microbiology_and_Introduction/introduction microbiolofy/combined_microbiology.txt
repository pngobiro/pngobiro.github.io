\section*{Normal Flora}

\section*{CLS 212: Medical Microbiology}

\section*{Relationships between Organisms}
- Symbiosis

Permanent association between two different organisms.
- Neutralism

Two organisms living together, and neither is affected by that.
- Mutualism

Two organisms living together, and both benefit from that.
- Commensalism:

Two organisms living together, one is benefited and the other is not been affected.
- Parasitism:

Two organisms living together, one is benefited "called parasite" and the other is harmed "called host".
- Synergism:

Sometimes, two (or more) microorganism may work together "team up" to produce a disease that neither could cause by itself.

\section*{What are Normal Flora?}
- Normal flora are microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses), mostly bacteria that continuously inhabited the human body (Resident Normal Flora).
- Under normal conditions in a healthy human they are harmless and may even be beneficial.
- Also called Commensals i.e. organisms that dine together or Microflora.

\section*{Stuff about Normal Flora}
- A fetus is sterile when born (No Normal Flora), then newborn start having the normal flora from its mother, air, food and the environment.
- Our internal organs are sterile like the spleen, liver, pancreas, bladder, CSF, and blood unless during infection.
- Normal flora differ from one human to another depending on age, diet, and geographic habitat.
- When the number of resident normal flora is greatly reduced, opportunistic microbes can easily cause infections in these areas e.g. Candida albicans that cause candidiasis.

\section*{Normal Microbiota and the Host:}
- Locations of normal microbiota on and in the human body
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_be38bcfa1c940bce21cdg-05.jpg?height=1410&width=1158&top_left_y=392&top_left_x=1181)

\section*{Why Should We Know About Normal Flora?}

We all should know about the types and distribution of normal flora in our bodies because:
1. It gives us better understanding of the possible infections that result from injury to a specific body site.
2. As well as the possible sources and significance of microorganisms isolated from the site of an infection.

\section*{Transient Normal Flora}
- Normal flora that are temporarily living on and within humans.
- The transient microbes living in the external environment are attracted to moist, warm body areas.

\section*{Why are these microbes temporary??}
1. They may be washed from external areas by bathing.
2. They may not be able to compete with resident normal flora.
3. They may be killed by substances produced by the resident normal flora.
4. They may not survive in the acidic or alkaline pH of the site.
5. They may be flushed away by bodily secretions like tears, sweat, oil, urine, feces,..).

\section*{Microflora of the SKIN}

The resident micoflora of the skin consist primerly bacteria and fungi

Resident bacteria of the skin can be in any layer of the skin.

Skin can acquire any transient bacteria from the environment but it either get washed off or die because the skin is dry, has acidic pH, and produce sweat and oil.

\section*{SKIN}
- Aerobic Bacteria:
- Present in the outer layer of skin.
- Staphylococcus epidermidis (accounts 90\%) + Staphylococcus aureus.
- Anaerobic Bacteria: (More than Aerobic bacteria)
- Present in the deeper skin layers, hair follicles, and sweat \& sebaceous glands.
- Propionibacterium acnes.
- Skin normal flora are generally harmless but it might cause bloodstream infections if skin was penetrated.

\section*{HCWs}

HCWs must be particularly carful to keep there skin and clothing free of transient microbes as possible to prevent personal infections and to avoid transferring pathogen to patient
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_be38bcfa1c940bce21cdg-10.jpg?height=751&width=1474&top_left_y=1085&top_left_x=931)

\section*{Microflora of the EYES}
- The conjunctiva of the eye has primarily S. epidermidis, followed by S. aureus, C. diphtheroids, and S. pneumoniae.
- Some skin normal flora are also
- present but at fewer amounts.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_be38bcfa1c940bce21cdg-11.jpg?height=821&width=980&top_left_y=412&top_left_x=1519)
- Tears (Lysozyme enzyme), mucus, and oil will protect the conjunctiva of the eye from colonization by more bacteria.

\section*{Microflora of the EARS}
- The middle ear and inner ear: are usually sterile.
- The outer ear and the auditory canal: contain the same normal flora of the skin.
- When the person coughs,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_be38bcfa1c940bce21cdg-12.jpg?height=881&width=1337&top_left_y=484&top_left_x=1162) sneezes, or blows his nose, these microbes may move into the middle ear where they cause infection.

\section*{Respiratory Tract}
- Upper Respiratory Tract:
- Nose and throat have

Many microorganisms. Some are normal flora, some are opportunistic, and others are carried like C. diphtheroids.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_be38bcfa1c940bce21cdg-13.jpg?height=594&width=842&top_left_y=357&top_left_x=1419)
- Nasopharynx: Streptococcus pneumoniae

In immune compromised or elderly it might cause acute bacterial pneumonia.
- Lower Respiratory Tract:

Is usually sterile because the mucous membranes of the lungs remove any microbes.

\section*{Oral Cavity (Mouth)}
- They have both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
The most common ones are:
C. diphtheroides, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis.
- Also yeasts, molds,
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_be38bcfa1c940bce21cdg-14.jpg?height=639&width=756&top_left_y=420&top_left_x=1465) protozoa, and viruses can be living in the mouth.

Teeth and Gengiva: Streptococcus mutans
- Poor dental hygiene help bacteria to grow and cause dental caries, gingivitis,...
- After dental surgeries, there might be a risk of bloodstream infection that might cause endocarditis.

\section*{Gastrointestinal Tract}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_be38bcfa1c940bce21cdg-15.jpg?height=1410&width=2150&top_left_y=446&top_left_x=162)

\section*{Microflora of the Gastrointestinal Tract}
- Stomach:

Only few bacteria are present in the stomach due to gastric enzymes and acidic pH .
- Small intestine:

Only few normal flora are present in the upper part of small intestine because bile kills them. Lower parts have more no. of normal flora.
- Large intestine:
- Has more bacteria than any other part of the body. 99\% of normal flora in the large intestine are anaerobic Bacteroides spp.
- Also many fungi, protozoa, and viruses can live there.
- Many of the normal flora are opportunistic i.e. if they move to other areas e.g. E.coli cause urinary infection.

\section*{Microflora of the Urogenital Tract}

\section*{Urinary Tract}
- Kidneys, Ureters and Urinary Bladder: are sterile.
- Lower Urethra and external opening: bacteria, yeast, and viruses. Has the same bacteria present on the skin.

\section*{Genital Organs}
- Male and female genitals: are sterile except vagina.
- Vagina: Lactobacillus spp. keeps the pH acidic to protect the vagina from opportunistic infections e.g. fungal vaginitis (Candida albicans) or bacterial vaginosis (Bacteroides spp., Gardnerella vaginalis).

\section*{Beneficial Functions of Normal Flora}
1. Protect our organs and systems that are in direct contact with the external environment from invading pathogens. Some normal flora produce substances that kills pathogens and others compete for with them for nutrients.
2. In newborns, normal flora stimulates the development of immune system.
3. Normal flora of the gut provides important nutrients such as Vitamin K which aid in digestion and absorption of nutrients.

\section*{Harmful Effect of Normal Flora}
1. When the normal flora are displaced from their normal site of the body e.g. bloodstream infections by S. epidermidis.
2. When potential pathogens gain a competitive advantage due to diminished populations of harmless competitors e.g. C. difficile growing in the gut after antibiotic therapy.
3. When harmless, commonly ingested food substances are converted into carcinogenic derivatives by bacteria in the colon e.g. sweetener cyclamate.
4. When individuals are immunocompromised, normal flora can overgrow and become pathogenic.

\section*{Module 1: Introduction to Microbiology \& Microorganism}

\section*{Learning Objective:}
* Knows the basic knowledge of microbes.
\$ Explain the importance of observation made by Hooke and Van Leeuwenhoek.
\$ Compare the theories of spontaneous generation and biogenesis.
\$ Differentiate among the major group of organism of studied in microbiology.
\$ List several ways in which microbes affect our lives.

\subsection*{1.1 Microbes in our lives}
\$ Living things too small too be seen with the unaided eye are called microorganisms.
\$Microorganism is important in the maintenance of an ecological balance on earth.
\$ Some microorganisms live in humans and other animals and are needed to maintain the animal's health.
\$ Some microorganisms are used to produce foods and chemicals.
\$ Some microorganism cause disease.

\subsection*{1.2 A Brief History of Microbiology}

\subsection*{1.2.1 The First Observation}
\#Robert Hooke observed the plant material was composed of 'little boxes'; he introduced the term cell .
\#Hooke's observations were the groundwork for development of the cell theory, the concept that all living things are composed of cells.
\#Anton Van Leeuwenhoek, using a simple microscope, was the first to observe microorganisms.

\subsection*{1.2.2 Hypothesis of the Origin of the Microorganism}

Two hypothesis attempted to explain the origin of the microbes:
- Biogenesis - They arose only from other living things of their same kind.
- Theory of Spontaneous Generation - They arose spontaneously from something non living.

\section*{The debate over Spontaneous Generation}
- Until the mid - 1880s, many people believed in spontaneous generation, the idea that living organisms could arise from nonliving matter.
- Francesco Redi demonstrated that maggots appear on decaying meat only when flies are able to lay eggs on the meat.
- Louis Pasteur demonstrated that microorganisms are in the air everywhere and offered proof of biogenesis by using various shapes of swan necked flasks.

\subsection*{1.3 The Diversity of Microorganisms}

\subsection*{1.3.1 Bacteria}
- Bacteria are unicellular organisms. Because they have no nucleus, the cells are describes as prokaryotic.
- The three major basic shapes of bacteria are bacillus, coccus and spiral. It also vary in size (0.1um to 5um).
- Most bacteria have a peptidoglycan cell wall; they divide by binary fission; and they may possess flagella.
- Bacteria can use a wide range of chemical substances for their nutrition.

\subsection*{1.3.2 Fungi}
- Fungi (mushroom, molds and yeast) have eukaryotic cells (with true nucleus). Most fungi are multi cellular.
- Fungi obtain nutrients by absorbing organic material from their environment.
1.3.3 Protozoa
- Protozoa are unicellular eukaryotes and classified according to their means of locomotion.
- Protozoa obtain nourishment by absorption or ingestion through specialized structures.
1.3.4 Algae
- Algae are unicellular or multi cellular eukaryotes that obtain nourishment by photosynthesis.
- Algae produce oxygen and carbohydrates that are used by other organisms.
1.3.5 Viruses
- Viruses are non-cellular entities that are parasites of cells.
- Viruses consist of a nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein coat. An envelope may surround the coat.

\subsection*{1.4 The Impact of Microorganism on Human Affairs}
1.4.1 Microorganisms as a decomposer
- Microorganisms degrade dead plants and animals and recycle chemical elements to be used by living plants and animals.
- For examples, bacteria are use to decompose organic matter in sewage and microbes decompose food into simple molecules.
1.4.2 Microorganisms as a nitrogen fixer
- Some bacteria live in nodules on a plant roots.
- Atmospheric nitrogen compounds that the plants can use for growth.
$$\mathrm{N} 2 \rightarrow \mathrm{NH} 3$$

Nitrogen fixer bacteria

\subsection*{1.4.3 Microorganisms and the food industry}
- Dairy Product
(cheese, yogurt, yogurt drinks, chocolate)
- Baked goods
- Alcoholic beverages
- Tempeh (Indonesian traditional food)
- Pickles
- Vinegar

\section*{Module 2: Methods for Studying Microorganism}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to;
* Define total magnification \& resolution.
\$ Identify a use for dark field, phase-contrast, DIC, and florescence microscopy and compare each with bright field illumination.
* List the step in preparing a Gram stain, and describe the appearance of gram positive and gram negative cells after each step.

\subsection*{2.1 Microscope}
* Microscope is an instrument that magnifies the size of image of an object to be seen with the naked eyes.
* The two key characteristics of a reliable microscope are;
i. Magnification
- the ability to enlarge image of an object. A compound light microscope uses multiple lenses to refract light to achieve magnification.
- total magnification is the product of the magnifying powers of the individual lenses where:

Power of objective $\mathbf{x}$ Power of ocular $=$ Total Magnification
$$\begin{aligned}
4 \mathrm{x} \times 10 \mathrm{x} & =40 \mathrm{x} \\
10 \mathrm{x} \times 10 \mathrm{x} & =100 \mathrm{x} \\
30 \mathrm{x} \times 10 \mathrm{x} & =300 \mathrm{x} \\
100 \mathrm{x} \times 10 \mathrm{x} & =1000 \mathrm{x}
\end{aligned}$$

\section*{ii. Resolution/ Resolving Power (R)}
- the resolving power $(R)$ of an microscope is the closest spacing between 2 point at which the point can still be seen clearly as separate entities.
- the resolving power of a light microscope depends on the wavelength of light ( $\lambda$ ) and a property of the objective lens, called the numerical aperture (NA)
$$\mathrm{R}=0.5 \lambda / \mathrm{NA}$$

\subsection*{2.2 Bright field Microscope}
\$ From it image, when light is transmitted through specimen.
\$ The specimen, being denser and more opaque then its surrounding absorbs some of this light, and the rest of the light is transmitted directly up to through the ocular into the field.
* As a result, the specimen will produce an image that is denser then surrounding brightly illuminated field .
\$ Can be used for both live, unstained material and preserved, stained material.

\subsection*{2.3 Dark field Microscope}
\$ Used for examining live microorganisms that either are invisible in the ordinary light microscope.
\$ Use a dark field condenser that contains an opaque disk. The disk blocks light that would enter the objective directly. Only light that is reflected off (turned back from) the specimen enters the objective lens. Because there is no direct background light, the specimen appear light against a black background.
\$ Frequently used to examine unstained microorganisms suspended in liquid.
\$ Example microbe -Treponema pallidum

\subsection*{2.4 Phase Contrast Microscope}
- It permits detailed examination of internal structure in living organism. Not attach the microbes to the microscope slide.
* Based on slight variations in refractive index. As rays pass from the light source through the specimen, their velocity may be altered by differences in the thickness and physical properties of various portion of the specimen.
\$ Light rays passing through the specimen are diffracted (bent) differently and travel different pathway (out of phase with one another) to reach eye of the viewer.
\$ Details of the internal structure of the specimen also become more sharply defined in phase-contrast microscope. The internal detail of a cell appear as degrees of brightness against a dark background.
* This microscope used the special condenser that contains an annular (ring shaped) diaphragm. The diaphragm allows a ring of light to pass through the condenser, focusing light on the specimen and a ring shaped diffraction (phase) plate in the objective lens.
\$ The diffraction and undiffracted rays are then bought into phase with each other to produce the image that meets the eye.

\subsection*{2.5 Fluorescence Microscope}
\$ Takes advantages of florescence of substances.
\# Florescence absorb short wavelength substances absorb short wavelengths of light (v)
\# Give off light at longer wavelength that can be seen by the use of the special light filters.

\subsection*{2.6 Staining}
\$ Staining means coloring a microorganism with a dye to make some structure more visible.
\$ Fixing uses air and heat to attach microorganism to a slide.
\$ Differential stains, such as the gram stain and acid fast stain, divide bacteria into groups according to their reaction to the stains.
* The gram-stain produce uses the purple stain (crystal violet) iodine as a mordant, an alcohol decolorized and the red counter stain.
\$ Gram-positive bacteria retain the purple stain after decolorization step: gram negative bacteria do not and thus appear pink from the counter stain.
- Acid fast bacteria, such as members of the genera Mycobacterium and Nocardia, retain carbolfuchin after acid alcohol decolorization and appear red; non acid fast bacteria take up the methylene blue counter stain and appear blue.

\section*{Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to;
- Define prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell.
* Define and explain each organelle function of prokaryotic cell.
- Define and explain each organelle function of eukaryotic cell.

\subsection*{3.1 Cell}
\$ The cell is the fundamental organizational unit of all living systems, including microorganisms.
* It provides the essential basis for organization, growth, metabolism, reproduction and heredity, which are the critical functions that comprise the essential characteristics of life.
* There are two different types of cells of living organisms:
i. prokaryotic cells (cells lacking a nucleus)- bacteria
ii. Eukaryotic cells (cells with a nucleus)- protozoa, algae and fungi
\$ All cells have some common properties regardless of whether their organizational structure is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Cell of all organisms:
i. are highly organized
ii. are capable of growth and reproduction
iii. contain the same heredity molecule - DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)

\subsection*{3.2 Prokaryotic Cell}
\$ The prokaryotic cell is more primitive and simple than eukaryotic cell. It does not have membrane bound compartments, called organelles, that serve
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_a4438ca015949be89dc6g-20.jpg?height=881&width=1155&top_left_y=310&top_left_x=1373) specialized functions, ass occurs in eukaryotic cells.
\$ A prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus and the heredity information (DNA) of a prokaryotic cell is not separated from the other constituents within the specialized organelle from the rest of the contents is of prime importance in distinguishing prokaryotic from eukaryotic cells.

\subsection*{3.2 Prokaryotic Cell}
* The general cellular organization of a prokaryotic cell can be represented with the following micro map:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_a4438ca015949be89dc6g-21.jpg?height=934&width=1320&top_left_y=571&top_left_x=866) from of surface coating or glycocalyx. Specific structures that are found in some, but not all are flagella, capsules, slime layers and granules.

\subsection*{3.2.2 Flagella}
\$ The primary function of flagella is to confer motility or self-propulsion that is, the capacity of a cell to swim freely through an aqueous habitat. As the flagellum rotates, it causes the cell body to spin in the opposite direction and gives the cell a forward motion.
\$ Figure 14 and 15

\subsection*{3.2.3 The Cell Envelope}
* The cell envelope is the complex of layers external to the cell protoplasm. The layers of the envelope are stacked one upon another and are often tightly bonded together. The three basic layers that can be identified are:
i. The glycocalyx
ii. The cell wall
iii. The cell membrane

\section*{\# Function of cell membrane:}
i. To regulate transport - that is the passage of nutrients into cell and the discharge of wastes.
ii. Enzyme secretion - the enzymes of respiration are located at the membrane. Macromolecules (carbohydrate, protein and fat) cannot permeate through the cell membrane. The enzyme is needed to brake the macromolecules.
iii. Cell membrane provides a site for the functions such as energy reactions, nutrient processing and synthesis.

\subsection*{3.2.4 Protoplasm}
\$Protoplasm is a prominent site for many of the cell's biochemical and synthetic activities. Its major component is water (70-80\%), which serves as a solvent for the cell pool, a complex mixture of nutrients, including sugars, amino acids and salts.
\$The components of this pool serve as building blocks for cell synthesis or as sources of energy. Also contains larger, discrete cells masses such as the chromatin body, ribosomes, mesosomes and granules.
i. Chromatin bodies - the heredity material of bacteria exists in the form of a single circular strand of DNA designated as the chromatin body or bacterial chromosome. By the definition, bacteria do not have a nucleus that is their DNA is not enclosed by a nuclear membrane, but instead is aggregated in a dense area of the cell called the nucleoid.
ii. Ribosomes - a bacterial cell contains thousands of tiny, discrete units called ribosomes. Ribosomes is where the protein synthesis is performed.
iii. Cytoplasmic inclusion/ granules - Inclusion bodies/ granules contain condensed, energy - rich organic substance including glycogen, fat and phosphate.

\subsection*{3.2.5 Bacterial Endospore}
* Only certain bacteria have endospore. This type of bacteria is called an endospore because it is produced inside a cell. Endospore is formed when the environment is not suitable for the bacteria to be reproductive.

\subsection*{3.3 Eukaryotic Cell}
\$ All eukaryotic microbial cells have a cytoplasmic membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, vacuoles and cytoskeleton.
* A cell wall, locomotor appendages, chloroplasts and glycocalyx are found only in some groups.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_a4438ca015949be89dc6g-25.jpg?height=1176&width=2141&top_left_y=738&top_left_x=322)

\subsection*{3.3.1 Flagella}
- The eukaryotic flagellum is thicker, structurally more complex and covered by an extension of the cell membrane.

\subsection*{3.3.2 Surface Structures}
- There are 3 basic layers:
i. Glycocalyx - An outermost boundary that comes in direct contact with the environment. This structure is usually composed of polysaccharides. The glycocalyx contributes to protection, adherence of cells to surfaces and reception of signals from other cells and from the environment.
ii. Cell wall - Cell walls of algal and fungal cells are rigid and provide structural support and shape. Fungal cell walls have a thick, inner layer of polysaccharide fibers composed of chitin or cellulose and a thin outer layer of mixed glycans. (Figure 18)
iii. Cytoplasmic membrane - The cytoplasmic membrane of eukaryotic cells is a typical bilayer of lipids in which protein molecules are embedded. Also contain sterols.

\subsection*{3.3.3 The Nucleus: The Cell Control Center}
- The nucleus is a compact sphere that is the most prominent organelle of eukaryotic cells. It is separated from the cell cytoplasm by an external boundary called a nuclear envelope.
- Nucleus contains chromosomes that bring the genetic information (DNA). In the nucleus, nucleolus produce components that are used to build protein.

\subsection*{3.3.4 Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)}
- There are two kinds of ER:
i. rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
ii. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)
- The RER originates from the nucleus membrane and extends in a continuous network through the cytoplasm even to the cell membrane. This is to permits the RER to transport materials from the nucleus to cytoplasm.
- The RER appears rough because of large numbers of ribosome partly attached to its membrane. Protein are synthesized on the ribosome.
- The SER is a closed tubular network within ribosome that functions in nutrient processing and synthesis and storage of non protein macromolecules such as lipids, sterols and glycogen.

\subsection*{3.3.5 Ribosome : Protein Synthesizers}
- Ribosome are numerous, tiny particles and distributed in two ways:
i. Some are scattered freely in cytoplasm
ii. Others associated with the RER as previously described

\subsection*{3.3.6 Mitochondria}
- The function of mitochondria is to supply energy.
- Respiration process in the cristae (inner membrane), extract energy from the nutrient molecules and stores it in the form of high-energy molecules or ATP (adenosine tryphosphate critae).

\subsection*{3.3.7 Chloroplasts}
- Chloroplasts are only found in algae and plant cells that are capable of converting of energy of sunlight into chemical energy through photosynthesis.

\subsection*{3.3.8 Golgi Complex}
- This Organelle is always closely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, both in its location and function.

\title{
Module 4: \\ Bacterial Growth
}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to;
\$ Define and describe each bacterial growth phases.
\$ Identify environmental factors that influence microbial growth.
- Microbes that are provided with nutrients and the required environments factors become metabolically active and grow.
- Growth take place on two levels:
i. A cell builds up protoplasm and increases its size.
ii. The number of cells in the population increases.

\subsection*{4.1 The Basis of Population Growth:}

\section*{Binary Fission}
- The division of a bacterial cell occurs mainly through binary fission; binary means that one cell become two.
- During binary fission, the parent cell enlarges, duplicates its chromosome and forms a central transverse septum that divides the cell into two daughter cells.
- This is repeated at intervals by each new daughter cell in turn, and with each successive round of division the population increases.
(Figure 20)

\subsection*{4.2 The Rate of Population Growth}
- The time required for a complete fission cycle - form parent cell to two new daughter cells - is called the generation, or doubling time.
- Each new fission cycle or generation increases the population by a factor of 2 or doubles it.
Ex: 1 cell 2 cells 4 cells 8 cells 16 cells 32 cells
- As long as the environment remains favorable, this doubling effect can continue at a constant rate. The length of the generation time is a measure of the growth rate of an organism. The average generation time is $30-60$ minutes under optimum conditions.
Ex: Mycobacterium leprae - 10-30 days
Salmonella enteritidis - 20-30 days
Staphylococcus aureus

Table 1. Growth Rates for Some Representative Bacteria Under Optimal Conditions
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Organism & Temperature ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) & Generation Time (min) \\
\hline Bacillus stearothermophilus & 60 & 11 \\
\hline Escherichia coli & 37 & 20 \\
\hline Bacillus subtilis & 37 & 27 \\
\hline Bacillus mycoides & 37 & 28 \\
\hline Staphylococcus aureus & 37 & 28 \\
\hline Streptococcus lactis & 37 & 30 \\
\hline Lactobacillus acidophilus & 37 & 75 \\
\hline Mycobacterium tuberculosis & 37 & 360 \\
\hline Treponema pallidum & 37 & 1980 \\
\hline Anabaena cylindrical & 25 & 840 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{4.3 Phase of Bacterial Growth}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_a4438ca015949be89dc6g-34.jpg?height=1092&width=1488&top_left_y=457&top_left_x=175)
- Data of growth period of 3-4 days, from a system of batch culturing produces a curve with a series of phases which are:
i. lag phase
ii. exponential phase / log phase
iii. stationary phase
iv. death phase
- The batch culture describe meaning that nutrients and space are finite and there is no mechanism for the removal of waste products.

\subsection*{4.3.1 Lag Phases}
- The growth curve of a bacterial culture begins with the lag phase.
- In this phase, the bacteria are transporting nutrients inside the cell from the new medium, preparing for reproduction and synthesizing DNA and various inducible enzymes needed for cell division.
- They increase in size during this process but the number of cell does not increase.

\subsection*{4.3.2 Exponential Phase}
- In the exponential phase, also called the log growth phase, bacterial cell division begins. One cell divides to form two, each of these cells divides to form four and so forth.
- During the log phase of growth, bacterial reproduction occurs at a maximal rate for the specific set of growth conditions.
- Growth during much of the exponential growth phase is said to be balanced, that is the concentrations of all macromolecules of the cell are increasing at the same rate.
- During the log phase of the growth curve, the growth rate of a bacterium is proportional to the biomass of bacteria that is present.

\subsection*{4.3.3 Stationary Phase}
- During this phase there is no further increase in bacterial cell numbers. Cells in the stationary phase have a different chemical composition from cells in the exponential phase.
- In the stationary phase, the growth rate is exactly equal to the death rate. A bacterial population may reach stationary growth when:
i. a required nutrient is exhausted
ii. inhibitory end products accumulate
iii. physical conditions change

\subsection*{4.3.4 Death Phase}
- The death phase start from the number of viable cells begins to decline.
- The kinetic of bacterial death, like those of growth, are exponential because the death phase really represents the result of the inability of the bacteria to carry out further reproduction.

\subsection*{4.4 Environmental Factors That Influence Microbes}
- Microbes are exposed to a wide variety of environmental factors in addition to nutrients.
- One aim in ecology is to account for the ways that microorganisms deal with or adapt to such factors as heat, cold, gases, acid, radiation, osmotic and hydrostatic pressures and even other microbes.

\subsection*{4.4.1 Temperature Adaptation}
- Microbial cells are unable to control their temperature. Their survival is dependent on adapting to whatever temperatures are encountered in the habitat.

The range of temperatures for microbial growth can be expressed as:
i. Minimum temperature - is the lowest temperature that permits a microbe's continued growth and metabolism; below this temperature, its activities are inhibited.
ii. Maximum temperature - is the highest temperature at which growth and metabolism can proceed. If the temperature rises slightly above maximum, growth will stop, but if it continues to rise beyond that point, the enzymes and nucleic acids will eventually become permanently inactivated and the cell will die. This is why heat works so well as an agent in microbial control.
iii. Optimum temperature - covers a small range, intermediate between the minimum and maximum, which promotes the fastest rate of growth and metabolism.

Another way to express temperature adaptation is to describe whether an organism grows optimally in a cold, moderate or hot temperature range. The terms used for these ecological groups are psychrophile, mesophile and thermophile.
i. A psychrophile is a microorganism that has an optimum temperature below $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and is capable of growing at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. It is obligate with respect to cold and generally cannot grow above $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
ii. Mesophiles - organisms that grow at intermediate temperatures. The optimum growth temperatures (optima) of most mesophiles fall into the range of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Most human pathogens have optima somewhere between $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (human body temperature is $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Ex: Bacillus and Clostridium.
iii. Thermophile is a microbes that grows optimally at temperatures greater than $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Such heat-loving microbes live in soil and water associated with volcanic activity and in habitats directly exposed to the sun. Thermopiles vary in heat requirements, with a general range of growth of $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{4.4.2 Gas Requirements}
- The atmospheric gases that most influence microbial growth are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen has the greatest impact on microbial adaptation. With respect to oxygen requirements, several general categories are recognized.
i. Aerobe (aerobic organism) - grows well in the presence of normal atmospheric oxygen and processes the enzymes needed to process toxic oxygen products.
ii. Obligate aerobe - organism that cannot grow without oxygen. Ex: Bdellovibrio and Xanthomonas.
iii. Facultative anaerobe - is an aerobe that does not require oxygen for its metabolism and is capable of growth in the absence of oxygen. This type of organism metabolizes by aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but in its absence, it adopts an anaerobic mode of metabolism such as fermentation. Ex: Bacterial pathogens - Gram-negative enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus.
iv. Microaerophile - does not grow at normal atmospheric tension of oxygen, but requires a small amount of it in metabolism. Most organisms in this category live in a habitat that provides small amounts of oxygen but is not directly exposed to the atmosphere.
v. Anaerobe (anaerobic microorganism) does not grow in normal atmospheric oxygen.
vi. Strict / obligate anaerobes - they cannot tolerate any free oxygen in the immediate environment and will die if exposed to it. Growing anaerobic bacteria usually requires special media, methods of incubation and handling chambers that exclude oxygen. Ex: Clostridium, Trichomonas, Bacteroides.
vii. Aerotolerant anaerobes - do not utilize oxygen, but can survive in its presence and these anaerobes are not killed by oxygen.

\subsection*{4.4.3 Effect of Ph}
- Microbial growth and survival are also influenced by the pH of the habitat. The pH is defined as the degree of acidity or alkalinity (basicity) of a solution. It is expressed by the pH scale, a series if numbers ranging from 1 to 14 . As the pH value decreases toward 0 , the acidity increases and as the pH increases toward 14, the alkalinity increases.
- Majority of organisms do not live or grow in high or low pH habitats, because acid and base can be highly damaging to enzymes and other cellular substances.
- The optimum pH range for most microorganisms is between 6 and 8 , and most human pathogens grow optimally at a pH of 6.5 to 7.5.

Module 5: Microorganisms Important in Food Microbiology
}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to;
\$ Define characteristic of mold, yeast and bacteria.
* Know the requirements of mold, yeast and bacteria.
\$ Identify several genus of mold, yeast and bacteria help in food industry.

\subsection*{5.1 Molds}
- Mold growth on foods, with its fuzzy and cottony appearance, is familiar to everyone and usually food with a moldy is considered unfit to eat.
- But certain molds are useful in the manufacture of certain foods or ingredients of foods.
- Some kinds of cheese are moldripened, ex; blue, Roquefort, Camambert, Brine, etc and molds are used in making oriental foods, ex; soy sauce, tapai, and tempeh.

\subsection*{5.1.1- General Characteristics of Molds}

The term 'mold' is a common one applied to certain multicellular, filamentous fungi whose growth on foods usually is readily recognised by its fuzzy or cottony appearance.

The main part of the growth commonly appears white but may be colored or dark or smoky. Colored spores are typical of mature mold of some kinds and give color to part or all of the growth.
a. Moisture requirements - In general most molds require less available moisture than do most yeasts and bacteria.
b. Temperature requirements - Most molds would be considered mesophilic ie. able to grow well at ordinary temperatures. The optimal temperature for most molds is around 25 to $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but some grow well at 35 to $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or above, ex. Aspergillus spp. and some at still higher temperatures.
c. Oxygen and pH requirements - Molds are aerobic ie. they require oxygen for growth. Most molds can grow over a wide range of pH ( pH 2 to 8.5) but the majority are favoured by an acid pH.

\subsection*{5.1.2 Molds of Industrial Importance}

Several molds of industrial importance are outlined by genus.
a. Mucor
- Mucor re involved in the spoilage of some foods and the manufacture of others. M. racemosus. M. rouxii is used in the process for the saccharafication of starch and mucors help ripen some cheeses and are used in making certain oriental foods.
b. Rhizopus
- Rhizopus is very common and is involved in the spoilage of many foods ex; berries, vegetables, bread, etc.
c. Aspergillus
- They are very widespread. Many are involved in the spoilage of foods and some are useful in the preparation of certain foods.
- A. flavus-oryzea is important in making of some oriental foods and the production of enzymes.

\subsection*{5.2 Yeasts}

Yeasts may be useful or harmful in foods. Yeasts fermentation are involve in the manufacture of foods such as bread, wines, vinegar, and surface ripened cheese etc. Yeasts are undesirable when they cause spoilage of fruit juices, syrups, honey, jellies, meats and other foods.

\subsection*{5.2.1 General Characteristics of Yeast}

The form of yeasts may be spherical, oval, lemon-shaped or cylindrical. They also differ in size. Most common yeasts grow best with a plentiful supply of available moisture. Yeasts can grow in the presence of greater concentrations of solutes (such as sugar or salt) than most bacteria. The optimum temperature for growth of most yeasts in around 25 to $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the maximum about 35 to $47^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{5.2.2 Yeasts of Industrial Importance}

\section*{a. Genus Saccharomyces}
- S. cerevisiae is employed in many food industries, ex; bread making, wine, production of alcohol.

\subsection*{5.3 Bacteria}

\subsection*{5.3.1 Lactic Acid-Forming Bacteria or Lactic}
- The most important characteristic of the lactic acid bacteria is their ability to ferment sugars to lactic acid.
- This may be desirable in making products such as sauerkraut and cheese.
- The major genera include Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Pediococcus.

\section*{Module 6: Contamination of Foods}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to; - Define and describe 7 natural sources of microorganisms that can contaminate foods.
- There are various natural sources of microorganisms that can contaminate foods include from green plants and fruits, animals, sewage, soil, water, air and during handling and processing.

\subsection*{6.1 From Green Plants and Fruits}
- The natural surface flora of plants varies with the plant but usually includes species of Pseudomonas, Micrococcus and coliforms, and lactic acid bacteria.
- Lactic acid bacteria include Lactobacillus brevis and plantarum, Streptococcus feacalis and Lauconostoc dextranioum. Bacillus spp, yeasts and molds also may be present.
- The numbers of bacteria will depend on the plant and its environment and may range from a few hundred or thousand per square centimetre of surface to millions.
- The surface of a well-washed tomato, may show 400-700 microorganisms per square centimetre, while and unwashed tomato would have several thousand. Exposed surfaces of plants become contaminated from soil, water, sewage, air and animal, so that microorganisms from these sources are added to be natural flora.

\subsection*{6.2 From Animals}

Sources of microorganisms from animals include:
a. the surface flora
b. the flora of the respiratory tract
c. the flora of the gastrointestinal tract
- The feathers and feet of poultry carry heavy contamination from similar sources. The skin of many meat animals may contain micrococci, staphylococci and streptococcus.
- Staphylococci on the skin or from the respiratory tract may find their way on to the carcass and then to the final product. The feces and fecal-contaminated products of animals can contain many enteric organisms, including Salmonella.
- Many infection disease agents of animals can be transmitted to people via foods.

\subsection*{6.3 From Sewage}
- When untreated domestic sewage is used to fertilize plant crops, there is a likelihood that raw plant foods will be contaminated with human pathogens, especially those causing gastrointestinal diseases.

\subsection*{6.4 From Soil}
- The soil contains the greatest variety of microorganisms of any source of contamination, Bacillus, Clostridium, Micrococcus, Streptococcus and Modern methods of food handling usually involve washing the surfaces of foods and hence the removal of much of the soil from those surfaces and care is taken to avoid contamination by soil dust.

\subsection*{6.5 From Water}
- Natural waters contain not only their natural flora but also microorganisms from soil and possibly from animals or sewage.
- The kinds of bacteria in natural waters are species of Pseudomonas, Proteus, Micrococcus, Bacillus, Streptococcus and Escherichia.

\subsection*{6.6 From Air}
- Contamination of foods from the air may be important for sanitary reason. Disease organism, especially those causing respiratory infection, may be spread among employees by air or the food product may become contaminated.
- Total numbers of microorganisms in a food may be increased from the air, especially if the air is being used for aeration of the product, as in growing bread yeast. Mold spores from air may give trouble in cheese, meat, sweetened condensed milk and sliced bread.

\subsection*{6.7 During Handling and Processing}
- Additional contamination may come from equipment coming in contact with foods, from packaging materials and from personnel.

\section*{Chapter 7.0 : Food Preservation}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to;
\$ Identify 4 methods of food preservation.
* Define and discuss deeply on pasteurization.
\$ Discuss on freezing, chilling and drying methods.
- Most kinds of food are readily decomposed by microorganisms.
- Preservation of food is achieved when special methods are used.

\subsection*{7.1 Methods of Food Preservation}

Some of the widely methods of food preservation are as follows:
a. Use of high temperatures
b. Use of low temperatures
c. Drying
d. Use of chemical preservatives

\subsection*{7.2 Preservation By Use of High Temperatures}

The temperatures and time used in heat-processing a food will depend on what effect heat has on the food and what other preservative methods are to be employed.

The greater the heat treatment the more organisms will be killed up to the heating that will produce sterility of the product. The various degrees of heating used on foods might be classified as:
a. pasteurization
b. heating at about $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
c. heating above $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

\subsection*{7.2.1 Pasteurization}

Pasteurization is a heat treatment that kills part but not all of the microorganisms present and usually involves the application of temperatures below $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Pasteurization is used when:
a. More rigorous heat treatment might harm the quality of the product (milk).
b. One aim is to kill pathogens (milk).
c. The main spoilage organisms are not very heat resistant (yeast in fruit juices).
d. When any surviving spoilage organisms will be taken care of by additional preservative methods to be employed as in the chilling of market milk.
e. When competing organisms are to be killed, allowing a desired fermentation, usually by added starter organisms, as in cheese making.

Times and temperatures used in the pasteurizing process depend on the method employed and the product treated. For example:
a. Milk is pasteurized at:
i. $\quad 62.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 min
ii. $\quad 71.7^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 15 sec
iii. $\quad 137.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 2 sec
b. Ice cream mix be heated at:
i. $\quad 71.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 min
ii. $\quad 82.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 16 to 20 sec

\subsection*{7.2.2 Heating at about $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$}

Home canners processed all foods for varying lengths of time at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or less. This treatment was sufficient to kill everything but bacterial spores in the food and often was sufficient to preserve even low - and medium - acid foods.

A temperature of approximately $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is obtained by:
i. boiling a liquid food
ii. immersion of the food container in boiling water
iii. exposure to flowing steam

Heat processing includes:
i. Baking - the internal temperature of bread, cake or other bakery product approaches but never reaches $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as long as moisture is present, although the oven is much hotter.
ii. Roasting - in roasting meat the internal temperature reaches only about $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
iii. Frying - frying gets the outside of the food very hot, but the centre ordinarily does not reach $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
iv. Blanching - blanching fresh vegetables before freezing or drying involves heating briefly at about $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{7.3 Preservation by Use of Low Temperature}
tow temperatures are used to stop chemical reactions and action of food enzymes and to slow down the growth and activity of microorganisms in food.
- Each microorganism present has an optimal temperature for growth and a minimal temperature, below which in cannot multiply.
- As the temperature drops from this optimal temperature toward the minimal, the rate of growth of the organism decreases and is slowest at the minimal temperature. Cooler temperature will prevent growth, but slow metabolic activity may continue.

\subsection*{7.3.1 Chilling or Cold Storage}
- Chilling storage is at temperature not far above freezing and usually involves cooling by ice or by mechanical refrigeration.
- Most perishable foods, including eggs, dairy products, meats, seafood, vegetables and fruits may be held in chilling storage for a limited time with little change from their original condition.
- Enzymatic and microbial change in the foods are not prevented but are slowed down.
- The temperature of a refrigerator is mechanically controlled but varies in different parts, usually between 0 and $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{73.2 Freezing or Frozen Storage}

Microbial growth in frozen foods is prevented entirely and the action of food enzymes is greatly retarded. The lower the storage temperature, the slower will be any chemical or enzymatic reactions.

There are 2 types of freezing:
i. Slow freezing - the temperature is usually $-23.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or less $\left(-15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ to $\left.-29^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, take $3-72$ hours.
ii. Quick freezing (the food is frozen in a relatively short time 30 min or less, temperature $-17.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $45.6^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).

\subsection*{7.4 Preservation by Drying}

Drying is usually accomplished by the removal of water. For example: Dried fish may be heavily salted so that moisture is drawn from the flesh and bound by solute and hence is unavailable to microorganisms. For sweetened condensed milk, sugar may be added to reduce the amount of available moisture.

Heat applied during a drying process causes a reduction in total numbers of microorganisms, but the effectiveness varies with the kinds and numbers of organisms originally present and the drying process employed.

Usually all yeasts and most bacteria are destroyed, but spores of bacteria and molds commonly survive.
Some of the methods used for drying are as follows:
i. Solar drying - Solar drying is limited to climates with a hot sun and a dry atmosphere and to certain foods such as raisins, fish, rice, etc.
ii. Drying by mechanical dryers.
iii. Drying during smoking.

\section*{Chapter 8.0: Food Fermentation}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to;
\# Define food fermentation.
\$ Identify food productions involve fermentation process and microbes involved.
- Microorganisms are used in the food industry for food production.
- Many of the foods and beverages we commonly enjoy, such as yogurt and cheese, are the products of microbial enzymatic activity.
- The production of fermented foods requires the proper substrates, microbial populations and environmental conditions to obtain the desired end product.
- Quality control is essential in food fermentation to ensure that the product is high quality.

\subsection*{8.1 Fermented Dairy Products}
- Numerous products are made by the microbial fermentation of milk, including yogurt and many cheeses. The fermentation of milk is primarily carried out by lactic acid bacteria.
- Lactic acid is produced during fermentation and acts as a natural preservative.

\subsection*{8.1.1 Yogurt}
- Yogurt is made by fermenting milk a mixture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus or with Lactobacillus acidophilus. Yogurt fermentation is carried out at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\subsection*{8.1.2 Cheese}
- Various cheese are produced by microbial fermentation. Cheeses consist of milk curds that have been separated from the liquid portion of the milk (whey). The curdling of milk is accomplished by using the enzyme rennin and lactic acid bacterial starter cultures.

Cheese are classified as:
i. soft cheese - high water content (50 to 80\%)
ii. semi hard cheese - water content is about 45\%
iii. hard cheese - low water content (less than 40\%)

Cheese are also classified as:
i. unripened - if they are produced by single-step fermentation
ii. ripened - if additional microbial growth is required during maturation of the cheese to achieve the desired taste, texture and aroma.
- The natural production of cheese involves lactic acid fermentation, with various mixtures of Lactococcus and Lactobacillus species used as starter cultures to initiate the fermentation.

\subsection*{8.1.3 Leavening of Bread}

Yeasts are added to bread dough to ferment the sugar, producing the carbon dioxide that leavens the dough and causes it to rise.

\subsection*{8.1.4 Vinegar}
- The production of vinegar involves 2 steps:
i. Conversion of carbohydrates to alcohol by anaerobic fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
ii. followed by a secondary oxidative transformation of the alcohol to form acetic acid by Acetobacter and Gluconobacter.
or the direct conversion of glucose to acetate by Clostridium species.
- The starting materials for the production of vinegar may be fruits such as grapes, oranges, apples, pears; vegetables such as potatoes.

\subsection*{8.1.5 Soy Sauce}
- Oriental foods are prepared by fermenting soybeans or rice. Soy sauce is produced by Aspergillus oryzae.

\subsection*{8.1.6 Tempeh}
- Tempeh is an Indonesian food produced from soybeans. The soybeans are soaked at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, dried and inoculated with spores of Rhizopus. The mash is incubated at $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 20 hours, during which mycelia growth occurs.

\section*{Chapter 9.0: Food-borne Diseases}

\section*{Learning Objective:}

After reading this module, students should be able to;
\$ Define food poisoning.
\$ Identify two kinds of food intoxications caused by bacteria.
\# Discuss on common food/sources causing food poisoning, common disease and treatments after ingested, prevention step to avoid food poisoning.
'Food poisoning' is the applied to diseases caused by microorganisms. The term is used to include both illnesses caused by:
i. the ingestion of toxins produced by the organisms.
ii. result from infection of the host through the intestinal tract.

\section*{Therefore:}
i. A bacterial food intoxication refers to food-borne illnesses caused by the presence of a bacterial toxin formed in the food.
ii. A bacterial food infection refers to food-borne illnesses by the entrance of bacteria into the body through ingestion of contaminated foods and the reaction of the body to their presence or to their metabolites.

There are two kinds of food intoxications caused by bacteria:
i. Botulism - caused by the presence in food of toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum.
ii. Staphylococcal intoxication - caused by a toxin in the food from Staphylococcus aureus.

\subsection*{9.1 Botulism}

Botulism is a disease caused by the ingestion of food containing the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum.
- The food

The food involved in botulism usually foods that are inadequately processed home-canned foods, such as sweet corn, asparagus, peas, tomatoes and also preserved meats and fish.
- The disease

People are so susceptible to botulism that if appreciable amounts of toxin are present. Consumption of very small pieces of food can cause illness and death. The typical symptoms of botulism usually appear within 12 to 36 hours. The earliest symptoms usually are an acute digestive disturbance followed by nausea and vomiting and possibly diarrheal, together with fatigue, dizziness and a headache. Later there is constipation. Double vision may be evident early and difficulty in swallowing and speaking may be noted. Patients may complain of dryness of the mouth and constriction of the throat and the tongue may become swollen and coated. Involuntary muscles become paralyzed. Paralysis spreads to the respiratory system and heart, and death usually result from respiratory failure. In fatal case, death usually comes within 3 to 6 days after the poisonous food has been ingested, but the period may be shorter or longer.
- The prevention

The prevention methods and precautions of botulism include:
i. use of approved heat processes for canned foods.
ii. rejection of all gassy (swollen) or otherwise spoiled canned foods.
iii. refusal even to taste a doubtfully food.
iv. avoidance of foods that have been cocked, held and not well reheated.
v. boiling of a suspected food for at least 15 minutes.

\subsection*{9.2 Staphylococcus Food Intoxication}

One of the most commonly occurring food poisonings is caused by the ingestion of the enterotoxin formed in food during growth of certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The toxin in termed on enterotoxin because it causes gastroenteritis or inflammation of the lining of the intestinal tract.
- The Food

Custard and cream-filled bakery goods, ham and poultry have caused the most outbreaks in Staphylococcus food poisoning. Other foods include meats and meat products, fish and fish products, milk and milk products, salads, pudding, custards, pies and salad dressings.
- The Disease

Individual differ in their susceptibility to Staphylococcus poisoning. The incubation period for this kind of poisoning usually is 2 to 4 hour. The most symptoms are salivation, then nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping and diarrheal. Blood and mucus may be found in stools in severe cases. Headache, muscular cramping, sweating, weak pulse and shallow respiration may occur. The mortality is extremely low.
- Prevention

The prevention of staphylococcus food poisoning outbreaks include:
i. prevention of contamination of the food with the staphylococci
ii. prevention of the growth of staphylococci
iii. killing staphylococci in foods

Contamination of foods can be reduced by general methods of sanitation, by using ingredients free from the cocci; ex, use pasteurized milk and by keeping employees away from foods when these workers have staphylococcal infections. Growth of the cocci can be prevented by adequate refrigeration of foods.

\subsection*{9.3 Salmonellosis}

Salmonellosis may result following the ingestion of viable cells of the member of the genus Salmonella. It is the most frequently occurring bacterial food infection. In addition to the typical food-poisoning salmonellosis syndrome, there are two other disease syndromes result by consumption of salmonella, which is typhoid fever and parathyphoid fever.
- The Source

The important source of salmonella are poultry and their eggs and rodents, and also come from cats, dogs and cattle. About one-third of all the food products involved in salmonella outbreak are meat and poultry products. Infected rodents, rats and mice, may contaminate unprotected foods with their feces and thus spread Salmonella bacteria. Flies may play an important role in the spread of Salmonella, especially from contaminated faecal matter to foods. Roaches apparently also can spread the disease.
- The Disease

Incubation period for salmonellosis usually 12 to 36 hr . The principal symptoms of a Salmonella gastrointestinal infection are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrheal that usually appear suddenly. This may be proceeded by a headache and chills. Other evidences of the disease are muscular weakness, usually a moderate fever, restlessness and drowsiness. Usually the symptoms persist for 2 to 3 days.
- Prevention

Three main principles are involved in the prevention of outbreaks of food-borne Salmonella infections.
i. avoid contamination of the food from salmonella sources such as diseased human being / animals and carriers and ingredients carrying the organisms.
ii. destruction of the organisms in foods by heat when possible, as by cooking or pasteurization.
iii. prevention of the growth of Salmonella in foods by adequate refrigeration.

\subsection*{9.4 Enteropathogenic Esherichia coli}
E.coll 0157 : H7 is an emerging cause of food borne illness. This strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness.
- The Source

The organism can be found on a small number of cattle farms and can live in the intestines of healthy cattle. Meat can become contaminated during slaughter and organisms can be thoroughly mixed into beef when it is ground. Bacteria present on the cow's udder or on equipment may get into raw milk.
- The Food

Eating meat, especially ground beef, that has not been cooked sufficiently to kill E. coli 0157:H7 can cause infection. Drinking unpasteurized milk and swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water can also cause infection.
- The Disease

Bacteria in diarrheal stools of infected persons can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or hand washing habits are inadequate. This is particularly likely among toddlers who are not toilet trained. Family members and playmates of these children are at high risk of becoming infected.
E. coli 0157:H7 infection often causes bloody diarrheal and abdominal cramps, sometimes the infection causes nonbloody diarrheal or no symptoms. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days.

In some persons, the infection can also cause a complication called haemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail.
- The Treatment

Most persons recover without antibiotics or other specific treatment in 5-10 days. Haemolytic uremic syndrome is a life-threatening condition usually treated in an intensive care unit. Blood transfusions and kidney dialysis are often required. With intensive care, the death for haemolytic uremic syndrome is $3-5 \%$.

Discovery of microorganisms.
- Microorganisms were regarded as the cause of disease.
- Development in the areas of disinfection and sterilization.
- Aspects of immunization to prevent diseases.

\section*{Development of microbiology}
A) Ancient civilization - history
- Ancient people believed that diseases originated from gods after wronging them. Some also believed that the knowledge of diseases were myths.
- They had an idea that diseases would be transmitted from the sick person to the healthy ones. Their form of treatment was secretive.
- They isolated themselves from the sick persons through; avoiding shaking of hands, not sharing foods etc.
- They had different forms of treatment such as surgery, bathing of bodies using herbs etc.
- They did not keep reference of treatment procedures.
- They had different hypothesis such as sickness was associated with poor people. They did not have knowledge of the diseases and the microbes.
- Soon after many years scholars and scientists started formulating hypothesis, keeping records and they did different discoveries.
- After these records and discoveries, scholars and scientists started sharing their experiences in conferences
- Ancient microbiology

\section*{1) Egypt and Chinese}
- Since the beginning of humanity, other living organisms existed. A brief history of ancient civilization is approved that early man had a vague idea about diseases. For instance, Egypt and Chinese people practice washing in water to prevent diseases
- They also knew that disease would be transmitted from one person to another and isolated sick people from the healthy ones to prevent disease. They had an idea that diseases are infectious ie transmitted.
- They also practiced biological warfare .i.e contaminating water with blood, poisoning water and food eaten by their enemies

\section*{11) Jews}
- They practiced personal hygiene and washing to keep clean.
- They collected dirt to keep the environment clean.
- They isolated the sick from the health.
- They prohibited eating of dead meat.
- They also had a procedure of killing a nimals for food and designate the parts to be eaten by different people in the community.

\section*{B) Middle ages microbiology}
- During this time knowledge on public sanitation and transmission was lost in Europe and there was a general stagnation of culture and learning and it went on for about 1000 yrs

\section*{c) Renaissance microbiology}
- Due to the negligence of public health, epidemics increased eg small pox, syphilis, rabies. This led to the early practioners to start thinking of the sources and transmission of these diseases. Most people believed that the diseases were curses from gods and started crude methods of treatment eg bleeding.

\section*{D) Early pioneers and their contributions in microbiology}
- Girolamo 1500s. In 1500 studied syphilis and said it was transmitted through germs from animals to humans and from objects. He had no proof i.e. no test or experiment was carried.
- Johannes Janseen 1590s and Galileo Galilei 1609 and others made contribution towards the discovery of the microscope.
- 1546 - Fracatorius discovered contagion e,g breathing, food etc.
- The first demonstration of microorganism was done in 1675 by Van Leeuwenhoek. He devised a simple microscope known as animalcule. He drew what he saw. He discovered protozoa, blood cells and sperms.
- Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch refined the microscope further and they did tests on the animalcules using the improved microscope. Van Leeuwenhoek was honored as the father of microbiology due to his work
- 1784 - Edward Jenner demonstrated the use of protective vaccination using cow pox. He used lesions of cowpox to inject in humans because it is similar to small pox. Vacca is a latin word meaning cow.
- 1867 - Joseph Lister a British surgeon postulated that certain chemicals when used to clean surgical instruments were disinfective. He used carbonic acid to reduce wound infection rates.
- 1877 - John Tyndal demonstrated sterilization using intermittent heating. This is the origin of the term 'Tyndallization'
- 1876 - Robert Koch demonstrated that B. athracus was the cause of anthrax in man and animals. They joined with Henle to form Henle-Koch's postulates.
- 1857 - Lois Pasteur demonstrated that the fermentation process required microorganisms.
- He developed the process of 'pasteurization'. He heated substances at high temperature and maintains it for some time.
- 1906 Paul demonstrated chemotherapy for syphilis using heavy metals
- Lois Pasteur and other scientists in mid 1800 s made advance trend in the field of microbiology the advances include:
- The concept of life must arise from preexisting life
- Development sterilization and pasteurization techniques i.e boiling milk
- Germ theory of fermentation
- Germ theory of disease
- Developed vaccines from killed or attenuated microbes/ bacteria
- During this period, the scientists kept records and discovered the relationship between microbes, disease and human life through the use of defined microscopes
- From the 19 th century to date, "Golden age", there are discoveries of antibiotics, new bacteria, vectors, ways of disease transmission and new drugs.
- John Snow did some work on cholera by mapping location of disease.
- He traced it to a bore hole and it was treated.

\section*{Robert Koch}
- he discovered pure culture research through extensive experiments and wrote reports and hypothesis concerning his research.
- He endeavored to find out experimentally the connection between microbes, how and where they are grown and can they be recovered from their colonies.
- In 1876, he established a procedure to proof the germ theory of disease; which states "a specific disesease is caused by a specific pathogen'.

\section*{Koch's postulates}
- They help in assigning a disease a causative agent. They are as follows:
A. An organism must be constantly present in the lesions for it to be incriminated as a cause of disease
13. The organism must be recovered in the pure culture
c. When inoculated in to susceptible animal it should reproduce the disease
D. The organism should be recovered from the animal
- The above postulates help in explaining the following important factors in microbiology:
- The importance of laboratory culture.
- Transmission and identification of microbes.
- He proved the suitability of culture growth.
- Only susceptible animals can get disease while others cannot due to strong immunity.

\section*{Exceptions to Koch's postulates}
- However with repeated experiments there are some circumstances where these postulates do not apply and these are termed as Exceptions to Koch's postulates. Examples:
- Carrier states-carry the microbes but do not display the symptoms. They can transmit the disease to other people who get infected
- Some microbes are difficult to grow in a laboratory culture and hence difficult to get a pure culture in the organism yet some of these can grow in living cells or organism. Egbacteria that cause leprosy, syphilis, most viruses
- Susceptibility i.e some animals are resistant to diseases eg rats. Some diseases are species specific eg cholera is present in animals but absent in warthogs
- some diseases develop in weakened states of health,these are called opportunistic or secondary diseases and only affect animals with weakened immunity
- Diseases where there are no causative pathogens eg diabetes, hypertension, scurvy. rickets
- Koch later went on to prove the aetiologic agents of cholera, plague and tuberculosis.

\section*{Cell Theory}
- It was proposed in 1838 by two German microbiologists' i.e Mathies and Theore and it stated that all living things are composed of cells.
- Later Rudolf enhanced the theory with the idea that cells must arise from existing ones, in other words life must arise from life.

\section*{Bacteria classification}

\section*{Morphological classification}
1. Rigid (un branched) several shapes e.g.
- Spheres-cocci. These can be clusters, chains, tetrads or pairs
- Rods e.g. bacilli
- Curved e.g. vibrios
2. Branched referred to as Actinomycetes
3. Indefinite shape e.g. mycoplasma
4. Flexuous un branched e.g. spirochetes
5. Miscellaneous e.g. rickettsiae

\section*{Biological classification}
- It helps in Taxonomy. It is based on consideration of all characteristics, anatomical, ecological, physiological or serological.

Nomenclature of bacteria
- The first name is the genus followed by species e.g staphylococcus aureus.

\section*{Microbiological methods}
- Microscopy this involves several types of microscopes e.g
a) Ordinary light microscope as power of $\times 10-\times 1000$
b) Dark ground microscope. It differs with the light microscope because of light arrangement. Light is not direct to the observing eyes.
c) Phase contrast detects a three dimensional object
d) Fluorescent microscope uses fluorescence
e) Electron microscope. It has a resolution of 0.005 mm

\section*{microscopy}

\section*{During microscopy we use:}
1. Wet preparation - the object is suspended in a liquid
- Stained preparation-Gram stain which divides microorganisms into two.
- Gram positive organisms stain purple or blue
- Gram negative microorganisms stain pink
- Other stains are:
1. Methyleneblue
2. Albert stain
3. Ziehl-Neelsen stain
4. Negative counter

\section*{Steps in gram staining}
- There are four basic steps of the Gram stain:
i. Applying a primary stain (crystal violet) to a heat-fixed smear of a bacterial culture. Heat fixation kills some bacteria but is mostly used to affix the bacteria to the slide so that they don't rinse out during the staining procedure
ii. The addition of iodine, which binds to crystal violet and traps it in the cell
iii. Rapid decolorization with ethanol or acetone
iv. Counterstaining with safranin. Carbol fuchsin is sometimes substituted for safranin since it more intensely stains anaerobic bacteria, but it is less commonly used as a counterstain.
2. Culture and isolation
3. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobials
4. Serology

\section*{Bacteria Anatomy}
- Bacteria are made of single cells relatively primitive known as Prokaryotic cells. Their size is about 0.4 micrometers therefore they can only be observed using a microscope
- In a microscope they are seen as single cells or aggregates (clusters).
- Some occur in 25, others 4s and others 8s depending on the species. Some form chains
- They vary in shape; they can be spherical e.g. cocci, rod shaped e.g. bacillus. There are also coma shaped ones e.g. vibrio. Some are thin and form spirals and are called spirochetes. There are also thin and elongated ones called filamentous bacteria e.g. Actomycetes
- Bacteria spores are formed from cells mainly bacilli and are a resting phase in the life cycle.
- They are formed from living cells; such organisms are referred to as spore forming.
- The spore retains genetic material and has a hard covering a round it.
- The shapes of spores vary; they can be spherical or oval.
- special stains are used to see them.

\section*{Structure of a Bacterium:}

\section*{Nucleus - (nucleoid)}
- Chromatin material - contains genes borne on thread like chromosomes
- Is has a homogeneous materials with nucleus membrane and a nucleolus
- It consists of a single double stranded nucleus.
- It occurs in form of a closed circle.
- It replicates and grows by binary fission not mitosis and contains the genetic material.

\section*{Cytoplasm}
- Bulk made of soft gel, water and contains a variety of organic and inorganic materials.
- Mostly it contains granules which are the form in which bacteria store reserve materials.
- It contains Ribosomes and lacks organelles e.g.

Mitochondria, Endoplasmic Reticulum

\section*{Cytoplasmic membrane}
- Cytoplasmic membrane - it is thin and made of semi permeable membrane.
- Consists of glycol proteins and different from mammalian cytoplasmic membrane because it lacks cholesterol.
- It provides selective permeability and allows waste products out of cells. It contains enzymes

\section*{Cell membrane}
- Cell membrane - it is a typical unit membrane composed of phospholipids and proteins.
- The membranes of prokaryotes are distinguished from those of eukaryotic cells by the absence of sterols, the only exception being mycoplasmas, which incorporate them into their membranes when growing in sterolcontaining media.

\section*{The major functions of the cell membrane are:}
- Selective permeability and transport of solutes into the cell
- Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in aerobic species
- The excretion of hydrolytic exoenzymes
- Serves as the site of enzymes and carrier molecules which function in the biosynthesis of DNA, cell wall polymers and membrane lipids

\section*{Cell wall}
- It is Rigid and this provides support and maintains cell shape
- When broken contains substances absent in mamalial cells called Peptidoglycan (Murein or mucopeptide) it contains $N$-acetyl muramic acid, and $N$-acetyl-glucosamine linked alternatively attached to it are pentapeptides to this sugar.
- The composition of these peptides differs.
- Bacteria are classified as gram positive or gram negative according to the Gram staining procedure. The cells are first stained with crystal violet and iodine and then washed with acetone or alcohol. This latter step decolorizes gram negative bacteria but not gram positive bacteria.
- The difference between gram positive and gram negative has been shown to reside in the cell wall.

\section*{Quantity of peptidoglycan:}
- In gram +ve it is 50-90\%
- It also contains Teichoic acid and Teichuronic acid important as it acts as an antigen
- In gram - ve - forms 5-10\%
- There are also glycoproteins and glycopolysacharides.
- These are important in gram - ve -because this glycopolysacharides act as a lipopolysacharide and forms an endotoxin.
- The Cell wall is a target of antibiotics e.g. some interfere with its activity.
- Some enzymes e.g. lysozyme - breaks down links between the sugars and the cell wall.
- In addition to osmotic protection, the cell wall plays an essential role in cell division as well as serving as a primer for its own biosynthesis.

\section*{Special components of Grampositive cell walls}

\section*{1. Teichoic acids}
- These are water soluble polymers, containing ribitol or glycerol residues joined through phosphodiester linkages.
- They constitute major surface antigens of those gram - positive species which posses them
- They also bind magnesium ion and play a role in the supply of this ion to the cell.
- Most of them also contain large amounts of Dalanine

\section*{2. Polysaccharides}
- These are neutral sugars such as mannose, a rabinose, galactose, ramnose and glucosamine and acidic sugars such as glucuronic acid and mannuronic acid.

\section*{Special components of Gram Negative cell walls}
1. Lipoprotein - they cross-link the outer membrane and peptidoglycan layer
2. Outer membrane - It is a phospholipids bilayer, relatively permeable to small molecules, hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic
3. Liposaccharide - they consist of a complex lipid, called lipid A

\section*{Ribosomes}
- Consist of 70 s sedimentation constants and each has 2 units 50 s and 30 s subunits.
- They are sites for protein synthesis.

Inclusion granules
- Not always present
- They store metabolites
- Presence identifies certain bacteria by staining.

\section*{Mesosomes}
- Function unclear
- They are involved in mechanism for compartmenting DNA in spore formation.

\section*{Capsules}
- could be micro capsules or proper capsules
- They are made of gelatinous materials outside the cell wall.
- Consist mainly of water some contain proteins i.e. polypeptide and polysaccharides.
- They protect org. against various agents from other bacteria and also protect against phagocytosis

\section*{Flagellum}
- Elongated thread-like appendages composed entirely of protein $12-30 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter.
- They are the organs of locomotion for the forms that posses them.
- A bacterial flagellum is made up of a single kind of protein subunit called flagellin. .
- Flagellin is antigenic

\section*{Fimbriae (pilli)}
- They are numerous projections found in gram-ve bacteria.
- They are shorter and finer than flagellum.
- They are composed of protein subunits like flagellum.
- Help bacteria to adhere to a surface.
- The type whose is clearly known are the sex pili which play an essential role in the attachment of conjugating cells to each other.
- They transfer DNA from one organism to another. They are also used as receptor sites for certain bacteriophages
- One group of gram positive bacteria, the streptococci, bear an outer layer of extended protein hairs (fimbriae) called M protein. The M protein is the principal surface antigen of the streptococci and is essential for their establishment in the host.

\section*{Plasmid}
- They are genetic materials that are extra chromosomal.
- They can replicate autonomously.
- Consist of circular double stranded DNA.
- Common in gram - ve bacillus and can be exchanged in closely related organisms.

\section*{Endospores}
- Three genera of bacteria are capable of forming endospores. These are:
- Bacillus - (aerobic gram positive rods)
- Clostridium (anaerobic)
- Sporosarcina (gram positive coccus)
- These organisms undergo a cycle of differentiation in response to environmental conditions.
- Under conditions of nutritional depletion, each cell forms a single internal spore which is liberated when the mother cell undergoes autolysis. (This is the process of sporulation which involves the production of many new structures, enzymes and metabolites along with the disappearance of many vegetative cell components).
- The spore is a resting cell, highly resistant to desiccation, heat and chemical agents.
- Under favorable nutritional conditions, the spore germinates to produce a single vegetative cell.

\section*{Properties of Endospores}
- Core -This is the spore protoplast
- Spore wall - It is the innermost layer surrounding the inner spore membrane. It contains normal peptidoglycan and becomes the cell wall of the germinating vegetative cell
- Cortex - It is the thickest layer of the spore envelop. Its peptoglycan is extremely sensitive to lysozyme, and its autolysis plays a key role in spore germination
- Coat - It is composed of keratine like protein containing many intramolecular disulfide bonds. It is impermeable and thus offers the spores relative resistance to antibacterial chemical agents
- Exosporium - It is a lipoprotein membrane containing some carbohydrate

\section*{Nutritional Requirements for Bacterial growth}
- Varies according to Bacteria
1. Hydrogen and oxygen - these are provided in water.
2. Carbon - for the synthesis of compounds by some organisms. Obtain it from atmosphere, air, ( $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.) (Saprophytes are not disease causing). others get it from fatty acids and most pathogenic bacteria belong here.
3. Nitrogen - obtained from Ammonia which is incorporated in also from deamination.
4. Inorganic salts and minerals - acts as enzyme activators and include $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{Ca}, \mathrm{Mg}, \mathrm{PO}_{4}$
5. Organic compounds - Amino acid, monosacharides, lipids. These provide growth factors and also used in biosynthesis to larger molecules.

\section*{Classification of bacteria}
- Strict or obligate aerobes - Require $O_{2}$ to remain viable. $\mathbf{O}_{2}$ is final electron acceptor in the energy production pathways. Waste products are $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and energy stored by conversion of ADP to ATP. This is the oxidative phosphorylation
- Strict anaerobes - grow and remain viable in absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. They are easily killed in presence of $\mathrm{O}_{2} \cdot e \cdot g$ this is seen in fermentation and the end products are lactic acid,
$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, Hydrogen and Alcohol. Energy is produced and stored in the granules. This is known as substrate level phosphorylation

Facultative anaerobes - can utilize either method to obtain energy.

\section*{BACTERIAL GROWTH}
- Environmental factors influence rate of bacterial growth such as pH, temp, water activity, macro and micro nutrients, oxygen levels, and toxins.
- Conditions tend to be relatively consistent between bacteria.
- Bacterium have optimal growth conditions under which they thrive, but once outside of those conditions the stress can result in either reduced or stalled growth, dormancy (eg formation spores), or death.
- Maintaining sub-optimal growth conditions is a key principle to food preservation.

\section*{Temperature}
- Low temptend to reduce growth rates which has led to refrigeration being instrumental in food preservation.

\section*{Acidity}
- Optimal acidity for bacteria tends to be a round pH 6.5 to 7.0 with the exception of acidophiles. Some bacteria can change the pH such as by excreting acid resulting in sub-optimal conditions.
- Water activity?

Oxygen?
- Micronutrients?

Toxins?

\section*{Lag phase}
- During lag phase, bacteria adapt themselves to growth conditions. It is the period where the individual bacteria are maturing and not yet able to divide.
- During the lag phase of the bacterial growth cycle, synthesis of RNA, enzymes and other molecules occurs.

\section*{Exponential Phase}
- It is the phase of maximum growth.
- Cells divide at a constant rate. New cell material is being synthesized at a constant rate, but the new material is itself catalytic and the mass increases in an exponential manner.
- This continues until one of 2 things happens: either one or more nutrients in the medium become exhausted, or toxic metabolic products accumulate and inhibit growth.
- For aerobic organisms, the nutrient that becomes limiting is usually oxygen. There is a linear relationship between time and number of cells growth.
- In the human body, bacteria at this time cannot be killed easily, and can easily overwhelm the body.

\section*{Maximum Stationary phase}
- There is neither growth nor death
- Growth ceases because of exhaustion of nutrients or the accumulation of toxic waste products. In most cases, however, cell turnover takes place in the stationary phase: there is a slow loss of cells through death, which is just balanced by the formation of new cells through growth and division
- Cells can exhibit variation difference in their morphology.
- Some form spores, others produce exotoxins.

\section*{Death phase}
- After a period of time in stationary phase, which varies with the organism and with the culture conditions, the death rate increases until it reaches a steady level
- Organisms are non viable, incapable of growing even if transferred to a nother culture. They lose selective permeability.
- Accumulation of toxic material occurs and eventually lysis takes place.

\section*{BACTERIAL}

\section*{GENETICSGENETICS}

\section*{INHERITANCE}
- Genetic material in microorganism is in the nucleus
- The bacterial chromosome is a continuous DNA structure approximately 1 nm long.
- The DNA molecule consists of a double helix made up of 2 complementary polynucleotide strands in each of which Purine and Pyrimidine bases are arranged along a backbone made of alternating deoxyribose and phosphate groups.
- The 2 strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between neighboring bases; the stereochemistry is such that hydrogen bonds can be formed only between adenine and thymine (A-T pair) and between guanine and cytosine ( $G-C$ pair). Thus a sequence of bases along one strand such as G-C-C-A-C-T-C-A must be matched on the opposite strand by the complimentary sequence of C-G-G-T-G-A-G-T-
- This arrangement has been made in such a manner that bacterial DNA looks like this; sketch the above
- The segment that comprises of a full sequence which could code so some enzyme is called a gene. That is;
- A gene is a DNA segment that can code for an enzyme.
- Codon - is a three base pair which could code a specific amino acid
- Genome - full complimentary set of gene found in any bacteria. They range from 1000-3000 normally.
- When the genetic material is undergoing replication it starts from a specific point which is initiated by the enzyme DNA polymerase. This enzyme initiates cleavage and runs along the DNA molecule and divides it into 2 complimentary parts which quickly synthesize the other complementary molecule.
- There are processes which lead to complete different DNA but most times the daughter cells are similar to the original.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_4b18cc5eef11ee2de26dg-089.jpg?height=1907&width=2470&top_left_y=45&top_left_x=189)
- The 2 major processes leading to different daughter cells are
$\square$ Mutation
$\square$ Gene transfer

\section*{1. Mutation}
- Any change in genetic material which changes the structure and hence the function of a specific protein constitutes mutation.
- 1. Mutation can be due to sequence changes due to base-pair substitution.
- a) This can be spontaneous whereby most changes are reversible.
- b) It can also be induced by mutagenic agents. Mutagenic agents include:
$\square$ Radiations e.g. $x$-rays, ultraviolet light etc
$\square$ Chemical agents such as nitrous acid, alkylating agents ( $e$. gethylmethane-sulfonate) proflavine dye
2. Mutation can also be due to breakage of sugar phosphate linkages

\section*{Mutations mechanisms}
- Mutations occur by different mechanisms e.g
- a) Deletion- it is a process whereby a base pair of the genome is deleted e.g.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_4b18cc5eef11ee2de26dg-093.jpg?height=268&width=1467&top_left_y=854&top_left_x=209)
- b) Insertion - A segment of the base pairs is inserted in a new place e.g.
$$\begin{array}{lc}
T-A-T-C-G-A & \text { Insert } T-A \quad T-A-T-T-G \\
A-T-A-G-C-T & A-T-A-A-C
\end{array}$$
- c) Frame shift - may involve folding over, overlap and thus cause a new gene arrangement.

Mutation is a process which can be reversible but some are irreversible.
- Example of reversible mutation

Fimbriated organism ated org.
- Example of irreversible (this is also referred to as smooth-rough mutation)
Capsulated org Non scroulated
- An organism undergoing from smooth - rough mutation also loses its virulence
- Mutation affects lots of activities in the bacterial cell.
- It can give rise to observable effects e.g.

Appearance staining characteristics metabolic activities.

\section*{EFFECTS OF MUTATION}
- Nonsense mutations - do not influence any activity in an organism.
- Lethal mutations affect key functions in the organism and organism dies
- Conditionally lethal mutations - may affect ability of organism to utilize certain materials but if placed in a condition.... Where we have the substance it can still grow.

\section*{2. Gene transfer}
- Takes place in 3 ways
a) Transformation
b) Transduction
c) Conjugation

\section*{a) Transformation}
- Refers to the uptake of DNA form environment that is usually released to the environment by already dead bacteria.
- In transformation, the recipient cell takes up soluble DNA released from the donor cell .it occurs in both gram tve and gram - ve bacteria
- It was demonstrated by Griffin (read about it)

\section*{b) Transduction}
- In this process, a fragment of donor chromosomes is carried to the recipient by a temperate bacteriophage.
- Bacteria acquire new genetic material as a result of transfer by bacteriophages.
- Bacteriophages are virus specialized in infecting bacteria They can cause-- 2 major effects.
$\square$ Lysis
$\square$ Insert their genetic material into the bacteria which is transferred during division i.e. Temperate
- Both are capable of co-existing with the bacteria for some time.
- Bacteria virulence can be influenced by the bacterial phage e,g, the Diptheria in man.

\section*{c) Conjugation}
- Involves two closely related org.
- Conjugation refers to transfer of genetic material from one bacterium which is donor (male) to a nother bacterium which is the recipient (Female) through contact.
- It occurs as follows: the cell exudes a special protein thread, called a sex pilus, which is coded for by plasmid genes.
- This thread, which may be several times the length of the cell, has a tip which adheres to gramnegative cell walls. Any gram - negative cell which touches it becomes tethered to the plasmidcontaining cell

\section*{Requirements for conjugation}
$\square 2$ bacteria cells
$\square$ Plasmid
$\square$ Sexpili
$\square$ Fertility factor (F)
$\square$ Transfer factor sex pili (Fimbriae)
$\square$ Resistance factor
$\square$ Conchlane factor
$\square$ Clumping factors
- Plasmid is an extra chromosomal material which is capable of dividing, is transmissible, and has transfer factors.
- Others help in providing resistance to antibiotics and are referred to as Resistance factors (R factors)
- During conjugation the zorganisms came into contact.
- This influences, virulence, sensitivity to antibiotics, and other activities

\section*{Restriction endonucleases}
- These are unique enzymes which cleave incoming would be cells.
- They find their application in genetic engineering (used in synthesizing some hormones)
