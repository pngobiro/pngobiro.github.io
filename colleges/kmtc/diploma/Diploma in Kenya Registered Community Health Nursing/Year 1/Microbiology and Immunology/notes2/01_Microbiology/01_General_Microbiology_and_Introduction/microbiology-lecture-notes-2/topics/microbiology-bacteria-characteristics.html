                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The bacteria (singular: bacterium) are a large group of unicellular microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a wide range of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals.</p>
                        <p>Bacteria are ubiquitous in every habitat on Earth, growing in soil, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, water, and deep in the Earth's crust, as well as in organic matter and the live bodies of plants and animals.</p>
                        <p>There are typically 40 million bacterial cells in a gram of soil and a million bacterial cells in a millilitre of fresh water</p>
                        <p>Bacteria are vital in recycling nutrients, with many steps in nutrient cycles depending on these organisms, such as the fixation of nitrogen</p>
                        <p>The study of bacteria is known as bacteriology, a branch of microbiology.</p>
                        <p>There are about ten times as many bacterial cells in the human flora of bacteria as there are human cells in the body, with large numbers of bacteria on the skin and as gut flora.</p>
                        <p>Majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, and a few are beneficial. A few species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases.</p>
                        <p>Bacteria are important in sewage treatment, the production of cheese and yoghurt through fermentation, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.</p>
                        <p>Once regarded as plants, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles.</p>
                        <p>Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor.</p>
                        <p>These are called Bacteria and Archaea.</p>
                        <p>Bacteria were first observed by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope of his own design.</p>
                        <p>The name bacterium was introduced much later, by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1838.</p>
                        <p>Louis Pasteur demonstrated in 1859 that the fermentation process is caused by the growth of microorganisms, and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation. (Yeasts and molds, commonly associated with fermentation, are fungi.)</p>
                        <p>Along with Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease. Robert Koch was a pioneer in medical microbiology and worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his research into tuberculosis, Koch finally proved the germ theory. In Koch's postulates, he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a disease these postulates are still used today.</p>

                        <p>As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan, which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane.</p>
