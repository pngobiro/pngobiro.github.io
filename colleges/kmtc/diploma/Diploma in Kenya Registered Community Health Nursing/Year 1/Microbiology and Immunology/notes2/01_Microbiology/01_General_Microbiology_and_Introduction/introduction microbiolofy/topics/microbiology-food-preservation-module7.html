                        <p>The temperatures and time used in heat-processing a food will depend on what effect heat has on the food and what other preservative methods are to be employed.</p>
                        <p>The greater the heat treatment the more organisms will be killed up to the heating that will produce sterility of the product. The various degrees of heating used on foods might be classified as:</p>

                            <li>pasteurization</li>

                        <h3 id="pasteurization" class="subsection-heading">7.2.1 Pasteurization</h3>
                        <p>Pasteurization is a heat treatment that kills part but not all of the microorganisms present and usually involves the application of temperatures below $100^{\circ}\text{C}$.</p>
                        <p>Pasteurization is used when:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>More rigorous heat treatment might harm the quality of the product (milk).</li>
                            <li>One aim is to kill pathogens (milk).</li>
                            <li>The main spoilage organisms are not very heat resistant (yeast in fruit juices).</li>
                            <li>When any surviving spoilage organisms will be taken care of by additional preservative methods to be employed as in the chilling of market milk.</li>
                            <li>When competing organisms are to be killed, allowing a desired fermentation, usually by added starter organisms, as in cheese making.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Times and temperatures used in the pasteurizing process depend on the method employed and the product treated. For example:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Milk is pasteurized at:

                                    <li>$62.8^{\circ}\text{C}$ for 30 min</li>
                                    <li>$71.7^{\circ}\text{C}$ for 15 sec</li>

                                <ol type="i">

                                    <li>$82.2^{\circ}\text{C}$ for 16 to 20 sec</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 id="heating-at-100c" class="subsection-heading">7.2.2 Heating at about $100^{\circ}\text{C}$</h3>
                        <p>Home canners processed all foods for varying lengths of time at $100^{\circ}\text{C}$ or less. This treatment was sufficient to kill everything but bacterial spores in the food and often was sufficient to preserve even low - and medium - acid foods.</p>
                        <p>A temperature of approximately $100^{\circ}\text{C}$ is obtained by:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>boiling a liquid food</li>

                            <li>exposure to flowing steam</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Heat processing includes:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Baking - the internal temperature of bread, cake or other bakery product approaches but never reaches $100^{\circ}\text{C}$ as long as moisture is present, although the oven is much hotter.</li>
                            <li>Roasting - in roasting meat the internal temperature reaches only about $80^{\circ}\text{C}$.</li>
                            <li>Frying - frying gets the outside of the food very hot, but the centre ordinarily does not reach $100^{\circ}\text{C}$.</li>
                            <li>Blanching - blanching fresh vegetables before freezing or drying involves heating briefly at about $100^{\circ}\text{C}$.</li>

                        <p>Drying is usually accomplished by the removal of water. For example: Dried fish may be heavily salted so that moisture is drawn from the flesh and bound by solute and hence is unavailable to microorganisms. For sweetened condensed milk, sugar may be added to reduce the amount of available moisture.</p>
                        <p>Heat applied during a drying process causes a reduction in total numbers of microorganisms, but the effectiveness varies with the kinds and numbers of organisms originally present and the drying process employed.</p>
