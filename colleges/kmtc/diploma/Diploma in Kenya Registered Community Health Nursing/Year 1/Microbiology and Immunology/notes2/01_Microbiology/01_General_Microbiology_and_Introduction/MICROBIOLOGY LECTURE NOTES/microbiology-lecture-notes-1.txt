\subsection*{1.1 INTRODUCTION TO MICROBIOLOGY}

Microbiology is a subject which deals with living organisms that are individually too small to be seen with the naked eye.

It considers the microscopic forms of life and deals about their reproduction, physiology, and participation in the process of nature, helpful and harmful relationship with other living things, and significance in science and industry.

\section*{Subdivision of microbiology}

Bacteriology deals about bacteria.
Mycology deals about fungi.
Virology deals about viruses.

\section*{History of Microbiology}

Man kind has always been affected by diseases which were originally believed to be visitations by the gods and meant to punish evil doers.

Hippocratus, father of medicine, observed that ill health resulted due to changes in air, winds, water, climate, food, nature of soil and habits of people.

Varro (117-26 BC)said a theory that disease was caused by animated particles invisible to naked eye but which were carried in the air through the mouth and nose into the body.

Fracastorius ( 1500 G.C.) proposed that the agents of communicable disease were living germs, that could be transmitted by direct contact with humans and animals, and indirectly by objects ; but no proof because of lacking experimental evidence.

Antony Van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723 G.C.), father of Microbiology, observed "animalcules" using simple microscope with one lens.

He was the first who properly described the different shapes of bacteria.

Although Leeuwenhoek was not concerned about the origin of micro-organism; many other scientists were searching for an explanation for spontaneous appearance of living things from decaying meat, stagnating ponds, fermenting grains and infected wounds.

On the bases of this observation, two major theories were formulated.
1. Theory of Abiogenesis
2. Theory of Biogenesis

Theory of Abiogenesis deals with the theory of spontaneous generation; stating that living things originated from non-living things.

Aristotle (384-322 BC): The founder of a theory spontaneous generation.

He observed spontaneous existence of fishes from dried ponds, when the pond was filled with rain.

Francesco Redi (1626-1697): He is the scientist who first tried to set an experiment to disprove spontaneous generation.
- He put the meat in a bottle and covered it with a gauze.
- He observed that the flies laid eggs from which the maggots developed.
- He said maggots did not developed from meat but from flies egg.

Theory of Biogenesis states that life comes from pre-existing life.
Louis Pasteur (1822-1895 GC) was the scientist who disproved the theory of abiogenesis.

He designed a large curved flask (Pasteur goose neck flask) and placed a sterile growth broth medium. Air freely moved through the tube; but dust particles were trapped in the curved portion of flask. Microbial growth in the broth was not seen.

Therefore Pasteur proved that micro-organisms entered to substrates through the air and micro-organisms did not evolve spontaneously.

\section*{Major contribution of Louis Pasteur}
1. Microbial theory of fermentation
2. Principles and practice of sterilization and pasteurization
3. Control of diseases of silk worms
4. Development of vaccines against anthrax and rabies.
5. Discovery of streptococci

\section*{The germ theory of disease}

The complete establishment of the germ theory of disease depended on the work of a German scientist, Robert Koch (18431910).

\section*{Major achievements of Robert Koch}
1. Discovery and use of solid medium in bacteriology
2. Discovery of causative agents of tuberculosis and cholera.
3. Koch's phenomenon
4. Koch's postulates

\section*{Koch's postulates: proof of germ theory of disease}

A micro-organism can be accepted as a causative agent of an infectious disease only if the following conditions are satisfied.
1. The micro-organism should be found in every case of the disease and under conditions which explain the pathological changes and clinical features.
2. It should be possible to isolate the causative agent in pure culture from the lesion.
3. When such pure culture is inoculated into appropriate laboratory animal, the lesion of the disease should be reproduced.
4. It should be possible to reisolate the bacterium in pure culture from the lesion produced in the experimental animal.
5. Now a days additional postulate is mentioned i.e.

Specific antibody to the bacterium should be detectable in the serum during the course of the disease.

It has not been possible to fulfil every one of Koch's postulates, but by adhering to them as closely as possible, serious errors have been prevented.

\section*{Exceptions to Koch's postulates}
<smiles>[11CH3]</smiles>
1. Many healthy people carry pathogens but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease.
2. Some microbes are very difficult or impossible to grow in vitro(in the laboratory) in artificial media. Eg. Treponema pallidum
3. Many species are species specific. Eg. Brucella abortus cause abortion in animals but no report in humans.
4. Certain diseases develop only when an opportunistic pathogen invades immunocompromised host.

\subsection*{1.2. THE MICROBIAL WORLD}

\section*{TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANISMS}

TAXONOMY is the science of organisimal classification.
Classification is the assignment of organisms (species) into anorganised scheme of naming .idealy these schemes are based on evolutionary relationships (i.e the more similar the name, the closer the evolutionary relationships). Thus, classification is concerned with:-
1. The establishment of criteria for identifying organisms \& assignment to groups (what belongs where)
2. The arrangement of organisms into groups of organism of organism (e.g. At what level of diversity should a single species be split in to two or more species?).
3. Consideration of how evolution resulted in the formation these groups.

\section*{TAXON:-}
- A group or category of related organisms.

Two key characteristics of taxa are:
-Members of lower level taxa (e.g. Species) are more similar to each other than are members of higher level taxa (eg.Kingdom or domain).
-Member of specific taxa are more similar to each other than any are to members of different specific taxa found at the same hierarchical level (eg. Humans are more similar to apes, i.e., comparison between species, than either is similar to, for example, Escherichia coli). Thus once you know that two individuals are member of the same taxon, you can inter certain similarities between the two organisms.
NOTE that taxa are dynamic, changing as our knowledge of organism and evolutionary relationships change

\section*{BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE}
- Organisms are named using binomial nomenclature ( viruses are exceptions)
- Binomial nomenclature employs the names of the two level taxa, genus and species, to name a specie. Binomial nomenclature includes:
i. Genus comes before species (e.g., Escherichia coli)
ii. Genus name is always capitalized (e.g., Escherichia)
iii. Species name is never capitalized (e.g., coli)
iv. Both names are always either italicized or underlined ( e.g Escherichia coli )
v. The genus name may be used alone, but not the species name (i.e saying or writing "Escherichia" alone is legitimate while saying or writing " coli" is not)

Strain
a) A strain in some ways is equivalent to a breed or subspecies among plants or animal. Strain is the level below the species
b) Two members of the same strain are more similar to each other than either is to an individual that is a member of a different strain, even if all three organisms are members of the same species

Bacterial species
- A bacterial species is defined by the similarities found among its members. Properties such as biochemical reactions, chemical composition, cellular structures, genetic characteristics, and immunological features are used in defining a bacterial species. Identifying a species and determining its limits presents the most challenging aspects of biological classification for any type of organism.
- A formal means of distinguishing bacterial species is by employing a dichotomous key to guide the selection of test used to efficiently determine those bacterial properties most relevant to bacterial identification

The five kingdom system

The five kingdom system was first proposed in 1969 and is showing its age

The five kingdoms include:
i. Plantae ( the plants)
ii. Fungi ( the fungi)
iii. Animalia ( the animals )
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-019.jpg?height=364&width=1026&top_left_y=956&top_left_x=528)

\section*{- Eubacteria}

Are our common, everyday bacteria, some of which are disease causing; also the taxon from which mitochondria originated.
- Cyanobacteria

Are photosynthetic eubacteria, the taxon from which chloroplast originated
- Archaeobacteria

Are distinctive in their adaptation to extreme environments (e.g., very hot, salty, or acidic) though not all archaeobacteria live in extreme environments.

These distinctions are more phenotypic than they are evolutionary (i.e., a cyanobacteria is a eubacteria, and neither is an archaebacteria).

\section*{Kingdom Protista}

Protista like Monera consist mostly of unicellular organisms. Distinctively, however, the members of Kingdom Protista are all eukaryotic while the mebers of kingdom Monera are all prokaryotic. Some members of protista are multicellular, however Kingdom protista represents a grab bag, essentially the place where the species are classified when they are not classified as either fungi, animals or plants.

\section*{Kingdom Fungi}

Unlike pprotists, the eukaryotic fungi are typically non - aquatic species. They traditionally are nutrients absorbers plus have additional distinctive features. They do exist unicellular fungi, which we call yeast

\section*{DOMAIN}

The domain is a taxanomic category that, depending on point of view, is either above the level of kingdom or supercedes the kingdom. The domain system contains three members
- Eukaryotes ( domain Eukarya )
- Eubacteria ( domain Bacteria)
- Archaebacteria ( domain Archaea)

Viral classification
Classification of viruses is not nearly as well developed as the classification of cellular organisms. Today viruses tend to be classified by their chemical, morphological and physiological attributes (e.g. genome $=$ DNA vs RNA, virion particle $=$ enveloped vs non enveloped and myriad details of their intracellular infection cycles). Binomial nomenclature is not employed to name viruses; instead viruses are named by their common names (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus a.k.a HIV)

Dichotomous key
A means of assigning an organism to a specific taxonomic category typically involves the use of specific criteria that may posed as questions ( e.g. What does the organism look like etc. ). Relevant criteria may be arranged as a dichotomous key. In a dichotomous key questions are arranges hierarchically with more general questions are asked first, with questions becoming more specific asked subsequently

\section*{EUKARYOTIC CELL}

Eu- true
Karyote- nucleus

The eukaryotic cell has a true membrane bound nucleus, usually containing multiple chromosomes, a mitotic apparatus, a well defined endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.

\section*{PROKARYOTIC CELL}

Pro- primitive
Karyote- nucleus
The prokaryotic cell possesses naked DNA with out associated basic proteins, divides amitotically by binary fission and bounded by a semi rigid cell wall.

\subsection*{1.3. STRUCTURE OF BACTERIA}

Bacterial structure is considered at three levels.
1. Cell envelope proper: Cell wall and cell membrane.
2. Cellular element enclosed with in the cell envelope: Mesosomes, ribosomes, nuclear apparatus, polyamies and cytoplasmic granules.
3. Cellular element external to the cell envelope: Flagellum, Pilus and Glycocalyx.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-024.jpg?height=687&width=1071&top_left_y=193&top_left_x=527)

Fig. 1.1 Ultrastructure of Bacteria
1. Cell envelope proper
A. Cell wall

Multi layered structure and constitutes about 20\% of the bacterial dry weight.

Average thickness is $0.15-0.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.
Young and rapidly growing bacteria has thin cell wall but old and slowly dividing bacteria has thick cell wall.

It is composed of N -acetyl Muramic acid and N -acetyl Glucosamine back bones cross linked with peptide chain and pentaglycine bridge.

Components of cell wall of Gram negative bacteria
1. Peptidoglycan
2. Lipoprotein
3. Phospholipid
4. Lipopolysaccharide

Components of cell wall of Gram positive bacteria
1. Peptidoglycan
2. Teichoic acid
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-025.jpg?height=1018&width=1077&top_left_y=559&top_left_x=513)

Fig. 1.2 Cell wall of Gram Positive \& Gram Negative Bacteria

\section*{Functions of cell wall}
1. Provides shape to the bacterium
2. Gives rigidity to the organism
3. Protects from environment
4. Provides staining characteristics to the bacterium
5. Contains receptor sites for phages/complements
6. Site of action of antibody and colicin
7. Contains toxic components to host

\section*{Bacteria with defective cell walls}

Bacteria with out cell wall can be induced by growth in the presence of antibiotics and a hypertonic environment to prevent lysis. They are of three types:
1. Protoplasts: Derived from Gram-positive bacteria and totally lacking cell walls; unstable and osmotically fragile; produced artificially by lysozyme and hypertonic medium: require hypertonic conditions for maintenance.
2. Spheroplast: Derived from Gram-negative bacteria; retain some residual but non-functional cellwall material; osmotically fragile;produced by growth with penicillin and must be maintained in hypertonic medium.
3. L- forms: Cell wall-deficient forms of bacteria usually produced in the laboratory but sometimes spontaneously formed in the body of patients treated with penicillin; more stable than protoplasts or spheroplasts, they can replicate in ordinary media.

\section*{B. Cell membrane}

Also named as cell membrane or cytoplasmic membrane
It is a delicate trilaminar unit membrane .
It accounts for $30 \%$ of the dry weight of bacterial cell.
It is composed of $60 \%$ protein, $20-30 \%$ lipids and $10-20 \%$ carbohydrate.

\section*{Function of cell membrane}
1. Regulates the transport of nutrients and waste products into and out of the cell.
2. Synthesis of cell wall components
3. Assists DNA replication
4. Secrets proteins
5. Carries on electron transport system
6. Captures energy in the form of ATP
2. Cellular element enclosed with in the cell envelope

\section*{A. Mesosomes}

Convoluted invagination of cytoplasmic membrane often at sites of septum formation.
It is involved in DNA segregation during cell division and respiratory enzyme activity.

\section*{B. Ribosomes}

Cytoplasmic particles which are the sites of protein synthesis. It is composed of RNA(70\%) and proteins(30\%) and constitutes 90\% of the RNA and 40\% of the total protein.

The ribosome monomer is 70s with two subunits, 30s and 50s.

\section*{C. Polyamines}

They are of three types
. Putrescin
. Spermidine
Spermine
It is found in association with bacterial DNA, ribosomes and cell membrane.

\section*{Function of polyamines}
1. Antimutagenic.
2. Prevent dissociation of 70s ribosome into subunits.
3. Increase resistance of protoplast lysis.
D. Cytoplasmic granules
. represent accumulated food reserves.
Nature of granules
Glycogen
. Poly-beta hydroxy butyrate
. Babes-ernst (Volutin)

\section*{E. Nuclear apparatus}

Well defined nucleus and nuclear membrane, discrete chromosome and mitotic apparatus are not present in bacteria ; so nuclear region of bacteria is named as nuclear body, nuclear apparatus and nucleoid.

Bacterial genome consists of single molecule of double stranded DNA arranged in a circular form.

Besides nuclear apparatus, bacteria may have extra chromosomal genetic material named as plasmids.

Plasmids do not play any role in the normal function of the bacterial cell but may confer certain additional properties(Eg. Virulence, drug resistance) which may facilitate survival and propagation of the micro- organism.

\section*{3. Cellular element external to the cell envelope}

\section*{A. Glycocalyx (capsule and slime layer)}

Capsule is gel firmly adherent to cell envelope.
Slime is gel easily washed off from cell envelope.
All bacteria have at least a thin slime layer.
Capsule is composed of polysaccharide and protein(D-Glutamate of Bacillus anthracis)

\section*{Features of capsule}
1. Usually weakly antigenic.
2. Not necessary for viability.
3. Endows virulence.
4. Protects from phagocytosis.
5. Capsulated strains are invariably non-motile.
6. Visualized by negative staining and capsule staining.
7. Detected by quellung phenomenon.

\section*{B. Flagellum}

It is the organ of locomotion in bacterial cell and consists of thee parts. These are .The filament
. The hook
. The basal body
The basal body and hook are embedded in the cell surface while the filament is free on the surface of bacterial cell.

Fig. 1.5 Morphology of Bacteria

\section*{2. Staining of bacteria}

Bacterial staining is the process of coloring of colorless bacterial structural components using stains (dyes). The principle of staining is to identify microorganisms selectively by using dyes, fluorescence and radioisotope emission.

Staining reactions are made possible because of the physical phenomena of capillary osmosis, solubility, adsorption, and absorption of stains or dyes by cells of microorganisms.

Individual variation in the cell wall constituents among different groups of bacteria will consequently produce variations in colors during microscopic examination.

Nucleus is acidic in character and hence, it has greater affinity for basic dyes. Whereas, cytoplasm is basic in character and has greater affinity for acidic dyes.
There are many types of affinity explaining this attraction force:
1. hydrophobic bonding
2. reagent-cell interaction
3. reagent-reagent interaction
4. ionic bonding
5. hydrogen bonding
6. covalent bonding

Why are stains not taken up by every microorganism?
Factors controlling selectivity of microbial cells are:
1. number and affinity of binding sites
2. rate of reagent uptake
3. rate of reaction
4. rate of reagent loss (differentiation or regressive staining)

Properties of dyes
Why dyes color microbial cells?
Because dyes absorb radiation energy in visible region of electromagnetic spectrum i.e., "light"(wave length 400-650). And absorption is anything outside this range it is colorless. E.g., acid fuschin absorbs blue green and transmit red.
General methods of staining
1. Direct staining

Is the process by which microorganisms are stained with simple dyes. E.g., methylene blue
2. Indirect staining - is the process which needs mordants.

A mordant is the substance which, when taken up by the microbial cells helps make dye in return, serving as a link or bridge to make the staining recline possible.

It combines with a dye to form a colored "lake", which in turn combines with the microbial cell to form a " cell-mordant-dyecomplex"

It is an integral part of the staining reaction itself, without which no staining could possibly occur. E.g., iodine.

A mordant may be applied before the stain or it may be included as part of the staining technique, or it may be added to the dye solution itself.

An accentuator, on the other hand is not essential to the chemical union of the microbial cells and the dye. It does not participate in the staining reaction, but merely accelerate or hasten the speed of the
staining reaction by increasing the staining power and selectivity of the dye.

\section*{Progressive staining}
- is the process whereby microbial cells are stained in a definite sequence, in order that a satisfactory differential coloration of the cell may be achieved at the end of the correct time with the staining solution.

\section*{Regressive staining}
- with this technique, the microbial cell is first over stained to obliteratethe cellulare desires, and the excess stain is removed or decolorized from unwanted part.

\section*{Differentiation (decolorization)}
is the selective removal of excess stain from the tissue from microbial cells during regressive staining in order that a specific substance may be stained differentiallyh from the surrounding cell.
Differentiation is usually controlled visually by examination under the microscope

\section*{Uses}
1. To observe the morphology, size, and arrangement of bacteria.
2. To differentiate one group of bacteria from the other group.

Biological stains are dyes used to stain micro-organisms.

\section*{Types of microbiological stains}
.Basic stains
. Acidic stains
. Neutral stains

NB: This classification is not based on $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}$ of stains.

Basic stains are stains in which the coloring substance is contained in the base part of the stain. The acidic part is colorless. Eg.

Acidic stains are stains in which the coloring substance is contained in the acidic part of the stain. The base part is colorless. It is not commonly used in microbiology laboratory. Eg. Eosin stain

Neutral stains are stains in which the acidic and basic components of stain are colored.

Neutral dyes stain both nucleic acid and cytoplasm. Eg. Giemsa stain

Types of staining methods
1. Simple staining method
2. Differential staining method
3. Special staining method
1. Simple staining method

It is type of staining method in which only a single dye is used.

2. Negative staining: The dye stains the background and the bacteria remain unstained. Eg. Indian ink stain Negrosin stain

\section*{2. Differential staining method}

Multiple stains are used in differential staining method to distinguish different cell structures and/or cell types. Eg. Gram stain and ZiehlNeelson stain

\section*{A. Gram staining method}

Developed by Christian Gram.
Most bacteria are differentiated by their gram reaction due to differences in their cell wall structure

Gram-positive bacteria are bacteria that stain purple with crystal violet after decolorizing with acetone-alcohol.

\section*{Preparation of culture media}

Culture media contains essential ingredients for microbial growth requirements.

For successful isolation of pathogens, culture media must be prepared carefully.

Most culture media are available commercially in ready -made dehydrated form.

The major processes during preparation of culture media
- Weighing and dissolving of culture media ingredients
- Sterilization and sterility testing
- Addition of heat-sensitive ingredients
- Dispensing of culture media
- pH testing of culture media
- Quality assurance of culture media
- Storage of culture media
1. Weighing and dissolving of culture media ingredients

Apply the following while weighing and dissolving of culture media ingredients
- Use ingredients suitable for microbiological use.
- Use clean glass ware, plastic or stainless steel equipment.
- Use distilled water from a glass still.
- Do not open new containers of media before finishing previous ones.
- Weigh in a cool, clean, dry and draught-free atmosphere.
- Weigh accurately using a balance.
- Wear a facemask and glove while weighing and dissolving toxic chemicals.
- Do not delay in making up the medium after weighing.
- Add powdered ingredients to distilled water and mix by rotating or stirring the flask.
- Stir while heating if heating is required to dissolve the medium.
- Autoclave the medium when the ingredients are dissolved.

\section*{2. Sterilization and sterility testing}

Always sterilize a medium at the correct temperature and for the correct length of time as instructed in the method of preparation. Methods used to sterilize culture media
A) . Autoclaving
B) Steaming to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
C) . Filtration

\section*{A) Autoclaving}

Autoclaving is used to sterilize most agar and fluid culture media.

\section*{B) Steaming at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$}

It is used to sterilize media containing ingredients that would be inactivated at temperature over $100{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and re-melt previously bottled sterile agar media.

\section*{C) Filtration}

It is used to sterilize additives that are heat-sensitive and can not be autoclaved.

\section*{Sterility testing}

The simplest way to test for contamination is to incubate the prepared sample media
At $35-37{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 24 hours. Turbidity in fluid media and microbial growth in solid media confirm contamination.

\section*{3. Addition of heat-sensitive ingredients}

Refrigerated-heat sensitive ingredients should be warmed at room temperature before added to a molten agar medium.

Using an aseptic technique, the ingredients should be added when the medium has cooled to $50{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and should be distributed immediately unless further heating is required.
4. pH testing

The pH of most culture media is near neutral, and can be tested using pH papers or pH meter.

\section*{5. Dispensing of culture media}

Media should be dispensed in a clean draught-free room using aseptic technique and sterile container.

\section*{Dispensing agar media in petridish}
- Lay out the sterile petridishes on a level surface.
- Mix the medium gently by rotating the flask or bottle.
- Flame sterilize the neck of flask or bottle.
- Pour 15 ml of medium in each petridish.
- Stack the plates after the medium has gelled or cooled.
- Store the plates in a refrigerator.

NB: Agar plates should be of an even depth and of a firm gel. The surface of the medium should be smooth and free from bubbles.

\section*{6. Quality control}
- Inoculate quarter plates of the medium with a five hours broth culture for each control organism.
- Use a straight wire to inoculate and wire loop to spread the inoculum.
- Depending on the species, incubate aerobically, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enriched atmosphere and anaerobically at $35-37{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 24 hours.

Examine for the degree of growth, morphology and other characteristics of microbial colonies.

Record the result of each control species and compare to your standard reading.

\section*{Storage of culture media}
- Dehydrated culture media and dry ingredients should be stored at an even temperature in a cool dry place away from direct light.
- Plates of culture media, and additives like serum, blood and antimicrobials in solid form require storage at $2-8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- Antimicrobials in solution form should be stored at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- All culture media and additives should be labeled with the name and date of preparation.

\section*{Inoculation of culture media}

When inoculating culture media, an aseptic technique must be used to prevent contamination of specimens and culture media, and laboratory worker and the environment.

\section*{Aseptic technique during inoculation of culture media}
- Decontaminate the workbench before and after the work of the day.
- Use facemask and gloves during handling highly infectious specimens.
- Flame sterilize wire loops, straight wires, and metal forceps before and after use.

Fig. 1.6 Aseptic inoculation technique

\section*{Inoculation of media in petridishes}

The inoculation of media in petridishes is named as 'plating out' or 'looping out'.

Before inoculating a plate of culture media, dry the surface of the media by incubating at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes.

To inoculate a plate, apply the inoculum to a small area of the plate ('the well') using sterile wire loop and then spread and thin out the inoculum to ensure single colony growth.

Fig. 1.9 Inoculation of slant media

\section*{Inoculation of fluid media}

To inoculate fluid media, use straight wire or wire loops.

\section*{Incubation of cultures}

Inoculated media should be incubated as soon as possible.
Optimal temperature, humidity and gaseous atmosphere should be provided for microorganisms to grow best.
The temperature selected for routine culturing is $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Some pathogens require $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-enriched atmosphere to grow in culture media, and the simplest way to provide $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-enriched atmosphere is to enclose a lighted candle in an airtight jar which provides $3-5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by the time the candle is extinguished.

Anaerobic atmosphere is essential for the growth of strict anaerobes, and the techniques for obtaining anaerobic conditions are the following:
> . Anaerobic jar with a gas generating kit.
> . Reducing agents in culture media.

\subsection*{1.6. BACTERIAL NUTRITION}

Bacteria, like all cells, require nutrients for the maintenance of their metabolism and for cell division.

Bacterial structural components and the macromolecules for the metabolism are synthesized from the elements. The four, most important elements of bacteria are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.

\section*{Carbon}

Organisms require a source of carbon for the synthesis of numerous organic compounds that comprise protoplast.

Depending on their requirements, bacteria can be classified as
1. Autotrophs: Free-living, non-parasitic bacteria which use carbondioxide as carbon source.

The energy needed for their metabolism can be obtained from:
. Sun light-Photoautotrophs
. Inorganic compounds by oxidation-Chemoautotrophs
2. Heterotrophs: Parasitic bacteria require more complex organic compounds as their source of carbon and energy.

Human pathogenic bacteria are heterotrophs.
The principal source of carbon is carbohydrate which are degraded either by oxidation, in the presence of oxygen, or by fermentation, in the absence of oxygen, to provide energy in the form of ATP.

\section*{Hydrogen and oxygen}
- Obtained from water.
- Essential for the growth and maintenance of cell.

\section*{Nitrogen}

Constitutes 10\% of dry weight of bacterial cell.
Obtained from organic molecules like proteins and inorganic molecules like ammonium salts and nitrates.

NB: Main source of nitrogen is ammonia, in the form of ammonium salt.

\section*{Growth factors}

Growth factors are organic compounds that are required by microorganisms in small amounts which the cell can not synthesize from other carbon source.

These are aminoacids, purines and pyrimidines, and vitamins.
Prototrophs: Wild-type bacteria with normal growth requirements.
Auxotrophs: Mutant bacteria, which require an additional growth factor not needed by the parental or wild type strain.

\subsection*{1.7. BACTERIAL GROWTH}

It is an orderly increase in all the components of an organism.
It is an increment in biomass.
It is synchronous with bacterial cell reproduction.

\section*{Generation time}

It is the time taken for the size of a bacterial population to double. Bacteria grow by taking nutrients and incorporate them into cellular components; then bacteria divide into two equal daughter cells and double the number.

\section*{Bacterial growth phases}

The pattern in cell numbers exhibited by bacterial population obtained after inoculation Of a bacterium into a new culture medium.

The normal bacterial growth curve has four phases.

\section*{1. Lag phase}

The period of adaptation with active macro molecular synthesis like DNA, RNA, various enzymes and other structural components.

It is the preparation time for reproduction; no increase in cell number.

\section*{2. Exponential(log) phase}

The period of active multiplication of cells.
Cell division precedes at a logarithmic rate, and determined by the medium and condition of the culture.

\section*{3. Maximal stationary phase}

The period when the bacteria have achieved their maximal cell density or yield.

There is no further increase in viable bacterial cell number.
The growth rate is exactly equal to the death rate.
A bacterial population may reach stationary growth when one of the following conditions occur:
1. The required nutrients are exhausted
2. Inhibitory end products are accumulated
3. Physical conditions do not permit a further increase in population size

\section*{4. Decline phase}

The period at which the rate of death of bacterial cells exceeds the rate of new cell formation.

There is drastic decline in viable cells.
Few organisms may persist for so long time at this period at the expense of nutrients released from dying micro-organisms.

Fig. 1.11 Bacterial growth curve

Quantitative measurement of bacterial growth
Bacterial growth is measured by determining number of bacteria.
The common measuring methods are
1. Viable plate count
2. Direct count
3. Turbidimetric method

\section*{1. Viable plate count}

The most common method of estimating bacterial growth which involves counting the number of bacterial colonies grown on solid media after incubation of the inoculated media for 18-24 hours.

\section*{Procedure}
- The sample is serially diluted.
- The suspension is inoculated on solid media by surface spread technique i.e. the suspension is spread
- The plate is incubated for $18-24 \mathrm{hrs}$ to allow the bacteria to grow and form colonies.
- The concentration of bacteria in the original sample can be determined by counting the visible colonies multiplied by the dilution factor.

\section*{Number of colonies $=$ Number of colonies X dilution factor}

\section*{Volume of sample}

NB: The statistically significant plate count is between 30 and 300 colonies.

Less than 30 colonies on a plate are not accepted for statistical reasons.

Greater than 300 colonies on a plate are too close to distinguish as an individual colony forming unit (too numerous to count).

Limitation of viable plate count: It selectively in favor of a certain group of bacterial population.

\section*{2. Direct count}

It involves direct microscopic counting of bacteria in the sample using counting chamber.

It is relatively quick and does not need the sample to be incubated.

\section*{Procedure}
. Serial dilution of the sample
. Fill known area and volume of the counting chamber with the sample
. Total number of bacteria in the sample per unit volume is equal to No. of bacteria in the sample X the No. of squares X dilution factor.

\section*{3. Turbidimetric method}

It is the method of determination of bacterial growth in liquid media.
Bacterial growth increases the turbidity of liquid to absorb light.
The turbidity of the suspension is determined by spectrophotometer.

\section*{Factors influencing bacterial growth in vitro}

Not all bacterial species grow under identical environmental conditions. Each bacterial species has a specific tolerance range for specific environmental parameters.

Out side the tolerance range environmental conditions for a bacteria to reproduce, it may survive in dormant state or may lose viability. Rates of bacterial growth are greatly influenced by the following environmental parameters.
. Nutrition
. Temperature
. Oxygen
. $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}$
. Salinity
. Pressure
. Light radiation

\section*{1. Nutrition}

The following nutrients must be provided for optimal bacterial growth.
- Hydrogen donors and acceptors
- Carbon source
- Nitrogen source
- Minerals: sulfur and phosphorus, trace elements
- Growth factors: amino acids, purines, pyrimidines and

\section*{2. Temperature}

Temperature tolerance range: The minimum and maximum temperature at which a micro-organism can grow; which is different in different species of bacteria.
Optimal growth range of temperature: The temperature at which the maximum growth rate occurs; and results in the shortest generation time of bacteria.

Based on different optimal growth temperature requirement, bacteria are divided into:

\section*{Optimal growth temperature}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
. Psychrophilic bacteria & $.15-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; grow best at low $\mathrm{T}^{0}$ range \\
. Mesophilic bacteria & $.30-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; grow best at middle $\mathrm{T}^{0}$ range \\
. Thermophilic bacteria & $.50-60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; grow best at high $\mathrm{T}^{0}$ range
\end{tabular}

NB: Most human pathogens and many of the normal flora of human bodies have an optimal temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; There fore they are mesophilic bacteria.

\section*{3. Oxygen}

Base on oxygen requirements and tolerance, bacteria are divided classified as:

Obligate aerobes
Obligate anaerobes
Facultative anaerobes
Microaerophiles
- Obligate aerobic bacteria grow only when free oxygen is available to support their respiratory metabolism.

They obtain ATP by using oxygen as a final electron acceptor in respiration.
- Obligate anaerobic bacteria grow in the absence of oxygen; exposure to oxygen kills anaerobes.
- Facultative anaerobic bacteria grow in the presence or absence of oxygen.

They obtain ATP by fermentation or anaerobic respiration
- Microaerophilic bacteria grow best at reduced oxygen tension; high oxygen tension is toxic to them.

\section*{4. Hydrogen ion concentration}

It is a measure of acidity and alkalinity.
$\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}<7$ is acidic
$\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}=7$ is neutral
$\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}>7$ ia alkaline
- Neutrophilic bacteria grow best at near neutral $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}$ value.
- Acidicophilic bacteria prefer to grow at low $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}$ value (acidic medium).
- Alkalinophilic bacteria prefer to grow at high $P^{H}$ value
5. Salinity

Salt content of the medium affects bacterial growth.
Halophilic bacteria grow best at high salt concentration.
. Moderate halophiles require $3 \%$ salt concentration.
. Extreme halophiles require $15 \%$ salt concentration.
Most bacteia can not tolerate high salt concentration. High salt concentration disrupts membrane transport systems and denatures proteins of bacteria but halophiles have adaptive mechanisms to tolerate high salt concentration.

\section*{6. Pressure}

Osmotic pressure: The pressure exerted on bacterial cell surface as a result of difference in solute concentration between the inside and out side of a cell.

Osmotolerant bacteria can grow in solutions with high solute concentration.

Osmophilic bacteria grow best at high hydrostatic pressure.
Hydrostatic pressure: The pressure exerted by the weight of a water column.

High hydrostatic pressures more than 200 atmosphere generally inactivates enzymes and disrupts membrane transport process.

Barotolerant bacteriacan grow at high hydrostatic pressure.
Barophilic bacteria grow best at high hydrostatic pressure.

\section*{7. Light radiation}

Photosynthetic bacteria require light in the visible spectrum to carry out photosynthesis.

\section*{COMMON BIOCHEMICAL TESTS}

\section*{Litmus milk reduction test:}

Required: Litmus milk medium
Wire loop
Bunsen burner
Test bacteria
Method:
. Inoculate 0.5 ml of sterile litmus milk medium with the test bacteria.
. Incubate at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ for up to 4 hrs .
. Observe for changes in color every 30 min .

Results:
. Change in color of medium from pink to white or pale is suggestive of enterococci

CAMP test (Christie, Atkins, Munich Paterson )
Principle: S.agalaciae produce protein named as camp factor, which interacts with staphylococci $\beta$ hemolysin on sheep red blood cell.

Method:
. Streak S.aureus isolate across sheep blood agar plate.
- Inoculate the test bacteria at right angle to staphylococci with out touching it.
. Incubate over night at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
Formation of an arrow-head shaped area of hemolysis indicates interaction of camp factor with staphylococci hemolysin.

\section*{Bacitracin test}

Principle: Streptococcus pyogenes is sensitive to bacitracin but other kinds of streptocci are resistant to bacitracin.

Method:
. Streak a blood agar plate with the isolated organism.
. Place bacitracin disc in the streaked area.
. Incubate the plate for 24 hours at 370 c.
. Examine the plate for a zone of no-growth around the disc.

No-growth around the disc.................. S.pyogenes
Growth around the disc ..................... Other streptococci

\section*{Optochin test}

Principle: S. pneumoniae is sensitive to optochin disc unlike other alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

Method:
. Streak a blood agar plate with the isolated organism. Place optochin disc in the streaked area.

Incubate the plate for 24 hours at 370 c.
- Examine the plate for a zone of no-growth around the disc.

No-growth around the disc .....S.pneumoniae
Growth around the disc ...otherAlphahemolytic streptococci

\section*{Carbohydrate utilization test}

Method:
Prepare saline suspension of test bacteria
. Add 0.1 ml of bacterial suspension into each of four test tubes containing glucose, lactose, maltose and sucrose carbohydrate discs.
. Incubate in a water bath at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and examine at 30 min intervals for 5 hrs for change in color.

Result: Change in color from red to yellow-orange indicates carbohydrate utilization.

\section*{BILE SOLUBILITY TEST}

This helps to differentate S.pneumoniae, which is soluble in bile and bile salts, from viridans streptococci which are insoluble.

\section*{Principle}

A heavy inoculum of the test organism is emulsified in physiological saline to give a turbid suspension. The bile salt sodium deoxycholate is then added. The test can also be performed by adding the bile salt to a broth culture of the organism. The bile salt dissoles S.pneumoniae as shown by a clearing of the turbidity within 10-15 minutes. Viridans streptococci are not dissolved and therefore there is no clearing of the turbidity.

\section*{Required}

Sodium deochollate $100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$
Physiological saline (sodium chloride, $8.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ )

\section*{Method}
- Emulsify several colonies of the test organism in a tube containing 2 ml of sterile physiological saline, to give a turbid suspension.
- Divide the organism suspension between two tubes.
- To one tube, add 2 drops of the sodium deoxycholate reagent and mix.
- To the other tube, add 2 drops of sterile distilled water and mix.
- Leave both tubes for 10-15 minutes.
- Look for a clearing of turbidity in the tube containing the sodium deoxycholate.

Results
Clearing of turbidity ------------ Probably
S.pneumoniae

No clearing of turbidity -----------organism is probably
Not S.pneumoniae

There should be no clearing of turbidity in the tube to which distilled water was added. If there is, repeat the test.

Note: Some strains of S.pneumoniae are not dissolved by bile salts, and very occasionally some strains of viridans streptococci give a positive tests.

\section*{Controls}

Bile solubility positive control: Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Bile solubility negative control: Streptococcus faecalis.

\section*{CATALASE TEST}

This test is used to differentiate those bacteria that produce the enzyme catalase, such as staphylococci, from non-catalase producing bacteria such as streptococci.

\section*{Principle}

Catalase acts as a catalyst in the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.

An organism is tested for catalase production by bringing it into contact with hydrogen peroxide. Bubbles of oxygen are released if the organism is a catalase producer. The culture should not be more than 24 hours old.

Care must be taken if testing an organism cultured on a medium containing blood because catalase is present in red cells. If any of the blood agar is removed with the colony, a false positive reaction will occur. It is usually recommended, therefore, that catalase testing be performed from a blood free culture medium such as nutrient agar

\section*{Required}
a. Hydrogen peroxide, $3 \% \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$

Note: Shaking the reagent before use will help to expel any dissolved oxygen. False positive reactions may occur if the hydrogen peroxide contains dissolved oxygen.

\section*{Method}
- Pour $2-3 \mathrm{ml}$ of the hydrogen peroxide solution into a test tube.
- Using a sterile wooden stick or a glass rod, remove a good growth of the test organism and immerse it in the hydrogen peroxide solution.

Note: A nichrome wire loop must not be used because this may give a false positive reaction.
- Look for immediate bubbling.

\section*{Results}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-074.jpg?height=226&width=925&top_left_y=738&top_left_x=584)

Note: if the organism has been cultured on an agar slope, pour about 1 ml of the hydrogen peroxide solution over a good growth of the organism, and look for the release of bubbles.

Caution: performing the test on a slide is not recommended because of the risk of contamination from active bubbling. If the rapid slide technique is used, the hydrogen peroxide solution should be added to the organism suspension after placing the slide in a petridish. The dish should then be covered immediately, and the preparation observed for bubbling through the lid.

\section*{Controls}

Positive catalase control: Staphylococcus species.
Negative catalase control: Streptococcus species.

\section*{CITRATE UTILIZATION TES}

This test is one of several techniques used to assist in the identification of enterobacteria. The test is based on the ability of an organism to use citrate as its only source of carbon and ammonia as its only source of nitrogen.

\section*{Principle}

The test organism is cultured in a medium which contains sodium citrate, an ammonium salt, and the indicator bromo - thymol blue. Growth in the medium is shown by turbidity and a change in colour of the indicator from light green to blue, due to the alkaline reaction, following citrate utilization.

\section*{Required}

Koser's citrate medium or Simmon's citrate agar.

\section*{Method}

Using a sterile straight wire, inoculate $3-4 \mathrm{ml}$ of sterile Koser's citrate medium with a broth culture of the test organism.

Note: Care must be taken not to contaminate the medium with carbon particles, such as from a frequently flamed wire.

Incubate the inoculated broth at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 4 days, checking daily for growth.

\section*{Results}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-076.jpg?height=1061&width=1075&top_left_y=269&top_left_x=525)

Free coagulase which converts fibrinogen to fibrin by activating a coagulase - reacting factor present in plasma. Free coagulase is detected by the appearance of a fibrin clot in the tube test. Bound coagulase (clumping factor) which converts fibrinogen directlyto fibrin without requiring a coagulase - reacting factor. It can be detected by the clumping of bacterial cells in the rapid slide test. It is usually recommended that a tube test should be performed on all negative slide tests. A tube test must always be
performed if the result of the slide test is not clear, or when the slide test is negative and the Staphylococcus has been isolated from a serious infection.

\section*{Required}
a. Undiluted human plasma (preferably pooled) or rabbit plasma. The plasma should be allowed to warm to room temperature before being used.

Plasma from EDTA (ethylenediamine - tetra - acetic acid) or citrate anticoagulated blood is usually used.

Note: Occasionally citrate-utilizing organisms such as Klebsilla can cause the clotting of citrated plasma in the tube test. This can be prevented by adding heparin to the citrated plasma. It is also possible for human plasma to contain inhibitory substances which can interfere with coagulase testing. Adequate controls must be included for both slide and tube tests.

\section*{Method for slide test (to detect bound coagulase)}

Place a drop of physiological saline on each end of a slide, or on two separate slides.

Emulsiy a colony of the test organism in each of the drops to make two thick suspensions.

Note: Colonies from a mannitol salt agar culture are not suitable for coagulase testing. The organism must first be cultured on nutrient agar or blood agar.

Add a drop of plasma to one of the suspensions, and mix gently. Look for clumping of the organisms within 10 seconds.

No plasma is added to the second suspension. This is used to differentiate any granular appearance of the organism form true coagulase clumping.

\section*{Results}

Clamping within 10 secs -------------------- S.---- S.aureus
No clumping within 10 secs-----------No bound coagulase produced.

\section*{Controls}

Positive coagulase control: Staphylococcus aureus.
Negative coagulase control: Escherichia coli or
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-078.jpg?height=204&width=1039&top_left_y=955&top_left_x=527)

Dilute the plasma 1 in 10 in physiological saline (mix 0.2 ml of plasma with 1.8 ml of saline).

Take three small test tubes and label:
$\mathrm{T}=$ Test organism (18-24h broth culture)
Pos $=$ Positive control (18-24h staph. Aureus broth culture)

Neg = Negative control (sterile broth)
A suitable broth is brain heart infusion
Pipette 0.5 ml of the diluted plasma into each tube.
Add 5 drops (about 0.1 ml ) of the test organism culture to the tube labeled 'T'.

Add 5 drops of the staph. Aureus culture to the tube labeled 'Pos'.

Add 5 drops of sterile broth to the tube labeled 'Neg'. After mixing gently, incubate the three tubes at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Examine for clotting after 1 hour. If no clotting has occurred, examine at 30 minute intervals for up to 6 hours.

When looking for clotting, gently tilt each tube.
Most Staph, aureus strains produce a fibrin clot within 1 hour of incubation. There should be no fibrin clot in the negative control tube.

Results
Fibrin clot ----------------------------S. aureus
No fibrin clot --------------------- No free coagulase produced

DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE (DNAse) TEST
This test is used to differentiate Staph. Aureus which produces the enzyme DNAse from other staphylococci which do not produce DNAse. It is particularly useful if plasma is not available to peform a coagulase test or when the results of a coagulase test are difficult to interpret.

\section*{Principle}

Deoxyribonuclease hydrolyzes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
The test organism is cultured on a medium which contains DNA. After overnight incubation, the colonies are tested for DNAse production by flooding the plate with a weak hydrochloric acid solution. The acid precipitates unhydrolyzed DNA. DNAse producing
colonies are, therefore surrounded by clear areas indicating DNA hydrolysis.

\section*{Required}
a. DNAse agar plate

Up to six organisms may be tested on the same plate.
b. Hydrochloric acid, $1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$

\section*{Method}

Divide a DNAse plate into the required number of strips by marking the underside of the plate.

Using a sterile loop or swab, spot - inoculate the test and control organisms. Make sure each test area is clearly labeled.
Incubate the plate at $36-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ overnight.
Cover the surface of the plate with $1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{l}$ hydrochloric acid solution. Tip off the excess acid.
58. Look for clearing around the colonies within 5 minutes of adding the acid.

\section*{Results}

Clearing around the colonies ----------------DBAse positive strain.
No clearing around to colonies ------------DNAse negative strain.

\section*{Controls}

Positive DNAse control: staphylococcus arureus .
Negative DNAse control: staphylococcus epidermidis.

\section*{HYDROGEN SULPHID ( $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ ) PRODUCTION}

The detection of hydrogen sulphide gas $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}\right)$ is used mainly to assist in the identification of enterobacteria and occasionally to differentiate other bacteria such as Bacteroides and Bruceila species. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ is produced when sulphur - containing amino acids are decomposed.

\section*{Use of Kligler iron agar (KIA) to detect $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$}

This medium is suitable for detecting $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ production by enterobacteria. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ is detected by the ferric citrate contained in the medium.

Inoculate the test organism into KIA and incubate it at appropriate temperature over night.

Observe blacking of the medium

\section*{Lead acetate paper test to detect $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$}

When a sensitive technique for detecting $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ production is required, the lead acetate paper test is recommended.

Inoculate a tube or bottle of sterile peptone water or nutrient broth with the test organism.

Insert a lead acetate paper strip in the neck of the bottle or tube above the medium, and stopper well.
Incubate the inoculated medium at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and examine daily for a blackening of the lower part of the strip.

\section*{Results}

Blackening
Positive test H 2 S produced
No blackening $\qquad$ Negative test No H2S produced.

\section*{Controls}

Positive hydrogen sulphide control: proteus vulgaris
Negative hydrogen sulphide control: shigella species

\section*{INDOLE TEST}

Testing for indole production is important in the identification of enterobacteria. Most sftrains of E.coli, P.vulgaris, P.rettgeri, M.morganll, and providencia species break down the amino acid tryptophan with the release of indole.

\section*{Principle}

The test organism is cultured in a medium which contains tryptophan. Indole production is detected by Kovac's or Ehrlich's reagent which contains 4(P)-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. This reacts with the indole to produce a red coloured compound. In the following method the use of the combined motility indole urea (MIU) medium is described. A Kovac's ragent paper strip is inserted in the neck of the tube, and indole production is indicated by a reddening of the strip. Indole is a volatile substance (easily vaporized). The tube must be well stoppered during incubation.

The indole test can also be performed by culturing the organism in tryptone water or peptone water containing tryptophan, and
detecting indole production by adding Kovac's or Ehrlich's reagent to an 18-24h culture.

\section*{Required}

Motility indole urea (MIU) medium MIU medium indicates whether an organism is motile or non-motile, indole positive or negative, and urease positive or negative.

\section*{Method}

Using a sterile straight wire, inoculate 5 ml of sterile MIU medium with a smooth colony of the test organism.

Place an indole paper strip in the neck of the MIU tube above the medium, and stopper the tube, incubate at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ overnight.
Examine for idole production by looking for a reddening of the lower part.

\section*{Results}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-083.jpg?height=229&width=961&top_left_y=1390&top_left_x=528)

Note: If the reaction is weak, confirm the result by adding 1 ml of Kovac's regent to the culture. Examine for a red colouring of the surface layer within 10 minutes.

\section*{Controls}

Positive indole control: Escherichia coli
Negative indoloe control: Enterobacter aerogenes.

\section*{Motility Test}

This is shown by a spreading turbidity from the stab line or a turbidity throughout the medium (compare with an uninoculated tube).

\section*{Urease production}

This is shown by a red-pink colour in the medium.

\section*{NITRATE REDUCTION TEST}

This test is used to differentiate members of the Enterobacteriaceae that produce the enzyme nitrate reductase, from Gram negative bacteria that do not produce the enzyme.

The test is also helpful in differentiating Mycobacterium species as explained.

\section*{Principle}

A heavy inoculum of the test organism is incubated in a broth containing nitrate. After 4 hours, the broth is tested fro the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by adding sulphanilic acid reagent. If nitrite is present, the acid reagent is diazotizex and forms a pink-red compound with alpha-naphthylamine. When nitrite is not detected it
is necessary to test whether the organism has reduced the nitrate beyond nitrite. This is done indirectly by checking whether the broth still contains nitrate. Zinc dust is added which will convert any nitrate to nitrate. If no nitrite is detected when the zinc dust is added, it can be assumed that all the nitrate has been reduced beyond nitrite to nitrogen gas or ammonia by a nitrate reducing organism.

\section*{Required}
a. Nitrate broth
b. Sulphanilic acid reagent
c. Alphanaphthylamine reagent
d. Zinc dust

\section*{Method}

Inoculate 0.6 ml of sterile nitrate broth with a heavy growth of the test organism.
Incubate at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 hours.
Add 1 drop of sulphanilic acid reagent and 1 drop of alphanaphthylamine reagent.

Shake to mix and look for a red colour.

\section*{Results}
$\begin{array}{ll}\text { Red colour ------------------------------------------ } & \text { Positive test } \\ & \text { Nitrate reduced }\end{array}$
If no red colour is produced, add a very small amount (knife point) of zink dust powder. Look again for a red colour and intrpret as follows:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline \multirow[t]{2}{*}{Red colour} & Negative test \\
\hline & No reduction of nitrate \\
\hline No red colour & Positive test \\
\hline & Nitrate reduced \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Controls}

Positive nitrate reduction control: Escherichia coli. Negative nitrate reduction control: Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

\section*{OXIDASE TEST (Cytochrome Oxidase)}

The oxidase test is used to assist in the identification of pseudomonas, Neisseria, Vibrio, and Pasteurella species, all of which produce oxidase enzymes.

\section*{Principle}

A piece of filter paper is soaked with a few drops of oxidase reagent. A colony of the test organism is then smeared on the filter paper. If the organism is oxidase - producing, the phenylenediamine in the reagent will be oxidized to a deep purple colour. Occasionally the test is performed by flooding the culture plate with oxidase reagent but this technique is not recommended for routine use because the reagent rapidly kills bacteria. It can be useful, however, when attempting to isolate N.gonorrhoeae colonies from mixed cultures in the absence of a selective medium. The oxidase positive colonies must be removed and subcultured within 30 seconds of flooding the plate.

Important: Acidity inhibits oxidase enzyme activity. The oxidase test must not be performed, therefore, on colonies that produce fermentation on carbohydrate - containing media, such as sucrose fermenting V.cholerae colonies on TCBS medium, Subinoculation on nutrient agar is required before the oxidase test can be performed reliably. Non - fermenting colonies, however, can be tested. Colonies tested from a medium that contains nitrate may give unreliable oxidase test results.

\section*{Required}
- Oxidase reagent

Freshly prepared
This is a $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ solution of tetramethyl -p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride.

Note: Oxidase reagent is easily oxidized. When oxidized, it is blue in colour and must not be used.

\section*{Method}

Place a piece of filter paper in a clean petri dish and add 2 or 3 drops of freshly prepared oxidase reagent.

Using a piece of stick or glass rod (not an oxidized wire loop), remove a colony of the test organism, and smear it on the filter paper.

Look for the development of a blue - purple colour within a few seconds.

\section*{Results}
\begin{tabular}{ll} 
Blue-purple colour ---------------------------------------------------- & Positive test \\
(within 10 seconds) & Oxidase produced
\end{tabular}
No blue - purple colour ------------------------------------------
(within 10 seconds) $\quad$ No oxidase produced

Note: ignore any blue - purple colour that develops after 10 seconds.

\section*{Controls}

Positive oxidase control: Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Negative oxidase control: Escherichia coli.

\section*{OXIDATION - FERMENTATION (O-F) TEST}

This test is used to differentiate those organisms that oxidize. Carbohydrates (aerobic utilization) Such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, from those organisms that ferment carbohydrates (anaerobic utilization) such as members of the Enterobacteriaaceae.

\section*{Principle}

The test organism is inoculated into two tubes of a tryptone or peptone agar medium containing glucose (or other carbohydrate) and the indicator bromothymol blue. The inoculated medium in one tube is sealed with alayer of liquid paraffin to exclude oxygen.

Fermentative organisms utilize the carbohydrate in both the open and sealed tubes and the colour of the medium changes from green to yellow. Oxidative organisms, however, are able to use the carbohydrate only in the open tube. There is no carbohydrate utilization in the sealed tube (medium remains green).

Although most genera of aerobic bacteria are either carbohydrate oxidizers or fermenters, the production of acid may be slow and therefore cultures are usually incubated for 7-14 days

\section*{Required}
a. Oxidation fermentation (O-F) medium Glucose, maltose, and sucrose O-F media are the most commonly used.
b. Sterile paraffin oil (liquid paraffin)

\section*{Method}

Using a sterile straight wire, inoculate the test organism to the bottom of two bottles (or more if testing several carbohydrates) of sterile O-F medium. Use a heavy inoculum.

Cover the incculated medium in one of the tubes (or one from each carbohydrate pair) with a 10 mm deep layer of sterile paraffin oil or molten wax.

Incubate the tubes at 35-37OC for up to 14 days. Examine daily for carbohydrate utilization as shown by acid production.

\section*{Results}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline \multicolumn{1}{|r|}{ Open } & \begin{tabular}{l} 
Sealed \\
tube
\end{tabular} & Interpretation \\
\hline Yellow & Green & Oxidative organism \\
\hline Yellow & Yellow & Fermentative organism \\
\hline Green or blue & Green & No utilization of carbohydrate \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Controls}

Oxidative control: Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fermentative control: Escherichia coli.

\section*{PHENYLALANINE DEAMINASE TEST}

The test, which is also referred to as the Phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) test, is used mainly to assist in the identification of enterobacteria. It is based on the ability of bacteria such as Proteus specdies and some Providencia strains to break down phenylalanine (by oxidative deamination) with the production of phenylpyruvic acid. Y.enterocolitica (urease - producer is a phenylalanine negative.

\section*{Principle}

The test organism is cultured on a slope of phenyiaianine medium. After overnight incubation, the deamination of phenylaianjine to phenyl - pyruvic acid is detected by adding iron III chloride (ferric chloride) which produces a green colour on the surface of the culture.

\section*{Required}
a. Phanylalanine agar
b. Iron III chloride (ferric chloride),
$100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}(10 \% \mathrm{w} / \mathrm{v})$. The reagent must be freshly prepared.

\section*{Controls}

Positive PPA control: Proteus species
Negative PPA control: Escherichia coli.

\section*{TWEEN 80 HYDROLYSIS TEST}

This test is used mainly to differentiate slow-growing Mycobacterium species as described in $44: 1$ species that hydrolize the detergent Tween 80 with the production of oleic acid are listed in Chart.

\section*{Principle}

The test organism is incubated in a Tween 80 buffered substrate that contains the indicator neutral red. Tween hydrolysis is detected by a change in colour of the indicator from amber to pink - red due to the production of oleic acid.

\section*{Required}

Tween 80 phosphate buffered substrate with neutral red.

\section*{+ \\ Method}
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-092.jpg?height=183&width=896&top_left_y=971&top_left_x=655)
. Inoculate 4 ml of sterile Tween 80 phosphate buffered substrate with a loopful of growth of the test organism.
Incubate at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 18 days. Examine at 5,10 , and 18 days for a change in colour of the substrate from amber to pink-red, as shown in colour.

\section*{Results}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Pink-red substrate & \multirow{2}{*}{Positive test Tween 80 hydrolyzed} \\
\hline & \\
\hline No change in colour & Negative test No hydrolysis of Tween 80 \\
\hline & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Controls}

Positive Tween hydrolysis control: Mycobacterium kansasii.
Negative Tween hydrolysis control: Use an unlnoculated tube of substrate.

\section*{UREASETEST}

Testing for urease enzyme activity is important in differentiating entrobacteria. Proteus strains are strong urease producers. Y.enterocolitica also shows urease activity (Weakly a $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) Salmonellae and shigellae do not produce urease.

\section*{Principle}

The test organism is cultured in a medium which contains urea and the indicator phenol red. If the strain is urease-producing, the enzyme will beak down the urea (by hydrolysis) to give ammonia and carbon diaoxide. With the release of ammonia, the medium becomes alkaline as shown by a change iin colour of the indicator to red-pink.

The method described is that which uses the combined motility indole urea (MIU) medium, urease production can also be detected by culturing the organisms in Christensen's urea broth.

\section*{Required}
a. Motility indole urea (MIU) medium.

\section*{Method}
. Using a sterile straight wire, inoculate a tube of sterile MIU medium with a smooth colony of the test organism.
. Place an indole paper strip in the neck of the MIU tube above the medium. Stopper the tube and incubate at 35$37^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ overnight.
. Examine for urease production by looking for a redpink colour in the medium as shown in colour.

Note: After overnight incubation, y.enterocolitica gives a weak urease reaction and is non-motile at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. At room temperature $\left(22-293^{\circ} \mathrm{c}\right)$, the species is motile and shows a stronger urease reaction.

\section*{VOGES - PROSKAUER (V-P) TEST}

This test is occationally used to assist in the differentiation of enterobacteria. K.pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae blovar el tor, and some strains of Enterobacter, ferment glucose with the production of acetylmethylcarbinol (acetoin) which can be detected by an oxidation reaction.

\section*{Principle}

The test organism is cultured in a glucose phosphate peptone water for 48 hours. Sodium hydroxide and a small amount of creatine are then added. Under alkaline conditions and exposure to the air, the acation produced from the fermentation of the glucose is oxidized to diacetyl which forms a pink compound with the creatine.

\section*{Required}
a. Glucose phosphate peptone water.
b. Sodium hydroxide, $400 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$.
c. Creatine poweder.

\section*{Method}
vom
. Inoculate 2 ml of sterile glucose phosphate peptone water with the test organism. Incubate at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 48 hours.

Add a very small amount (knife point)of creatine and mix.
Add about 3 ml of the sodium hydroxide reagent and shake well,

Caution: The sodium hydroxide reagent is corrosive, therefore handle with care and do not mouth - pipette.
. Remove the bottle cap, and leave for 1 hour at room temperature. Look for the slow development of a pink - red.

\section*{Results}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Pink - red colour & Positive test \\
\hline & Acetoine produced \\
\hline No pink - red colour & Negative test \\

\end{tabular}

\section*{Controls}

V-P Positive control: Enterobacter aerogenes or Klebsiella pneumoniae

V-P Negative control: Escherichia coli.

\subsection*{1.8. BACTERIAL GENETICS}

Genetics is the study of inheritance. Bacterial inherited characteristics are encoded in DNA.

Bacteria have two types of DNA that contain their genes. These are :
Chromosome
Extra chromosome: Plasmid

The bacterial chromosome is circular, double stranded DNA attached to bacterial cell membrane.

DNA replication in bacteria is semi-conservative i.e. each strand of DNA is conserved intact during replication and becomes one of the
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-096.jpg?height=345&width=907&top_left_y=1177&top_left_x=628)

Fig. 1.12 Bacterial chromosome

Plasmids are self-replicating extra chromosomal DNA molecules.
It multiplies independent of the host cell.
Multiple copies of the same plasmid may be present in each bacterial cell.

Different plasmids are also often present in the same bacterial cell.

\section*{Plasmid types}

There are many types of plasmid types. The following are examples.
a. R factors: Plasmids which contain genes that code for antibiotic resistance.
b. Col factors: Plasmids which contain genes that code for extracellular toxin (colicines) production that inhibit strains of the same and different species of bacteria.
c. F(fertility) factors: Plasmids that can recombine itself with the bacterial chromosome.

It promotes transfer of the chromosome at a high frequency of recombination into the chromosome of a second (recipient) bacterial cell during mating.

\section*{Genetic variation in Bacteria}

Mechanisms: Mutation and Gene transfer
1. Mutation: It is due to a chemical alteration in DNA.

It could be spontaneous or induced by chemical and physical meanses

Mutants are variants in which one or more bases in their DNA are altered; which are heritable and irreversible

\section*{Types of mutation}
1. Substitution: Change of a single base.
2. Deletion: Los of a base.
3. Insertion: Addition of a base.

\section*{2. Gene transfer}

There are three types of gene transfer that alter the DNA gene content of bacteria.

These are:
. Transformation
. Transduction
. Conjugation
1. Transformation occurs when fragments of exogenous bacterial DNA are taken up and absorbed into recipient bacterial cells. Transformation of genes from one bacterium to another results in . Change in pathogenicity of the bacterium.

Change in antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterium.
Competence: The recipient bacterium must be competent to absorb the exogenous fragments of bacterial DNA.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-099.jpg?height=581&width=999&top_left_y=940&top_left_x=555)

Fig. 1.13 Transformation; gene transfer by the uptake \& subsequent recombination of a fragment of exogenous bacterial DNA
2. Transduction occurs when fragments of chromosomal DNA is transferred or transduced into a second bacterium by phage.

During phage replication, the bacterial DNA may be accidentally enclosed instead of the normal phage DNA, and when this particle which enclosed the bacterial DNA infects a second bacterial cell, the DNA from the first bacterium is released and incorporated into The chromosome of the second bacterium.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-101.jpg?height=1375&width=1072&top_left_y=196&top_left_x=556)

Fig. 1.14 Transduction; gene transfer from one bacterium to another via phage.
3. Conjugation occurs when plasmid DNA is transferred from donor to recipient bacterium by direct contact via a sex pilus.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-102.jpg?height=1410&width=1074&top_left_y=317&top_left_x=558)

Fig. 1.15 Conjugation; plasmid gene transfer by conjugation

\section*{4. Transposition}

Mechanism which enhances genetic flexibility among plasmids and bacterial chromosomes.

Transposons(Jumping genes) are segments of DNA that can transpose or move extremely readily, from plasmid to plasmid or from plasmid to chromosome(and viceversa).In this way, plasmid genes become part of the chromosomal component of genes.

When transposons transfer to a new site, it is usually a copy of the transposon that moves, the original transposon remaining in situ.

Transposons code for toxin production, resistance to antibiotics as wellas other fuctions.

\subsection*{1.9. STERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION}

Sterilization: Destruction of all forms of microbial life including spores.
Disinfection: Destruction of microbes that cause disease; may not be effective in killing spores.
Antisepsis: destruction or inhibition of microorganisms in living tissue there by limiting or preventing the harmful effect of infection. Sterilizing and disinfecting agents are divided into two groups.

These are:
1. Chemical methods of sterilization and disinfection
2. physical methods of sterilization and disinfection

\subsection*{1.9.1. Chemical methods of sterilization and disinfection}

These chemical agents destroy any type of microbes with out showing any form of selectivity unlike antibiotics.

The efficacy of these agents depends on the following factors.
1. Concentration of the agent

There is a relationship between the concentration of the agent and the time required to kill a given fraction of the microbial population.
2. Time of exposure

Microbes are killed with a reasonable length of time with chemical agents.
3. $p^{H}$ of the medium where action is to take place

Hydrogen ion concentration determines degree of ionization of the chemical and bacterial surface charge.
The non-ionized form passes through the bacterial cell membrane more readily than the ionized form.
4. Temperature

Bactericidal potency of the chemical agent increases with an increase in temperature.
An increase in $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ doubles the bacterial death rate.
5. Nature of the organism
. Species of the bacteria
. Growth phase of bacteria in culture
. Presence of capsule, spore and other special structures
. Number of bacteria in test system
6. Presence of extraneous materials

Organic materials like serum, blood or pus makes chemicals inert that are highly active in their absence.

\section*{Classification of chemical methods of sterilization and disinfection}
1. Chemical agents that damage the cell membrane
. Surface active agents
. Phenols
. Organic solvents
2. Chemical agents that denature proteins

\section*{Phenolic compounds}

Phenol is highly effective in Gram positive bacteria.
Clinically no more used because of its neurotoxic effect.
Currently used as a standard for measuring bactericidal potency of new chemicals i.e. phenol coefficient.

Phenol coefficient is the ratio of the concentration of the new chemical agent being tested to the concentration of the reference standard (phenol) required to kill in a specific time.

If phenol coefficient is less than one, the new chemical agent is less effective than phenol.

If phenol coefficient is equal to one, the new chemical agent is equal to phenol in efficacy.

If phenol coefficient is more than one, the new chemical agent is more effective than phenol.

Derivatives of phenol:
. Cresols e.g. Lysol, Creolin
. Halogenated diphenyl compounds eg. Hexachlorophene
It is more active on Gram-positive bacteria.
It is germicidal and anti-perspirant.

\section*{Organic solvents}

Alcohol e.g. Ethyl alcohol, Isopropyl alcohol
. Disorganize cell membrane lipid structure.
. Denatures protein.
. Active against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and acid-fast bacilli.

Uses:
1. Potent skin disinfectants
2. Disinfects clinical thermometer

NB: Ethanol is potent at concentration of $70 \%$.

\section*{Chemical agents that denature proteins}
E.g. Acids and alkalies, Quates, Alcohol
- Causes conformational alteration of proteins (unfolding of polypeptide chain) resulting in irregular looping and coiling of polypeptide chain.

Acids like benzoic acid, citric acid and acetic acid are helpful as food preservatives: extending storage life of food products.

\section*{Chemical agents that modify functional groups of proteins and nucleic acids Heavy metals}
1. Mercurials : mercuric chloride - limited use because of toxicity.

Organic mercurials - less toxic than inorganic mercuric salts.

\subsection*{1.9.2. Physical methods of sterilization and disinfection}
1. Heat: the most reliable and universally applicable method of sterilization.

Mechanism of action
Dry heat - denatures protein.
Moist heat - denatures and coagulates protein.
1.1. Dry heat: It is less efficient and requires high temperature
and long period heating than moist heat.
Dry heat can be used by the following methods:
a. Incineration: It is an efficient method of sterilization and disposal of contaminated needles, syringes and cover slips at high temperature
b. Red heat: Inoculating wires, loops and points of forceps are sterilized by holding them in the flame of a Bunsen burner until they are red hot.
c. Flaming: Scalpels and neck of flasks, bottles and tubes are exposed for a few seconds, but it is of uncertain efficacy.
d. Hot Air Sterilizer (Oven): it is essential that hot air should circulate between the objects being sterilized and these must be loosely packed and adequate air space to ensure optimum heat transfer.

It is done by applying $160^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 1 hour.
Use: Sterilizes glassware, oils, greases, lubricants and powders.
1.2. Moist heat: It is preferred to dry heat due to more rapid killing.

Moist heat can be used by the following methods.
a. Boiling: It is not reliable method of sterilization. It is done by applying $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes.

Used for sterilizing catheters, dressing and fabrics.
b. Tyndallization : Intermittent steaming (Fractional sterilization)

Steaming of the material is done at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes on three consecutive days.

The principle is that spores which survived the heating process would germinate before the next thermal exposure and then would be killed. It is used for sterilizing heat sensitive culture media containing materials such as carbohydrates, egg or serum.
c. Pasteurization: It is the process of application of heat at temperature of
$62^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes(Holder method) or $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 15 seconds (Flash method) followed by rapid cooling to discourage bacterial growth.

Uses:
. Pasteurization of milk
- Preparation of bacterial vaccines.
d. Autoclaving : Steam under pressure

It is based on the principle that when water is boiled at increased pressure, hot saturated steam will be formed which penetrates and gives up its latent heat when it condenses on cooler objects.

Hot saturated steam in autoclaving acts as an excellent agent for sterilization because of:
1. high temperature
2. High latent heat
3. ability to form water of condensation
4. contraction in volume that occurs during condensation

\section*{Method of using an autoclave}
- Add the correct volume of water to the autoclave.
- Place the bottles and tubes of culture media with caps loosened in the inner chamber of the autoclave.
- Secure the lid i.e. Open the air-outlet and close the draw-off knob.
- Adjust the safety valve to the required pressure and temperature.
- When the required pressure and temperature has been reached, begin timing.

NB: Most culture media are sterilized at a pressure of $15 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{in}^{2}$, at a temperature of $121^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 15 minutes.
- At the end of sterilizing time, turn off the heat and allow the autoclave to cool naturally.

It destroys bacterial endospores and vegetative cells.

Uses: Sterilize solid and fluid culture media, gowns, medical and surgical equipment.

Time -Temperature-Pressure level relationship in moist heat sterilization (autoclaving)
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l} 
Temperature & \multicolumn{1}{l}{ Time } & Pressure level \\
\hline $121^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & 15 minutes & $15 \mathrm{lb} /$ inch $^{2}$ \\
$126^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & 10 minutes & $20 \mathrm{lb} /$ inch $^{2}$ \\
$134^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ & 3 minutes & $30 \mathrm{lb} /$ inch $^{2}$
\end{tabular}

\section*{Methods of controlling sterilization}
1. Recording of temperature and time of each sterilizing cycle.
2. Heat-sensitive autoclave tape fixed to the outside of each pack.
. Color change of autoclave tape from blue to brown-black indicates completesterilization.
3. Biological indicator: Use of paper strips impregnated with spores of Bacillus stereothermophilus
. Put the paper strip in the culture medium after autoclaving and observe for germinating bacteria to check for growth. In complete sterilization there should not be bacterial growth.
e. Freezing: Inactivation of living bacteria by cold.

It prevents active multiplication of bacteria by decreasing the metabolic activity of bacteria.

Lyophilization : Freeze-drying : Involves rapid freezing with subsequent drying.
Use:
. Preservation of microbial cultures.
. Preservation of vaccines.
f. Filtration : Mechanical sieving through membrane filters.

Uses:
. Sterilization of thermolabile parental and ophthalmic solutions, sera and plasma.

Microbial evaluation of water purity.
Viable counting procedures.
Determination of viral particle size
g. Radiation : loning and ultra violet radiation
loning radiation includes $\chi$ ray, $\gamma$ ray and $\beta$ ray.
These induce break down of single stranded or sometimes double stranded DNA.

Ultra violet radiation has less quantum energy with low penetrating power than ionic radiation.
Spore forming bacteria are more resistant to ionic and ultra violet radiation than vegetative bacteria because of:
1. The spore coat confers protection.
2. DNA is in different state in spores.

Use: Sterilize surgical sutures, catheters, petridishes, culture media while dispensing and pharmaceutical products like hormones, enzymes and antibiotics.

It also sterilize biological safety cabinet (Laboratory rooms).

\subsection*{1.9.3. Anti-Microbial agents and Sensitivity Testing}

Anti- Microbial drugs
Anti-microbial drugs include
.Antibiotics
Chemical anti-microbials

Antibiotics:
Definition: Antimicrobial substances produced by living microorganisms.

Chemical anti-microbials
Definition: synthetically produced anti-micorbial compounds.
Anti-microbial drugs show specific toxicity to microbial cells due to differences in cell envelope, protein and enzymes to host cells.

\section*{Mechanism of action of anti-microbial drugs}
1. Those inhibiting cell wall synthesis, leading to cell lyses.
- penicillin
- cephalosporin
- vancomycin
2. Those damaging cell membrane leading to loss of cell contents and then cell death.
- polymyxin
- Amphotericin B
3. Those inhibiting protein synthesis and then arresting bacterial growth
- aminoglycosides
- tetracycline
- erythromycin
- chloramphenicol
- clindamycin
4. Those inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-116.jpg?height=313&width=982&top_left_y=895&top_left_x=574)
5. Those inhibiting nucleotide synthesis
sulfonamide
- trimethoprim
$\left.{ }^{6} 110141\right] 3$

\section*{Resistance of bacteria to anti-microbial drugs}

Production of enzymes that destroy or inactivate anti-microbials Eg. B.lactamase destroying B-lactam ring of penicillin
1. Altering permeability of bacterial cell membrane Eg. resistance to polymixin and tetracycline
2. Developing an altered structural target for the drug Eg. resistance to aminoglycosides and erythromycin
3. Developing an altered metabolic pathway that bypasses the reaction inhibited by the drugs Eg. resistance to sulfonamides
4. Developing an altered enzyme that can still perform its metabolic function but is much less affected by the drug Eg. resistance to trimethoprim

\section*{Dangers of indiscriminate use of antimicorbial drugs}
1. Wide spread sensitization resulting in hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reaction, and drug rashes.
2. Changing normal microbial flora leading to "super infection" due to over growth of drug-resistant micro-organism.
3. Direct drug toxicity

Eg. renal and auditory nerve damage due to aminoglylosides toxicity.
4. Masking serious infection with out eradicating it.
5. Development of drug resistance by micro-organisms.

\section*{Anti-microbial sensitivity testing}

> Anti-microbine activity is measured in vitro in order to determine:
> - $\quad$ the potency of an anti-microbial agent
> - concentration of anti-microbial agent in body tissues or fluids
> - the sensitivity of a given micro-organism to known concentrations of the drug

> Measurement of anti-microbial activity
> Techniques
> a diffusion technique
> a dilution technique

> Diffusion Sensitivity Tests
> It is the routinely used sensitivity test by most microbiology laboratories.

> A filter paper disk containing measured quantities of drug is placed on a solid medium that has been seeded with the test organisms. The drug diffuses from the disk into the medium. Following over right incubation, the diameter of the clear zone of inhibition surrounding the deposit of drug is taken as a measure of the inhibitory power of the drug against the particular test organism.

> Bacterial strains sensitive to the drug are inhibited at a distance from the disk whereas resistant strains grow up to the edge of the disk.

In the kirby-Bauer technique, the zone of inhibition is measured and compared to a prepared scale, which correlates the zone of inhibition size with the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC).

NB: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that is required to inhibit in vitro bacterial multiplication under specified conditions.

Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the least concentration of the anti-microbial required producing a sterile culture.

\section*{Dilution Sensitivity Tests}

Agar dilution tests
Broth dilution tests

Graded amounts of antimcorbial agents are incorporated into liquid or solid bacteriology media. The media are subsequently inoculated with test bacteria and incubated.

The end point is taken as that amount of antimicobial agent required to inhibit the growth of the test bacteria (MIC) or to kill the test bacteria (MBC).
Nowadays the above tests are either time consuming or cumbersome, so the advent of microdilution both solution tests has simplified the method and permit a quantitative result to be reported, indicating the amount of a given drug necessary to inhibit or kill the test micro-organism.

\section*{Factors affecting anti-microbial activity in vitro}
1. $P^{H}$ of the environment
- some drugs more active at acidic or alkaline $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{H}}$
2. Components of medium
- media composition components enhance or inhibit bacterial growth
3. Stability of drug
4. Size of inoculum: the larger the bacterial inoculum, the lower the apparent sensitivity of the organisms.
5. Length of incubation: short exposure of moisture to the drug inhibits their growth but does not kill them; longer exposure of moisture to a drug gives a chance for resistant motants to emerge.
6. Metabolic activity of moistures actively and rapidly growing micro-organisms are more susceptible to drug action than those in the resting phase.

Techniques of routinely used antimicrobial sensitivity testing (disc diffusion tests)

Required:
- sensitivity testing media
- $\quad$ Anti-microbial discs
- $\quad$ Control strains
- Turbidity standard

Sensitivity testing media: The commonly used media is MuellerHinton agar.

For pathogens requiring enriched media like Neisseria gonorrhea, Heamophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, it is necessary to add blood to (heat it if needed) sensitivity testing agar.

Turbidity (Opacity) standard: This is a barium chloride standard against which the turbidity of the test inocula can be compared. The turbidity of the standard is equivalent to the turbidity of subcultured broth test micro-organism.

Method
Emulsify several colonies of similar appearance of the test organism in a small volume of sterile nutrient both. Match the turbidity of the subculture against the turbidity standard.

Apply a loopful of the test organism subculture to the sensitivity testing plate using a sterile loop.

Spread the inoculum evenly across the plate using a sterile dry cotton wool swab.

Allow the inocula to dry for a few minutes with the petridish lid in place.
- $\quad$ Place the anti microbial discs into the test organism in petridish using a sterile forceps or dispenser.

NB: each disc should be pressed down on the medium and should not be moved once in place.
- Incubate the plate aerobically at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ over night after 30 minutes of applying the discs.
- Read the tests and interpret as 'sensitive (S)', " resistant $(\mathrm{R})$ "or " intermediate (I)" comparing the chart of the sensitivity test.

\section*{CHAPTER TWO}

\section*{COLLECTION, TRANSPORT AND EXAMINATION OF SPECIMEN}
- If pathogens are to be isolated successfully, the type of specimen, its collection, time and method of its dispatch to the laboratorty must be correct.
- Adequate information about the patient's_condition and antimicrobial treatment must also be sent in the Specimen.

\section*{Type of specimen}

The correct type of specimen to be collected will depend on the pathogens to be isolated.

For example: a cervical not a vaginal swab is required for the most successful isolation of N.gonorrhoeae from a woman.
:sputum not a saliva is essential for the isolation of respiratory pathogens.

\section*{Time of collection}
* Specimens such as urine and sputum are best collected soon after a patient wakes when organisms have had the opportunity to multiply over several hours.
\$ Blood for culture is usually best collected when a patient's temperature begins to rise.
$\star$ The time of collection for most other speciemens will depend on the condition of the patient, and the time agreed between medical, nursing and laboratory personnel for the delivery of the specimen to the laboratory.
* Every effort must be made to collect specimens for microbiological investigation before antimicrobial treatment is started.

\section*{Collection techniques}
- The laboratory should issue written instruction to all those responsible for collecting specimens including staff of wards, out patient clinics and health centres.

Precaution apply to the collection of most microbiological specimens:
1) Use a collection technicnque that will ensure a specimencontains only those organisms from the site where it was collected.
- If contaminating organisms are introduced in to a specimen during its collection or subsequent handling, this may lead to difficulties in the interpretation of cultures and delays in the issuing reports.
- A strictly sterile (aseptic) procedure is essential when collecting from site that are normally sterile.

Example: collection of blood, CSF or effusions
This teachings is necessary not only to prevent contamination of the specimen but also protect the patient.
2) Avoid contaminating discharges or ulcer material with the skin commensals. The swabs used to collect the specimens must be sterile and the absorbent cotton wool from which the swabs are made must be free from antibacterial substances.
3) Collect specimens in sterile, leak- proof, dry containers, free from all traces of disinfectant.

Container must be clean but need not be sterile for the collection of feaces and sputum.
4) Those responsible for collecting specimens should report any abnormal features, such as coldiness in a specimen which should appear clear, abnormal coloration or presence of pus, blood, mucus or parasites.

Labelling of specimens and sending of a request form

Each specimen must be accompanied by a request form which gives:
- The patient's name, age (whether an infant, child or adult), number, and ward or health center.
- Type of specimen and the date and time of it collection.
- Investigation required
- Clinical note giving details of the patient's illness, suspected disease, and any antimicrobial treatment that may have been started at home or in the hospital.

\section*{Specimen containing dangerous pathogen}
* Those delivering, receiving and examining specimens must be informed if a specimen is likely to contain highly infection organisms. Such specimen should be labelled HIGH RISK, and whenever possible carry a warning symbols such as red dot, star or triangle
* Specimen which should be marked as HIGH RISK include:
- Sputum likely to contain M. tuberculosis
- Faecal specimen that may contain V. cholerae Preservatives and transport media for microbiological specimen
* In general, specimens for microbiological investigations should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible. This will help to ensure that pathogens are living when they reach the labratory.
* When a delay in delivery is unavoidable, For example, when transporting a specimen from health center to a hospital laboratory, a suitable chemical preservative or transport culture medium must be used.
* This will help to prevent organisms from dying due to enzyme action, change of pH, or lack of essential nutrients. Example. Amies transport medium widely used and effective in ensuring the survival of pathogens like the more delicate organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

Cary - Blair medium in used as transport medium for faeces that may contain Salmonella, shigella, campylobacter or vibro species.

Example of Preservatives include boric acid added to urine and cetylpyridinium- chloride sodium chloride (CPC-Nacl) added to sputum for the isolation of M.tuberculosis.

Transport of microbiological specimens collected in a hospital
Specimen should reach to the laboratory as soon as possible or a suitable preservative or transport medium must be used.
Refrigeration at $4-10{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ can help to preserve cells and reduce the multiplication of commensals in unpreserved specimens.
- However, specimens for isolation of Haemophilus, S. pneumoniae or Neisseria species, must never be refrigerated because cold kills these pathogens.

If specimen are to be mailed, the regulations regarding the sending of "pathological specimens" through the post should be obtained from the post office and followed exactly. When dispatching microbilogical speciemens:
1) Keep a register of all specimens dispatched.

Record Name
Number
Ward or health centre of the patient.
Type of specimen
Investigation required
Date of dispatch
Method of sending the specimen (eg. Mailing, hand-delivery etc.)
2) Ensure that the specimen container is free from cracks, and the cap is leak proof. Seal round the container cap with adhesive tape to prevent loosening and leakage during transit.
3) If the container is glass tube or bottle, use sufficient packaging material to prefect a specimen.

If the specimen is fluid, use sufficient absorbent materiel to absorb it.
4) Mark all specimen that may contain highly infectious organism "HIGH RISK"
5) Dispatch slides in a plastic slide continer or use slide carrying box.
6) Label speciments dispetched by mail, "FRAGILE WITH CARE- PATHOLOGICAL SPECIMGN".

\section*{In a hospital with a microbiology Laboratory.}
1. Give the patient a clean (need not be sterile), dry, widenecked, leak- proof container and request him or her to cough deeply to produce a sputum specimen

Note: The specimen must be sputum, not saliva.
Sputum is best collected in the morning, soon after the patent wakes and before any mouth-wash is used.

If the patient is young child and it is not possible to obtain sputum, gastric washings can be used for the isolation of M.tuberculosis but not for other respiratory
2. Label the container and fill the request form.
3. If pneumonia or bronchopneumonia is suspected, deliver the sputum to the laboratory with as little delay as possible.

Because organisms such as S.pneumoniae and H. influenza require culturing as soon as possible.
- If the specimen is for the isolation of M.tuberculosis, ensure it is delivered to the laboratory within 2 hours or kept at $4{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until delivery is possible.
- If pneumonia plague is suspected: Deliver the sputum to the laboratory as soon as possible. Make sure that the specimen is marked HIGH RISK.

\section*{For dispatching to a microbiology laboratory}

Collect the sputum in a container as usual.
Depending on whether the sputum is for the isolation of pneumonia and bronchopneumonia or M.tuberculosis, proceed as follows:

Pneumonia and Bronchopneumonia pathogen
* Collect a purulent part of the sputum on a cotton wool swab, and insert in a container of Amies transport medium. Label the container using a lead pencil
* Amies will help the pathogens to survive and from being overgrown by fast-multiplying commensas.
* Make a smear on slides for gram staining and fix using heat or alcohol and send the swab and the request form to reach to the laboratory.

\section*{M.tuberculosis}

Make a smear of the sputum on slides for ZielNeelsen staining, from the most pumlent materials.
- Fix with alcohol.

\section*{If pneumonia plague is suspected:}
- Send the swab of the sputum in cary-Blair transport medium to reach the microbiology laboratory.

Caution: Y. pestis is highly infectious organism.
1. Describe the appearance of the specimens
- Purulent: Green- looking with pus and mucus.
- Mucopurulent: Green- looking with pus and Mucus
- Mucoid: Mostly mucous
- Mucosalivary: Mucus with a small amount of saliva
- Bloody: should be reported.
2. Examine the specimen microscopically.

\section*{Gram smear}

Look for pus cells and bacteria
- Gram positiveve diplococci that could be S. pneumoniae
- Gram positive cocci that could be $S$. aureus
- Gram negative rods that could be H. influenzae
- Gram negative capsulated rods that could be K. pneumoniae.

\section*{Additional investigation}

Look for:
- saline preparation, if paragonimiasis is suspected
- Eosin paration, if asthma or other allergic condition is suspected.
- Potassium hydroxide (KoH) preparation, if fungal infection is suspected (yeast cells, Nocardia species, actinomycetes).
- Giemsa smear, if histoplasmosis or pneumonic plague is suspected.

\section*{3) Culture the specimen}

To obtain as pure a culture as possible of a respiratory pathogen it is necessary to reduce the number of commensals inoculated.

Ways of reducig commensal numbers include washing the sputum free from saliva or liquefying and diluting it.

\section*{Blood agar and chocolate agar}

Wash a purulent part of the sputum in about sml of sterile physiological saline.
- Inoculate the washed sputum on plates of blood agar and chocolate (heated blood) agar.

Add an optochin disc to the chocolate agar plate. This will help to identity S. pneumonia.

Incubate the blood agar plate aerobically and the chocolate agar in a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enriched atmosphere at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for upto 48 hours, examining for growth atfter ovemight incubation.

Additional:
Lowenstein Jensen medium, if pulmonary tubercles is suspected.
- About 20 minuets before culturing, decontaminate the specimen by mixing equal volumes of sputum and
sodium hydroxide (NaoH) $40 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ or ( $4 \% \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{v}$ ) solution. Shake at intervals to homogenize the sputum.
- Using a sterile pasteur pepitte, inoculate $200 \mathrm{Nl}(0.2 \mathrm{ml})$ of the well-mixed homogenized sputum on a slope of acid Lowenstein Jensen medium. Allow the specimen to run down the slope.
- Incubate at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{c}-37^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ in a rack placed at an agle of about $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to ensure that the specimen is incontact with the full length of the slops.

After one week, place the slope in an upright position and continue to incubate, examining twice a week for groth.
4. Examine and report the culture

Examine the blood agar \& Chocolate agar culture for:
S. pneumonia
S. aureus
H. influezae
K. pneumoniae

\section*{Collection and Transport of Throat and Mouth swabs}
- Whenever possible it should be collected by a medical officer or experienced nurse.

\section*{In a hospital with a microbiology laboratory}
1. In a good light and using the handle of a spoon to depress the tongue, examine the inside of the month.

Look for inflammation, and the presence of any membrane, exudate or pus.
- With diphtheria - a greyish- yellow membrane (later becoming grayish Green-black and smelly) can often seen over the soft palate and backwards on to the phargedl wall. With streptococcal sore throat, the tonsil are inflammed and often coverd in a yellow spots.

With infectious mononucleosis, the tonsils may be covered with a white exudate
- With C. albicans infection, patches of white exudate may be seen attached in places to the mucosal membrane of the month.
2. Swab the affected area using a sterile cotton. Taking care not to contaminate the swab with saliva, return it to its sterile container.
- Before swabbing the patient must not treated with antiboitics or antiseptic month-washesr (gargles) for 8 hours.
- For children, swabbing may causes obstruction child's airway instead blood for culture should be collected.
3. Within 2 hours of collection, deliver the swab with a request form to the laboratory

\section*{Dispatching to the microbiology laboratory}
1. Using a sterile swab or silica gel collect a specimen from the infected area.
2. Taking care not to contaminate the swab, return it to its tube.

Seal with adhesive tape and label using a lead pencil.
3. Send the swab with its request form to reach the microbiology laboratory within three days.

Laboratory Examination of throat and month swabs

\section*{1. culture the specimen}

\section*{Blood agar}
- Inoculate the swab on a plate of blood agar.
- If the swab is received in silica gel ( eg. from health centre), moisten it first with sterile nutrient broth and then inoculate the plate.
- Add a bacitracin disc. This will help in the identification of S. pyogenen.
- Incubate the plate preferably anaerobically or in a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enriched atmosphere overnight at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Beta-haemolytic streptococci produce larger Zones of haemolysis when incubated anaerobically.
- A minority of Group A streptococcus strains will only grow if incubated anaerobically.

\section*{Additional}

\section*{Modified Tinsdale medium and tellurite blood agar if diphtheria is suspected.}
- If in an area where diphtheria occurs or the disease is suspected, inoculate the swab on modified Tinsdale medium and tellurite blood agar.

Incubate the plates aerobically at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{c}$ for up to 48 hours, examing for growth after overnight incubation.

Sabouraud agar if thrush is suspected
- Inoculate the swab on sabourad agar
- Incubate at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 48 hours checking for growth after overnight incubation

\section*{2. Examine the specimen microscopically}

\section*{Gram smear}

Examine the smear for pus cells and Vincent's organisms:
- Vincent's organism are seen as Gram negative spirochaetes (B. vincenti)

And fusiform rods, (L. buccalis).
- If thrush is suspected, look for Gram positivee yeast-like cells.
- If diphtheria is suspected, look for Gram positive pleomorphic rods
- Commensal diphtheroids, however, are strongly Gram positive and Unlike
C.diphtheriae, they show little variation in size or shape.

\section*{Additional}

\section*{Albert stained smear}

Examine the smear for bacteria that that could be C . diphtheriae:
- Most strains of C. diphtheriae contain dark-staining volutin gtanules.
- The pleomorphic rods tend to join together at angles giving the appearance of Chinese letters.

\section*{3. Examine and report the cultures.}

\section*{Blood agarculture}
- look for beta-haemolytic colonies that could be group Astreptococcu(S. pyogenes)
or a beta-haemolytic streptococcus belonging to another lancefield group such as group $C$ or $G$.
- Most group A strains show sensitivity to bacitacin.

\section*{Reporting of the throat swab cultures:}
- If a B-haemolytic streptococcus sensitive to bacitracin is isolated, report the culture as "S. pyogenes presumptive group A isolated, Lancefield group to be confirmed.
- If a B-haemolytic streptococcus that is not sensitive to bacitracin is isolated (confirm that the colonies are streptococci), report the culture as "Beta-haemolytic streptococcus isolated, lancfield group to follow".

3. Label, and deliver immediately to the laboratory
B. pertusis does not survive well on a swab
-It must be cultured as soon as possible.
-If plating cannot be performed at the bedside, the swab should be placed in special transport medium
-If it is not possible to collect a per nasal swab, a less satisfactory way of isolating B. pertussis is to hold the plate of culture medium in front of the child's month during a coughing attack.

\section*{Anterior nasal swabs to detect carriers:}
1. Using a steile cotton wool swab moistened with sterile peptone water, gently swab the inside surface of the nose.
2. Taking care not to contaminate the swab, replace it in its sterile container.

\section*{Collection and transport of urogenital specimen}
- Amies medium is the most efficient medium for transporting urethral, cervical and vaginal swabs.

\section*{Specimen required for diagnosis of gonorrhoea}

Male patients:
. Smears of urethral discharge
. Rectal swab from homosexual patient
Female patients
. Smears of mucopus from the cervix and urethra
Note: N. gonorrhoeae infects the mucaus membranes of the cervix, not the vagina.

The pathogen is, therefore, more likely to be isolated from a cervical swab than from a vaginal swab.

\section*{Collection of Urethral specimens}
1. cleans the urethral opening using a swab moistened with sterile physiological saline.
2. Gently massage the urethra from above downwards, and collect a sample of pus on a sterile cotton wool swab.
- The patient should not have passed urine preferably for 2 hours before the specimen is collected.

Parasites: Trypanosoma species
Naegleria fowleri
Acanthamoeba species and rarely the larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis and Dirofilaira immitis

Note:
1. Inflammation of the meninges (membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord) is called meningitis.

Pathogens reach the meninges in the blood stream or occasionally by spreading from nearby sites such as the middle ear or nasal sinuses.

Meningitis is described as:
- Pyogenic (purulent), when the C.S.f contains mainly poly morphonuclear neutrophils (pus cell), as in acute meningitis caused by $N$. meningitides, H. influenzae and S. pneumonae.
- Pus cells are also found in the C.S.f in acute amoebic meningoencephalitis.
- Lymphocytic, when the C.S.f contains mainly lymphocytes, as in meningitis caused by viruses, M. tuberculosis and C. neoformans.
- Lymphocytes are also found in the C.S.f in trypanosomlasis meningoencephalitis and neurosyphilis.
- Eosinophilic, when the CSf contain mainly eosinophilus. This rare form of meningitis is caused by helminthes larvae such as Angiostrongylus cantonensis and Dirofilaria imitis
- Meningitis of the newborn (neonatal meningitis) is caused mainly by E.coli, S. agalactiae (Group B), S. avreus, L. Monocytogenes.
- Haemophilus meningitis occurs mainly in infants and young children.

\section*{Commensals}

No normal microbial flora

\section*{Collection of Csf}
- It should be collected by medical officer in aspectic procedure
- The fluid is usually collected from the arachnoid space. A sterile wide-bore needle is inserted between the $4^{\text {th }}$ and $5^{\text {th }}$ lumbar vertebrate and
C.s.f. is allowed to drip into a dry sterile container.
- A delay in examining C.S.f reduces the chances of isolating a pathogen.
- It will also lead to a falsely low glucose value due to glycolysis. If typanosomes are present, they will not be found because they are rapidly lyzed once the C.S.f has been withdrawn.
1) Take two sterile, dry, screw-cap containers and label one No 1 (first sample collected, to be used for culture), and the other No 2 (second sample collected, to be used for other investigations).
2) Collect about 1 ml of C.S.f in container No 1 and about $2-3 \mathrm{ml}$ in container No2
3) Deliver immediately the samples with a request form to the laboratory.

Note: It is necessary to culture the C.S.f in the health center because pathogens such as N.meningitidis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, are unlikely to survive transport to the bacteriology laboratory.
- If unable to perform a cell count and estimate the protein and glucose, transfer C.S.f sample â 2 to a screw-cap bottle containing sodium fluoride exalate and mix This will preserve the cells and prevent the breakdown of glucose. Protein can also be estimated from a floride oxalated specimen.

\section*{Laboratory examination of C.S.f}
- It should be performed without delay and should be reported micro-organism especially Gram smear. The fluid should be handled with special care because it is collected by lumbar puncture and only a small amount can be withdrawn.

\section*{Two samples of C.S.f}
- It is usual to use sample No 1 for the culture, and sample No 2 for the cell caunt, microscopy and biochemistry.

This is because sample No 1 may contain blood (due to a traumatic lumbar puncture) which will affect the accuracy of the cell count and biochemical estimations.

\section*{I. Describe the appearance of the specimens}

\section*{Report:}
- Whether the C.S.f is clear, slightly cloudy, cloudy or definitely purulent (looking like pus).
- If the C.S.f is purulent or markedly cloudy, make immediately a smear for gram staining, and report it as soon as possible.
- Whether it contain blood and if so whether sample No 2 contains as much blood as sample no 1.

If blood is present in the C.S.f due to a traumatic lumbar puncture, sample No 1 will usually contain more blood than sample No 2.
If the blood is due to haemorrahage in the CNS, the two samples will probably appear equally blood-stained.

Following a subarachnoid haemorrhoge the fluid may appear xanthochromic, ie. Yellow-red (after centrifuting)
The fluid may also appear xanthromic if the patient is jaundiced or when there is spinal constriction.

\section*{Whether it contains clots}
- Clotted C.S.f indicate an increase in fibrinogen.
- It occurs when there is spinal construction
- Clots can also be found in C.S.f. from patients
with pyogenic meningitis (sterile beads to break the clot)
- In tuberculosis meningitis, if the C.S.f is allowed to stand for several hours; skin (spider web clot) may form on the surface of the fluid.

This should be transferred to a slide, pressed out, alcoholfixed, and stained by the Ziel-Neelsen method I.

\section*{2. Perform a cell count (1:2) value $5 \times 10^{6}$ cell/l (sample No 2)}

\section*{3. Test the specimen biochemically}
- Glucose estimation $1 / 2$ - $2 / 3$ of that found in blood, i.e $2.5-4.0 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}(45-72 \mathrm{mg} \%)$
- Low Glucos $\rightarrow$ pyogenic meningitidis
-Normal $\rightarrow$ viral miningitis.
-High glucose $\rightarrow$ hyperglycemia
- Total protein estimation and globulin test

Value: $0.15-0.40 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}(15-40 \mathrm{mg} \%)$
- A positive pandy's test for increase in total C.S.f protein in all form of meningitis.
- When the total protein exceeds 2.8/l ( $200 \mathrm{mg} \%$ ), the fibrinogen level in usually increased sufficiently to cause the C.S.f to clot. (sever pyogenic meningitis)
4. Culture the specimen (sample No 1)

It is necessary, if the fluid contains cells and, or, the protein concentration is abnormal.

Note: C.S.f should be cultured as soon as possible after collection.

If a delay is unavoidable, the fluid should be kept at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (never refrigerated).

If the C.S.f appears only slightly cloudy, centrifuge it in a sterile tube for $15-20$ minute and use the sediment for inoculating the plates.

\section*{5. Microscopy}

The microscopical examination of C.S.f is required if the specimen appears abnormal, contains cells and, or, the total protein is raised with a positive pandy's test.

Routine:
Gram smear
- Gram negative intracellular diplococci that could be N. meningitidis.
- Gram positive diplococci or short streptococci that could be $S$. pneumoniae. It is often possible to see the capsules as unstained are as around the bacteria.
- Garm negative rods, possibly H. influezae
- Gram negative rods, could also be E.coli or other coliforms, especially if the C.S.f is from a newborn infant.
- Gram positive cocci in groups and singly, possible S.aureus.
- Gram positive streptococci, possibly S. agalacteae (G-.B)
- Gram positive yeast cells, C. neoformans.

\section*{Note:}
1. The presence of bacteria in the blood is called bacteraemia. The term septicaemia refers to a severe and often fatal infection of the blood in which bacteria multiply and release toxins in to the blood stream.
2. Bacteria that are associated with neonatal septicaemia include E.coli and other coliforms, spaphylococci and B.haemolytic Group B streptococci.
3. In typhoid, salmonella typhi can be detected in the blood of $75-90 \%$ of patients during the first 10 days of infection and in about $30 \%$ of patients during the third week.

In chronic salmonellosis, bacteria are often more rapidly and successfully isolated from bone marrow, especially once antimicrobial treatment has been started.
4. Y. pestis can be isolated from the blood in septicaemia plague. The organism in highly infectious.

\section*{Commensal}

Neither blood nor bone has a normal microbial flora.

\section*{Collection and culture of Blood and Borne marrow}
$\checkmark$ Blood and bone marrow require culturing immediately after collection, before clotting occurs.

Choice of culture media
$\checkmark$ Because septicaemia is such a serious condition, it is essential to use media that will provide the fastest growth and isolation of as wide a range of pathogens as possible.
$\checkmark$ The following media are suitable for routine culture of blood and bone marrow:
- Tryptone soya (tryptic soy) diphasic medium
- Thioglycollate broth medium

\section*{Tryptone soya (tryptic soy) diphasic medium}
- A diphasic (two phase) medium is one that combines an agar slope with a broth medium.

Because the bacteria can be seen growing on the slope, the need to subculture on a solid medium every few days is avoided, thus reducing the risk of contamination.
- Tryptone soya diphasic medium consists of a tryptone soya agar slope and a tryptone soya broth to which is added Liquoid and P-aminobenzoic acid.

Liquoid: It is the commercial name for sodium polyanethol sulphonate. It prevents clotting of the blood and neutralize the natural bactericidal substances in fresh blood.
P. Aminobenzoic acid: This neutralizes the action of sulphonamides should these be present in the blood.
- Tryptone soya diphasic medium is suitable for the growth of a wide range of pathogens.

Incubation in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is required for the culture of brucella species. Strict anaerobes will not grow in this medium.

\section*{Thioglycollate broth}
- This consists of a nutrient broth to which is added thiogiycollate to provide the condition necessary for the growth of anaerobes. Most aerobic bacteria will also grow in thioglycollates broth.
- Because liqoid is not added to this medium, a sufficient volume of broth must be used to prevent the blood from clotting and to dilute out the blood's natural bactericidal substances.

The blood should be diluted at least 1 in 10 in the broth.

Examination of Blood and Bone marrow
1. Collect and culture the specimen

\section*{Blood}
- It should be collected before antimicrobial treatement has been started and at the time the patient's temperature is beginning to rise.
- To increase the chance of isolating a pathogen, it is usually recommended that at least two specimens (collected at different times) should be cultured.
- Blood for culture must be collected as aseptically as possible.
2. Insert the needle through the rubber line of the bottle cap and dispense 5 ml of blood into each culture bottle.
3. Gently mix the blood with the bruch.
- The blood must not be allowed to clot in the culture media because any bacteria will become trapped in the Culture medium.

Incubate the inoculated media:

\section*{Thioglycollate broth}

At $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 2 weeks, examining and sub-culturing
- Look for visible signs of bacterial growth such as turbidity above the red cell layer, colonies growing on top of the red cells ("cotton balls"), haemolysis, gas bubbles and clots.
- A sterile culture usually remains clear
- If there are signs of bacterial growth, subculture the broth and examine a gram stained smear for bacteria

\section*{Tryptone soya diphasic medium}

At $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 4 weeks.
- Look for colonies on the agar slope (preferably using a hand lense), and signs of bacterial growth in the broth.
- Colonies of staphycococ, s .typhi, brucellosis and most coliforms can usually be seen easily. Where as colonies of pneumococci, S. pyogens, and Y.pestis are not easily seen.
- If growth is present subculture to blood agar plate, Chocolate agar plate, MacConkey

Collection, transport and examination of effusions (synovial, pleural, pericardial, ascitie and hydroceles fluids)
- An effusion is fluid which collects in a body cavities

Fluid which collects due to an inflammatory process is referred to as an exudates and that which forms due to a non-inflammatory condition is referred to as a transudates.
- If the effusion is all exudates, it is important to investigate whether the inflammatory process is all infective one.
Effusions sent to the laboratory for vestigation include:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline Fluid & Origin \\
\hline Synovial & From joint \\
\hline Pleural & From the pleural cavity (space between the lungs and the inner chest wall) \\
\hline Pericardial & From the pericardial sac (membranous sac surrounding the health) \\
\hline Ascitic (peritoneae) & From the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity \\
\hline Hydrocele & Usually from the sacs surrounding the tests. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
1. Synovitis means inflammation of the synovial membrane (living of a joint capsule). It can be caused by bacteria,rheumatic disorder or injury.
2. Inflammation of a joint is called arthritis.

The term polyarthritis is used when many joints are affected.
Arthritis may be caused by bacteria (infective arthritis), rheumatoid arthritis, gout and pseudogout, osteoatrhtitus
3. The term pleural effusion is used to describe a non-purulent serous effusion which sometimes forms in pneumonia, tuberculosis, malignante disease etc

Empyema is used to describe a purulent pleural effusion when pus is found in the pleural space.
4. Peritonitis means inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the serous membrane that lines the peritoneal cavity. Ascites refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pentional cary causing abdominal swelling.

\section*{Commensales}

No microbial flora
Collection is carried out by a medical officer
$-2-3 \mathrm{ml}$ without anticogulent, to see whether clotting occurs.

Classification of streptococci: Based on
1. Colony morphology and hemolytic reaction on blood agar
2. Serologic specificity of the cell wall group specific substance and other cellwall capsular antigens
3. Biochemical reactions and resistnace to physical and chemical factors
4. Ecologic features

Lancefield grouping of streptococci:
Streptococci produce group specific carbohydrates(C carbohydrates) identified using group specific antiserum.

It is designated $\mathrm{A}-\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{K}-\mathrm{V}$.
The clinically important streptococci are grouped under A,B,C,D,F and G .

The main species and groups of medical importance
S. pyogenes......... Lancefield group A
S. agalactiae........ Lancefield group B

Enterococci.........Lancefield group D

NB: Viridans streptococci and anaerobic streptococci are not grouped under Lancefield Classification.

Antigenic structure:
1. Group-specific cell wall antigen

Streptococcal cell wall obtained carbohydrate is the basis for serologic grouping of streptococci (Lancefield groups A-H, K-U)
2. M protein

They are found in hair-like projections of the streptococcal surfaceand determine virulence

Major virulent factor for group A streptococci.
There are two major structural classes of M protein(class I
\&class II) and
More than eighty serotypesof $M$ protein of group $A$ streptococci

The class I M protein may be a virulence determinant for rheumatic fever

Conserved antigenic domains on the class I M protein induce antibodies that cross react with cardiac muscle tissue
3. T substance: Acid and heat labile unlike M protein, and has no relation to virulence of streptococci.
4. R protein

Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A $\beta$-hemolytic streptococci)
The most pathogenic member of the genus
It is present as a commensal in the nasopharynx in a variable proportion of healthy individuals.

These are:
1. Streptokinase: Fibrinolysin.

It is an active proteolytic enzyme which lyses fibrin by catalytic conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.

Has been given intravenously for the the treatment of pulmonary edema and of arterial and venous thrombosis
2. Streptodornase: Streptococcal deoxyribonuclease

Mixtures of streptokinase and streptodornase are used in "enzymatic debridement"
3. NADase: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotidase
4. Hyaluronidase: Spreading factor

It degrades the ground substance of connective tissue (hyaluronic acid) and aids in spreading infectious microorganoism
5. Hemolysins: Two types

Streptolysin O and Streptolysin S
Antistreptolysin O antibody titer $>1: 200$ todd: Supportive evidence for Acute reheumatic fever

Possess irregular swelling at one end that give them the "clubshaped" appearance

Possess granules (metachromatic granules) near the poles that give the rod a beaded appearance

It tends to lie in parallel (pallisades) or at acute angles to one another in stained smears, forming V,L , W shapes, so called Chinese-character arrangement

It has four four biotypes named as gravis, mitis, intermedius and balfanti based on growth characteristics and severity of disease produced

Pathogenesis and clinical features:
Found in nature in the respiratory tract, in wounds, or on the skin of infected person or normal carriers

Spread by droplets or by direct contact
The organism colonize the mucus membrane or skin abrasions and toxigenic C.diphteriae start producing exotoxin, possessing two components, fragment A and B . Fragment B transpots fragment A into the cell and fragment A inhibit polypeptide chain elongation by inactivating the elongation factor EF-2, required for translocation of polypeptidyl-tRNA from the acceptor to the donor site on the eukaryotic ribosome, leading to abrupt arrest of protein synthesis and result in cell necrosis and neurotoxic effect.

Diphteria toxin causes respiratory tract epithelial destruction tesulting in formation of necrotic epithelium with pseudomembrane formation over the tonsils, pharynx, and larynx. Distant toxic damage includes parenchymal degeneration and necrosis in heart muscle, liver, kidney, adrenal glands and peripheral and cranial nerves.

Wound/skin diphteria occurs chiefly in the tropics and forms membrane-covered wound that fails to heal. Systemic effect is negligible.

It clinically manifests with fever, sorethroat, suffocation (due to obstruction by upper respiratory tract pseudomembrane formation), arrhythemia, and difficulty of vision, swallowing and paralysis of upper and lower extremities.

NB: C.diphteriae var gravis tends to produce more severe disease than var mitis.

1. Guinea pig inoculation: Inject suspension of the isolated strain of C.diphteriae into two guinea pig, one protected with diphteriaantitoxin.

Death in 2-3 days of the unprotected animal
2. Gel-precipitation (Elek) test: a filter paper strip previously immersed in diphteria antitoxin is incorporated into serum agar; the strain of C.diphteriae under investigation is then streaked onto the agar at right angles to the filter paper strip. Incubate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for $1-2$ days, and observe for lines of precipitation in the agar indicating toxin-antitoxin interaction.

Schick test: a skin test to demonstrate immunitydue to immunization or natural infection

Method: Intradermal injection of toxin into the anterior aspect of one forearm and heat-inactivated toxin into the other.

Objective: to detect susceptibility and hypersensitivity to diphteia toxin

Interpretation: Observe for erythema at the injection site at 36 hrs and 120 hrs . Reactions due to the toxin are slower and longer lasting than those resulting from hypersensitivity.

\subsection*{4.1. HOST-PARASITE RELATIONSHIP}

Definition: It is a beneficial or harmful relationship between the host and the parasite.

On the basis of their life habits, microorganism is classified as saprophytes or parasites.

Saprophytes : Mode of life of free-living organisms which obtain their nourishment from soil and water. Saprophytes in general do not require a living host.

Parasitism: An Adaptation to life on or in the bodies of higher organisms. The association may take one of the three forms:
1. Symbiosis: The ability to live in the tissues of the host with mutual benefit.
2. Commensalism: The ability to live on the external or internal surface of the body with out causing disease.
"Eating at the same table"
3. Pathogenicity: The ability of an organism to cause disease.

The outcome of the host- parasite relationship depends on a balance between the virulence of the parasite and the resistance of the host.

\section*{Aggressive mechanisms of the parasite}
1. Adherence factors
. Pili: Hair-like appendages extending from the bacterial cell surface.
2. Invasiveness of micro-organism

A high degree of bacterial invasiveness is usually associated with severe infection.
3. Bacterial toxins

These are of two types.
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-306.jpg?height=177&width=617&top_left_y=963&top_left_x=575)

\hline
\end{tabular}
4. Enzymes
.Tissue degrading enzymes
. Collagenase: Degrade collagen, which is major protein of fibrous connective tissue.
. Hyaluronidase: (Early spreading factor) hydrolyzes hyaluronidic acid, which is the ground substance of connective tissue.

Lecithinase: Splits lecithin of cell membrane into phosphorylcholine and glycerides

Staphylokinase/Streptokinase (fibrinolysin)
5. Anti-phagocytic factors
1. Protein A of Staphylococcus aureus

M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes
6. Intracellular pathogenicity
E.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis

Brucella spps.

\section*{Defense mechanisms of the host}

\section*{1. Non-specific defense mechanisms}
a. Skin
. Many layered impermeable barrier to invasion of the tissues by microorganisms from the environment.
.Infection is frequent when this barrier is breached.
E.g. Wounds, Burns
b. Mucus membrane: A single layer of epithelium and less protective than skin.
c. Lysozyme: An enzyme which lyses the mucopeptide (peptidoglycan) of the Gram-positive bacteria.
d. Normal flora: Prevents establishment of pathogenic bacteria.

Flushing of tears, urine and respiratory secretion
e. Tears: Keep the eye surface sterile due to lysozyme and flushing.
f. Respiratory secretion: Traps bacteria and constantly moves them upward propelled by cilia on the cells of the epithelium.
g. Urine: Voiding helps to flush out bacteria that have gained entry to the bladder.
h. $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{H}}$ of body tract

Low $\mathrm{p}^{\mathrm{H}}$ in stomach due to hydrochloric acid secretion kills ingested bacteria.

Low $p^{H}$ in vagina due to lactic acid conferred by lactobacilli spp. prevents entry of pathogenic bacteria.
i. Phagocytosis: The process by which microorganisms are ingested and destrroyed by phagocytic cells.

There are two types of phagocytic cells.
1. Neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocytes (The polymorphs)
. Produced and mature I bone marrow.
. Short lived cells; circulate in the blood stream for six hours.
. Act as an early defense against infection and are the "pus cells" seen in the exudate from acute infection.
. Perform only one phagocytic event.
2. Macrophages
. Produced in the bone marrow and found in blood stream as monocyte and in tissue as fixed macrophage.
. Long-lived cells
. Can perform many phagocytic events.

\section*{Major events in phagocytosis}
1. Chemotaxis: Attraction of the phagocytic cell to the site of the organism.
2. Attachment: Adherence of the organism to the membrane of the phagocytic cell.
3. Ingestion of the micro-organism by pseudopods of the phagocytic cells.
4. Formation of phagosome and phagolysosome.

Phagosome: The engulfed bacterium by a phagocyte.
Phagolysosome: Fusion ofphagosome and lysozyme (bag of hydrolytic and proteolytic enzymes found in phagocytic cells).
5. Intracellular killing of microorganism.
6. Exocytosis (removal) of degraded and killed bacteria.
j. Complement system: Cascade of reactions mediated by complement components.
Complement components are a family of proteins present in serum.

\section*{Major functions of complement system}
1. Liberation of complement fragments that attract phagocytic cells.
2. Promotes and enhances phagocytosis.
3. Induces inflammatory reaction
k. Others
1. Nutrition: Malnutrition predisposes to infection.
2. Age: The very old and the very young are particularly liable to infection.
3. Sex: May be attributes to hormonal influence.
4. Impairment of the host immune response
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-310.jpg?height=484&width=979&top_left_y=837&top_left_x=573)

\section*{2. Specific defense mechanisms}

There are two main mechanisms by which the host mounts a specific immune response against bacterial infection. These are:
1. The humoral(antibody) response
2. The cell mediated response

\section*{The humoral response}

Antibodies are proteins produced by B-lymphocytes in response to antigens (foreign substance which induces and binds with antibody).

\section*{Functions of antibodies}
1. Neutralization of toxin
2. Promotion of phagocytosis
3. Bacterial Lysis

\section*{The cell mediated response}

It is important in killing of intracellular pathogenic bacteria.
T-lymphocytes are population of lymphocytes conferring cell mediated immunity due to release of hormone-like mediators (lymphokines).

\section*{Functions of lymphokines}
1. Inhibition of macrophage migration: Localizes macrophage to the site of infection.
2. Chemotactic attraction of lymphocytes, macrophages and polymorphs to the site of infection.
3. Mitogenic activity: Stimulation of unsensitized lymphocytes to divide.

\subsection*{4.2 Normal microbial flora}

It denotes the population of micro-organisms that inhabit the skin and mucus membrane of healthy normal person.

There are two groups of normal flora. These are:
1. Resident normal flora
2. Transient normal flora

Resident normal floras are relatively fixed microorganisms regularly inhabiting the skin and mucus membrane of the normal host.

Transient normal floras are non-pathogenic or potentially pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the skin and mucus membrane for a short period of time like hours, days and weeks.

\section*{Roles of (Resident) normal flora}
1. Prevent colonization by pathogenic micro-organisms and possible disease through "bacterial interference".
a. Competition for nutrition with pathogenic bacteria
b. Competition for binding sites with pathogenic bacteria.
c. Mutual inhibition by their toxic metabolites.
d. Mutual inhibition by bacteriocins.
2. Synthesis of vitamin K in the gastrointestinal tract
3. Aid in the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine.

NB: Normal flora can cause disease when the defense mechanisms of the body is breached or when the micro-organism is placed in the abnormal body site.

\section*{Normal flora of the skin}

The skin is rich in resident bacterial flora, estimated at $10^{4}$ microbes per square inch.

2. Based on nature of diarrhea
. Secretary diarrhea: Watery diarrhea
. Invasive diarrhea: Bloody mucoid diarrhea
Osmotic diarrhea Eg. Non-absorbed purgative intake (Magnesium sulfate)

Motility diarrhea Eg. Hyperthyroidism
NB: Only secretary and invasive diarrhea are caused by microbes.

\section*{Examples of secretary diarrhea}
1. V.cholerae and E.T.E.Coli cause diarrhea by production of an enterotoxin which activates the adenylcyclase of enterocytes to increase the cyclic AMP (CAMP) level, leading into increased secretion and decreased absorption of fluids and electrolytes in the intestinal wall.
2. Giardia lamblia causes diarrhea by physical coverage of the normal absorptive surface.
3. Viruses cause diarrhea by disrupting the normal absorptive surface.

\section*{Examples of invasive diarrhea}

Shigella spp. Campylobacter spp.
Salmonella spp.E.hystolytica
E.I.E.coli

All of them cause extensive intestinal mucosal damage by invasion of the intestinal wall

Leading into bloody mucoid diarrhea.

\section*{Complication of diarrhea}
1. Local
. Intestinal wall perforation
. Intestinal vessel erosion leading to bleeding
2. Systemic (Generalized)

Dehydration leading to hypovolemic shock
Septicaemia leading to septic shock
. Malnutrition due to loss of essential nutrients and electrolytes.

Laboratory diagnosis:
Specimen: Stool, rectal swab
Wet mount preparation: Pus cells, red blood cells, parasites and ova.

Culture: Mac Conkey agar, SS agar, TCBS agar, Campylo agar
Observe for colony appearance, pigmentation, hemolysis.
Biochemical reaction and serology: For species identification.

Treatment:
. Fluid and electrolyte replacement
. Provision of antibiotics
. Continue feeding

\section*{FOOD POISONING}

It is an out break related to common meal.
Characteristics:
. Sharing same meal.
. Multiple cases
. Same clinical features
. Developing same clinical features more or less at the same time.

There are two types of food poisoning
1. Food intoxication: Illness is caused by ingestion of food with preformed toxin.
2. Food infection: Illness is caused by ingestion of food with microorganism.

Incubation period and severity of disease in food infection is determined by inoculum of micro-organism ingested.
Table 4.2. Examples of food intoxication
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline Organism & Clinical findings & Related food item \\
\hline Bacillus cereus & Vomiting, cramp & Rice, Pasta dishes \\
\hline Staphylococcus aureus 2-4 hours & Vomiting & Meat, Salads \\
\hline Clostridium botulinum 12-72 hours & Flaccid paralysis & Meat, Vegetables \\

2. Haematogenous route (source of infection is blood)

NB: Ascending route is the commonest route infection of the urinary tract.

\section*{Contributing factors for urinary tract infection}
1. Age: Very young and very old individuals are more at risk for UTI.
2. sex: UTI is more common in females than males because females have short and wide urethra.
3. Instrumentation: Indwelling catheters and cystoscopic procedures
3. Neurogenic bladder dysfunction: Diabetes mellitus, Spinal injury
4. Obstruction: Congenital anomalies in youngs and prostatic adenoma, stricture and calculi in olds.
5. Underlying diseases: Diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease
6. Vesico-ureteral reflex: Associated with recurrent acute pyelonephritis.

Clinical features:
1. Lower urinary tract infection: Infection of urethra and bladder which manifests with frequency of micturition, pain during micturition, blood-stained or cloudy urine, supra pubic tenderness.

Usually no fever.
2. Upper urinary tract infection: Infection of the kidney parenchyma and pylus which manifests with the lower UTI symptoms and signs, flank pain, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, and flank tenderness.

Laboratory diagnosis
Specimen: Clean catched midstream urine
Catheterized urine
Suprapubic aspiration
Direct microscopic examination: WBCs, RBCs, Epithelial cells.
The presence of more than five WBCs and abundant epithelial cells per HPF supports infection of urinary tract.

Gram stain: The presence of one bacterium in Uncentrifuged gram stained urine confirms Urinary tract infection.

Culture: Blood agar medium, Mac Conkey agar medium

\section*{Interpretation of culture results}
1. $\geq 10^{5} \mathrm{cfu} / \mathrm{ml}$ of urine is significant to indicate UTI.
2. $<10^{3} \mathrm{cfu} / \mathrm{ml}$ of urine indicates contamination of specimen.
3. $10^{3}-10^{5} \mathrm{cfu} / \mathrm{ml}$ of urine is uncertain.

NB: $10^{3}-10^{5} \mathrm{cfu} / \mathrm{ml}$ of urine in symptomatic patient or suprapubic or catheterized specimen indicates UTI.

\section*{CHAPTER FIVE}

\section*{Learning objective:}

At the end of the lesson, the student should be able to:
. Perform bacteriological analysis of water sample

\section*{Bacteriology of water}

Good quality of water is odorless, colorless, tasteless and free from fecal pollution and harmful chemicals.

Human illness is caused by water supplies becoming contaminated from feces being passed or washed into rivers, streams, or being allowed to seep into wells.

Feces contain microorganisms like Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Clostridium perfringenes, which contaminate safe water.

Determining whether a water supply is fecally polluted is to test for the presence of normal fecal organism.

Testing for normal fecal organisms as indicators of fecal pollution is a reliable way of determining whether water is bacteriologically safe to drink.

A single laboratory examination of any water does not justify the conclusion that the supply is safe for drinking so bacteriologic analysis of water should be performed at regular intervals.

Organisms used as indicators of fecal pollution are the coliform group particularly E. coli.
E. coli is a coliform organism, which is capable of fermenting lactose with the production of acid and gas at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $44^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in less than

48 hours, produces indole in tryptophan-containing peptone water and gives positive result in methyl red test.

When organisms of coliform group other than E.coli are found in a water sample,

Presence of S.faecalis confirms fecal pollution of water.
The presence of C . perfringenes in the absence of coliform group in water suggests fecal pollution of water at some remote date since cloostridial spores are capable of surviving in water for a long duration.

\section*{Collection of a water sample}

Technique:
. Sample of water must be collected in sterile bottles.
. Hold the base of sterile bottle in one hand, remove the stopper and cover together with the other hand.
. Fill the bottle with sample water, replace the stopper and cover together.

\section*{Collecting a sample from tap:}
. Remove any external fittings from the tap.
. Clean carefully the outside nozzle of the tap.
. Turn on the tap and allow the water to run for1 min.
. Sterilize the tap using the flame by igniting a piece of cotton wool soaked in alcohol holding with a pair of tongs.
. Allow the tap to cool by running the water for few seconds.
. Fill the sample bottle from a gentle flow of water, and replace the bottle cap.

\section*{Collecting a sample from an open well:}
. Tie a sterile sample bottle on to a weighted length of rope; attach $1 / 2$ Kg weighing stone as a weight below the bottle.
. Remove the cap from the bottle septically and lower the bottle into the well to a depth of one meter.
. Raise the bottle out of the well when no more bubbles raise to the surface.
. Replace the bottle cap and label the bottle.

\section*{Transport of water sample}

Water sample should be placed in an insulated cold box immediately after collection, and should be processed with in six hours of collection.

Frequency of sampling Population served

\section*{Multiple tube technique for counting fecal coliforms}

A 100 ml water sample is distributed (five 10 ml amounts and one 50 ml amount) in bottles of sterile selective culture broth containing lactose and an indicator.

After incubation, count the number of bottles in which lactose fermentation with acid and gas production has occurred.

Estimate the most probable number of coliforms in the 100 ml water by referring to probability tables.

\section*{Required:}
.Bottles of sterile Mac Conkey broth (Purple)
. Water samples
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-349.jpg?height=443&width=1027&top_left_y=437&top_left_x=527)

NB: Double strength broth refers to broth made up using twice the normal amount of broth powder. Single strength broth contains the normal amount of broth powder.

Bottle broth contains an inverted durham tube for gas collection. Method:
- Label the bottles.
- Mix thoroughly the sample of water by inverting the bottle several times.
- Remove the bottle cap and cover, flame the mouth of the bottle, and inoculate the bottles of sterile broth as follows:
- Add 50 ml of water to the bottle containing 50 ml of broth for treated and untreated water samples.
- Add 10 ml of water to each of five bottles containing 10 ml of broth for treated and untreated water samples.
- Add 1 ml of water into each of five bottles containing 5 ml of broth in untreated water sample.
- Mix the contents of each bottle.
- Incubate the inoculated broth in a water bath at 44 Oc for 24 hours with the botles loosely capped.
- After incubation, examine and count each bottle which has produced acid and gas.
- Determine the most probable number (MPN) of fecal coliform bacteria in the 100 ml of treated and 105 ml of untreated water sample with referring to probablity tables.

NB: Acid production is shown by a change in color of the
Mac Conkey broth from purple to yellow and gas production by the collection of a bubble in the durham tube.

\section*{CHAPTER SIX}

\section*{Learning objective:}

At the end of the lesson, the student should be able to:
- Know the simple, common and applicable methods
- Analysis difference food samples
- Know reasons for microbials food analysis
$\rightarrow$ to meet certain set standards
$\rightarrow$ to estimate the shelf - life of the product
$\rightarrow$ to determine the quality of the food
$\rightarrow$ to determine the safety of the food for public health

\section*{Food bacteriology}
- Food are essential substance for life.
- They are also important vehicles for micro-organisms that cause food borne infections and intoxications.

Food is essentially complex, and predicting whether, or how fast micro organisms will grow in any food is difficult.most food contains suffiecient nutrients to support microbial growth.
- To provide consumers with claimable qualities of food, these substance must be controlled, regulated and inspected from the microbiological view - point. Such activities are usually carried out by FAO, WHO, UNICEF, Federal state and other agencies.
- In Ethiopia the quality and safety of food have been controlled, regulated and inspected by the National Research Institute of Health and regional laboratories.

\section*{Sources of food contamination}

Food may acquire their micro-organism from various sources and the following are the important sources.
1. Animals
- Animals could be a source of contamination of food.
- The surface of animals, the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, hides, Loofs and waste products of animals are
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-353.jpg?height=175&width=264&top_left_y=967&top_left_x=643) important sources of contamination.

Food may get their microbial contamination from green plants.

The natural flora of growing plants includes pseudomonas, alcaligenes, bacissus, Micrococcus, coliform etc.
3. Sewage

Gastrointestinal pathogens, coliforms, Enterococci of untreated domestic sewage could be source of contamination of raw plant foods.
- Sewage can also contaminate natural waters and contribute micro-organisms to shellfish, fish and other sea foods.
4. Soil
- Soil is a very rich environment in microbes and is a major source of contamination of food.
- Bacillus, clostridium, enterobacter, Escherichia, Micrococcus, Alkaligens, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, proteus, Aerobacter, molds and yeast are kinds of organisms that contaminate food from soil.
5. Air and water:- are also important source of food contamination.-

Factors influencing microbial activity in food
Nutrient found in foods
- Organisms obtain their energy for carrying their metabolic activity mainly from the food.
2. Hydrogen ion concentration $(\mathrm{pH})$
- The optimum pH for many microorganisms is near the neutral point of pH 7 . However molds and yeasts as a rule are acid tolerant. This is one of the reasons why fungi are usually associated with acid foods especially fruits.
- Many bacteria are not acid tolerant, accordingly, several acid like acetic, benzoic, propionic acids are used to preserve foods.
- It has been found that pH of 4.5 or below is lethal to salmonellae and staphylococci.
3. Oxidation reduction potential $(\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{R})$
- Organisms can be classified into aerobic and anaerobic based on their oxygen requirements. There fore, the reducing and oxidizing power of the food influences the type of organism that growth on it.
- Foods with high oxidation potential favours the growth of aerobes and faculitative anaerobic organisms.
- Foods with low oxidation potential favours the growth of anaerobic and faculitative anaerobic organism.
4. Growth inhibitors: - These are chemicals such as sodium chloride (NaCl), Nitrate, Nitrite, Sulphur dioxide and hypochlorites that are added to foods to the growth of certain organisms.
5. Temperature

It was found that E.coli, for example, requires the following periods for a cell to divide at different temperatures.
-60 minutes at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
-40 minutes at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
-29 minutes at $29^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- 17 Minutes at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- 19 minutes at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- 32 minutes at $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- No growth at $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$

It is clear that rate of growth is optimal at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, but decreases when the temperature is lowered below, or raised above $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
6. Water acitivity $\left(\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{W}}\right)$
- No microbial activity can occur unless water is available.
- Water activity is the ratio between the vapour pressure of the food and that of pure water.
- Pure water has $\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{w}}=1.0$ and a relative humidity of $100 \%$. This means that $a_{w} \times 100$ indicates the equilibrium relative humidity, which the particular food would produce if enclosed in a sealed container at a constant temperature.
- Organisms have their own characterstic optimal $\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{w}}$ and range of $a_{w}$ for their growth.

The lowest $a_{w}$ values permitting growth of spoilage organisms are
- Normal bacteria
0.91
- xalophilic 0.77
- Normal yeast
0.88
- xalophilic fungi 0.65

- As can be seen from the above values dry foods are most likely spoiled by moulds.
- Syrups and honey favours the growth of osmophilic yeasts.
- Moist neutral foods like milk and meats are spoiled by bacteria.

\section*{Microorganism of importance in food bacteriology}

Micro-organisms of interest in food bacteriology are:
(i) Indicator organism(s):-
- An indicator organism or group of organisms is/are one whose numbers in a product reflects the success or failure of good manufacturing practices.
- Indicator organisms are bacterial groups (or species) whose presence in foods, above a certain numerical limits, is considered to indicate exposure of food to conditions that might introduce hazardous organisms and/or allow proliferation of pathogenic or toxinogenic species.
- They have value in assessing both the microbiological safety and quality of foods. Indicator organisms include coliforms and faecal streptococci.
- The best example of indicator organisms are the coliforms.
- Coliform group is defined to include all aerobic and faculitative anaerobic, gram negative, non-spor forming, rod shaped species which ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas within 48 hours at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$
- Coliform are either part of the normal flora of intestinal tract of man and animals or found in environments such as soil and plants.
- Coliform that are commonly found in the intestinal tracts of man and animals (faeces) are called faecal
coliform and those coliforms that are normal inhabitants of soil and plants are called non faecal coliform.
- The recovery of coliform from food or water above a certain numerical limits implies that diseases causing organism may be present and the food is potentially dangerous for human consumption.

\section*{Differentiation of faecal from non faecal coliform:-}
- In many laboratories differentiation of faecal coliforms from non faecal coliform is considered of limited value in determining the suitability of water or food for human consumption, as contamination with either type renders water or food potentially dangerous and unsafe from a sanitary stand point. However, differentiation may be advantageous under some conditions where the identity of specific members of the group present may indicate the source of pollution.

Coliform such as a aerogenes and E. freundui only occessionally found in the intertinal contents of man and animans ( $6 \%$ ). They are normally found in soil. Therefore, there presence in food or water is of doubtful sanitary significance.
- On the other hand E.coli, rarely found in the soil but constitute the predominant organisms in the intestinal contents of man and animals. Therefore, isolation E.coli in food may strongly suggest the
food has been polluted with feaces than isolation of A.aerogenes or E.freundii.

Methods used for differentiation of faecal from non faecal coliforms indole, methyl red, voges proskauer, citrate test (IMVic). IMvic test is one of the test used to differentiate faecal coliforms (E.coli) from non faecal coliforms (A.aerogenes and E.freundsi) as shown in the table below.
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline Organisms & Indole & Methyl red & V - P & Sodium citrate \\
\hline E.coli type I & + & + & - & - \\
\hline E.coli type II & - & $+$ & - & - \\
\hline E. freundii I & - & + & - & + \\
\hline E. freundii II & $+$ & $+$ & - & + \\
\hline A. aerogens I & - & - & + & + \\
\hline A. aerogens II & $+$ & - & $+$ & $+$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\section*{Elevated temperature test}
- In elevated temperature tests faecal coliforms are defined to be bacterial species that grow and ferment lactose with the production of acid and gas at temperatures higher than the normal $\left(44-44.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$.
- E.coli type I and II grow and ferment lactose at elevated temperature while A. aeerogenes and
E. freundii fall to grow and ferment lactose at elevated temperature.
ii) Index organisms: is one whose presence implies the possible occurance of a similar but pathogenic organism.E. coliis used an index organism and its presence indicates possible presence of pathogenic enteriobacteriacea eg.salmonellae species.
iii) Food poisoning organisms
- those which cause the disease by infection
- those which produce toxin in food

Those which cause infection must grow in food in large numbers and cause infection
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-360.jpg?height=554&width=316&top_left_y=967&top_left_x=620) when consumed together with food. The most most common microorganisms includes salmonella tyhimurrium, entropathogenicE.coli,Vibrio parahaemolyticus etc.
$\checkmark$ Those which cause intoxication must grow in food large numbers and produce enough toxin and when consumed together with food cause intoxication. The most common microorganism in this group are clostridium botulinium,staphylococcus and toxigenic fungi eg. Aspergillus flavus.

\section*{iv) Infectious microorganisms}

Organisms whose presence in sall numbers in food and when consumed can cause infection. In this case the food acts as a vector but not necessarly as a growth medium.organisms in this group are, Vibrio choleraeO1, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei,Bacillus anthracis, HepatitisB virus etc.

\section*{The spoilage micro-organisms}
. The spoilage microorganisms include bacteria, yeasts and modlds that cause undesirable changes of the appearance, odour, texture or taste of the food. They are commonly grouped according to their type of activity or according to theiri growth reguirements.

\section*{Psychrophilic microorganisms}

Are those organisms capable of growing relatively rapidly at commercial refrigeration temperatures with out reference to optimum temperature for growth.
. Species of Pseudomans, Achromobacter, flavobacterium and Alcahigenes are examples of Psychrophilic bacteria.
. Many psychrophilic bacteria when present in large numbers can cause a variety of off flavoirs as well as defects in foods
. The presence of large number of psychrophilic bacteria in refrigerated foods such as dairy products, meat, poultry and sea food may reflect growth of initial population during storage and /or massive contamination at some point prior to or during refrigerated storage.

\section*{Thermoduric microorganisms}
. Thermoduric organisms are those organisms which will survive so significant measure of heat treatment
. The thermophilic organisms not only survive the heat treatment but also grow at the elevated temperature
- Thermoduric bacteria are important with regard to milk and milk products as they may survive pastourisation temperature The genera Micrococcus, Streptococcus primary the entrococci, Lactobacillus, Bacillus and Clostridium are recognized as containing some species which will qualify as thermoduric.

The thermoduric count may be useful as a test of the care employed in utensil sanitation and as means of detecting sources of organisms responsible for high bacterial count in pasteurized.

\section*{Lipolytic Microorganisms}

Are those organisms capable of hydrolytic and oxidative deterioration of fats, mostly cream, butter, marganine, etc The genera Pseudomans, Achromobacter, and staphylococcus among other bacteria, Rhizopus, Geotrichum, Aspergillus and penicillium among the moulds and the yeast genera Candida, Rhodotorula, and Hansenula contain may lipolytic species.

\section*{Proteolytic microorganisms}

Proteolytic microorganisms are those microorganisms capable of hydrolyzing proteins producing a variety of odour and flavour defects Proteolytic species are common among the genera Bacillus, Clostridim, Pseudomoans, and proteus.

Acid proteolytic organisms are those organisms which carry out protein hydrolysis and acid fermentation as streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens

\section*{Halophilic microorganisms}

Haliphilic microorganisms are those organisms which require certain minimal concentrations of salt (NACI) for growth.

Slight halophiles grow optimally in media containing $2.5 \%$. Most of the slight halophilic bacteria originate from marine environments

Marine psychrophilic bacteria of the genera pseudomonas, Moraxella. Acinetobacter, and Flavobacterium contribute to the spoilage of marine fish and shelfish

Moderate halophiles grow optimally in media containing 5.20\% salt and most of the moderately halophilic bacteria involved in the spoilage of salted foods are gram positive species of the Bacillaceae and Micrococcaceae

The extreme halophiles grow optimally in media containing 20-30\% salt

The extreme hamophiles are principally species of the genera Halobacterium and Halococcus which produce bright red or pink pigments, grow very slowly.

They have been incriminated in spoilage of fish, and hides preserved in sea salts.

\section*{Halotolerant organisms}

Are those organisms capable of growth in salt concentrations exceeding 5\%.

Some halotolerant microorganisms are involved in food spoilage while some others such as staphylococcus aureus and cl.perfringens are pathogenic.

\section*{Osmophillic microorganisms}

Are those organisms tha grow in concentrated food products
Osmophillic microorganisms most commonly encountered in food industry are yeasts

They can grow in highly concentrated sugar solutions
They are frequently the cause of honeny, chocolate, candy,jams etc. Almost all of the the known osmophillic yeasts are species of saccharomyces species.

\section*{Pectinolytic microorganism}

Are those microorganisms capable of degrading pectins foun in fruites and vegetables.the destruction of the pectin can cause subsequent loss of jelly power of fruites and softening of the stored fruits and vegetables.

The pectinolytic organisms includes species of Achrobacterium, Aeromonas ,Arthrobacter, Bacillus , Enterobacer etc.

It also includes many yeasts and moulds

\section*{Acid producing microorganisms}

An important group of acid producing bacteria in the food industry is the lactic acid bacteria

This group is subdivided into the genera streptococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus.

The homofermentative species produce lactic acid from the available sugar, while the hetrofermentative types produce inadition to lactic acid, mainly acic acid, ethanol and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

Many sporeforming species belonging to the genera Bacillus and Clostridium are also important acid producers

Some mould and yeasts produce citric acid, oxalic acid,etc.

\section*{Yeasts and moulds}

Yeasts and moulds can be responsible for spoilage of many types of foods

They often manifests themselves in foods of low pH , low moisture, high salt or sugare content, etc.

They are resistant to heat freezing, antibiotics

\section*{Mesophillic spore forming aerobes}

The mesophilic, aerobic spore forming bacteria are all strains Bacillus species that grow at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ but not at $55^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

They cause spoilage in canned low acid (pH > 4.6) foods is usually of the sour type.

Inadequate heat processing is commonly responsible since spores of mesophillic bacteria are moderately resistant to moist heat.

\section*{Thermophillic anaerobes}

These organisms are obligatory anaerobes and are strongly saccharolytic, producing and abundant gas from different sugars they non hydrogen sulphid producers

They are responsible spoilage of canned food products.

\section*{Microbiological Examination of Food}

\section*{Sampling}

It is important to not that samples of foods collected for microbiological analysis should reflect the microbiological condition at the time of collection. This implies that
- Sampling should be carried out aseptically
- Samples should be protected against extraneous contamination
- Moreover, samples must be held under conditions that permit neither die off nor multiplication of the original microflora present in the food.

Definintion of terms

\section*{A lot}

Is a quantity of food produced and handled under uniform condition. This means that food produced within a batch or in a continuous process a food produced within a limited period of time
- The number of field samples collected are usually five. But for the investigation of food for salmonella the number of field sample is ten

\section*{Filed sample:}
- The amount of material actually used in the analysis of food for microorganisms. The sample unit is recommended to be 25 g for all types of food

\section*{Microbiological criteria}

A microbiological criteria is a microbiological value (eg. Number of microorganism per $g$ of food) or a range established by use of defined procedures and includes the following information.
- A statement of the microorganism of concern and/or the toxin
- The analytical methods of their detection and quantification
- A plan refining the number of field sample to be withdrawn and the size of the sample unit
- The microbiological limits considered appropriate to the food
- The proportion of the sample units that should conform to these limits.

\section*{MICROBIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF DIFFERENT FOOD}

\section*{For example Egg and egg products ' Types of contaminating microorganisms}
- The shell of eggs are either sterile or harbour very low numbers of microorganisms at the time of ovipositor.
- It gets its bacterial contamination after oviposition from nesting material, dirt, and faecal matter.
- The flora of the egg shell is dominated by Gram-positive cocci. Whereas the Gram-negative rods are present in low numbers
- They penetrate more easily through the egg shell membrane and multiply more readily than do the Gram-positive cocci.
- The number of bacteria in liquid egg product depend upon the bacteriological condition of shell eggs used for breaking, plant sanitation and conditions under which the liquid may be stored.
- The most common bacterial genera found in liquid eggs are members of pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Proteus and

Escherichia. These organisms are the main cause of spoilage resulting in characteristic off odours and off colours.
- The major pathogen associated with eggs and egg products is Salmonella.

\section*{Microbiological examination}

Eggs can be given as liquid egg frozen egg, dried egg

\section*{Methods of analysis}

Salmonella organisms should not be recovered from any of ten sample units examined when the test is carried out according to the method described; ( $\mathrm{n}=10, \mathrm{c}=0 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{M}=0$ ).

\section*{METHODS OF MICROBIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF FOOD AND WATER}

ENUMERATION OF MESOPHILIC AEROBIC
BACRERIA (Aerobic plate count)
- This method is based on the assumption that the microbial cells present in a sample mixed with an agar medium each form visible, separated colonies.

This is obtained by mixing decimal dilutions of the food sample homogenatte or warer with the medium
- After incubation of the plates at $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C} 72$ hours the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria per $g$ of food sample is calculated from the number of colonies Obtained in selected petridishes at levels of dilutions giving a significant result.

However, it should be borne in mind that this method, as all other methods, has some limitations
- Microbial cells often occur as clumps, clusters, chains, or pairs in foods, and may not be well distributed irrespective of the mixing and dilution of the sample.
- Consequently, each colony that appears of the agar plate may arise from a single cell or from groups of cell and Moreover, some microorganisms may fail to grow and form visible colonies on the agar medium as a result of unfavourable conditions of temperature, oxygen or nutrition, or because the cells are weak.
- Hence the colony count may nor reflect the actual number of viable bacteria in the food.

\section*{Counting the colonies}

Following incubation, count all colonies on dishes containing 30-300 colonies and record the results per dilution counted.

\section*{Calculation}
a) When the dishes examined contain no colonies, the result is expressed as; less than $1 \times 10^{1}$ bacteria per g or ml .
b) When the dishes (dilution 1 in 10) contain less than 30 colonies, the result is expressed as: less than $3 \times 10^{2}$ $\left(30 \times 10=3 \times 10^{2}\right)$.

\section*{Brilliant green lactose bile broth (BGLBB)}
- A loop-full of culture from each positive presumptive tube is transferred to brilliant green lactose bile broth fermentation tubes and incubated at appropriate temperature and time
- Presence of gas in any amount in the inverted vial within the incubation period may be positive confirmed test

\section*{Completed test}
- Transfer typical or atypical colonies from E.M.B or Endo agar to lactose fermentations tubes and nutrient agar slants and incubate at appropriate temperature for a period not to exceed 48hours
- If Brilliant green lactose bile broth is used in the confirmed test, an E.M.B or Endo agar plate is streaked from each fermentation tube showing gas and all plates should be incubated at appropriate temperature and period

\section*{ANNEX}

\section*{Preparation of media}

Presently, a wide range of culture media are available commercially in the form of dehydrated media. These media are simply reconstituted by weighing the required quantities and by adding distilled water, as per the manufacturer's instructions.

The pH determination can be conveniently done with the use of Lovibond comparator with phenol red indicator disc.
- Take two clean test tubes and add 5 ml of the medium to each of the tubes. One serves as a blank while phenol red indicator is added to the other tube.
- Compare the colour of the medium with the phenol red indicator at the appropriate pH marking.
- Add $\mathrm{N} / 10 \mathrm{NaOH}$ or $\mathrm{N} / 10 \mathrm{HCl}$, drop by drop till the colour of the medium matches the colour of the disc at the required pH reading.
- Calculate the volume of the NaOH or HCL of $1 / 10$ strength for 5 ml of the medium to get the required pH .
- Based on the calculation, the volume of 1 N NaOH or IN HCl required for the total volume of medium can be calculated and added.
- Check the pH of the medium once again before use.

The quantity of agar given in the formulae of media may have to be changed depending upon the quality of agar used. The concentration varies from batch to batch and should be such that will produce a sufficiently firm surface on solidification. This can be tested by streaking with inoculating wire.

In some laboratories media are prepared by individual measurement of ingredients and then mixing the same. Hence the method of preparation is given likewise:
![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2025_06_15_80485959504889b0cabag-387.jpg?height=462&width=1023&top_left_y=718&top_left_x=529)

Mix the ingredients and dissolve them by heating in a steamer. When cool, adjust the pH to 7.5-7.6.

\section*{Nutrient agar}

To the ingredients as in nutrient broth, add 15 gm agar per litre. Dissolve the agar in nutrient broth and sterilize by autoclaving at $121^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 15 minutes. Prepare plates and slopes as required.

\section*{Glucose broth}

Nutrientbroth 900 ml
Glucose (10\% solution) 100 ml
- Dissolve 9 gm glucose in distilled water and sterilize by tyndallisation.
- Add 100 ml of the glucose solution to 900 ml of sterile nutrient broth.

- Sterilize by open steaming at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for one hour.

Blood agar

Nutrient agar 100 ml
Sheep blood (defibrinated) 10 ml
- Melt the sterile nutrient agar by steaming, cool to $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- Add required amount of sheep blood aseptically with constant shaking.
- Mix the blood with molten nutrient agar thoroughly but gently, avoiding froth formation.
- Immediately pour into petri dishes or test tubes and allow to set.

\section*{Chocolate agar}

The ingredients are essentially the same as in blood agar.
- Melt the sterile nutrient agar by steaming and cool to about $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
- Add blood to the molten nutrient agar and allow to remain at $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ after gently mixing till it is chocolate brown in colour.
- Pour in petri dishes or test tubes for slopes as desired.

Staining Procedure

To prepare suspension, pick small amount of growth from 18-24 h plate (equivalent to 1 mm colony). Do not pick up agar. Suspend gently in 3 ml distilled water. (Flagella can be knocked off.) Suspension should be faintly opalescent.

To prepare slide, pass cleaned slide through blue part of burner flame several times to remove residual dirt. Cool slide, flamed side up, on paper towel. Mark wax line across slide to give area $2.5 \times 4.5$ cm . Place large loopful of suspension in center of slide adjacent to wax line. Tilt slide, letting drop run down center of slide to end. If drop does not run evenly, slide is dirty. Discard it. Air-dry slide on level surface.

5 N acetic acid 200 ml

\section*{C. alpha-Naphthol reagent}
alpha-Naphthol 1 g
5 N acetic acid 200 ml

To prepare 5 N acetic acid, add 28.75 ml glacial acetic acid to 71.25 ml distilled water. Store reagents in glass-stoppered brown bottles. To perform test, add $0.1-0.5 \mathrm{ml}$ each of reagent A and either reagent B or reagent C (as specified in method) to culture grown in liquid or semisolid medium. Development of red-violet color with reagents $A$ and B or orange color with reagents A and C indicates that nitrate has been reduced to nitrite. Since color produced with reagents A and B may fade or disappear within a few minutes, record reaction as soon as color appears. If no color develops, test for presence of nitrate by adding small amount of zinc dust. If color develops, nitrate has not been reduced.

Nitrate reduction test for enteropathogenic E. coli. To 3 ml of 1824 h culture in indole-nitrite medium, add 2 drops each of reagents A and B.Red-violet color indicates that nitrate has been reduced to nitrite. Check negative tests by adding small amount of zinc dust; if red-violet color does not appear, nitrate has been reduced.
D. Alternative test reagents. 5-Amino-2-naphthylene sulfonic acid (Cleve's acid) and N,N-dimethyl-1-naphthylamine have been recommended as substitutes for preparation of reagent B. Absolute ethanol may be substituted for acetic acid in reagent C. However, comparative evaluations should be conducted before substitution of these alternative reagents.
