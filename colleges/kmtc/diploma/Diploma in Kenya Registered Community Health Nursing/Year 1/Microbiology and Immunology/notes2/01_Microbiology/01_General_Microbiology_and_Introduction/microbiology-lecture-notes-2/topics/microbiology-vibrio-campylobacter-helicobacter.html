                        <p>Vibrios are distinguished from enterics by being oxidase-positive and motile by means of polar flagella.</p>
                        <p>Of the vibrios that are clinically significant to humans, <em>Vibrio cholerae</em>,the agent of cholera, is the most important.</p>
                        <p>Most vibrios have simple growth factor requirements and will grow in synthetic media with glucose as a sole source of carbon and energy. However, since vibrios are typically marine organisms, most species require 2-3% NaCl or a sea water base for optimal growth.</p>
                        <p>Vibrios are one of the most common organisms in surface waters of the world. They occur in both marine and freshwater habitats and in associations with aquatic animals. Some species are bioluminescent and live in mutualistic associations with fish and other marine life.</p>
                        <p>Other species are pathogenic for fish, eels, and frogs, as well as other vertebrates and invertebrates.</p>

                        <p>The seventh pandemic began in 1961 in the Indonesia, with spread to Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>
                        <p>Cholera is endemic in India and Southeast Asia. From these centers, it is carried along shipping lanes, trade routes, and pilgrim migration routes.</p>
                        <p>The disease is spread by contact involving individuals with mild or early illness and by water, food, and flies.</p>
                        <p>Vibrios survive in water for up to 3 weeks. <em>Vibrio cholerae</em> lives in aquatic environments. And such environments are the vibrios natural reservoir.</p>
