                        <p>Generally uses a 100-power objective lens with a 10-power ocular lens, thus magnifying the specimen 1000 times. Particles $0.2 \mu\text{m}$ in diameter are magnified to about $0.2 \text{ mm}$ and so become clearly visible.</p>
                        <p>Specimens are rendered visible because of differences in contrast between them and the surrounding medium.</p>
                        <p>Many bacteria are difficult to see well because of their lack of contrast with the surrounding medium.</p>

                        <p>Takes advantage of the fact that light waves passing through transparent objects, such as cells, emerge in different phases depending on the properties of the materials through which they pass.</p>
                        <p>This effect is amplified by a special ring in the objective lens of a phase contrast microscope, leading to the formation of a dark image on a light background.</p>

                        <p>Some organisms fluoresce naturally because of the presence within the cells of naturally fluorescent substances such as chlorophyll. Those that do not naturally fluoresce may be stained with a group of fluorescent dyes called fluorochromes.</p>
                        <p>Widely used in clinical diagnostic microbiology eg the fluorochrome auramine O , which glows yellow when exposed to ultraviolet light, is strongly absorbed by <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, When applied to a specimen containing <em>M tuberculosis</em> and exposed to ultraviolet light, the bacterium can be detected by the appearance of bright yellow organisms against a dark background.</p>
                        <p>The principal use of fluorescence microscopy is a diagnostic technique called the fluorescentantibody (FA) technique or immunofluorescence. In this technique, specific antibodies (eg, antibodies to <em>Legionella pneumophila</em>) are chemically labeled with a fluorochrome</p>
                        <p>If the specimen contains <em>L pneumophila</em>, the fluorescent antibodies will bind to antigens on the surface of the bacterium, causing it to fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light.</p>

                        <p>DIC microscopes employ a polarizer to produce polarized light. The polarized light beam passes through a prism that generates two distinct beams; these beams pass through the specimen and enter the objective lens where they are recombined into a single beam.</p>
                        <p>Because of slight differences in refractive index of the substances each beam passed through, the combined beams are not totally in phase but instead create an interference effect, which intensifies subtle differences in cell structure. Structures such as spores, vacuoles, and granules appear three dimensional.</p>
                        <p>DIC microscopy is particularly useful for observing unstained cells because of its ability to generate images that reveal internal cell structures that are less apparent by bright-field techniques.</p>
