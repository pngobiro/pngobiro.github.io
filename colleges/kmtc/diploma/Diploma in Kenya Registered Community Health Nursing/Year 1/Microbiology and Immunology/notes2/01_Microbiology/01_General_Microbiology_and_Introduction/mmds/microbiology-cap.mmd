March 2019. INTRODUCTION

MODULE CONTENT:
Historical back ground,
Classification of microorganisms, properties of
microorganisms, clinical importance of microorganisms, modes of transmission of infections, concept of infection(definition of terms related to infection, stages in development of an infection, common nosocomial infections), life cycles of HIV.

\section*{MICROBIOLOGY: INTRODUCTION.}

\section*{Microbiology is the scientific study of minute} microorganisms which are not seen with naked eyes.
Microscope is the instrument used to view microorganisms.(uses magnifying lenses)

\section*{HISTORICAL BACKGROUND.}

Anton Leeuwenhoek was the first man to observe a microorganism which he called bacteria in 1600 s; it was not until the $19{ }^{\text {th }}$ century that the germ theory of disease was accepted.

\section*{Luis Pasteur provided persuasive evidence that microbes}
were responsible for causing human illness.

He discovered three bacteria, staphylococcus, streptococccus and pneumococcus that can become
pathogens.(harmful to human/animals).
Examples of microorganisms include
-bacteria,
-viruses,
- parasites (protozoa/helminth)
-fungi
-archea, algae
- CLASSIFICATION AND INDENTIFICATION OF MICROBES
-Define 'microbe'- small living microorganisms.(not seen by naked eyes).
-There are five groups of microorganisms viz:
1). bacteria
2). fungi (yeast and
molds)
3).viruses
4).parasites (protozoa
\& helminths)
5).algae

\section*{NAMING ACCORDING TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND NUTRITIONAL ADAPTATION.}

Micro organisms are further named according to their environmental and nutritional survival properties as follows:
energy source-phototrophic; those that requires light
- chemotrophic; survives in advance chemical conditions
- autotrophic
- heterotrophic

Nutrient requirement - simple or complex.

\section*{Bacteria.}

Mode of classification: according to their structural characteristic, morphology and gram staining property.
- Bacteria hence belong to four classes based on gram-stain technique and morphology.
- Gram positive cocci,
- Gram positive bacilli,
- Gram negative cocci,
- Gram negative bacilli.
- Gram stain is a staining technique which was founded in
1884 by Hans Christian Grams. Bacterial smears are
made on a glass slide and are stained and observed under
microscope, the bacteria that takes grams basic stain(crystal violet) is called grams positive and the one
that takes grams counterstain(neutral red) is called grams negative.
- The thick layers of peptidoglycan in the cell wall will stain purple, gram positive while the thin gram negative cell wall appears pink.
- Some bacteria like mycobacteria and norcadia shows acid fast properties and are stained with a stain called Ziel nelsons (ZN stain)
- Bacteria are further classified according to their shape, respiration, reproduction, genus and species.
- Read the flow chart pg 4\&5 of mims'medical microbiology and
- immunology $6^{\text {th }}$ edition by Richard v, Goering and three others.
-Identification of bacteria in the laboratory depend on the
following:
-gram stain
-Shape
Presence of capsule
-Bonding tendency -Motility-Respiration -Growth medium
-Intra or extracellular

\section*{VIRUSES}
- General Characteristics:
- virus means poison; someone once called them "a piece of bad news wrapped in a protein coat.
obligate intracellular parasites
- reproduce by replication only inside a host cell
- consist of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) in a protein coat, called a capsid (no cell membrane)
-they insert themselves into a host cell \& direct the host cell's metabolic machinery to make more virus
- the virus supplies information (the plan) in the form of its nucleic acid - raw materials and driving force (ATP \& reducing power) are supplied by the host cell.
- all cellular organisms can be attacked by viruses; however, viruses are very specific for the organisms \& cells they infect.
-They have DNA or RNA, unlike prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, which have both.
- In addition, they lack a metabolism of their own (they cannot produce ATP, etc.) - raw materials and driving force (ATP \& reducing power) are supplied by the host cell.

\section*{FUNGI,YEAST AND MOULDS}

FUNGI:
- there are two types of fungi -yeasts and molds
-They are eukaryotic organisms
- they are bigger in size than bacteria
- Their cell consists of chitin (not peptidoglycan as in bacteria) thus they are insensitive to antibiotics such as penicillin that inhibit peptidoglycan.
- The cell wall contains other polysaccharides Important one is ÃŸ-glucan (an important site of action of antifungal drug caspofungin), a long polymer of D- glucose.
-Some fungi reproduce sexually by mating and forming sexual spores e.g zygospores, ascosores, basidiospores.
-Fungi that do not form sexual spores are termed imperfect fungi.
- Medially important fungi propagate by asexually by forming conidia(asexual spores).
-Yeast are single cell and reproduce by budding.
- Molds grow as long
filaments(hyphae)and form a mat called mycelium, some hyphae forms transverse walls (septate hyphae).
- Non septate hyphae are multinucleated (coencytic) the growth of hyphae occurs by extension of the tip of the hypha not by cell division all along the filament.
-Most fungi are obligate aerobes, some facultative anaerobes but non are obligate anaerobes.
- Medically important fungi are thermally dimorphic (they form different structures at different temperature) they exist as molds in the environment and as yeast in the human tissue at body temperature. - Yeast candida albicans is a human body flora but becomes a pathogen in female reproductive track.

\section*{PARASITES}
- parasites are organisms that sorely depends on the host for their growth, reproduction and survival.
-Some parasites are microscopic in some stages of their life cycle or in the whole lifecycle(e.g. entomoeba histolytica, plasmodium-malarial parasites) while others are microscopic in their first stage (egg) and macroscopic in larval and adult stage(eg ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, tapeworm)
- lives inside the body) are classified into two groups protozoa and helminth.
- Protozoa: are unicellular organism
-the commonly known protozoa of medical importance include: -

Sarcodina (amoeba)
Sporozoa (plasmodium)
Mastigophora (filariworms)
protozoa are motile and move by means of either
-flagella,
cilia, or
Dpseudopodia - allowing them to move in an aqueous habitat.

HELMINTH ( Metazoa) helminthes are generally intestinal, cutaneous
and tissue worms.
Helminth are classified into 2 groups platyhelminth and nematohelminth, in the class of platyhelminth we have two subgroups - trematoda
- cestodes

Eosinophilia is associated with several helminth infections especially when the larvae migrates in the host body.
high eosinophoils are associated with the following worms:
ascaris ,strongyloides, trichinella, toxocara and hookworm necator and ancylostoma.
Eosinophils are white blood cells involved in the host body defense mechanisms.

Helminths lifecycle progress from egg $\rightarrow$ larvae $\rightarrow$ adult.
The egg contains embryo that hatches into larvae which then matures to adult which in turn produces eggs.
Sexual cycle (adult mating and reproduction) occurs in the definitive host(immediate host), intermediate host is one in which the asexual cycle occurs or the larvae is present.
ASSIGNMENT
- Read and make notes on pathogenic protozoa and helminth (note on amoeba and plasmodium(malaria parasite)

\section*{ALGAE}

Algae are eukaryotic Protista, organisms that photosynthesis but lack the specialized multicellular reproductive structure of plants.

\section*{ASSIGMENT.}
- List pathogenic fungi (molds and yeast) the diseases they cause.
-Pathogenesis of fungi.

\section*{PROPERTIES OF MICROOGANISMS.}
- Microorganisms properties as related to environment and other living things falls into two types 1) benefical
2) harmful.
1)BENEFICIAL:
- Soil bacteria and fungi are involved in decomposing organic matters and recycling old plant material providing nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous to plant roots.
- Fungi colonize upper part of plants providing many benefits including drought/heat tolerance resistance to insect and plant diseases.
- Bacteria on human skin prevents colonization of harmful microorganisms.
- Bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract of human aids in the digestion of food and also acts as commensals preventing colonization by harmful yeasts and fungi.
- Bacteria such as saccharides ceverasiae aids fermentation and is used in food and beverage industries.
- Bacteria are used for conventional biological-treatment alternatives for settled domestic sewage. Thus, the reuse of treated wastewater from small wastewatertreatment systems may become feasible.
-The treatments of plants with higher concentrations of the reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis)resulted in improved plant growth in the uninoculated controls.
- HARMFULL PROPERTIES
- Contaminate the environment including food and water sources.
- Cause diseases to both human, animals and plants
- Causes extinctions of important species and economic drawbacks.
- Warrants world concern in epidemics and outbreaks of diseases.
- Occurrence of incurable conditions and diseases.
- Formation of biofilms.
(A biofilm is an aggregate of microorganisms in which cells adhere to each other or a surface. Biofilm, which is also referred to as slime. Complete removal of biofilms is

IMPORTANCE OF MICROOGARNISMS TO THE ENVIRONMENT/ECOSYSTEM.
-Decomposition: (Bioremedation) microorganisms are the main
source of decomposition.
After the death of human or animals and plants ,microorganisms penetrates their bodies (or plant remains) and deep inside starts digesting the dead skin and other organs in a process called autolysis and decay.
In the process useful nutrients ( such as carbon and nitrogen) are released to the environment. Decomposition makes the soil fertile benefiting the production of plants. Simply re-fertilization of soil.

Production of oxygen: autotrophic organisms; this includes the cyanbacteria and blue green algae whose habitat is ocean lakes and ponds produce oxygen and produce food.
Parasitic nature of microorganisms: they are the cause of
bringing evolution of many species because weak organisms die out to the diseases they cause and strong and beneficent organisms are left out to the ecosystem; enough food is the left to those who survive who the reproduce efficiently and healthy.

\section*{CLINICAL IMPORTANCE OF \\ MICROORGANISMS}
- Microorganisms play an important role in diagnosis of diseases.(identifying the causative organism)
- Assist in treatment of diseases( knowledge as to which organism responds to which drug [antibiotics]/chemically manufactured products)
- Used in prevention of diseases (as in immunization vaccines)
- Microorganisms are used as bioremediation rendering the environment clean and free from foul smell of decaying organic materials.

\section*{MODES OF TRANSMISSION OF INFECTION.}
- Direct contact. (person to person, touch, kisses, sexual) herpes soster, gonorrhea, hepatitis infections.
- Ingestion. (oral route- through mouth eating or drinking contaminated food, fruits or water/drinks) e.g typhoid, cholera, amoebiasis,
- Inhalation. (breathing in air containing droplets of
- microorganism either bacteria, virus, fungi spores e.g
- tuberculosis, anthrax, aspergillus infections)
- Skin penetration(through injuries, abrasions, infected animal and vector bites)
- Congenital (acquired from mother to child during pregnancy, transplacental infection e.g syphilis, HIV)

\section*{MODES OF TRANSMISSION WITH EXAMPLES OF MICROBIAL DISEASES.}
- Ingesting pathogens in contaminated food or water as in cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid fever ,bacillary dysentery, hepatitis A, or ingesting pathogen in unpasteurized milk and dairy products as in brucellosis, or campylobacter infections.
- Inhaling pathogens in airborne droplets as in tuberculosis, whooping cough, measles, influenza, pneumonia, meningitis, SARS. Pathogens being transferred by direct contact from one person to another as in HIV infections, syphilis gonorrhea, ringworm infections.

Skin penetration:
- Pathogens entering the tissue through bites of an arthropod vector as in bubonic plague, rickettsial infections, dengue, rift valley fever.
- Pathogen entering wounds, cuts, or burns by way of contaminated hands or unsterilized instruments as in the infection of the skin such as boils and abscess and tetanus(via contaminated soil or dust.
-Transfer of pathogens in contaminated blood or blood products as in HIV infection, viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV).
-Congenital: Pathogen transmitted from mother to child as in HIV infection, congenital syphilis, chlamydia infection, herpes infection, congenital rubella, gonococcal conjunctivitis, cytomegalovirus neonatal infection.

\section*{TERMINOLOGIES RELATED TO MICROORGANISMS AND INFECTION.}

Infection: is the invasion of an organism's body tissue by disease causing agent, their multiplication and the reaction of host tissue to the infectious agent and the toxin they produce.
- Infectious disease is a transmissible disease or communicable disease an illness resulting from the infection.
-Cause of infection: by infectious agents such as bacteria virus viroids funai and
- Pathogen: A pathogen is any microorganism that is capable of
causing disease in a susceptible host.
[Pathogens are often described as primary, capable of causing disease in normal hosts, or opportunists, primarily causing disease in immunocompromised individuals.]
Pathogenesis - the process an organism causing disease in hosts body.
-Intoxication: Some pathogens can cause disease by the
elaboration of a toxin. This can occur in the absence of viable bacteria. One example of this is certain types of food poisoning.
- Carrier: An individual with asymptomatic colonization or
infection who is capable of transmitting infection to
others.
- Latency: The pathogen remains viable but is
- Epidemics: These are outbreaks of infections that are in excess of the normal "endemic" incidence of a particular type of infection.
- There are 2 types of epidemics.
- A Common Source Outbreak is represented by a sharp curve. It is a point source outbreak with a single site or agent (e.g., food) causing infection. Eliminate the source and eliminate the epidemic. (i.e., removing the handle during the Broad Street Pump epidemic).
- A Propagated Epidemic is when secondary cases are involved such as chicken pox affecting a large community. A wave of individuals acquires the infection and because of the presence of susceptible subjects secondary cases occur. This continues until a sufficient amount of community members develop immunity and are protected from subsequent infection.
- Endemic - the constant presence of a disease or agent of disease in a community or region.
- Epidemiology - is the study of the spread, distribution, prevalence and control of disease in a community.
- Pandemic - a disease that travels to many countries and affects a large number of people, eg HIV, influenza, cholera.
-Sporadic disease - is one which breaks out only occasionally.
- Capsid- the protein coat surrounding a virus used for its protection.
- Cilia - are slender, microscopic hairlike structures or organelles that extend from the surface of mammalian cells including bacteria and protozoa and may be used for locomotion and adherence.
- Phagocytes - a white cell that can surround or engulf (by phagocytosis)and destroy micro organisms including viruses and bacteria. There are two separate groups of cells= macrophages and neutrophils.
- Food poisoning- any illness caused by eating food contaminated by pathogenic microbes.
- Food spoilage- changes in appearance, flavor, odors and other qualities of food due to microbial growth which causes it to deteriorate and spoil by decay.
- Generation time- the time taken for a population of microorganism to double in a number.
-Host cell- a cell that is infected by a virus or any other microorganism.
-Hyphae, plural) - a very fine thread that is the basic structure of the filamentous fungi.
-Inflammation - a reaction of tissue to irritation; it is a beneficial process as it destroys or contain the pathogen within a small area enabling the healing process to begin.
- Antibiotic - a chemical that kills or inhibits growth of bacteria and is used to treat bacterial infections.
-Bacterium(bacteria-plural) - a prokaryotic single celled organism which may be harmful or beneficial to human, animals or environment.
- Decomposer- the term given to some fungi and soil bacteria that breakdown dead animals and plants and their waste products into simpler substances called nutrients.(soil nutrients)
- Virulence - is the ability of a pathogen or microbe to infect and cause disease to the host body. [or a term used to describe the degree of pathogenicity of an organism].

\section*{REPRODUCTION OF BACTERIA}
- Bacteria multiply by simple cell division known as binary fission
(splitting into two).
- The single piece of double-stranded DNA reproduces itself exactly. The information required to make the cell's protein is encoded in the bacterial genome. Messenger (m) RNA is transcribed from the DNA chromosome and the proteins translated from the mRNA are assembled by the ribosomes. Several enzymes are involved in DNA replication and protein production. Bacterial mutations (chemical alteration in DNA) or transmissible bacterial variations involving gene transfer may occur in response to environmental changes.
-When a bacterial species produces several forms each with its own characteristics, these variations are called strains.
- Rickettsiae.
- Although classified as bacteria, rickettsiae resemble viruses in
that they replicate only in living cells and are unable to survive as
free-living organisms. They can just be seen with the light microscope (red particles in Giemsa preparations). Unlike viruses,
rickettsiae contain both RNA and DNA, multiply by binary fission
and have cell walls composed of peptidoglycan.
- They show sensitivity to antiseptics and some antibiotics.

Chlamydiae
- Chlamydiae are small ( $250-500 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) Gram negative bacteria but resemble viruses in being unable to replicate outside of living cells. They contain both DNA and RNA and have their own enzyme systems.
- The energy required for metabolic activities is supplied by the host cell. Chlamydiae develop and reproduce in a special way.
- The infectious form is called an elementary body. Following infection of a host cell, the elementary body develops into a reticulate body. This reproduces by binary fission, producing microcolonies within a large cytoplasmic inclusion (chlamydial inclusion).
Elementary particles are produced and released to infect new cells when the host cell ruptures (48-72 h after infection).

\section*{- Prion particles}
- Neither bacteria nor viruses, prions are thought to be infectious self-replicating protein particles that cause a range of rare fatal degenerative neurological diseases (transmissible degenerative spongiform encephalopathies) which have long incubation periods. They include:
- Scrapie in sheep (disease known for many years).
- Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle.
- Kuru in humans (found only in Papua New Guinea, associated
with ritual cannibalism, now a rare occurrence).
- Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD) affecting mainly elderly people.
sponge-like appearance of the tissue.
Inflammatory cells are absent and there is no antibody response.
Prions are particularly resistant to heat and some chemical agents. They are inactivated by hypochlorite and by autoclaving
at $134^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 18 minutes.
Bacteria lacking cell walls
Four types of bacteria with deficient cell walls are recognized:
- Mycoplasma species
- L-forms
- Spheroplasts
- Protoplasts
- Mycoplasmas: These are naturally occurring stable bacteria that
lack a rigid cell wall. They are among the smallest living microorganisms capable of independent existence, ranging in size from $0.1-2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Species of medical importance include Mycoplasma
pneumoniae and Ureaplasma urealyticum.
- L-forms: These are mutant bacteria without a cell wall, usually
produced in the laboratory but sometimes formed in the body of
patients being treated with penicillin. They can reproduce on
- Protoplasts: These are unstable cell wall deficient forms originate artificially.
The cell wall is lost due to the action of lysozyme enzymes which
destroy peptidoglycan. Protoplasts are metabolically active but
unable to reproduce. They are easily lyzed.

\section*{Spheroplasts:}
- Derived from Gram negative bacteria, spheroplasts are bacteria with a damaged cell wall. The damage is caused by a toxic chemical or antibiotic such as penicillin.
- They are able to change back to their normal form when the toxic agent is removed.

Leptospires:
are thin spirochaetes with many tightly packed coils that are difficult to distinguish.
- They measure $6-20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length by $0.1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in width and have hooked ends.
The leptospire of medical importance is Leptospira interrogans (contains many serovars).,

\section*{LABORATORY INVESTIGATION OF MICROBIAL INFECTIONS}

The laboratory investigation of microbial diseases
involves:
- Examining specimens to detect, isolate, and identify pathogens or their products using:
- Microscopy
- Culture techniques
- Biochemical methods
- Immunological (antigen) tests

\section*{NORMAL MICROBIAL FLORA}
-The normal microbial flora are those organisms that make their home on or in some part of the body. In a healthy person such organisms rarely cause disease. Microorganisms of the normal flora consist of symbionts, commensals, and opportunists.
-SYMBIONTS: These are organisms that usually benefit the person infected, e.g. the enteric bacteria that form nart of the normal

\section*{COMMENSALS:}

These organisms form the largest group of the normal microbial flora of the body. They live on skin
and the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory
tract, intestines, and vagina. They are mostly neither
beneficial nor harmful to their host, and can protect
by competing with potential pathogens.

\section*{Opportunists:}
-These are the organisms that can, if a suitable opportunity arises, become pathogenic and cause disease.
Such an opportunity may arise following:
- The transfer of a commensal from its usual habitat to another part of the body where it can establish itself and cause disease, e.g. Escherichia coli is a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract but if it enters the urinary tract it can cause urinary infection.
-The weakening of a person's natural immunity due to poor health, malnutrition, previous surgery, infection with HIV,or drug therapy,e.g. Staphylococcus aureus is a normal commensal in the nose but it may become a pathogen and cause pneumonia in a child with measles or influenza.

NOTE:
Opportunistic organisms are often the cause of what are called nosocomial infections, i.e. infections accidentally acquired by patients during a hospital stay due to their defense mechanisms being weakened.
Sites of the body having a normal microbial flora include:
the skin,
axilla and groin,
conjunctiva,
external ear, mouth, nose and nasopharynx,

\section*{SPECIMENS CONTAINING COMMENSALS}
- Sputum
- Throat and mouth specimens
- Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens
- Eye discharges
- Skin and ulcer specimens
- Urogenital specimens
- Faeces and rectal swabs
- Urine (small numbers of commensals)

Note: The commensals which may be present in each specimen are listed in those subunits in which the examination of each specimen is described.

\title{
SPECIMENS NOT CONTAINING COMMENSALS*
}
- Pus (wounds, abscesses, burns, sinuses)
- Cerebrospinal fluid
- Blood
- Serous fluids (synovial, pericardial, ascitic, hydrocele)
Note: Special care must be taken not to introduce contaminants into these specimens

\section*{NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS.}

A hospital-acquired infection (HAI), also known as a nosocomial infection, is an infection that is acquired in a hospital or other health care facility. sometimes instead called a health care-associated infection (HAI or HCAI).[ Such an infection can be acquired in hospital, nursing home, rehabilitation facility, outpatient clinic, or other clinical settings. Infection is spread to the susceptible patient in the clinical setting by various means:
-The infection can originate from the outside environment, another infected patient, staff that may be infected, or in some cases, the source of the infection cannot be determined.
- In some cases the microorganism originates from the patient's own skin microbiota, becoming opportunistic after surgery or other procedures that compromise the protective skin barrier. Though the patient may have contracted the infection from their own skin, the infection is still considered nosocomial since it develops in the health care setting.
- hospital-associated infections, from all types of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi combined.
- The category of gram-negative infections are estimated to account for two-thirds of the Nosocomial infections.
- Nosocomial infections can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream and other parts of the body. Many types display antimicrobial resistance, which can complicate treatment.

\section*{Transmission}
-Indwelling catheters have recently been identified with hospital acquired infections.
-Procedures using Intravascular Antimicrobial Lock Therapy can reduce infections that are unexposed to blood-borne antibiotics.
Introducing antibiotics, including ethanol, into the catheter (without flushing it into the bloodstream) reduces the formation of biofilms.

\section*{Main routes of transmission}
-Direct contact: The most important and frequent mode of transmission of nosocomial infections is by direct contact.
-Airborne transmission: Transmission occurs when droplets containing microbes from the infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the patient's body; droplets are generated from the source person mainly by coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures, such as

Dissemination can be either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle
residue $\{5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or smaller in size $\}$ of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent.
Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air-handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission.
- Common vehicle transmission: This applies to microorganisms transmitted to the host by contaminated items(common vehicle), such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment. - Vector borne transmission: This occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms.
Contact transmission is divided into two

\section*{subgroups:}
-direct-contact transmission and indirect-contact transmission.

\section*{Direct-contact transmission:}
- This involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as when a person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other patient-care activities that require direct personal contact.
- Direct-contact transmission also can occur between two patients, with one serving as the source of the infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.

\section*{Indirect-contact transmission.}

This involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments, needles, or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between patients. In addition, the improper use of saline flush syringes, vials, and bags has been implicated in disease transmission in the US, even when healthcare workers had

The most common type of nosocomial infections are:
surgical wound infections, respiratory infections, genitourinary infections, as well as gastrointestinal infections.
-Immunocompromised patients, the elderly and
young children are usually more susceptible than

> PATHOGEN THAT REGULARLY CAUSE NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS
> - Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeroginosa \&
> Escherichia coli.
- According to the CDC, the most common pathogens that cause nosocomial infections are Staphylococcus aureus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.
- Some of the common nosocomial infections are urinary tract infections, respiratory pneumonia, surgical site wound infections, bacteremia, gastrointestinal and skin infections.
- Nosocomial infections are not just limited to bacteria;
certain fungi such as Candida albicans and aspergillus, as
well as, viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus and
influenza have also been implicated in a number of hospital acquired infections.

\section*{PREVENTION AND CONTROL}
- Controlling nosocomial infection is to implement QA/QC measures to the health care sectors, and evidence-based management can be a feasible approach. [quality assurance/quality control]
- Nosocomial infections are often caused by breaches of infection control practices and procedures, unclean and non-sterile environmental surfaces, and/or ill hospital staff.

Prevention of nosocomial infections includes: proper personal hygiene and hand washing on the part of the hospital staff, complete sterilization of medical equipment, providing a clean, sanitary environment in the health care facilities.
Educating the patients on personal hygiene, and avoid sharing of sanitary
items among inpatient e.g bed pans, basins and towels.

Decongesting the ward for adequate spacing of beds

Constructing of well ventilated inpatient wards

Maintaining the hospital and all health facilities free from insect vectors and pests which many be carriers of infection (clearing and spraying.
