                        <p>The word measles is derived from the German word for blister.</p>
                        <p>Before the advent of the current measles vaccine, there were about 500,000 cases of measles in the United States per year; almost everyone got the measles. But since 1963, the number has fallen precipitously (figure 1B) with a low of only 86 cases in 2001, all of which seem to be imported. In the less developed world, measles still takes its toll with an estimated 30 million illnesses and 770,000 measles-caused deaths in 2000 of which 58% were in Africa</p>

                        <p>Infection is via an aerosol route and the virus is very contagious. It replicates initially in the upper/lower respiratory tract, followed by replication in lymphoid tissues leading to viremia and growth in a variety of epithelial sites. The disease develops 1-2 weeks after infection.</p>
                        <p>Uncomplicated disease is characterized by the following:</p>

The patient may get an enormous number and red areas may become confluent (see below).</span></li>

                        </aside>
                        <p>The infection is prostrating but recovery is usually rapid. The peak of infectiousness is before the onset of obvious symptoms (Koplik's spots, rash). Note some virus shedding occurs during the disease phase, so spread of the virus to other individuals can be somewhat reduced by minimizing contact with others.</p>
                        <p>The cell mediated response is important since patients with agamma-globulinemia recover normally. Measles tends to be more severe in adults and the very young (under 5 years of age) and is less severe in older children and teenagers.</p>

This is rare, but often fatal. The reason for the giant cells is that, since F protein can function at physiological pH , it can facilitate cell-cell fusion.</span></li>
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon"></span><span class="item-text">Since virus grows in epithelia of the nasopharynx, middle ear and lung, all of these sites may then be susceptible to secondary bacterial infection.
