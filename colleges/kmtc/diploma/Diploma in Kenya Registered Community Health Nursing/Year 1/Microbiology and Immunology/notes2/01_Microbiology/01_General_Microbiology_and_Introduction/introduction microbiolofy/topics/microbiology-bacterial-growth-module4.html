                        <ul class="enhanced-list">
                            <li class="list-item"><span class="item-icon">-</span><span class="item-text">Microbial cells are unable to control their temperature. Their survival is dependent on adapting to whatever temperatures are encountered in the habitat.</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The range of temperatures for microbial growth can be expressed as:</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Minimum temperature - is the lowest temperature that permits a microbe's continued growth and metabolism; below this temperature, its activities are inhibited.</li>
                            <li>Maximum temperature - is the highest temperature at which growth and metabolism can proceed. If the temperature rises slightly above maximum, growth will stop, but if it continues to rise beyond that point, the enzymes and nucleic acids will eventually become permanently inactivated and the cell will die. This is why heat works so well as an agent in microbial control.</li>
                            <li>Optimum temperature - covers a small range, intermediate between the minimum and maximum, which promotes the fastest rate of growth and metabolism.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Another way to express temperature adaptation is to describe whether an organism grows optimally in a cold, moderate or hot temperature range. The terms used for these ecological groups are psychrophile, mesophile and thermophile.</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>A psychrophile is a microorganism that has an optimum temperature below $15^{\circ}\text{C}$ and is capable of growing at $0^{\circ}\text{C}$. It is obligate with respect to cold and generally cannot grow above $20^{\circ}\text{C}$.</li>
                            <li>Mesophiles - organisms that grow at intermediate temperatures. The optimum growth temperatures (optima) of most mesophiles fall into the range of $20^{\circ}\text{C}-40^{\circ}\text{C}$. Most human pathogens have optima somewhere between $30^{\circ}\text{C}$ and $40^{\circ}\text{C}$ (human body temperature is $37^{\circ}\text{C}$). Ex: Bacillus and Clostridium.</li>
                            <li>Thermophile is a microbes that grows optimally at temperatures greater than $45^{\circ}\text{C}$. Such heat-loving microbes live in soil and water associated with volcanic activity and in habitats directly exposed to the sun. Thermopiles vary in heat requirements, with a general range of growth of $45^{\circ}\text{C}-80^{\circ}\text{C}$.</li>

                        <h3 id="gas-requirements" class="subsection-heading">4.4.2 Gas Requirements</h3>
                        <p>- The atmospheric gases that most influence microbial growth are oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen has the greatest impact on microbial adaptation. With respect to oxygen requirements, several general categories are recognized.</p>
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>Aerobe (aerobic organism) - grows well in the presence of normal atmospheric oxygen and processes the enzymes needed to process toxic oxygen products.</li>
                            <li>Obligate aerobe - organism that cannot grow without oxygen. Ex: Bdellovibrio and Xanthomonas.</li>
                            <li>Facultative anaerobe - is an aerobe that does not require oxygen for its metabolism and is capable of growth in the absence of oxygen. This type of organism metabolizes by aerobic respiration when oxygen is present, but in its absence, it adopts an anaerobic mode of metabolism such as fermentation. Ex: Bacterial pathogens - Gram-negative enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus.</li>
                            <li>Microaerophile - does not grow at normal atmospheric tension of oxygen, but requires a small amount of it in metabolism. Most organisms in this category live in a habitat that provides small amounts of oxygen but is not directly exposed to the atmosphere.</li>
                            <li>Anaerobe (anaerobic microorganism) does not grow in normal atmospheric oxygen.</li>
                            <li>Strict / obligate anaerobes - they cannot tolerate any free oxygen in the immediate environment and will die if exposed to it. Growing anaerobic bacteria usually requires special media, methods of incubation and handling chambers that exclude oxygen. Ex: Clostridium, Trichomonas, Bacteroides.</li>
                            <li>Aerotolerant anaerobes - do not utilize oxygen, but can survive in its presence and these anaerobes are not killed by oxygen.</li>
                        </ol>
