                        <p>Microbiology is a subject which deals with living organisms that are individually too small to be seen with the naked eye.</p>
                        <p>It considers the microscopic forms of life and deals about their reproduction, physiology, and participation in the process of nature, helpful and harmful relationship with other living things, and significance in science and industry.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">History of Microbiology</h3>
                        <p>Man kind has always been affected by diseases which were originally believed to be visitations by the gods and meant to punish evil doers.</p>
                        <p>Hippocratus, father of medicine, observed that ill health resulted due to changes in air, winds, water, climate, food, nature of soil and habits of people.</p>
                        <p>Varro (117-26 BC)said a theory that disease was caused by animated particles invisible to naked eye but which were carried in the air through the mouth and nose into the body.</p>
                        <p>Fracastorius ( 1500 G.C.) proposed that the agents of communicable disease were living germs, that could be transmitted by direct contact with humans and animals, and indirectly by objects ; but no proof because of lacking experimental evidence.</p>
                        <p>Antony Van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723 G.C.), father of Microbiology, observed "animalcules" using simple microscope with one lens.</p>
                        <p>He was the first who properly described the different shapes of bacteria.</p>
                        <p>Although Leeuwenhoek was not concerned about the origin of micro-organism; many other scientists were searching for an explanation for spontaneous appearance of living things from decaying meat, stagnating ponds, fermenting grains and infected wounds.</p>
                        <p>On the bases of this observation, two major theories were formulated.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Theory of Abiogenesis</li>
                            <li>Theory of Biogenesis</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Theory of Abiogenesis deals with the theory of spontaneous generation; stating that living things originated from non-living things.</p>
                        <p>Aristotle (384-322 BC): The founder of a theory spontaneous generation.</p>
                        <p>He observed spontaneous existence of fishes from dried ponds, when the pond was filled with rain.</p>
                        <p>Francesco Redi (1626-1697): He is the scientist who first tried to set an experiment to disprove spontaneous generation.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He put the meat in a bottle and covered it with a gauze.</li>
                            <li>He observed that the flies laid eggs from which the maggots developed.</li>
                            <li>He said maggots did not developed from meat but from flies egg.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Theory of Biogenesis states that life comes from pre-existing life.<br>Louis Pasteur (1822-1895 GC) was the scientist who disproved the theory of abiogenesis.</p>
                        <p>He designed a large curved flask (Pasteur goose neck flask) and placed a sterile growth broth medium. Air freely moved through the tube; but dust particles were trapped in the curved portion of flask. Microbial growth in the broth was not seen.</p>
                        <p>Therefore Pasteur proved that micro-organisms entered to substrates through the air and micro-organisms did not evolve spontaneously.</p>

                        <p>The complete establishment of the germ theory of disease depended on the work of a German scientist, Robert Koch (1843-1910).</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Koch's postulates: proof of germ theory of disease</h4>
                        <p>A micro-organism can be accepted as a causative agent of an infectious disease only if the following conditions are satisfied.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The micro-organism should be found in every case of the disease and under conditions which explain the pathological changes and clinical features.</li>
                            <li>It should be possible to isolate the causative agent in pure culture from the lesion.</li>
                            <li>When such pure culture is inoculated into appropriate laboratory animal, the lesion of the disease should be reproduced.</li>
                            <li>It should be possible to reisolate the bacterium in pure culture from the lesion produced in the experimental animal.</li>
                            <li>Now a days additional postulate is mentioned i.e. Specific antibody to the bacterium should be detectable in the serum during the course of the disease.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>It has not been possible to fulfil every one of Koch's postulates, but by adhering to them as closely as possible, serious errors have been prevented.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Exceptions to Koch's postulates</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Many healthy people carry pathogens but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease.</li>
                            <li>Some microbes are very difficult or impossible to grow in vitro(in the laboratory) in artificial media. Eg. Treponema pallidum</li>
                            <li>Many species are species specific. Eg. Brucella abortus cause abortion in animals but no report in humans.</li>
                            <li>Certain diseases develop only when an opportunistic pathogen invades immunocompromised host.</li>

                        <p>TAXONOMY is the science of organisimal classification.<br>Classification is the assignment of organisms (species) into anorganised scheme of naming .idealy these schemes are based on evolutionary relationships (i.e the more similar the name, the closer the evolutionary relationships). Thus, classification is concerned with:-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The establishment of criteria for identifying organisms & assignment to groups (what belongs where)</li>
                            <li>The arrangement of organisms into groups of organism of organism (e.g. At what level of diversity should a single species be split in to two or more species?).</li>
                            <li>Consideration of how evolution resulted in the formation these groups.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TAXON:-</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A group or category of related organisms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Two key characteristics of taxa are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Members of lower level taxa (e.g. Species) are more similar to each other than are members of higher level taxa (eg.Kingdom or domain).</li>
                            <li>Member of specific taxa are more similar to each other than any are to members of different specific taxa found at the same hierarchical level (eg. Humans are more similar to apes, i.e., comparison between species, than either is similar to, for example, Escherichia coli). Thus once you know that two individuals are member of the same taxon, you can inter certain similarities between the two organisms.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NOTE that taxa are dynamic, changing as our knowledge of organism and evolutionary relationships change</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Organisms are named using binomial nomenclature ( viruses are exceptions)</li>
                            <li>Binomial nomenclature employs the names of the two level taxa, genus and species, to name a specie. Binomial nomenclature includes:
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>Genus comes before species (e.g., Escherichia coli)</li>
                                    <li>Genus name is always capitalized (e.g., Escherichia)</li>
                                    <li>Species name is never capitalized (e.g., coli)</li>
                                    <li>Both names are always either italicized or underlined ( e.g Escherichia coli )</li>
                                    <li>The genus name may be used alone, but not the species name (i.e saying or writing "Escherichia" alone is legitimate while saying or writing " coli" is not)</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Strain</h4>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>A strain in some ways is equivalent to a breed or subspecies among plants or animal. Strain is the level below the species</li>
                            <li>Two members of the same strain are more similar to each other than either is to an individual that is a member of a different strain, even if all three organisms are members of the same species</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Bacterial species</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A bacterial species is defined by the similarities found among its members. Properties such as biochemical reactions, chemical composition, cellular structures, genetic characteristics, and immunological features are used in defining a bacterial species. Identifying a species and determining its limits presents the most challenging aspects of biological classification for any type of organism.</li>
                            <li>A formal means of distinguishing bacterial species is by employing a dichotomous key to guide the selection of test used to efficiently determine those bacterial properties most relevant to bacterial identification</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Archaeobacteria</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Are distinctive in their adaptation to extreme environments (e.g., very hot, salty, or acidic) though not all archaeobacteria live in extreme environments.</p>
                        <p>These distinctions are more phenotypic than they are evolutionary (i.e., a cyanobacteria is a eubacteria, and neither is an archaebacteria).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Kingdom Protista</h4>
                        <p>Protista like Monera consist mostly of unicellular organisms. Distinctively, however, the members of Kingdom Protista are all eukaryotic while the mebers of kingdom Monera are all prokaryotic. Some members of protista are multicellular, however Kingdom protista represents a grab bag, essentially the place where the species are classified when they are not classified as either fungi, animals or plants.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Kingdom Fungi</h4>
                        <p>Unlike pprotists, the eukaryotic fungi are typically non - aquatic species. They traditionally are nutrients absorbers plus have additional distinctive features. They do exist unicellular fungi, which we call yeast</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">DOMAIN</h4>
                        <p>The domain is a taxanomic category that, depending on point of view, is either above the level of kingdom or supercedes the kingdom. The domain system contains three members</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Eukaryotes ( domain Eukarya )</li>
                            <li>Eubacteria ( domain Bacteria)</li>
                            <li>Archaebacteria ( domain Archaea)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Viral classification</h4>
                        <p>Classification of viruses is not nearly as well developed as the classification of cellular organisms. Today viruses tend to be classified by their chemical, morphological and physiological attributes (e.g. genome = DNA vs RNA, virion particle = enveloped vs non enveloped and myriad details of their intracellular infection cycles). Binomial nomenclature is not employed to name viruses; instead viruses are named by their common names (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus a.k.a HIV)</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Dichotomous key</h4>
                        <p>A means of assigning an organism to a specific taxonomic category typically involves the use of specific criteria that may posed as questions ( e.g. What does the organism look like etc. ). Relevant criteria may be arranged as a dichotomous key. In a dichotomous key questions are arranges hierarchically with more general questions are asked first, with questions becoming more specific asked subsequently</p>

                        <p>The eukaryotic cell has a true membrane bound nucleus, usually containing multiple chromosomes, a mitotic apparatus, a well defined endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Cocci (singular coccus): Round or oval bacteria measuring about $0.5-1.0 \mu \mathrm{mb}$ in diameter.They are found insingle, pairs, chains or clusters.</li>

                        <p>Bacterial staining is the process of coloring of colorless bacterial structural components using stains (dyes). The principle of staining is to identify microorganisms selectively by using dyes, fluorescence and radioisotope emission.</p>
                        <p>Staining reactions are made possible because of the physical phenomena of capillary osmosis, solubility, adsorption, and absorption of stains or dyes by cells of microorganisms.</p>
                        <p>Individual variation in the cell wall constituents among different groups of bacteria will consequently produce variations in colors during microscopic examination.</p>
                        <p>Nucleus is acidic in character and hence, it has greater affinity for basic dyes. Whereas, cytoplasm is basic in character and has greater affinity for acidic dyes.<br>There are many types of affinity explaining this attraction force:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>hydrophobic bonding</li>
                            <li>reagent-cell interaction</li>
                            <li>reagent-reagent interaction</li>
                            <li>ionic bonding</li>
                            <li>hydrogen bonding</li>
                            <li>covalent bonding</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Why are stains not taken up by every microorganism?<br>Factors controlling selectivity of microbial cells are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>number and affinity of binding sites</li>
                            <li>rate of reagent uptake</li>
                            <li>rate of reaction</li>
                            <li>rate of reagent loss (differentiation or regressive staining)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Properties of dyes</h4>
                        <p>Why dyes color microbial cells?<br>Because dyes absorb radiation energy in visible region of electromagnetic spectrum i.e., "light"(wave length 400-650). And absorption is anything outside this range it is colorless. E.g., acid fuschin absorbs blue green and transmit red.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">General methods of staining</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Direct staining
                                <p>Is the process by which microorganisms are stained with simple dyes. E.g., methylene blue</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Indirect staining - is the process which needs mordants.
                                <p>A mordant is the substance which, when taken up by the microbial cells helps make dye in return, serving as a link or bridge to make the staining recline possible.</p>
                                <p>It combines with a dye to form a colored "lake", which in turn combines with the microbial cell to form a " cell-mordant-dyecomplex"</p>
                                <p>It is an integral part of the staining reaction itself, without which no staining could possibly occur. E.g., iodine.</p>
                                <p>A mordant may be applied before the stain or it may be included as part of the staining technique, or it may be added to the dye solution itself.</p>
                                <p>An accentuator, on the other hand is not essential to the chemical union of the microbial cells and the dye. It does not participate in the staining reaction, but merely accelerate or hasten the speed of the staining reaction by increasing the staining power and selectivity of the dye.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Progressive staining</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>is the process whereby microbial cells are stained in a definite sequence, in order that a satisfactory differential coloration of the cell may be achieved at the end of the correct time with the staining solution.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Regressive staining</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>with this technique, the microbial cell is first over stained to obliteratethe cellulare desires, and the excess stain is removed or decolorized from unwanted part.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Differentiation (decolorization)</h4>
                        <p>is the selective removal of excess stain from the tissue from microbial cells during regressive staining in order that a specific substance may be stained differentiallyh from the surrounding cell.<br>Differentiation is usually controlled visually by examination under the microscope</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Uses</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>To observe the morphology, size, and arrangement of bacteria.</li>
                            <li>To differentiate one group of bacteria from the other group.</li>

                            <li><strong>Basic /Simple / All purpose media</strong>
                                <p>It is a media that supports the growth of micro-organisms that do not require special nutrients. Uses:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>To prepare enriched media</li>
                                    <li>To maintain stock cultures of control bacterial strains</li>
                                    <li>To subcuture pathogenic bacteria from selective/differential medium prior to performing biochemical or serological tests.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Eg. Nutrient Broth<br>Nutrient Agar</p>

                                <p>Media that are enriched with whole blood, lyzed blood, serum, special extracts or vitamins to support the growth of pathogenic bacteria.</p>
                                <p>Eg. Blood Agar<br>Chocolate Agar</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Enrichment media</strong>
                                <p>Fluid media that increases the numbers of a pathogen by containing enrichments and/or substances that discourage the multiplication of unwanted bacteria.</p>
                                <p>Eg. Selenite F broth media<br>Alkaline peptone water</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Selective media</strong>
                                <p>Media which contain substances ( Eg. Antibiotics) that prevent or slow down the growth of bacteria other than pathogens for which the media are intended.</p>
                                <p>Eg. Modified Thayer -Martin Agar<br>Salmonella-Shigella( SS) agar</p>

                        <p>Always sterilize a medium at the correct temperature and for the correct length of time as instructed in the method of preparation. Methods used to sterilize culture media</p>
                        <ol type="A">
                            <li>Autoclaving</li>
                            <li>Steaming to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</li>
                            <li>Filtration</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>A) Autoclaving</strong></p>
                        <p>Autoclaving is used to sterilize most agar and fluid culture media.</p>
                        <p><strong>B) Steaming at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$</strong></p>
                        <p>It is used to sterilize media containing ingredients that would be inactivated at temperature over $100 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and re-melt previously bottled sterile agar media.</p>
                        <p><strong>C) Filtration</strong></p>
                        <p>It is used to sterilize additives that are heat-sensitive and can not be autoclaved.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sterility testing</strong></p>
                        <p>The simplest way to test for contamination is to incubate the prepared sample media<br>At $35-37 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 24 hours. Turbidity in fluid media and microbial growth in solid media confirm contamination.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic;">3. Addition of heat-sensitive ingredients</h5>
                        <p>Refrigerated-heat sensitive ingredients should be warmed at room temperature before added to a molten agar medium.</p>
                        <p>Using an aseptic technique, the ingredients should be added when the medium has cooled to $50 { }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and should be distributed immediately unless further heating is required.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic;">4. pH testing</h5>
                        <p>The pH of most culture media is near neutral, and can be tested using pH papers or pH meter.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic;">5. Dispensing of culture media</h5>
                        <p>Media should be dispensed in a clean draught-free room using aseptic technique and sterile container.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dispensing agar media in petridish</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lay out the sterile petridishes on a level surface.</li>
                            <li>Mix the medium gently by rotating the flask or bottle.</li>
                            <li>Flame sterilize the neck of flask or bottle.</li>
                            <li>Pour 15 ml of medium in each petridish.</li>
                            <li>Stack the plates after the medium has gelled or cooled.</li>

                        <p>Bacteria, like all cells, require nutrients for the maintenance of their metabolism and for cell division.</p>
                        <p>Bacterial structural components and the macromolecules for the metabolism are synthesized from the elements. The four, most important elements of bacteria are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.</p>

                        <p>The most common method of estimating bacterial growth which involves counting the number of bacterial colonies grown on solid media after incubation of the inoculated media for 18-24 hours.</p>
                        <p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The sample is serially diluted.</li>
                            <li>The suspension is inoculated on solid media by surface spread technique i.e. the suspension is spread</li>
                            <li>The plate is incubated for $18-24 \mathrm{hrs}$ to allow the bacteria to grow and form colonies.</li>
                            <li>The concentration of bacteria in the original sample can be determined by counting the visible colonies multiplied by the dilution factor.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Number of colonies = Number of colonies X dilution factor</strong></p>

                        <p>NB: The statistically significant plate count is between 30 and 300 colonies.</p>
                        <p>Less than 30 colonies on a plate are not accepted for statistical reasons.</p>
                        <p>Greater than 300 colonies on a plate are too close to distinguish as an individual colony forming unit (too numerous to count).</p>
                        <p>Limitation of viable plate count: It selectively in favor of a certain group of bacterial population.</p>

                        <p>Out side the tolerance range environmental conditions for a bacteria to reproduce, it may survive in dormant state or may lose viability. Rates of bacterial growth are greatly influenced by the following environmental parameters.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic;">1. Nutrition</h5>
                        <p>The following nutrients must be provided for optimal bacterial growth.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hydrogen donors and acceptors</li>

                            <li>Nitrogen source</li>
                            <li>Minerals: sulfur and phosphorus, trace elements</li>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading" style="font-weight:normal; font-style:italic;">2. Temperature</h5>
                        <p>Temperature tolerance range: The minimum and maximum temperature at which a micro-organism can grow; which is different in different species of bacteria.<br>Optimal growth range of temperature: The temperature at which the maximum growth rate occurs; and results in the shortest generation time of bacteria.</p>
                        <p>Based on different optimal growth temperature requirement, bacteria are divided into:</p>
                        <p><strong>Optimal growth temperature</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Psychrophilic bacteria: $15-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; grow best at low T<sup>0</sup> range</li>
                            <li>Mesophilic bacteria: $30-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; grow best at middle T<sup>0</sup> range</li>
                            <li>Thermophilic bacteria: $50-60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; grow best at high T<sup>0</sup> range</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB: Most human pathogens and many of the normal flora of human bodies have an optimal temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$; There fore they are mesophilic bacteria.</p>

                        <p>Base on oxygen requirements and tolerance, bacteria are divided classified as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Obligate aerobes</li>

                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Obligate aerobic bacteria grow only when free oxygen is available to support their respiratory metabolism.
                                <p>They obtain ATP by using oxygen as a final electron acceptor in respiration.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Obligate anaerobic bacteria grow in the absence of oxygen; exposure to oxygen kills anaerobes.</li>
                            <li>Facultative anaerobic bacteria grow in the presence or absence of oxygen.
                                <p>They obtain ATP by fermentation or anaerobic respiration</p>

                        <p>Salt content of the medium affects bacterial growth.<br>Halophilic bacteria grow best at high salt concentration.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moderate halophiles require $3 \%$ salt concentration.</li>
                            <li>Extreme halophiles require $15 \%$ salt concentration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most bacteia can not tolerate high salt concentration. High salt concentration disrupts membrane transport systems and denatures proteins of bacteria but halophiles have adaptive mechanisms to tolerate high salt concentration.</p>

                        <p>Osmotic pressure: The pressure exerted on bacterial cell surface as a result of difference in solute concentration between the inside and out side of a cell.</p>
                        <p>Osmotolerant bacteria can grow in solutions with high solute concentration.</p>
                        <p>Osmophilic bacteria grow best at high hydrostatic pressure.<br>Hydrostatic pressure: The pressure exerted by the weight of a water column.</p>
                        <p>High hydrostatic pressures more than 200 atmosphere generally inactivates enzymes and disrupts membrane transport process.</p>

                        <p>This helps to differentate S.pneumoniae, which is soluble in bile and bile salts, from viridans streptococci which are insoluble.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle</strong></p>
                        <p>A heavy inoculum of the test organism is emulsified in physiological saline to give a turbid suspension. The bile salt sodium deoxycholate is then added. The test can also be performed by adding the bile salt to a broth culture of the organism. The bile salt dissoles S.pneumoniae as shown by a clearing of the turbidity within 10-15 minutes. Viridans streptococci are not dissolved and therefore there is no clearing of the turbidity.</p>

                        <p>This test is used to differentiate those bacteria that produce the enzyme catalase, such as staphylococci, from non-catalase producing bacteria such as streptococci.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle</strong></p>
                        <p>Catalase acts as a catalyst in the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water.</p>
                        <p>An organism is tested for catalase production by bringing it into contact with hydrogen peroxide. Bubbles of oxygen are released if the organism is a catalase producer. The culture should not be more than 24 hours old.</p>
                        <p>Care must be taken if testing an organism cultured on a medium containing blood because catalase is present in red cells. If any of the blood agar is removed with the colony, a false positive reaction will occur. It is usually recommended, therefore, that catalase testing be performed from a blood free culture medium such as nutrient agar</p>

                        <p>Note: if the organism has been cultured on an agar slope, pour about 1 ml of the hydrogen peroxide solution over a good growth of the organism, and look for the release of bubbles.</p>
                        <p>Caution: performing the test on a slide is not recommended because of the risk of contamination from active bubbling. If the rapid slide technique is used, the hydrogen peroxide solution should be added to the organism suspension after placing the slide in a petridish.

                        <p>This test is one of several techniques used to assist in the identification of enterobacteria. The test is based on the ability of an organism to use citrate as its only source of carbon and ammonia as its only source of nitrogen.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle</strong></p>
                        <p>The test organism is cultured in a medium which contains sodium citrate, an ammonium salt, and the indicator bromo - thymol blue. Growth in the medium is shown by turbidity and a change in colour of the indicator from light green to blue, due to the alkaline reaction, following citrate utilization.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Method</strong></p>
                        <p>Using a sterile straight wire, inoculate $3-4 \mathrm{ml}$ of sterile Koser's citrate medium with a broth culture of the test organism.</p>
                        <p>Note: Care must be taken not to contaminate the medium with carbon particles, such as from a frequently flamed wire.</p>
                        <p>Incubate the inoculated broth at $35-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 4 days, checking daily for growth.</p>

Free coagulase is detected by the appearance of a fibrin clot in the tube test. Bound coagulase (clumping factor) which converts fibrinogen directlyto fibrin without requiring a coagulase - reacting factor. It can be detected by the clumping of bacterial cells in the rapid slide test. It is usually recommended that a tube test should be performed on all negative slide tests. A tube test must always be performed if the result of the slide test is not clear, or when the slide test is negative and the Staphylococcus has been isolated from a serious infection.</p>

                        <p>Testing for indole production is important in the identification of enterobacteria. Most sftrains of E.coli, P.vulgaris, P.rettgeri, M.morganll, and providencia species break down the amino acid tryptophan with the release of indole.</p>

                        <p>The test organism is cultured in a medium which contains tryptophan. Indole production is detected by Kovac's or Ehrlich's reagent which contains 4(P)-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. This reacts with the indole to produce a red coloured compound. In the following method the use of the combined motility indole urea (MIU) medium is described. A Kovac's ragent paper strip is inserted in the neck of the tube, and indole production is indicated by a reddening of the strip. Indole is a volatile substance (easily vaporized). The tube must be well stoppered during incubation.</p>
                        <p>The indole test can also be performed by culturing the organism in tryptone water or peptone water containing tryptophan, and detecting indole production by adding Kovac's or Ehrlich's reagent to an 18-24h culture.</p>

                        <p>A heavy inoculum of the test organism is incubated in a broth containing nitrate. After 4 hours, the broth is tested fro the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by adding sulphanilic acid reagent. If nitrite is present, the acid reagent is diazotizex and forms a pink-red compound with alpha-naphthylamine. When nitrite is not detected it is necessary to test whether the organism has reduced the nitrate beyond nitrite. This is done indirectly by checking whether the broth still contains nitrate. Zinc dust is added which will convert any nitrate to nitrate. If no nitrite is detected when the zinc dust is added, it can be assumed that all the nitrate has been reduced beyond nitrite to nitrogen gas or ammonia by a nitrate reducing organism.</p>

                        <p>The oxidase test is used to assist in the identification of pseudomonas, Neisseria, Vibrio, and Pasteurella species, all of which produce oxidase enzymes.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle</strong></p>
                        <p>A piece of filter paper is soaked with a few drops of oxidase reagent. A colony of the test organism is then smeared on the filter paper. If the organism is oxidase - producing, the phenylenediamine in the reagent will be oxidized to a deep purple colour. Occasionally the test is performed by flooding the culture plate with oxidase reagent but this technique is not recommended for routine use because the reagent rapidly kills bacteria. It can be useful, however, when attempting to isolate N.gonorrhoeae colonies from mixed cultures in the absence of a selective medium. The oxidase positive colonies must be removed and subcultured within 30 seconds of flooding the plate.</p>
                        <p>Important: Acidity inhibits oxidase enzyme activity. The oxidase test must not be performed, therefore, on colonies that produce fermentation on carbohydrate - containing media, such as sucrose fermenting V.cholerae colonies on TCBS medium, Subinoculation on nutrient agar is required before the oxidase test can be performed reliably. Non - fermenting colonies, however, can be tested. Colonies tested from a medium that contains nitrate may give unreliable oxidase test results.</p>

                        <p>This test is occationally used to assist in the differentiation of enterobacteria. K.pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae blovar el tor, and some strains of Enterobacter, ferment glucose with the production of acetylmethylcarbinol (acetoin) which can be detected by an oxidation reaction.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle</strong></p>
                        <p>The test organism is cultured in a glucose phosphate peptone water for 48 hours. Sodium hydroxide and a small amount of creatine are then added. Under alkaline conditions and exposure to the air, the acation produced from the fermentation of the glucose is oxidized to diacetyl which forms a pink compound with the creatine.</p>

                        <p>Phenol coefficient is the ratio of the concentration of the new chemical agent being tested to the concentration of the reference standard (phenol) required to kill in a specific time.</p>
                        <p>If phenol coefficient is less than one, the new chemical agent is less effective than phenol.</p>
                        <p>If phenol coefficient is equal to one, the new chemical agent is equal to phenol in efficacy.</p>
                        <p>If phenol coefficient is more than one, the new chemical agent is more effective than phenol.</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat: the most reliable and universally applicable method of sterilization.
                                <p>Mechanism of action<br>Dry heat - denatures protein.<br>Moist heat - denatures and coagulates protein.</p>
                                <p><strong>1.1. Dry heat:</strong> It is less efficient and requires high temperature and long period heating than moist heat.<br>Dry heat can be used by the following methods:</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Incineration: It is an efficient method of sterilization and disposal of contaminated needles, syringes and cover slips at high temperature</li>
                                    <li>Red heat: Inoculating wires, loops and points of forceps are sterilized by holding them in the flame of a Bunsen burner until they are red hot.</li>
                                    <li>Flaming: Scalpels and neck of flasks, bottles and tubes are exposed for a few seconds, but it is of uncertain efficacy.</li>
                                    <li>Hot Air Sterilizer (Oven): it is essential that hot air should circulate between the objects being sterilized and these must be loosely packed and adequate air space to ensure optimum heat transfer.
                                        <p>It is done by applying $160^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 1 hour.<br>Use: Sterilizes glassware, oils, greases, lubricants and powders.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><strong>1.2. Moist heat:</strong> It is preferred to dry heat due to more rapid killing.</p>
                                <p>Moist heat can be used by the following methods.</p>
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Boiling: It is not reliable method of sterilization. It is done by applying $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes.
                                        <p>Used for sterilizing catheters, dressing and fabrics.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Tyndallization : Intermittent steaming (Fractional sterilization)
                                        <p>Steaming of the material is done at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes on three consecutive days.</p>
                                        <p>The principle is that spores which survived the heating process would germinate before the next thermal exposure and then would be killed. It is used for sterilizing heat sensitive culture media containing materials such as carbohydrates, egg or serum.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Pasteurization: It is the process of application of heat at temperature of $62^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 minutes(Holder method) or $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 15 seconds (Flash method) followed by rapid cooling to discourage bacterial growth.
                                        <p>Uses:</p>
                                        <ul>

                        <p>Anti-microbine activity is measured in vitro in order to determine:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the potency of an anti-microbial agent</li>
                            <li>concentration of anti-microbial agent in body tissues or fluids</li>
                            <li>the sensitivity of a given micro-organism to known concentrations of the drug</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Measurement of anti-microbial activity</strong><br>Techniques</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a diffusion technique</li>
                            <li>a dilution technique</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Diffusion Sensitivity Tests</strong><br>It is the routinely used sensitivity test by most microbiology laboratories.</p>
                        <p>A filter paper disk containing measured quantities of drug is placed on a solid medium that has been seeded with the test organisms. The drug diffuses from the disk into the medium. Following over right incubation, the diameter of the clear zone of inhibition surrounding the deposit of drug is taken as a measure of the inhibitory power of the drug against the particular test organism.</p>
                        <p>Bacterial strains sensitive to the drug are inhibited at a distance from the disk whereas resistant strains grow up to the edge of the disk.</p>
                        <p>In the kirby-Bauer technique, the zone of inhibition is measured and compared to a prepared scale, which correlates the zone of inhibition size with the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC).</p>
                        <p>NB: Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that is required to inhibit in vitro bacterial multiplication under specified conditions.</p>
                        <p>Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the least concentration of the anti-microbial required producing a sterile culture.</p>
                        <p><strong>Dilution Sensitivity Tests</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Agar dilution tests</li>
                            <li>Broth dilution tests</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Graded amounts of antimcorbial agents are incorporated into liquid or solid bacteriology media. The media are subsequently inoculated with test bacteria and incubated.</p>
                        <p>The end point is taken as that amount of antimicobial agent required to inhibit the growth of the test bacteria (MIC) or to kill the test bacteria (MBC).<br>Nowadays the above tests are either time consuming or cumbersome, so the advent of microdilution both solution tests has simplified the method and permit a quantitative result to be reported, indicating the amount of a given drug necessary to inhibit or kill the test micro-organism.</p>

                            <li>Size of inoculum: the larger the bacterial inoculum, the lower the apparent sensitivity of the organisms.</li>
                            <li>Length of incubation: short exposure of moisture to the drug inhibits their growth but does not kill them; longer exposure of moisture to a drug gives a chance for resistant motants to emerge.</li>
                            <li>Metabolic activity of moistures actively and rapidly growing micro-organisms are more susceptible to drug action than those in the resting phase.</li>

                        <p>For pathogens requiring enriched media like Neisseria gonorrhea, Heamophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, it is necessary to add blood to (heat it if needed) sensitivity testing agar.</p>
                        <p>Turbidity (Opacity) standard: This is a barium chloride standard against which the turbidity of the test inocula can be compared. The turbidity of the standard is equivalent to the turbidity of subcultured broth test micro-organism.</p>

                        <p>NB: each disc should be pressed down on the medium and should not be moved once in place.</p>
