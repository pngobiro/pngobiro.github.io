                            <li><strong>1840s</strong> - Operate on a client who was free from pain. It was a revolution for surgery.</li>
                            <li>Development of safer anaesthetic gases allowed surgeons to conduct longer operative procedures.</li>
                            <li>All the surgery was conducted in hospital setting and nurses required special training for new responsibilities such as assisting, preparing, caring for a patient in surgical unit.</li>
                            <li><strong>1876s</strong>- In Massachusetts, general hospital provided the first operating room education for nurse's.</li>
                            <li>The trend continued to <strong>1900s</strong> as nursing schools included operating room experience in each nurses clinical instruction.</li>
                            <li><strong>1956</strong>- The association of operating room nurses was formed to gain knowledge of surgical principles and explore methods to improve nursing care of surgical clients.</li>
                            <li>The associations of operating room nurses overcame the idea that operating room nurses were only technically skilled practitioners.</li>
                            <li>This organization also developed standard of nursing practice to establish the need for registered nurses in the operating room</li>
                            <li><strong>1970s</strong>-A change occurred in nursing education with a focus on the importance of nurses acquiring a broad knowledge base, resulted in less emphasis on operating room techniques.</li>
                            <li>There has also been a new development in the setting for operative procedures:</li>
                            <li><strong>Ambulatory surgery</strong>: It was also referred to as outpatient.</li>
                            <li><strong>One-day surgery</strong>: This health care service is presently growing rapidly in numbers and various types of procedures such as invasive non invasive procedures are performed.</li>
                            <li>Ambulatory surgery is a scheduled surgical procedure provided for a client who does not remain overnight in a hospital, e.g. biopsies, cosmetic surgery, cataract extractions.</li>
                            <li><strong>God's powers</strong>: faith praying to God to heal the illness.</li>
                            <li>The above was common in Egypt, India, China, Greece and Africa</li>
                            <li><strong>460 BC</strong> a physician in Greece invented hypocrates oath for physicians which is still relevant in use today and is considered the father of modern medicine.</li>
