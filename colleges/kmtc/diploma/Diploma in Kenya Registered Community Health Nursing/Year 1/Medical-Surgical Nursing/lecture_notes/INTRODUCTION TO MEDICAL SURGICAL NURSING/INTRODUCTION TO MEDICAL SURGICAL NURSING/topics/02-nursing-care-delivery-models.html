                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The functional nursing method is a decades-old, traditional form of patient care.</p>
                        <p>The model relies on a hierarchy of nurses who perform different tasks depending upon their level of education, training and experience.</p>
                        <p>The team leader, a registered nurse (RN), collaborates with physicians to determine the needs of a patient.</p>
                        <p>The head nurse then delegates tasks to nurses under her supervision. For example, she might assign another registered nurse to administer treatments, while a licensed practical nurse (LPN) monitors blood pressure and a nurse's aide assists the patient with an exercise regime.</p>
                        <p>Functional nursing applies an assembly-line method of patient care, which can offer economic advantages for the hospital because it maximizes each team member's skill set.</p>
                        <p>This nursing model works well in periods of high demand, such as wartime or during epidemics.</p>
                        <p>However, functional nursing does not provide the holistic care that many patients need, because the nurses focus on their individual tasks rather than the overall condition or progress of the patient.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Developed in the 1950s, the team nursing model is similar to the functional nursing method, but provides care on a larger scale.</p>
                        <p>The team nursing model assigns an RN as the group leader who delegates tasks to a team of medical professionals who care for multiple patients.</p>
                        <p>Teams contain at least two nurses, typically with different experience, education and skill levels.</p>
                        <p>An RN team member might dispense medications, while an LPN monitors patient blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>The team might also include a nurse's aide, who carries out tasks such as bathing and dressing the same group of patients. Inexperienced nurses appreciate the opportunity to work with and learn from their experienced colleagues.</p>
                        <p>Experienced nurses report that they feel more supported in their duties under a team nursing model.</p>
                        <p>The team nursing approach also benefits medical facilities by enabling inexperienced nurses to learn more quickly, giving them increased value as employee assets.</p>
                        <p>The method also promotes and improves communication among team members, which can result in improved patient care.</p>
                        <p>Team nursing relies on team leader RNs with good management and leadership skills.</p>
                        <p>Patient needs can impact the success of the team nursing method.</p>
                        <p>Designed to provide care for numerous patients, the team nursing model does not offer appropriate coverage for patients who need constant care and attention.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>The primary nursing model assigns patients to a primary RN, who takes responsibility for their care throughout the hospital stay.</p>
                        <p>By following a patient’s progress, the RN can provide a more holistic level of care, while offering the patient the comfort of having a primary caregiver among the nursing staff.</p>
                        <p>The primary nursing method developed in the 1970s and quickly gained popularity.</p>
                        <p>It addressed the shortcomings of older models such as functional and team nursing, which left gaps in patient care because of task-oriented approaches.</p>
                        <p>Primary nursing has proven particularly successful in meeting the needs of patients with complex medical conditions.</p>
                        <p>For example, a patient with diabetes might have heart problems, tissue damage and dietary restrictions, which require the type of comprehensive care a primary nurse can provide.</p>
                        <p>Patients respond well to the primary nursing model, because it provides them with a knowledgeable medical contact and a sense of continuous care.</p>
                        <p>Nurses appreciate the feeling of autonomy primary nursing offers, while enabling them to provide patients with a high level of care.</p>
                        <p>Flexible work schedules, which allow nurses to work three consecutive days of 12-hour shifts, followed by four days off, create a disadvantage to the primary nursing model, particularly for patients who require long-term hospitals stays.</p>
                        <p>The primary nursing model has remained relatively unchanged since its conception.</p>
                        <p>Most studies indicate that it provides a higher level of job satisfaction for nurses and is popular among patients.</p>

                        <p>Total patient care is the grandfather of nursing models.</p>
                        <p>It requires a patient to receive all nursing care from one nurse.</p>
                        <p>In today's medical industry, total patient care can only be applied in certain types of situations, including critical care and home health care.</p>
                        <p>In the total patient care model, the attending nurse typically provides care for the patient from the beginning to the end of his medical care episode.</p>
                        <p>For example, a nurse might provide a few weeks of around-the-clock, in-home care for an elderly patient who has broken a hip.</p>
                        <p>The patient might deal with more than one nurse due to work schedules, but he does not receive care from multiple nurses during a work shift.</p>
                        <p>Total patient care requires nurses to assume all care for their patients.</p>
                        <p>They closely monitor the patient's condition and communicate closely with the patient's physicians.</p>
                        <p>Patients respond favorably to total patient care, because their nurses attend quickly to their needs.</p>
                        <p>Patient and nurse develop a friendship, which makes the experience less stressful and more meaningful for the patient.</p>
                        <p>In home health care settings, a patient might face a disadvantage if he needs medical care the nurse cannot readily provide.</p>
                        <p>For example, if an in-home patient suddenly develops a breathing problem, the nurse cannot quickly summon a respiratory therapist.</p>
                        <p>Nurses enjoy autonomy that total patient care offers them thou focusing effort on one patient can lead to burnout.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Case management focuses on the administrative issues of health care, rather than the actual delivery of health care.</p>
                        <p>An RN case manager evaluates a patient's care to determine her healthcare costs and the likelihood that the insurer will provide coverage.</p>
                        <p>Case managers follow the progression of a patient's care to determine the likely discharge date and her care needs after discharge.</p>
                        <p>The case management model stems from the complexity of third party health-care payers and the rising costs of health care.</p>
                        <p>A case manager serves as an intermediary between the patient and third party payers, which may include insurance companies and Medicare.</p>
                        <p>They also ensure that third party payers will reimburse the health-care facilities for services.</p>
                        <p>Case managers often deal with 12 to 28 patients per day.</p>
                        <p>In the past, they reviewed patient charts and communicated with third party payers every three to seven days.</p>
                        <p>But in today’s digital age, case managers communicate daily with attending doctors, nurses and third party payers.</p>
                        <p>Effective case management benefits everyone involved.</p>
                        <p>The case manager communicates with the patient to inform her about approvals or denials from her healthcare provider.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, the case manager can help prevent health-care facilities from losing money because of unexpected coverage denials.</p>
                        <p>Case managers must stay abreast of every aspect of the patient's care, from diagnostic tests to surgery schedules and from outpatient therapies to home health-care requirements. For example, a case manager must keep track of the number of days a patient's insurance company will pay for inpatient care.</p>
                        <p>If a patient experiences a discharge delay due to a rescheduled surgery, the case manager must communicate with the third party payer and coordinate new surgery and discharge dates with healthcare staff.</p>
                        <p>A case manager must work closely with the patients to assess the effectiveness of treatments and help devise self-care plans for after discharge.</p>
