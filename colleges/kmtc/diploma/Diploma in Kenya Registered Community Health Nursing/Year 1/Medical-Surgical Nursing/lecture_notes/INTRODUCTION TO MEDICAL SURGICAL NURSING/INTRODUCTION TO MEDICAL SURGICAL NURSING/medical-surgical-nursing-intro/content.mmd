\section*{NURSING CARE MODALITIES}
$\square$ Functional Nursing Model
- The functional nursing method is a decades-old, traditional form of patient care.
- The model relies on a hierarchy of nurses who perform different tasks depending upon their level of education, training and experience.

\section*{CONT'}
- The team leader, a registered nurse (RN), collaborates with physicians to determine the needs of a patient.
- The head nurse then delegates tasks to nurses under her supervision. For example, she might assign another registered nurse to administer treatments, while a licensed practical nurse (LPN) monitors blood pressure and a nurse's aide assists the patient with an exercise regime.

\section*{CONT'}
- Functional nursing applies an assembly-line method of patient care, which can offer economic advantages for the hospital because it maximizes each team member's skill set.
- This nursing model works well in periods of high demand, such as wartime or during epidemics.
- However, functional nursing does not provide the holistic care that many patients need, because the nurses focus on their individual tasks rather than the overall condition or progress of the patient.

\section*{2. Team Nursing Model}
- Developed in the 1950s,
