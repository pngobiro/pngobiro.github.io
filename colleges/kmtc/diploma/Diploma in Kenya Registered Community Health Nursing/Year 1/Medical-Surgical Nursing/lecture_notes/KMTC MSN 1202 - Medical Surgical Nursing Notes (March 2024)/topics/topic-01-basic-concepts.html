                            <p>Illness refers to the subjective experience of symptoms and suffering, as perceived by the individual. It encompasses how a person feels and how they interpret their health status. Unlike disease, which is an objective pathological condition, illness is the personal experience of the impact of disease.</p>

                            <h3>Disease:</h3>
                            <p>Disease refers to a pathological condition of a bodily part, an organism, or system resulting from various causes, such as infection, genetic defect, or environmental factors, and characterized by an identifiable group of signs or symptoms. It is often diagnosed by medical professionals based on clinical and laboratory findings.</p>

                            <p><strong>Inflammation:</strong> A complex biological response of tissues to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. It is a protective mechanism intended to remove the harmful stimuli and initiate the healing process. Inflammation can be classified into acute and chronic types.</p>
