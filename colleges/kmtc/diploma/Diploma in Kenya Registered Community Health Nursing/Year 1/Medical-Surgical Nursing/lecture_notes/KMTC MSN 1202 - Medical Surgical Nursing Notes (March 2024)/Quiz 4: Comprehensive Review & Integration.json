      "partialCredit": true,
      "explanation": "In the Compensatory Stage, the body releases adrenaline to maintain perfusion. This causes Tachycardia and Vasoconstriction (Cool skin), often maintaining a Normal BP. Hypotension and Coma occur in Progressive/Refractory stages.",
      "hint": "The body is 'compensating' to keep the BP normal, usually by beating faster."

      "explanation": "Secondary intention involves filling a large gap with granulation tissue, which leads to greater collagen deposition and a higher risk of extensive scarring or keloids.",
