                        <p>The health care industry, like other industries in U.S. society, has experienced profound changes during the past several decades. Nursing, as a health care profession and a major component of the health care delivery system, is significantly affected by shifts in the health care industry. In addition, nursing has been and will continue to be an important force in shaping the future of the health care system.</p>

                        <p>Although the delivery of nursing care has been affected by changes occurring in the health care system, the definition of nursing has continued to distinguish nursing care and identify the major aspects of nursing care.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">NURSING DEFINED</h3>
                        <p>Since the time of Florence Nightingale, who wrote in 1858 that the goal of nursing was "to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him," nursing leaders have described nursing as both an art and a science. However, the definition of nursing has evolved over time. The American Nurses Association (ANA), in its Social Policy Statement (ANA, 1995), defined nursing as "the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to health and illness" and provided the following illustrative list of phenomena that are the focus for nursing care and research:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Self-care processes</li>
                            <li>Physiologic and pathophysiologic processes in areas such as rest, sleep, respiration, circulation, reproduction, activity, nutrition, elimination, skin, sexuality, and communication</li>
                            <li>Comfort, pain, and discomfort</li>
                            <li>Emotions related to experiences of health and illness</li>
                            <li>Meanings ascribed to health and illnesses</li>
                            <li>Decision making and ability to make choices</li>
                            <li>Perceptual orientations such as self-image and control over one's body and environments</li>
                            <li>Transitions across the life span, such as birth, growth, development, and death</li>
                            <li>Affiliative relationships, including freedom from oppression and abuse</li>
                            <li>Environmental systems</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Nurses have a responsibility to carry out their role as defined in the Social Policy Statement, to comply with the nurse practice act of the state where they practice, and to comply with the code for nurses as spelled out by the International Council of Nurses and the ANA. Understanding the needs of health care consumers and the health care delivery system, including the forces that affect nursing and health care delivery, will provide a foundation for examining the delivery of nursing care.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">THE PATIENT/CLIENT: CONSUMER OF NURSING AND HEALTH CARE</h3>
                        <p>The central figure in health care services is, of course, the patient. The term patient, which is derived from a Latin verb meaning "to suffer," has traditionally been used to describe those who are recipients of care. The connotation commonly attached to the word is one of dependence. For this reason, many nurses prefer to use the term client, which is derived from a Latin verb meaning "to lean," connoting alliance and interdependence. For the purposes of this book, the term patient will be used throughout, but with the understanding that either term is acceptable.</p>
                        <p>The patient who seeks care for a health problem or problems (increasing numbers of people have multiple health problems) is also an individual, a member of a family, and a citizen of the community. Patients' needs vary depending on their problem, associated circumstances, and past experiences. One of the nurse's important functions in health care delivery is to identify the patient's immediate needs and take measures to address them.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">The Patient's Basic Needs</h4>
                        <p>Certain needs are basic to all people and require satisfaction accordingly. Such needs are addressed on the basis of priority, meaning that some needs are more pressing than others. Once an essential need is met, the person experiences a need on a higher level. Approaching needs according to priority reflects Maslow's hierarchy of needs (Fig. 1-1).</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">Maslow's Hierarchy</h4>
                        <p>Maslow ranked human needs as follows: physiologic needs; safety and security; belongingness and affection; esteem and self-respect; and self-actualization, which includes self-fulfillment, desire to know and understand, and aesthetic needs. Lower-level needs always remain, but a person's ability to pursue higher-level needs indicates that he or she is moving toward psychological health and well-being. Such a hierarchy of needs is a useful organizational framework that can be applied to the various nursing models for assessment of a patient's strengths, limitations, and need for nursing interventions.</p>
