                        <p>In today's health care arena, the nurse is faced with increasingly complex issues and situations resulting from advanced technology, greater acuity of patients in hospital and community settings, an aging population, and complex disease processes, as well as ethical and cultural factors. Traditionally, nurses have used a problem-solving approach in planning and providing nursing care. Today the decision-making part of problem solving has become increasingly complex and requires critical thinking.</p>

                    <div class="content-card">
                        <p>Critical thinking is a multidimensional skill, a cognitive or mental process or set of procedures. It involves reasoning and purposeful, systematic, reflective, rational, outcome-directed thinking based on a body of knowledge, as well as examination and analysis of all available information and ideas. Critical thinking leads to the formulation of conclusions and the most appropriate, often creative, decisions, options, or alternatives (Ignatavicius, 2001; Prideaux, 2000).</p>
                        <p>Critical thinking includes metacognition, the examination of one's own reasoning or thought processes while thinking, to help strengthen and refine thinking skills (Wilkinson, 2001). Independent judgments and decisions evolve from a sound knowledge base and the ability to synthesize information within the context in which it is presented. Nursing practice in today's society mandates the use of high-level critical thinking skills within the nursing process. Critical thinking enhances clinical decision making, helping to identify patient needs and to determine the best nursing actions that will assist the patient in meeting those needs.</p>
                        <p>Critical thinking and critical thinkers have distinctive characteristics. As indicated in the above definition, critical thinking is a conscious, outcome-oriented activity; it is purposeful and intentional. The critical thinker is an inquisitive, fair-minded truthseeker with an open-mindedness to the alternative solutions that might surface.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">RATIONALITY AND INSIGHT</h3>
                        <p>Critical thinking is systematic and organized. The skills involved in critical thinking are developed over time through effort, practice, and experience. Skills needed in critical thinking include interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation (Ignatavicius, 2001). Critical thinking requires background knowledge and knowledge of key concepts as well as standards of good thinking (Prideaux, 2000). The critical thinker uses reality-based deliberation to validate the accuracy of data and the reliability of sources, being mindful of and questioning inconsistencies. Interpretation is used to determine the significance of data that are gathered, and analysis is used to identify patient problems indicated by the data. The nurse uses inference to draw conclusions. Explanation is the justification of actions or interventions used to address patient problems and to help a patient move toward desired outcomes. Evaluation is the process of determining whether outcomes have been or are being met, and self-regulation is the process of examining the care provided and adjusting the interventions as needed (Ignatavicius, 2001).</p>
                        <p>Critical thinking is also reflective, involving metacognition, active evaluation, and refinement of the thinking process. The critical thinker considers the possibility of personal bias when interpreting data and determining appropriate actions. The critical thinker must be insightful and have a sense of fairness and integrity, the courage to question personal ethics, and the perseverance to strive continuously to minimize the effects of egocentricity, ethnocentricity, and other biases on the decisionmaking process (Alfaro-LeFevre, 1999).</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">COMPONENTS OF CRITICAL THINKING</h3>
                        <p>Certain cognitive or mental activities can be identified as key components of critical thinking. When thinking critically, a person will do the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ask questions to determine the reason why certain developments have occurred and to see whether more information is needed to understand the situation accurately.</li>
                            <li>Gather as much relevant information as possible to consider as many factors as possible.</li>
                            <li>Validate the information presented to make sure that it is accurate (not just supposition or opinion), that it makes sense, and that it is based on fact and evidence.</li>
                            <li>Analyze the information to determine what it means and to see whether it forms clusters or patterns that point to certain conclusions.</li>
                            <li>Draw on past clinical experience and knowledge to explain what is happening and to anticipate what might happen next, acknowledging personal bias and cultural influences.</li>
                            <li>Maintain a flexible attitude that allows the facts to guide thinking and takes into account all possibilities.</li>
                            <li>Consider available options and examine each in terms of its advantages and disadvantages.</li>
                            <li>Formulate decisions that reflect creativity and independent decision making.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Critical thinking requires going beyond basic problem solving into a realm of inquisitive exploration, looking for all relevant factors that affect the issue, and being an "out-of-the-box" thinker. It includes questioning all findings until a comprehensive picture emerges that explains the phenomenon, possible solutions, and creative methods for proceeding (Wilkinson, 2001). Critical thinking in nursing practice results in a comprehensive patient plan of care with maximized potential for success.</p>
                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">CRITICAL THINKING IN NURSING PRACTICE</h3>
                        <p>Using critical thinking to develop a plan of nursing care requires considering the human factors that might influence the plan. The nurse interacts with the patient, family, and other health care providers in the process of providing appropriate, individualized nursing care. The culture, attitude, and thought processes of the nurse, the patient, and others will affect the critical thinking process from the data-gathering stage through the decision-making stage; therefore, aspects of the nurse-patient interaction must be considered (Wilkinson, 2001). Nurses must use critical thinking skills in all practice settings—acute care, ambulatory care, extended care, and in the home and community. Regardless of the setting, each patient situation is viewed as unique and dynamic. The unique factors that the patient and nurse bring to the health care situation are considered, studied, analyzed, and interpreted. Interpretation of the information presented then allows the nurse to focus on those factors that are most relevant and most significant to the clinical situation. Decisions about what to do and how to do it are then developed into a plan of action.</p>
                        <p>Fonteyn (1998) identified 12 predominant thinking strategies used by nurses, regardless of their area of clinical practice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Recognizing a pattern</li>
                            <li>Setting priorities</li>
                            <li>Searching for information</li>
                            <li>Generating hypotheses</li>
                            <li>Making predictions</li>
                            <li>Forming relationships</li>
                            <li>Stating a proposition ("if-then")</li>
                            <li>Asserting a practice rule</li>
                            <li>Making choices (alternative actions)</li>
                            <li>Judging the value</li>
                            <li>Drawing conclusions</li>
                            <li>Providing explanations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Fonteyn further identified other, less prominent thinking strategies the nurse might use:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pondering</li>
                            <li>Posing a question</li>
                            <li>Making assumptions (supposing)</li>
                            <li>Qualifying</li>
                            <li>Making generalizations</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These thought processes are consistent with the characteristics of critical thinking and cognitive activities discussed earlier. Fonteyn asserted that exploring how these thinking strategies are used in various clinical situations, and practicing using the strategies, might assist the nurse-learner in examining and refining his or her own thinking skills.</p>
                        <p>Because developing the skill of critical thinking takes time and practice, critical thinking exercises are offered throughout this book as a means of practicing one's ability to think critically. Additional exercises can be found in the study guide that accompanies the text. The questions listed in Chart 3-1 can serve as a guide in working through the exercises, although it is important to remember that each situation is unique and calls for an approach that fits the particular circumstances being described.</p>

                        <p>In the complex modern world, we are surrounded by ethical issues in all facets of our lives. Consequently, there has been a heightened interest in the field of ethics, in an attempt to gain a better understanding of how these issues influence us. Specifically, in health care the focus on ethics has intensified in response to controversial developments, including advances in technology and genetics, as well as diminished health care and financial resources.</p>
                        <p>Today, sophisticated technology can prolong life well beyond the time when death would have occurred in the past. Expensive experimental procedures and medications are available for attempting to preserve life, even when such attempts are likely to fail. The development of technological support has had an influence on all stages of life. For example, the prenatal period has been influenced by genetic screening, in vitro fertilization, the harvesting and freezing of embryos, and prenatal surgery. In the early stages of life, premature infants are given a chance for survival by the use of technical support. Children and adults who would have died as a result of organ failure are living longer because of organ transplantation. Technological advances have also contributed to an increase in the average life expectancy. These advances in technology, however, have been a mixed blessing. Questions have been raised about whether, and under what circumstances, it is appropriate to use such technology. Although many individuals are afforded a better quality of life, others face extended suffering as a result of efforts to prolong life, usually at great expense. Ethical issues also surround those practices or policies that seem to allocate health care resources unjustly on the basis of age, race, gender, disability, or social mores.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span> Chart 3-1: The Inquiring Mind: Critical Thinking in Action</h4>
                            <p>Throughout the critical thinking process, a continuous flow of questions evolves in the thinker's mind. Although the questions will vary according to the particular clinical situation, certain general inquiries can serve as a basis for reaching conclusions and determining a course of action.</p>
                            <p>When faced with a patient situation, it is often helpful to seek answers to some or all of the following questions in an attempt to determine those actions that are most appropriate:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What relevant assessment information do I need, and how do I interpret this information? What does this information tell me?</li>
                                <li>To what problems does this information point? Have I identified the most important ones? Does the information point to any other problems that I should consider?</li>
                                <li>Have I gathered all the information I need (signs/symptoms, laboratory values, medication history, emotional factors, mental status)? Is anything missing?</li>
                                <li>Is there anything that needs to be reported immediately? Do I need to seek additional assistance?</li>
                                <li>Does this patient have any special risk factors? Which ones are most significant? What must I do to minimize these risks?</li>
                                <li>What possible complications must I anticipate?</li>
                                <li>What are the most important problems in this situation? Do the patient and the patient's family recognize the same problems?</li>
                                <li>What are the desired outcomes for this patient? Which have the highest priority? Does the patient see eye to eye with me on these points?</li>
                                <li>What is going to be my first action in this situation?</li>
                                <li>How can I construct a plan of care to achieve the goals?</li>
                                <li>Are there any age-related factors involved, and will they require some special approach? Will I need to make some change in the plan of care to take these factors into account?</li>
                                <li>How do the family dynamics affect this situation, and will this have an affect on my actions or the plan of care?</li>

                        <h3 class="subsection-heading">Domain of Nursing Ethics</h3>
                        <p>The ethical dilemmas a nurse may encounter in the medicalsurgical arena are numerous and diverse. An awareness of underlying philosophical concepts will help the nurse to reason through these dilemmas. Basic concepts related to moral philosophy, such as ethics terminology, theories, and approaches, are included in this chapter. Understanding the role of the professional nurse in ethical decision making will assist nurses in articulating their ethical positions and in developing the skills needed to make ethical decisions.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ETHICS VERSUS MORALITY</h4>
                        <p>The terms ethics and morality are used to describe beliefs about right and wrong and to suggest appropriate guidelines for action. In essence, ethics is the formal, systematic study of moral beliefs, whereas morality is the adherence to informal personal values. Because the distinction between the two is slight, they are often used interchangeably.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">ETHICS THEORIES</h4>
                        <p>One classic theory in ethics is teleologic theory or consequentialism, which focuses on the ends or consequences of actions. The most well-known form of this theory, utilitarianism, is based on the concept of "the greatest good for the greatest number." The choice of action is clear under this theory, because the action that maximizes good over bad is the correct one. The theory poses difficulty when one must judge intrinsic values and determine whose good is the greatest. Additionally, the question must be asked whether good consequences can justify any amoral actions that might be used to achieve them.</p>
                        <p>Another theory in ethics is the deontologic or formalist theory, which argues that moral standards or principles exist independently of the ends or consequences. In a given situation, one or more moral principles may apply. The nurse has a duty to act based on the one relevant principle, or the most relevant of several moral principles. Problems arise with this theory when personal and cultural biases influence the choice of the most primary moral principle.</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">APPROACHES TO ETHICS</h4>
                        <p>Two approaches to ethics are metaethics and applied ethics. An example of metaethics (understanding the concepts and linguistic terminology used in ethics) in the health care environment would be analysis of the concept of informed consent. Nurses are aware that patients must give consent before surgery, but sometimes a question arises as to whether the patient is truly informed. Delving more deeply into the concept of informed consent would be a metaethical inquiry.</p>
                        <p>Applied ethics is the term used when questions are asked of a specific discipline to identify ethical problems within that discipline's practice. Various disciplines use the frameworks of general ethical theories and moral principles and apply them to specific problems within their domain. Common ethical principles that apply in nursing include autonomy, beneficence, confidentiality, double effect, fidelity, justice, nonmaleficence, paternalism, respect for people, sanctity of life, and veracity. Brief definitions of these important principles can be found in Chart 3-2.</p>
                        <p>Nursing ethics may be considered a form of applied ethics because it addresses moral situations that are specific to the nursing profession and patient care. Some ethical problems that affect nursing may also apply to the broader area of bioethics and health care ethics. However, the nursing profession is a "caring" rather than a predominantly "curing" profession; therefore, it is imperative that one not equate nursing ethics solely with medical ethics, because the medical profession has a "cure" focus. Nursing has its own professional code of ethics.</p>

                            <h4 class="callout-title"><span class="callout-icon"></span> Chart 3-2: Common Ethical Principles</h4>
                            <p>The following common ethical principles may be used to validate moral claims.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Autonomy</h5>
                            <p>This word is derived from the Greek words autos ("self") and nomos ("rule" or "law"), and therefore refers to self-rule. In contemporary discourse it has broad meanings, including individual rights, privacy, and choice. Autonomy entails the ability to make a choice free from external constraints.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Beneficence</h5>
                            <p>Beneficence is the duty to do good and the active promotion of benevolent acts (eg, goodness, kindness, charity). It may also include the injunction not to inflict harm (see nonmaleficence).</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Confidentiality</h5>
                            <p>Confidentiality relates to the concept of privacy. Information obtained from an individual will not be disclosed to another unless it will benefit the person or there is a direct threat to the social good.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Double Effect</h5>
                            <p>This is a principle that may morally justify some actions that produce both good and evil effects.</p>
                            <p>All four of the following criteria must be fulfilled:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The action itself is good or morally neutral.</li>
                                <li>The agent sincerely intends the good and not the evil effect (the evil effect may be foreseen but is not intended).</li>
                                <li>The good effect is not achieved by means of the evil effect.</li>
                                <li>There is proportionate or favorable balance of good over evil.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Fidelity</h5>
                            <p>Fidelity is promise keeping; the duty to be faithful to one's commitments. It includes both explicit and implicit promises to another person.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Justice</h5>
                            <p>From a broad perspective, justice states that like cases should be treated alike. A more restricted version of justice is distributive justice, which refers to the distribution of social benefits and burdens based on various criteria that may include the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Equality</li>
                                <li>Individual need</li>
                                <li>Individual effort</li>
                                <li>Societal contribution</li>
                                <li>Individual merit</li>
                                <li>Legal entitlement</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Retributive justice is concerned with the distribution of punishment.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Nonmaleficence</h5>
                            <p>This is the duty not to inflict harm as well as to prevent and remove harm. Nonmaleficence may be included within the principle of beneficence, in which case nonmaleficence would be more binding.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Paternalism</h5>
                            <p>Paternalism is the intentional limitation of another's autonomy, justified by an appeal to beneficence or the welfare or needs of another. Under this principle, the prevention of evils or harm takes precedence over any potential evils caused by interference with the individual's autonomy or liberty.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Respect for Persons</h5>
                            <p>Respect for persons is frequently used synonymously with autonomy. However, it goes beyond accepting the notion or attitude that people have autonomous choice, to treating others in such a way that enables them to make the choice.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Sanctity of Life</h5>
                            <p>This is the perspective that life is the highest good. Therefore, all forms of life, including mere biologic existence, should take precedence over external criteria for judging quality of life.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Veracity</h5>
                            <p>Veracity is the obligation to tell the truth and not to lie or deceive others.</p>
                        </aside>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">MORAL SITUATIONS</h4>
                        <p>Many situations exist in which ethical analysis is needed. Some are moral dilemmas, situations in which a clear conflict exists between two or more moral principles or competing moral claims, and the nurse must choose the lesser of two evils. Other situations represent moral problems, in which there may be competing moral claims or principles but one claim or principle is clearly dominant. Some situations result in moral uncertainty, when one cannot accurately define what the moral situation is, or what moral principles apply, but has a strong feeling that something is not right. Still other situations may result in moral distress, in which the nurse is aware of the correct course of action but institutional constraints stand in the way of pursuing the correct action (Jameton, 1984).</p>
                        <p>For example, a patient tells a nurse that if he is dying he wants everything possible done. The surgeon and family have made the decision not to tell the patient he is terminally ill and not to resuscitate him if he stops breathing. From an ethical perspective, patients should be told the truth about their diagnoses and should have the opportunity to make decisions about treatments. Ideally, this information should come from the physician, with the nurse present to assist the patient in understanding the terminology and to provide further support, if necessary. A moral problem exists because of the competing moral claims of the family and physician, who wish to spare the patient distress, and the nurse, who wishes to be truthful with the patient as the patient has requested. If the patient's competency were questionable, a moral dilemma would exist because no dominant principle would be evident. The nurse could experience moral distress if the hospital threatens disciplinary action or job termination if the information is disclosed without the agreement of the physician or the family, or both.</p>
                        <p>It is essential that nurses freely engage in dialogue concerning moral situations, even though such dialogue is difficult for everyone involved. Improved interdisciplinary communication is supported when all members of the health care team can voice their concerns and come to an understanding of the moral situation. The use of an ethics consultant or consultation team could be helpful to assist the health care team, patient, and family to identify the moral dilemma and possible approaches to the dilemma. The nurse should be familiar with agency policy supporting patient self-determination and resolution of ethical issues. The nurse should be an advocate for patient rights in each situation (Trammelleo, 2000).</p>
                        <h4 class="subsubsection-heading">TYPES OF ETHICAL PROBLEMS IN NURSING</h4>
                        <p>As a profession, nursing is accountable to society. This accountability is spelled out in the American Hospital Association's Patient Care Partnership (Chart 3-3), which reflects social beliefs about health and health care. In addition to accepting this document as one measure of accountability, nursing has further defined its standards of accountability through a formal code of ethics that explicitly states the profession's values and goals. The code (Chart 3-4), established by the American Nurses Association (ANA), consists of ethical standards, each with its own interpretive statements (ANA, 2001). The interpretive statements provide guidance to address and resolve ethical dilemmas by incorporating universal moral principles (ANA's Code of Ethics Project Task Force, 2000). The code is an ideal framework for nurses to use in ethical decision making.</p>
                        <p>Ethical issues have always affected the role of the professional nurse. The accepted definition of professional nursing has inspired a new advocacy role for nurses. The ANA, in Nursing's Social Policy Statement (1995), defines nursing as "the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to health and illness." This definition supports the claim that nurses must be actively involved in the decision-making process regarding ethical concerns surrounding health care and human responses. Efforts to enact this standard may cause conflict in health care settings in which the traditional roles of the nurse are delineated within a bureaucratic structure. If, however, nurses learn to present ethical conflicts within a logical, systematic framework, struggles over jurisdictional boundaries may decrease. Health care settings in which nurses are valued members of the team promote interdisciplinary communication and may enhance patient care. To practice effectively in these settings, nurses must be aware of ethical issues and assist patients in voicing their moral concerns.</p>
                        <p>The basic ethical framework of the nursing profession is the phenomenon of human caring. Nursing theories that incorporate the biopsychosocial-spiritual dimensions emphasize a holistic viewpoint, with humanism or caring as the core. As the nursing profession strives to delineate its own theory of ethics, caring is often cited as the moral foundation. For nurses to embrace this professional ethos, it is necessary to be aware not only of major ethical dilemmas but also of those daily interactions with health care consumers that frequently give rise to ethical challenges that are not as easily identified. Although technological advances and diminished resources have been instrumental in raising numerous ethical questions and controversies, including life-and-death issues, nurses should not ignore the many routine situations that involve ethical considerations. Some of the most common issues faced by nurses today include confidentiality, use of restraints, trust, refusing care, genetics, and end-of-life concerns.</p>

                            <p>When you need hospital care, your doctor and the nurses and other professionals at our hospital are committed to working with you and your family to meet your health care needs. Our dedicated doctors and staff serve the community in all its ethnic, religious, and economic diversity. Our goal is for you and your family to have the same care and attention we would want for our families and ourselves.</p>
                            <p>The sections below explain some of the basics about how you can expect to be treated during your hospital stay. They also cover what we will need from you to care for you better. If you have questions at any time, please ask them. Unasked or unanswered questions can add to the stress of being in the hospital. Your comfort and confidence in your care are very important to us.</p>
                            <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">What to Expect During Your Hospital Stay</h5>
                            <p><strong>High quality hospital care.</strong> Our first priority is to provide you the care you need, when you need it, with skill, compassion, and respect. Tell your caregivers if you have concerns about your care or if you have pain. You have the right to know the identity of doctors, nurses, and others involved in your care, as well as when they are students, residents, or other trainees.</p>
                            <p><strong>A clean and safe environment.</strong> Our hospital works hard to keep you safe. We use special policies and procedures to avoid mistakes in your care and keep you free from abuse or neglect. If anything unexpected and significant happens during your hospital stay, you will be told what happened and any resulting changes in your care will be discussed with you.</p>
                            <p><strong>Involvement in your care.</strong> You and your doctor often make decisions about your care before you go to the hospital. Other times, especially in emergencies, those decisions are made during your hospital stay. When they take place, making decisions should include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Discussing your medical condition and information about medically appropriate treatment choices.</strong> To make informed decisions with your doctor, you need to understand several things:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The benefits and risks of each treatment.</li>
                                        <li>Whether it is experimental or part of a research study.</li>
                                        <li>What you can reasonably expect from your treatment and any long-term effects it might have on your quality of life.</li>
                                        <li>What you and your family will need to do after you leave the hospital.</li>
                                        <li>The financial consequences of using uncovered services or out-of-network providers.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    Please tell your caregivers if you need more information about treatment choices.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Discussing your treatment plan.</strong> When you enter the hospital, you sign a general consent to treatment. In some cases, such as surgery or experimental treatment, you may be asked to confirm in writing that you understand what is planned and agree to it. This process protects your right to consent to or refuse a treatment. Your doctor will explain the medical consequences of refusing recommended treatment. It also protects your right to decide if you want to participate in a research study.</li>
                                <li><strong>Getting information from you.</strong> Your caregivers need complete and correct information about your health and coverage so that they can make good decisions about your care. That includes:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Past illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays.</li>
                                        <li>Past allergic reactions.</li>
                                        <li>Any medicines or diet supplements (such as vitamins and herbs) that you are taking.</li>
                                        <li>Any network or admission requirements under your health plan.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Understanding your health care goals and values.</strong> You may have health care goals and values or spiritual beliefs that are important to your well-being. They will be taken into account as much as possible throughout your hospital stay. Make sure your doctor, your family, and your care team know your wishes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Understanding who should make decisions when you cannot.</strong> If you have signed a health care power of attorney stating who should speak for you if you become unable to make health care decisions for yourself, or a "living will" or "advance directive" that states your wishes about end-of-life care, give copies to your doctor, your family and your care team. If you or your family need help making difficult decisions, counselors, chaplains and others are available to help.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Protection of your privacy.</strong> We respect the confidentiality of your relationship with your doctor and other caregivers, and the sensitive information about your health and health care that are part of that relationship. State and federal laws and hospital operating policies protect the privacy of your medical information. You will receive a Notice of Privacy Practices that describes the ways that we use, disclose and safeguard patient information and that explains how you can obtain a copy of information from our records about your care.</p>
                            <p><strong>Help preparing you and your family for when you leave the hospital.</strong> Your doctor works with hospital staff and professionals in your community. You and your family also play an important role. The success of your treatment often depends on your efforts to follow medication, diet and therapy plans. Your family may need to help care for you at home.</p>
                            <p>You can expect us to help you identify sources of follow-up care and to let you know if our hospital has a financial interest in any referrals. As long as you agree we can share information about your care with them, we will coordinate our activities with your caregivers outside the hospital. You can also expect to receive information and, where possible, training about the self-care you will need when you go home.</p>
                            <p><strong>Help with your bill and filing insurance claims.</strong> Our staff will file claims for you with health care insurers or other programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. They will also help your doctor with needed documentation. Hospital bills and insurance coverage are often confusing. If you have questions about your bill, contact our business office. If you need help understanding your insurance coverage or health plan, start with your insurance company or health benefits manager. If you do not have health coverage, we will try to help you and your family find financial help or make other arrangements. We need your help with collecting needed information and other requirements to obtain coverage or assistance.</p>
                            <p>While you are here, you will receive more detailed notices about some of the rights you have as a hospital patient and how to exercise them. We are always interested in improving. If you have questions, comments, or concerns, please contact ____.</p>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Confidentiality</h5>
                        <p>We all need to be aware of the confidential nature of information obtained in daily practice. If information is not pertinent to a case, the nurse should question whether it is prudent to record it in the patient's chart. In the practice setting, discussion of the patient with other members of the health care team is often necessary. These discussions should, however, occur in a private area where it is unlikely that the conversation will be overheard.</p>
                        <p>Another threat to keeping information confidential is the widespread use of computers and the easy access people have to them. This may increase the potential for misuse of information, which may have negative social consequences (Zolot, 1999). For example, laboratory results regarding testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or genetic screening may lead to loss of employment or insurance if the information is disclosed. Because of these possibilities of maleficence (see Chart 3-2) to the patient, sensitivity to the principle of confidentiality is essential.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Restraints</h5>
                        <p>The use of restraints (including physical and pharmacologic measures) is another issue with ethical overtones. It is important to weigh carefully the risks of limiting a person's autonomy and increasing the risk of injury by using restraints against the risks of not using restraints. Before restraints are used, other strategies, such as asking family members to sit with the patient, should be tried (Rogers & Bocchino, 1999). The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) have designated standards for use in care of patients with restraints; these standards are available on the website listed at the end of this chapter (Schiff, 2001).</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Trust Issues</h5>
                        <p>Telling the truth (veracity) is one of the basic principles of our culture. Two ethical dilemmas in clinical practice that can directly conflict with this principle are the use of placebos (non-active substances used to treat symptoms) and not revealing a diagnosis to the patient. Both involve the issue of trust, which is an essential element in the nurse-patient relationship. Placebos may be used in experimental research, where the patient is involved in the decision-making process and is aware that placebos are being used in the treatment regimen. However, the use of a placebo as a substitute for an active drug to show that the patient does not have real symptoms is deceptive. This practice may severely undermine the nurse-patient relationship.</p>
                        <p>Informing patients of their diagnoses when the family and physician have chosen to withhold information is a common ethical situation in nursing practice. The nursing staff often use evasive comments with the patient as a means to maintain professional relationships with other health practitioners. This area is indeed complex because it challenges the nurse's integrity. Trust and connection with the patient play an important part in optimizing care (Day & Stannard, 1999). Strategies the nurse could consider in this situation include the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Not lying to the patient</li>
                            <li>Providing all information related to nursing procedures and diagnoses</li>
                            <li>Communicating to the family and physician the patient's requests for information</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Families often are unaware of the patient's repeated questions to the nurse. With a better understanding of the situation, families may change their perspective. Finally, although providing the information may be the morally appropriate behavior, the manner in which the patient is told is important. Nurses must be compassionate and caring while informing patients; disclosure of information merely for the sake of patient autonomy does not convey respect for others.</p>

                                <li>The nurse, in all professional relationships, practices with compassion and respect for the inherent dignity, worth, and uniqueness of every individual, unrestricted by considerations of social or economic status, personal attributes, or the nature of health problems.</li>
                                <li>The nurse's primary commitment is to the patient, whether an individual, family, group, or community.</li>
                                <li>The nurse promotes, advocates for, and strives to protect the health, safety, and rights of the patient.</li>
                                <li>The nurse is responsible and accountable for individual nursing practice and determines the appropriate delegation of tasks consistent with the nurse's obligation to provide optimum patient care.</li>
                                <li>The nurse owes the same duties to self as to others, including the responsibility to preserve integrity and safety, to maintain competence, and to continue personal and professional growth.</li>

                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">Refusing to Provide Care</h5>
                        <p>Any nurse who feels compelled to refuse to provide care for a particular type of patient faces an ethical dilemma. The reasons given for refusal range from a conflict of personal values to fear of personal risk of injury. Such instances have increased since the advent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) as a major health problem. In one survey, the number of nurses who stated they might refuse to care for a patient with AIDS declined over a 10-year period, from 75% to 20%. The number who might refuse to care for a patient with AIDS who was violent or uncooperative, however, rose from 72% to 82% (Ventura, 1999).</p>
                        <p>The ethical obligation to care for all patients is clearly identified in the first statement of the Code of Ethics for Nurses. To avoid facing these moral situations, a nurse can follow certain strategies. For example, when applying for a job, one should ask questions regarding the patient population. If one is uncomfortable with a particular situation, then not accepting the position would be an option. Denial of care, or providing substandard nursing care to some members of our society, is not acceptable nursing practice.</p>
                        <h5 class="subsubsection-heading">End-of-Life Issues</h5>
                        <p>Dilemmas that center on death and dying are prevalent in medicalsurgical nursing practice and frequently initiate moral discussion. The dilemmas are compounded by the fact that the idea of curing is paramount in health care. With advanced technology, it may be difficult to accept the fact that nothing more can be done, or that technology may prolong life but at the expense of comfort and quality of life. Focusing on the caring as well as the curing role may assist nurses in dealing with these difficult moral situations. End-of life issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 17.</p>
                        <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">PAIN CONTROL</h6>
                        <p>The use of opioids to alleviate a patient's pain may present a dilemma for nurses. Patients with excruciating pain may require large doses of analgesics. Fear of respiratory depression or unwarranted fear of addiction should not prevent nurses from attempting to alleviate pain for the dying patient or for a patient experiencing an acute pain episode. In the case of the terminally ill patient, for example, the actions may be justified by the principle of double effect (see Chart 3-2). The intent or goal of nursing interventions is to alleviate pain and suffering while promoting comfort. The risk of respiratory depression is not the intent of the actions and should not be used as an excuse for withholding analgesia. However, the patient's respiratory status should be carefully monitored and any signs of respiratory depression reported to the physician. The administration of analgesia should be governed by the patient's needs.</p>
                        <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">DO-NOT-RESUSCITATE ORDERS</h6>
                        <p>The "do not resuscitate" (DNR) order is a controversial issue. When a patient is competent to make decisions, his or her choice for a DNR order should be honored, according to the principles of autonomy or respect for the individual (Trammelleo, 2000). However, a DNR order is at times interpreted to mean that the patient requires less nursing care, when actually these patients may have significant medical and nursing needs, all of which demand attention. Ethically, all patients deserve and should receive appropriate nursing interventions, regardless of their resuscitation status.</p>
                        <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">LIFE SUPPORT</h6>
                        <p>In contrast to the previous situations are those in which a DNR decision has not been made by or for a dying patient. The nurse may be put in the uncomfortable position of initiating life-support measures when, because of the patient's physical condition, they appear futile. This frequently occurs when the patient is not competent to make the decision and the family (or surrogate decision maker) refuses to consider a DNR order as an option. The nurse may be told to perform a "slow code" (ie, not to rush to resuscitate the patient) or may be given a verbal order not to resuscitate the patient; both are unacceptable medical orders. The best recourse for nurses in these situations is to be aware of hospital policy related to the Patient Self-Determination Act (discussed later) and execution of advance directives. The nurse should communicate with the physician. Discussing the matter with the physician may lead to further communication with the family and to a reconsideration of their decision, especially if they are afraid to let a loved one die with no further efforts to resuscitate (Trammelleo, 2000). Finally, when working with colleagues who are confronting such difficult situations, it helps to talk and listen to their concerns as a way of providing support.</p>
                        <h6 class="subsubsection-heading">FOOD AND FLUID</h6>
                        <p>In addition to requesting that no heroic measures be taken to prolong life, a dying patient may request that no more food or fluid be administered. Many individuals think that food and hydration are basic human needs, not "invasive measures," and therefore should always be maintained. However, some consider food and hydration as means of prolonging suffering. In evaluating this issue, nurses must take into consideration the potential harm as well as the benefit to the patient of either administering or withdrawing sustenance. Research has not supported the belief that withholding fluids results in a painful death due to thirst (Smith, 1997; Zerwekh, 1997).</p>
                        <p>Evaluation of harm requires a careful review of the reasons the person has requested the withdrawal of food and hydration. Although the principle of autonomy has considerable merit and is supported by the Code of Ethics for Nurses, there may be situations when the request for withdrawal of food and hydration cannot be upheld. For patients with decreased decision-making capacity, the issues are more complex. Some of these cases have reached courts of law, and different states have different case law precedents forbidding withdrawal of sustenance. Although an advance directive may provide some answers, at present there are no firm guidelines to assist nurses in this area.</p>
